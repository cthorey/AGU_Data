            "abstract": "Sediment is deposited within scallop-shaped erosional scarps that form between trees armoring the banks of Difficult Run, a suburban watershed with a forested riparian zone. These deposits create small (surface area 85 m2, volume 300 m3), low-lying floodplain landforms this group terms Scallop Floodplain Benches (SFB). It is hypothesized that SFB formed within the past couple decades initially forming as transversal accretion deposits and eventually gaining floodplain features dominated by vertical accretion. Stratigraphic data supports that SFB deposits begin laterally as sand and gravel bars approximately 100 cm thick, and continue to grow by vertical accretion of sand, silt, and clay. As a SFB reaches its maximum height, a distinctive levee develops adjacent to the channel, and fine-grained silt and clay are deposited behind the levee. Core samples to a depth of 118 cm and additional samples from an overbank event that occurred on June 20, 2015 were collected from one of two SFB on Difficult Run near Leesburg Pike. The grain size distribution was measured using a Coulter Counter and activities of Pb-210, Cs-137, and Be-7 were measured using High Purity Germanium Detectors. Cs-137 activities are relatively constant with depth without a well-defined peak, suggesting that the SFB was deposited after 1963. Be-7 is present in the recent flood deposits, but is absent below the surface, suggesting that the SFB deposits are at least several years old. Excess Pb-210 activities decrease exponentially with depth, and can be fit using the Constant Rate of Supply method to determine an average age of approximately 13.5 years for the SFB. The SFB is storing sediment at a rate of 27 tons/year, which is equal to 0.35% of the annual sediment load of Difficult Run, based on this average age. SFB appear to be a significant component of the sediment storage of Difficult Run and therefore should be considered in the sediment budget.",

            "abstract": "We report a numerical reactive transport model which explicitly incorporates the effectively stable isotopes of uranium (U) and the factors that influence their partitioning in bioactive systems. The model reproduces trends observed in U isotope ratios and concentration measurements from a field experiment, thereby improving interpretations of U isotope ratios as a tracer for U reactive transport. A major factor contributing to U storage and transport is its redox state, which is commonly influenced by the availability of organic carbon to support metal-reducing microbial communities. Both laboratory and field experiments have demonstrated that biogenic reduction of U(VI) fractionates the stable isotope ratio 238U/235U, producing an isotopically heavy solid U(IV) product. It has also been shown that other common reactive transport processes involving U do not fractionate isotopes to a consistently measurable level, which suggests the capacity to quantify the extent of bioreduction occurring in groundwater containing U using 238U/235U ratios. A recent study of a U bioremediation experiment at the Rifle IFRC site (Colorado, USA) applied Rayleigh distillation models to quantify U stable isotope fractionation observed during acetate amendment. The application of these simplified models were fit to the observations only by invoking a “memory-effect,” or a constant source of low-concentration, unfractionated U(VI). In order to more accurately interpret the measured U isotope ratios, we present a multi-component reactive transport model using the CrunchTope software. This approach is capable of quantifying the cycling and partitioning of individual U isotopes through a realistic network of transport and reaction pathways including reduction, oxidation, and microbial growth. The model incorporates physical heterogeneity of the aquifer sediments through zones of decreased permeability, which replicate the observed bromide tracer, major ion chemistry, U concentration, and U isotope ratios. These results suggest that the rate-limited transport properties of U in the Rifle aquifer are governed by the presence of low-permeability regions in the modeling domain and that these zones are responsible for the suggested “memory” effect observed in previous U isotope studies at this site.",

            "abstract": "Numerical simulations of snow on the ground are used for numerous scientific and operational applications such as avalanche hazard forecasting. Although the chain of models used in French mountain ranges for meteorological analysis and forecast (SAFRAN) and detailed snowpack modeling (SURFEX/ISBA-Crocus) usually perform reasonably well, significant differences with snowpack observations are common and are primarily attributed to the uncertainties in meteorological input and to the heterogeneity of snowpack conditions at all scales.\nSo far, no snow observation is assimilated into this model chain, so that simulation errors can accumulate over the winter season. Current efforts are devoted to the assimilation of data from visible and near-infrared imagers into the snowpack model. These efforts rely on the recently developed “TARTES” optical scheme that computes reflectances at various wavelengths using the vertical profile of the physical properties of snow predicted by the snowpack model.\nIn a first step, we performed ensemble simulations by perturbing the atmospheric forcing consistently with its estimated uncertainty. These experiments showed that the simulated snowpack evolution is extremely sensitive to this uncertainty, and that the assimilation of observations can greatly improve model results.\nIn a second step, we performed assimilation experiments using synthetic imager observations and a particle filter. The experiments were carried out for the location of Col du Lautaret area (French Alps) over 5 hydrologic seasons. They provide a good insight about the potential and limitations of assimilating imager data to improve the representation of the snowpack.",

            "abstract": "Lunar mare basalts, the most common volcanic feature on the Moon, provide insights into compositions and thermal history of lunar mantle. According to the model ages of mare basalt units determined by crater counting with remote sensing data indicate that magma activity has a second peak at the end of mare volcanism (~2 Ga), and the latest eruptions were limited in the Procellarum KREEP Terrane (PKT), which is characterized by high abundances of heat-producing elements. In order to understand the magma source of the latest volcanism and mechanism for causing the second peak, we examined the correlation between the titanium contents and eruption ages of mare basalt units using compositional and chronological data updated by SELENE/Kaguya. Although the systematic relationship is not observed globally, a rapid increase in mean titanium (Ti) content occurred at 2.3 Ga in the PKT, suggesting that the magma source of mare basalts changed at that time. The high-Ti basaltic eruptions can be correlated with the second peak of volcanic activity at ~2 Ga. The latest volcanic activity can be induced by a high-Ti hot plume originated from the core-mantle boundary. If the hot plume was occurred, the topographic features formed by the hot plume may be remained. Then, we calculated the difference between topography and selenoid and found the circular feature like a plateau in the center of the PKT, which scale is ~1000 km horizontal and ~500 m vertical. Moreover, mare ridges in this region seem to connect with the plateau. Using detailed models of the flexural response of the lunar elastic lithosphere, we estimated the elastic thickness at the time of occurrence of the hot plume. From our results, the effective elastic thickness at the period of latest volcanism is estimated 20-30 km, which is thinner than that of the period before ~2 Ga. These results may suggest that the up lift of lithosphere caused by the hot plume.",

The simulation is performed for the self-consistent interaction between the solar wind and the magnetosphere. Cases with (1) a steady southward IMF and (2) a steady northward IMF that turns southward are presented. Near-tail reconnection is found to lead to 3-D, localized flux ropes and fast flows, in which multiple ion beams are present. The structure of fast flow and the flow braking at the dipolarization are investigated. To understand the ion transport in the dynamic global process, the entropy distribution in the magnetotail is calculated. By projecting the integrated entropy along the closed flux tubes to the ionosphere, the plasma transport to the inner magnetosphere and its relation to depleting entropy on flux tubes are discussed.",

When calculating the dry edge and wet edge in temperature-vegetation triangle framework, a step-width of 0.02 in NDVI was set and the maximum and minimum temperatures in each interval were found. A fitting line was derived based on these points using the least square method. The results shows that the values of R2 of the dry edge is larger than that of the wet edge. The average R2 of dry edges is 0.89, while the average R2 of wet edges in only 0.74. The slope of dry edges reaches its peak absolute value of -61.51 in DOY 97 (day of year) in 2012. To divide the whole basin into different parts with different degrees of soil moisture status, defined intervals and natural breaks methods were used for TVDI and ATI respectively. The majority of the upstream of Heihe river is comparable or general wet region, with the downstream of the river basin being the dry region. The result of TVDI shows that the midstream of the river belongs to the dry region, as same as its surrounding areas. However, the result of ATI shows the midstream of the river is much wetter. The comparison between the in-situ precipitation data and TVDI and ATI indicates that TVDI and ATI both respond to the precipitation. Only the remote sensing data is need to estimate the soil moisture status based on the TVDI and ATI methods, which can provide straightforward approaches to estimate soil moisture and monitor drought.",

            "abstract": "In the past, the chemical methods of contaminant hydrogeology have dominated much of hydrogeological thinking. In their wake, understanding the physics of subsurface fluid flow and its application to practice and science seemingly has played a secondary role and it often has been replaced by numerical modelling only.\nBuilding an understanding of the actual physics of subsurface flow beyond numerical modelling, however, is a confusing experience exposing one to conflicting statements from the sides of engineers, hydrogeologists, and, for a decade or more, by the followers of free convection and density-driven flow. Within the physics of subsurface flow a number of questions arise, such as:\nIs water really incompressible as assumed in engineering hydraulics?\nHow does buoyancy work?\nAre underground buoyancy forces generally directed vertically upwards or downwards?\nWhat is the consequential difference between hydrostatic and hydrodynamic conditions?\nWhat are the force fields causing subsurface flow for water, hydrocarbons and CO2?\nIs fluid flow really driven by pressure gradients as assumed in reservoir engineering?\nWhat is the effect of geothermal gradients on subsurface flow?\nDo convection cells and free convection exist on-shore?\nHow does variable density flow work?\nCan today’s numerical codes adequately determine variable density flow?\nDoes saltwater really sink to the bottom of geologic systems due to its higher density?\nAquitards create confining conditions and thereby confine fluid movements to aquifers?\nDoes more water flow in aquifers than aquitards?\n The presentation will shed light on the maze of conflicting statements issued within engineering hydraulics and groundwater dynamics. It will also present a field case and its numerical modelling of variable density flow at a major industrial landfill site.\nThe presentation will thereby foster the understanding of the correct physics involved and how this physics can be beneficially applied to practical cases regarding subsurface flow in general, hydrodynamic migration of contaminants, variable density flow, migration of hydrocarbons and CO2, and to scientific processes in the present and within the geological past.",

Positive trends in both temperature and precipitation have been observed over the 20th century over much of the Continental United States (CONUS), however projections of future trends are reliant on climate model simulations. In order to have confidence in future projections of temperature and precipitation, it is crucial to evaluate the ability of current state-of-the-art climate models to reproduce historical observed trends. Towards this goal, trends in surface temperature and precipitation obtained from the NOAA nClimDiv 5 km gridded station observation-based product are compared to the suite of CMIP5 historical simulations over the CONUS region. The Regional Climate Model Evaluation System (RCMES), an analysis tool which supports the NCA by providing access to data and tools for regional climate model validation, is used to provide the comparisons between the models and observation. NASA TRMM precipitation data and MERRA surface temperature data are included in part of the analysis to observe how well satellite data and reanalysis compares to nClimDiv station observation data.",

Forward models are available but have suffered from poor parameter specification. Here, forward models are calibrated and the accompanying change in predictive power is discussed. With inputs (e.g., soil moisture) from the Noah land surface model and applying MODIS LAI data, two microwave emissivity models are tested, the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) and Community Microwave Emission Model (CMEM). The calibration is conducted with the NASA Land Information System (LIS) parameter estimation subsystem using AMSR-E based emissivity retrievals for the calibration dataset. The extent of agreement between the modeled and retrieved estimates is evaluated using the AMSR-E retrievals for a separate 7-year validation period. Results indicate that calibration can significantly improve the agreement, simulating emissivity with an across-channel average root-mean-square-difference (RMSD) of about 0.013, or about 20% lower than if relying on daily estimates based on climatology. It remains as future work to assess the extent to which the improvements in emissivity estimation translate into improvements in precipitation retrieval accuracy.",

            "abstract": "The relation between static stress changes and earthquake triggering has important implications for seismic hazard analysis. Considering long time difference between triggered events, viscoelastic stress transfer plays an important role in stress accumulation along the faults. Developing a better understanding of triggering effects may contribute to improvement of quantification of seismic hazard in tectonically active regions. Parsons (2002) computed the difference between the rate of earthquakes occurring in regions where shear stress increased and those regions where the shear stress decreased on a global scale. He found that 61% of the earthquakes occurred in regions with a shear stress increase, while 39% of events occurred in areas of shear stress decrease. Here, we test whether the inclusion of viscoelastic stress transfer affects the results obtained by Parsons (2002) for static stress transfer. Doing such a systematic analysis, we use Global Centroid Moment Tensor (CMT) catalog selecting 289 Ms>7 main shocks with their ~40.500 aftershocks located in ±2° circles for 5 years periods. For the viscoelastic post seismic calculations, we adapt 12 different published rheological models for 5 different tectonic regions. In order to minimise the uncertainties in this CMT catalog, we use the Frohlich and Davis (1999) statistical approach simultaneously. Our results shows that the 5590 aftershocks are triggered by the 289 Ms>7 earthquakes. 3419 of them are associated with calculated shear stress increase, while 2171 are associated with shear stress decrease. The summation of viscoelastic stress shows that, of the 5840 events, 3530 are associated with shear stress increases, and 2312 with shear stress decrease. This result shows an average 4.5% increase in total, the rate of increase in positive and negative areas are 3.2% and 6.5%, respectively. Therefore, over long time periods viscoelastic relaxation represents a considerable contribution to the total stress on neighbouring faults.",

            "abstract": "Even in urbanized regions, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are derived from a variety of biogenic and anthropogenic sources and are influenced by atmospheric transport across borders. As policies are introduced to reduce the emission of CO2, there is a need for independent verification of emissions reporting. In this work, we aim to use carbon isotope (13CO2 and 12CO2) simulations in combination with atmospheric measurements to distinguish between CO2 sources in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Canada. This is being done by developing an urban δ13C framework based on existing CO2 emission data and forward modelling using a chemistry transport model, CHIMERE. The framework is designed to use region specific δ13C signatures of the dominant CO2 sources together with a CO2 inventory at a fine spatial and temporal resolution; the product is compared against highly accurate 13CO2 and 12CO2 ambient data. The strength of this framework is its potential to estimate both locally produced and regionally transported CO­2. Locally, anthropogenic CO­2 in urban areas is often derived from natural gas combustion (for heating) and gasoline/diesel combustion (for transportation); the isotopic signatures of these processes are significantly different (approximately d13CVPDB = -40 ‰ and -26 ‰ respectively) and can be used to infer their relative contributions. Furthermore, the contribution of transported CO2 can also be estimated as nearby regions often rely on other sources of heating (e.g. coal combustion), which has a very different signature (approximately d13CVPDB = -23 ‰). We present an analysis of the GTA in contrast to Paris, France where atmospheric observations are also available and 13CO2 has been studied. Utilizing our δ13C framework and differences in sectoral isotopic signatures, we quantify the relative contribution of CO2 sources on the overall measured concentration and assess the ability of this framework as a tool for tracing the evolution of sector-specific emissions.",

            "abstract": "Heavy rainfall during 9 – 13 September 2013 induced about 1100 debris flows in the foothills and mountains of the northern Colorado Front Range. Weathered bedrock was partially exposed in the basal surfaces of many of the shallow source areas at depths ranging from 0.2 to 5 m. Typical values of saturated hydraulic conductivity of soils and regolith units mapped in the source areas range from about 10-4 – 10-6 m/s, with a median value of 2.8 x 10-5 m/s based on number of source areas in each map unit. Rainfall intensities varied spatially and temporally, from 0 to 2.5 x 10-5 m/s (90 mm/hour), with two periods of relatively heavy rainfall on September 12 – 13. The distribution of debris flows appears to correlate with total storm rainfall, and reported times of greatest landslide activity coincide with times of heaviest rainfall.\nProcess-based models of rainfall infiltration and slope stability (TRIGRS) representing the observed ranges of regolith depth, hydraulic conductivity, and rainfall intensity, provide additional insights about the timing and distribution of debris flows from this storm. For example, small debris flows from shallower source areas (<2 m) occurred late on September 11 and in the early morning of September 12, whereas large debris flows from deeper (3 - 5 m) source areas in the western part of the affected area occurred late on September 12. Timing of these flows can be understood in terms of the time required for pore pressure rise depending on regolith depth and rainfall intensity. The variable hydraulic properties combined with variable regolith depth and slope angles account for much of the observed range in timing in areas of similar rainfall intensity and duration. Modeling indicates that the greatest and most rapid pore pressure rise likely occurred in areas of highest rainfall intensity and amount. This is consistent with the largest numbers of debris flows occurring on steep canyon walls in areas of high total storm rainfall.",

            "abstract": "Geochemical and petrological studies have revealed the existence of high-Ti and low-Ti basalts in large igneous provinces (LIPs). However the originate of these high-Ti and low-Ti magmas are still under debate. Several different mechanisms have been proposed: (1) the high-Ti basalts are formed by the melting of mantle plume containing recycled oceanic crust (Spandler et al., 2008) while low-Ti basalts are formed by the melting of subcontinental lithospheric mantle (Xiao et al., 2004); (2) both high-Ti and low-Ti basalts are from mantle plume source, but the production of high-Ti basalts are associated with the thick lithosphere while the low-Ti basalts are controlled by the thin lithosphere (Arndt et al., 1993); (3) they are derived from the different degrees of melting, with high-Ti basalts representing low degree of partial melting of mantle plume (Xu et al., 2004). The low Mg# (below 0.7) of high-Ti and low-Ti basalts provides that they are far away from direct melting of mantle peridotite. In addition, seismic data indicate unusually high seismic velocities bodies beneath the LIPs which explained by the fractionated cumulates from picritic magmas (Farnetani et al., 1996). Therefore, we believed that the crystallization differentiation process might play a more significant role in the genesis of high-Ti and low-Ti basalts.\nIn order to investigate the generation of high-Ti and low-Ti basalts, a series of high pressure and high temperature partial crystallization experiments were performed at pressures of 1.5, 3.0 and 5.0 GPa and a temperature range of 1200-1700℃. The starting material is picrate glass with relative high TiO2 (2.7 wt %), which is synthesized according to the chemical composition of primary magmas of Emeishan LIP (Xu et al., 2001). The experimental results show that: (1) At a given pressure, the TiO2 content is decreased with increasing melt fraction; (2) At a given melt fraction, the TiO2 content of melts is increased with increasing pressure. On the basis of our experimental results, we propose that the high-Ti and low-Ti basalts are inherited from the same picritic parental magmas. The high-Ti basalts are generated at relatively high pressure while the low-Ti basalts are generated at relatively low pressure.",

            "abstract": "For decades, studies of the exposed igneous Martian crust via remote sensing and landed observation have concluded that it is predominantly basaltic. However, new analyses of meteorites and mission data indicate a wider range of primary rock composition. Nili Patera in the Syrtis Major region provides one of the best exposures of evolved compositions. Recently, Wray et al. (2013) identified a new unit in the caldera with very high feldspar abundance but unusually low mafic abundance and interpreted it as a felsic unit (as opposed to spectrally similar anorthosite) based on its proximity to a dacite unit.\nWe investigate the summit calderas of Syrtis Major by defining and mapping distinct compositional units using mineralogies inferred from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). The study focuses on the areal extent of potential felsic material, identified based on a broad absorption feature centered at ~1.25-1.3 μm, a unique feature of feldspars attributed to minor Fe2+ substitution. These mapping efforts are put in geologic context using images from the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) instrument on MRO and existing mapping efforts in the area, as well as spectral context using laboratory generated spectra of feldspar and mafic mixtures. While further work understanding this potential felsic unit is warranted, if it is truly felsic it implies a more complicated Martian magmatic history than previously thought. As the diversity of known geologic materials on Mars grows, it is necessary that we understand how to recognize and characterize those materials using the instruments available on current and upcoming missions, such as MRO or the Mars 2020 Rover. Through modeling and data analysis, our ongoing work seeks to understand the geophysical and petrologic context in which the potential felsic materials were generated, and thus to infer their implications for Martian magmatic history.\n",

The rate is defined by the difference between two subsequent 20-year periods. This approach can be relevant to impacts affecting upcoming generations, and to their continuous adaptation towards a changing target. Under the strongest emission pathway (RCP8.5), moistening and drying rates strongly increase at the global scale. As we move further over the twenty-first century, more and more regions exhibit substantial rates. These regions are modified over time due to spatial variability of precipitation. However, we show that they tend to become more geographically stationary through the century, leading to persisting trends at several places over the globe. Whilst global warming is accelerating, this spatial stabilization is due to the decreasing relative influence of global circulation in precipitation changes compared to thermodynamic processes. In specific regions, the combination of intensification and persistence of such substantial rates should be considered in the framework of future impact studies (i.e. the Mediterranean Sea, Central America, South Asia and the Arctic). These trends are already visible in the current period, but could almost disappear if strong mitigation policies (RCP2.6) were quickly implemented.",

These studies are essential for understanding organic matter δ13C signals in terms of environmental changes (e.g., atmospheric pCO2 and nutrient availability) or taxonomic changes (e.g., algal species succession and community composition).\nDinoflagellates are among the most widespread and ecologically dominant primary producers in modern oceans and throughout the Mesozoic and Cenozoic. Compared to more recently evolved phytoplankton taxa, however, dinoflagellate carbon isotope fractionation has received relatively little mechanistic study. Several dilute batch culture experiments with dinoflagellates have investigated ɛp as a function of CO2 availability, but the influences of changing growth rates, nutrient limitation, pH, and irradiance require further systematic exploration. We investigated stable carbon isotope fractionation in the marine dinoflagellate Alexandrium tamarense under nitrate-limited conditions in a chemostat culture system in which full DIC system parameters, including the concentration and δ13C value of CO2, were determined. Growth rates were varied between experiments, and cells were grown under continuous light. Previously reported ɛp values for seven dinoflagellate species including A. tamarense ranged from approximately -1 to 14‰ in nutrient-replete batch culture studies ([CO2] = 0-50 µmol kg‑1). In contrast, in chemostat conditions we measured ɛp values on the order of 20‰ ([CO2] = 20-30 µmol kg-1). These experiments provide an initial step toward understanding the physiological controls on ɛp in dinoflagellates and illuminating the role of algal taxonomy in shaping the Phanerozoic stable carbon isotope record.",

It consists of sixty stations, among which forty-eight are already certified and continuously transmit data to the International Data Centre (IDC) in Vienna, Austria. Each infrasound station is composed of an array of infrasound sensors capable of measuring micro-pressure changes produced at ground level by infrasonic waves. The characteristics of infrasonic waves are computed in near real-time by IDC automatic detection software and are used as an input to IDC source categorization and localization algorithms.\nThe PTS is continuously working towards the completion and sustainment of the IMS infrasound network. The objective of this presentation is to review the main activities performed in the IMS infrasound network over the last five years. This includes construction, installation, certification, major upgrade and revalidation activities. Major technology development projects to improve the reliability and robustness of IMS infrasound stations as well as their compliance with IMS Operational Manual requirements will also be presented.

Thus, the prediction of linkage between these properties are broadly important. Here we present a parameterized model that links fracture permeability and specific stiffness with scaling coefficients dependent on fracture roughness and correlation length. The model was developed empirically from results of modeling the deformation and flow through synthetic fractures with aperture fields that follow a normal distribution. The fractures were subjected to increasing normal stress and deformed follow an elastic model. Specific stiffness was directly quantified from these numerical experiments with resultant displacement. Moreover, intrinsic permeability was estimated through calculation of the local flow field while considering effects of local fracture roughness and tortuosity through the modified Local Cubic Law.\nWe found that fracture displacement increases non-linearly with applied normal stress, while specific stiffness is expectedly proportional to normal stress. Most importantly, permeability decreases exponentially with increasing specific stiffness following different deformation paths depending mainly on fracture roughness rather than correlation length. Based on the calculated permeability and specific stiffness, we propose an empirical model that predicts a clustered linkage between specific stiffness and permeability. The model can capture the transition from effective medium to percolation flow regimes with increasing specific stiffness.",

In the semi-arid Mediterranean regions, such as Sardinian island, dam reservoirs are key elements of the water resources system, because they accumulate autumn and winter runoff, which is then available for the dry months. In this sense, also the seasonal precipitation distribution and its time and spatial variability can be considered hydrologically important. In the Flumendosa basin (Sardinia), which is characterized by a reservoir system that supplies water to the main city of Sardinia, Cagliari, a drastic runoff reduction has been observed in last thirty years. Using data from 41 rain gauges stations (1922-2007 period) and runoff data at the outlet section, we show that: 1) the annual runoff in the latter part of the 20th century was less than half the historic average rate, 2) while the precipitation over the Flumendosa basin has decreased, but not at such a drastic rate as the discharge, suggesting a marked non-linear response of discharge to precipitation changes. Indeed runoff coefficient anomaly are strictly related to winter precipitation (correlation coefficient of 0.5). Trends in precipitation series, in the number of wet days and temperature were examined using the Mann-Kendall non parametric trend test, showing negative trends (-0.25 in winter for both precipitation and runoff). The relationship between winter precipitation and large scale pressure indices, such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), has been also investigated. High correlation between NAO and precipitation and runoff, -0.48 and -0.42 respectively, during the winter season is estimated for the whole basin homogenously, highlighting the large impact of NAO on the hydrologic dynamics of this Sardinian basin located in the east coast of the island.",

The gravity observations are measured at sites of different geological settings under the AGTO and NGDS projects. The resulting gravity changes cannot be fully explained by vertical motions derived from GPS. Unlike previous AG gravity studies in Taiwan, we apply hydrology-induced gravity changes to raw gravity measurements using a simple model that estimates the Bouguer gravity effect due to rainfalls. Typhoon Morakot, occurring on August 8, 2009, results in torrential rainfalls and large debris flows in southern Taiwan. Morakot causes a gravity increase of 51.22 μGal near an AG site along the southern cross-island highway. The M7.0 Hengchun earthquake on December 26, 2006 causes a gravity rise of 2.32 μGal at the KDNG AG site near its epicenter. A Moho thickening rate (-0.81 μGal/yr) in central Taiwan and a deep-fault slip rate (-0.94 μGal/yr) in eastern Taiwan are postulated from the gravity changes. Other distinct gravity changes are potentially associated with the subsidence in Yunlin County (-2.73 μGal/yr), the magma coolings in Tatun Volcano Group (0.12 μGal/yr), Green Island (-2.95 μGal/yr) and Orchid Island (-0.97μGal/yr).",

The lake surface warming has been heterogeneous in both space and time, ranging from moderate warming over the southern lakes and shallow areas of the northern lakes, peaking in late spring, to strong warming over the northern, deep lake areas, peaking in mid-summer. The greatest lake warming between 1997 and 1998 occurs over the deepest areas of Lake Superior during mid-summer, primarily arising from enhanced heat accumulation during the mild 1997/1998 winter and amplified by greater solar radiation and air temperature during the spring of 1998. In contrast, the modest peak warming over southern lakes and shallow areas of northern lakes from 1997 to 1998 is a rapid response to synchronous increases in solar radiation and air temperature during May between the two years.\nAccording to the model experiments, the reduction in surface albedo, attributed to diminished lake ice cover from the cold winter of 1996/1997 to the mild winter of 1997/1998, contributes to an earlier springtime termination of the lake ice season but leads to minimal impact on subsequent summertime lake temperatures. These results suggest that changes in antecedent wintertime lake ice cover have played only a minor role in the accelerated Great Lakes warming trend. Therefore, trends in lake ice cover can be viewed as a surrogate for changes in cumulative winter severity and not the key driver of summertime lake temperature warming.",

            "abstract": "We showed previously (Gong and Rossen, 2014a,b) that, if the fracture aperture distribution is broad enough in a naturally fractured reservoir, even one where the fracture network is well-connected, most fractures can be eliminated without significantly affecting the flow through the fracture network. During a waterflood or enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) process, the production of oil depends on the supply of injected water or EOR agent. This suggests that the characteristic fracture spacing for the dual-porosity/dual-permeability simulation of waterflood or EOR in a naturally fractured reservoir should account not for all fractures but only the relatively small portion of the fracture network carrying almost all the injected water or EOR agent. In contrast, in primary production even a relatively small fracture represents an effective path for oil to flow to a production well. Thus in primary production the effective fracture spacing should include all the fractures. This distinction means that the \"shape factor\" in dual-porosity/dual-permeability reservoir simulators and the repeating unit in homogenization should depend on the process involved: specifically, it should be different for primary and secondary or tertiary recovery. We test this hypothesis in a simple representation of a fractured reservoir with a non-uniform distribution of fracture flow conductivities. We compare oil production, flow patterns in matrix, and the pattern of oil recovery around fractures with and without the ”unimportant” fractures present. In primary production, all fractures which are much more permeable than matrix play a significant role in production. The shape factor or repeating-unit size should reflect the entire fracture distribution. In secondary or tertiary production, the role of fractures that carry relatively little flow depends on injection rate, the ratio of flow carried by the different fractures, and the permeability of matrix. In some cases, the appropriate shape factor or repeating-unit size for waterflood or EOR should reflect only those fractures that carry most of the flow.\n",

The wave properties of this mode are characterized by a strong magnetic compressional component. These waves are observed around the magnetic equator in the Earth's inner magnetosphere. Case studies of the spectra of these waves have found the emissions to be composed of 1) harmonics, usually with spacing near the local fcp, 2) broad band hiss-like structure, or 3) a superposition of the two spectral types. No statistical studies of the frequency structure of these waves have been made. Using ~600,000 burst mode wave captures from the EMFISIS Wave Form Receiver and the EFW instrument on the Van Allen Probes spacecraft this mode will be identified in the high resolution frequency spectra and its frequency structure will be characterized. The variation of the frequency structure will be investigated as a function of normalized frequency, location, and geomagnetic conditions, and with spacecraft separation. The frequency structure will be compared with path integrated gain using proton ring distributions as the wave source.\nRecently the modulation of the fast magnetosonic mode has been reported, with modulation periods in the range of 30s to 240s. It has been proposed that frequency drift observed during each modulation is due to strong inward diffusion in energy of the proton ring distributions that generate these waves. As the inner edge of the ring distribution diffuses towards lower energies the band of unstable harmonics increases in frequency. If in the source region, for modulations with periods greater than say 100s, the inward energy diffusion should be observable in the HOPE proton data which has a cycle time of 24s.",

It captures the emission signatures from raindrops within and below clouds at low frequency channels. It also attempts to measure the depressions of brightness temperatures (TBs) at high frequency channels, which means that ice related particles exist in the atmosphere. Additionally the active radar is also an important sensor to estimate rainfall.\nBased on the success of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite mission, the advanced Global Precipitation Measuring (GPM) mission’s Core Observatory was launched on February 27, 2014. It includes both multi-channel (10-183 GHz) GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) and Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR). This study focuses on use of the GMI and the DPR observations to evaluate the various cloud microphysical schemes in the WRF model (version 3.7) for a severe snowstorm that occurred in January 2015 over the northeastern part of the USA. Impacts of each water content such as rain, cloud, ice, snow, and graupel on simulated TBs will be also evaluated.",

Generally in the geodetic inversion the source is parameterized with some fixed number of unknowns. This parametrization yield non-uniqueness of the results. The Bayesian procedure lets us to include a priori to abandon this problem. Nevertheless this fixed number of unknowns is not mostly considered as a parameter, which can be limited by data. Then the number of parameters can give us an idea about the complexity of the source. In order to do such an inversion we need to apply a trans-dimensional procedure in which the number of parameters is a parameter of the problem. Here we are going to apply the trans-dimensional approach in a Bayesian framework to invert the 2004 M6.0 Parkfield earthquake co-seismic offsets. The trans-dimensional approach has a upper limit for the number of parameters, which is limited by the number of observations. In other words after we cross this limit, regardless of the complexity of source we can not have bigger number of parameters in our inversion. In the case of geodetic static data which decays as 1/r2 , where r is the distance between the source and the observation point, one can apply a priori in order to have a tessellation which represent this resolution power. This means if the source is a complex one we can have more finer patches close to GPS sites in order to get a better resolved slip distribution. The results of synthetic tests and the 2004 M6.0 Parkfield earthquake show that the the data limits the number of parameters. The results of the 2004 M6.0 Parkfield earthquake indicates that this event has a homogeneous slip distribution. In our results, the hypocenter slip which is present in the inversions with fixed number of parameters and a global smoothness as a priori, does not exist.",

Reservoir construction may significantly alter the water budget by permitting more water to be stored in the land surface, resulting in a decrease in observed runoff and, in turn, an increase in calculated ET=P-R. However, this pattern has not been well quantified, particularly in China, where increasing numbers of reservoirs are being built. Here, we show that the water stored in the newly built reservoirs significantly altered the trend of calculated ET. After accounting for the surface water storage change resulting from reservoir construction, the original significant trend in ET of 5.26% per decade decreases sharply to -0.53% - +1.95% per decade for the period from 1997 to 2012, which is consistent with the negligible changes in its determining factors. From 1975 to 2012, the reservoir total storage capacity in China increased by 0.46×1012 m3, which can explain an increase of 12.3% in the calculated ET or a decrease of 19.9% in the observed R. This study indicates that the impact of reservoir construction on calculated ET trends cannot be ignored. ",

These conditions are influenced by the underlying crust and mantle, including the presence of mantle plumes, which translate into high geothermal heat flux at the interface between ice and the underlying bedrock. Recent seismic measurements in West Antarctica reveal the presence of a deep late-Cenozoic mantle plume in Marie Byrd Land but the spatial extent of the associated enhanced heat-flux remains poorly understood. We perform here a series of numerical experiments based on parameterization of the plume and ice sheet numerical modeling using the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) to better characterize the conditions at the base of Marie Byrd Land as well as provide more robust constraints to the heat supplied by the solid Earth and the characteristics of a deep mantle plume. Our results show that the presence of such a plume is compatible with the presence of ice in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. While our simulations suggest that the geothermal heat flux cannot be as high as some recent studies suggest in West Antarctica, the presence of the plume has a strong influence on the thermal state of the ice in this area, including basal melt rate and ice hardness. Well-studied plumes beneath continental crust provide bounds on the spatial extent of heat supplied to the base of the crust and ice sheet from the deep mantle.",

CO plays an important role in both air quality and climate as a precursor for tropospheric ozone and as a major sink of OH, the atmospheric “detergent” that affects the lifetime of methane and other pollutants. Worden et al., [2013] showed decreasing global CO values in time series of satellite total column CO measurements over the past decade. All of the satellite instruments that measure CO in the thermal infrared showed consistent inter-annual variability due to fires and possibly the global recession in late 2008. Observed decreases in CO over N. America and Europe were consistent with expected decreases in CO emissions inventories [Granier et al., 2011], however, the decrease is not uniform globally. In particular, Africa shows regions with smaller negative trends and potentially increasing trends in CO concentration.\nHere we examine trends for surface and total column CO concentrations in Africa over 2002-2014 using MOPITT V5J data. Our hypothesis is that temporal changes in CO will have different signatures related to anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions. We use singular value decomposition (SVD) with time series from different regions based on vegetation type and population density to diagnose the dominant trends and their potential drivers.",

Although the pattern of SST warming is important, this research demonstrated that models overestimate increases in static stability between the mid- to upper- tropical troposphere, even when they are forced with historical sea surface temperatures. This discrepancy between satellite-borne microwave sounding unit measurements (MSU) and GCMs is important because it has implications for the strength of the lapse rate and water vapor feedback. \nThe apparent model-observational difference for changes in static stability in the tropical upper troposphere represents an important problem, but it is not clear whether the difference is a result of common biases in GCMs, biases in observational datasets, or both. In this work, we will use GCM simulations to examine the importance of the spatial pattern of SST warming and different convective parameterizations in determining the lapse rate changes in tropical troposphere. We will also consider uncertainties in MSU satellite observations, including changes in the diurnal sampling of temperature and instrument calibration biases when comparing GCMs with the observed record.

The geologic, chemical, and biological fate of these pollutants has become very relevant with the increase in human population and the resulting increase in pollutant concentrations in the environment. In this study, we focus on sildenafil (SDF) and vardenafil (VDF), active compounds in Viagra and Levitra, respectively, two commonly used erectile dysfunction drugs. The main objective is to determine the sorption potential and transport behavior of these two compounds in natural soils. Both SDF and VDF are complex organic molecules with multiple amine functional groups in their structures. Two types of natural acidic soils (pH≈4.5), an organic-rich soil (7.6% OM) and clay-rich soil (5.1% clay) were used in this study to determine which soil components influence sorption behavior of both compounds.\nSorption isotherms measured using batch reactors were nearly linear, but sorption was stronger in soil that contained higher clay content. Both compounds have multiple pKas due to the amine functional groups, the relevant pKas of SDF are 5.97 and 7.27, and those of VDF’s are 4.72 and 6.21. These values indicate that these compounds likely behave as cations in soil suspensions and hence were strongly sorbed to negatively-charged clay minerals present in both soils. The clay composition in both soils is predominantly kaolinite with smaller amount of montmorillonite, both of which have a predominantly negative surface charge. Transport experiments using glass chromatography columns indicated that both compounds were more strongly retarded in the clay-rich soils. Breakthrough curves from the transport experiments were modeled using convection-dispersion transport equations. The organic matter in the soil seemed to play a less dominant role in the geochemistry in this study, but is likely to transform both compounds into derivative compounds as seen in other studies.",

From north to south the MCSC is just ~140 km long, as it is bounded to the north by the Oriente transform fault, and to the south by the Swan Islands and Walton fault systems. The neovolcanic zone is characterized by an axial valley with depths to 6000 m, and a few off-axis bathymetric highs that can be as shallow as 2000 m. The role of tectonic and magmatic processes in the creation of this bathymetric relief is not yet understood. In the 2015 CaySEIS experiment, a collaboration between German, US and UK scientists, we gathered ocean-bottom seismic refraction data along five lines across and parallel to the MCSC to determine its crustal structure. We here present the tomographic analysis of marine seismic refractions recorded along the spreading axis. The presence of thin crust here shows that the bathymetric relief of the MCSC is at least in part isostatically compensated. Much of the older ultraslow spread crust on the flanks of the MCSC may not have accreted along the deep axial valley, but it may instead have formed by exhumation of gabbros along extensional faults in the adjacent seafloor.",

We have compiled continuous recordings of all permanent broadband stations and temporary experiments in the region (IberArray, WILAS, PYROPE, PICASSO) from 2007 to 2014. This dataset consists of more than 400 broadband stations, although not all of them were operating simultaneously. We cross-correlate the three components these continuous recordings between all station pairs to obtain empirical Green’s functions (EFGs). From these EGFs we measure group and phase velocities of the fundamental mode Rayleigh and Love waves, and also obtain estimates of Rayleigh wave ellipticity. We then perform a 2D tomographic inversion of the dispersion measurements to obtain phase and group velocity maps of Rayleigh and Love waves for periods from 4 to 40 seconds. The short period dispersion and ellipticity maps show excellent correlation with surface features (i.e. sedimentary basins, internal zones of mountain ranges, and stable regions), while maps for longer periods are a good proxy for crustal thickness. Due to the high station density of the dataset used we are able to image the entire Iberian Peninsula with unprecedented resolution, resolving small scale structures such as the West Alboran and Lower Tagus basins, the high anomaly associated with the Ronda-Beni Bousera peridotites, etc. We also investigate the existence of azimuthal anisotropy of Rayleigh wave velocities as a function of period (i.e. depth) . Given the good correlation of the new dispersion maps with gravity anomalies, estimates of crustal thickness from receiver functions, and P-wave velocities from local earthquake tomography, our ultimate objective is to obtain an integrated model of shear-wave structure that fits all these datasets.",

The detection of Ca, K, Mg, and Na confirmed that LIBS has sufficient sensitivity to be used as a tool for characterization of paleo-climate proxy indicators in ice-core samples. Techniques were developed for direct analysis of ice as well as indirect measurements of ice via melting and filtering. Pitfalls and issues of direct ice analysis using several cooling techniques to maintain ice integrity will be discussed. In addition, a new technique, laser ablation molecular isotopic spectroscopy (LAMIS) was applied to detection of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in ice as isotopic analysis of ice is the main tool in paleoclimatology and glaciology studies. Our results demonstrated that spectra of hydroxyl isotopologues 16OH, 18OH, and 16OD can be recorded with a compact spectrograph to determine hydrogen and oxygen isotopes simultaneously. Quantitative isotopic calibration for ice analysis can be accomplished using multivariate chemometric regression as previously realized for water vapor. Analysis with LIBS and LAMIS required no special sample preparation and was about ten times faster than analysis using ICP-MS. Combination of the two techniques in one portable instrument for in-field analysis appears possible and would eliminate the logistical and cost issues associated with ice core management.",

            "abstract": "Many paleomagnetic studies use natural magnetic minerals of the titanomagnetite (TM) solid solution series (Fe3-xTixO4, 0 ≤ x ≤ 1). So far our understanding of the acquisition of thermal remanent magnetisation (TRM) in those minerals was based on the assumption that their Curie temperature (TC) only depends on composition. However, it has been shown that TC of some natural TMs with Al- and Mg-substitution also strongly depends on thermal history and TC changes up to >150°C on timescales and at temperatures relevant to laboratory and geological processes were observed (Bowles et al. 2013). These variations in TC are thought to result from cation reordering within the crystal lattice. Those processes may have major effects on the acquisition, retention and demagnetisation of partial TRM and thermoviscous remanence and may have significant consequences for many paleomagnetic studies. However, so far no direct evidence for this cation reordering has been established. To gain further insight into the mechanisms at work, we have synthesised TMs of varying Ti-content (0.25 ≤ x ≤ 60) and with different degrees of Al- and Mg- substitution. Measuring the magnetic susceptibility as function of temperature TC was determined. Subsequently the samples were subjected to isothermal annealing at temperatures between 325-400°C for 10 to 103 hours. We observe an increase of TC on warming with anneal time up to 80°, whereas TC on cooling decreases slightly. The magnitude of the change in TC on warming varies with anneal temperature, and the temperature of maximum change depends on composition. Splits of the samples were studied using X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) of the Fe L2,3-edge, which is sensitive to valence state and site occupancy of the Fe cations. The results suggest different Fe2+/Fe3+ site occupancy for different sample compositions but there seem to be no consistent differences between the XMCD spectra of annealed and un-annealed samples of one composition. X-ray absorption spectra (XAS) of the Ti, Mg and Al show no significant differences for samples of different anneal stages, suggesting no reordering of the Ti4+, Al3+ and Mg2+. The lack of observed (re)ordering between A and B lattice sites suggests the process may be vacancy mediated or there might be short-range cation (re)ordering within the lattice sites.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we report results from integrated geological, geophysical and geochemical investigations on the Wulungu Depression of the Junggar Basin to understand the Late Paleozoic continental growth of the Junggar area and its amalgamation history with the Altai terrane, within the broad tectonic evolution of the Altai–Junggar area. Based on seismic and borehole data, the Wulungu Depression can be divided into two NW-trending tectonic units by southward thrust faults. The Suosuoquan Sag is composed of gray basaltic andesite, andesite, tuff, tuffaceous sandstone and tuffite, and the overlying Early Carboniferous volcano-sedimentary sequence with lava gushes and marine sediments from a proximal juvenile provenance, compared to the andesite in the Hongyan High. The SIMS Zircon U–Pb ages for andesites from Late Paleozoic strata indicate that these volcanics in Suosuoquan Sag and Hongyan High erupted at 376.3Ma and 313.4Ma, respectively. Most of the intermediate-mafic volcanic rocks exhibit calc-alkaline affinity, low initial 87Sr/86Sr and positive εNd(t) and εHf(t) values. Furthermore, these rocks have high Th/Yb and low Ce/Pb and La/Yb ratios as well as variable Ba/Th and Ba/La ratios. These features imply that the rocks were derived from partial melting of a mantle wedge metasomatized by subduction-related components in an island arc setting. The basin filling pattern and the distribution of island arc-type volcanics and their zircon Hf model ages with the eruptive time suggest that the Wulungu Depression represents an island arc-basin system with the development of a Carboniferous retro-arc basin. The gravity and magnetic anomaly data suggest that Altai–Junggar area incorporates three arc-basin belts from north to south: the Karamaili–Luliang–Darbut, Yemaquan–Wulungu, and Dulate–Fuhai–Saur. The recognition of the Wulungu arc-basin system demonstrates that the northern Junggar area is built by amalgamation of multiple Paleozoic linear arcs and accretionary complexes and has important implications for continental crustal growth in Altai–Junggar in particular, and the world’s largest Phanerozoic accretionary orogen–the CAOB–in general.",

            "abstract": "The Stage 2 of the CO2CRC project involves injection of a small quantity of CO2, 15 Kt, into the Paaratte formation, a saline aquifer located at a depth of around 1500 m in the Otway basin, Victoria, Australia. The project aims to investigate the limits of time lapse seismic methodologies in order to devise an optimal monitoring program. That includes time lapse signal and noise prediction, time lapse data acquisition design and finally data analysis. The strength of the time lapse (TL) seismic is governed by the magnitudes of both the time lapse signal and time lapse noise. They are in turn both dependent on numerous factors which need to be addressed through modelling studies and data acquisition technologies.\nGeological information is used to build a detailed 3D static model for the dynamic reservoir simulations and analysis of CO2 plume distribution for small quantities of CO2 injected into the deepest Paaratte member. Various lithological scenarios and variations in permeability distribution are tested until arriving at the “most likely” solution. The final model is used initially for 1D and subsequently for the full 3D time lapse modelling. These time lapse modelling results, combined with field tests and noise analysis, show clearly that small quantities of CO2 injected into a relatively thin (~20 m in thickness) saline aquifer would benefit from utilizing a permanent 3D seismic array to achieve desired repeatability, that is reduction in time lapse seismic noise.\nBuried receiver array was designed and deployed at the CO2CRC Otway during January and February. The array comprises 908 high-sensitivity geophones deployed at 4 m depth below the surface. Baseline 3D was acquired in March 2015. Some 3003 shots were acquired by a crew of 7 people over 9 days. Benchmark tests show a significant improvement in data quality compared to surface geophones.\nWith this approach there are no cables or other seismic infrastructure on the surface. This significantly reduces the impact of the survey on farming activities. The total project cost will also be reduced over the period of two years in comparison to the surface seismic array.\nWe acknowledge the funding provided by the Australian government to support this CO2CRC research project. We also acknowledge the funding from ANLEC R&D and the Victorian Government for the Stage 2C project.",

It plays crucial ecological role in flood storage and biological diversity. Poyang Lake is facing increasingly serious water crises, including seasonal dry-up, decreased wetland area, and water resource shortage, all of which are closely related to progressive bottom topographic changes over recent years. Time-series of bottom topography would contribute to our understanding of the lake’s evolution during the past several decades. However, commonly used methods for mapping bottom topography fail to frequently update quality bathymetric data for Poyang Lake restricted by weather and accessibility. These deficiencies have limited our ability to characterize the bottom topographic changes and understanding lake erosion or deposition trend. To fill the gap, we construct a decadal bottom topography of Poyang Lake with a total of 146 time series medium resolution satellite images based on the Waterline Method. It was found that Poyang Lake has eroded with a rate of -14.4 cm/ yr from 2000 to 2010. The erosion trend was attributed to the impacts of human activities, especially the operation of the Three Gorge Dams, sand excavation, and the implementation of water conservancy project. A decadal quantitative understanding bottom topography of Poyang Lake might provide a foundation to model the lake evolutionary processes and assist both researchers and local policymakers in ecological management, wetland protection and lake navigation safety.",

This is particularly the case for the sparsely-instrumented Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, where the timing and amplitude of regional and hemispheric-scale climatic events are poorly constrained.\nHere we present a 1,350-year record of hydroclimatic variability and regional circulation derived from an annually laminated sediment record from Lake Ohau, South Island, New Zealand (44.23°S, 169.85°E). The climate of New Zealand is influenced by climatological patterns originating in both the tropics (e.g. El-Niño-Southern Oscillation, Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation) and the Antarctic (Southern Annular Mode, SAM). Utilizing the annually resolved Lake Ohau hydroclimate record in combination with a tree-ring record of summer temperature from Oroko Swamp, New Zealand (Cook et al., 2002), we generate a circulation index for the Western South Island of New Zealand. This index utilizes the temperature and precipitation anomalies defined by the Regional Climate Regime Classification scheme for New Zealand (Kidson, 2000) to assign synoptic scale circulation patterns to 25-year intervals from 900-2000 AD. This circulation index shows significant periods of change, most notably 835 – 985 AD when northerly airflow dominated and from 1385 – 1710 AD when strong southerly airflow persisted. Comparisons with regional SAM and ENSO reconstructions show that dry, warm conditions at Lake Ohau are consistently associated with strengthened tropical teleconnections to New Zealand and a positive SAM, while cold and wet conditions are driven by increased southerly airflow and negative phase SAM. A persistent negative SAM dominates the Little Ice Age (LIA; ~1385-1710 AD) interval in the Western South Island. This same period coincides with the Northern Hemisphere LIA.",

In this project, we studied the biogeochemical sources and sinks of Si in the Grand River watershed (GRW), a 7000 km2 basin located inthe largely agricultural region of southwestern Ontario, Canada. The river, its major tributaries, and eastern Lake Erie, into which the GRW drains, have historically been considered P limited. We collected groundwater and surface water samples at 11 locations in the lower half of the GRW at monthly to weekly intervals for one year. Samples were analyzed for dissolved and reactive particulate Si (DSi and PRSi), total dissolved P, soluble reactive P, and a suite of other macro and micronutrients including nitrate, nitrite, sulfur and iron. Results indicate that groundwater discharge to surface water provides a year-round source of DSi to surface water, with concentrations roughly equal to winter surface water concentrations. For the majority of the year, this groundwater DSi flux results in Si excess in the GRW. However, during extreme high flow events such as the spring snowmelt and long-term heavy rain events, P is flushed in high concentrations into the river, while DSi concentrations, which experience seasonal drawdown due to biological uptake, are diluted. These dynamics can lead to periods of Si limitation, which persists throughout the river and into Lake Erie.",

This new model, which was developed and calibrated using results from physics-based earthquake simulators, is much more self-consistent and less biased than those applied previously. It also has some implications that should be considered when interpreting paleoseismic observations. One is that unless faults are well segmented, there is no good reason to assume that a point on a fault (e.g. a paleoseismic trench) will exhibit a recurrence-interval distribution that is anything like that of traditionally assumed renewal models. We avoid such assumptions by changing the “probability of what” question in the new approach. The model also supports the application of magnitude-dependent aperiodicity (coefficient of variability), the need for which is implied by the results of physics-based simulators. That is, larger magnitude events are more periodic than smaller events, presumably due to the latter being more influenced by stress heterogeneities. These and other features will be discussed in the context of the new model and information used in its development.",

Previous studies (Daley et.al. 2007, 2011) have demonstrated that spatial-temporal changes in the picked first arrival time after CO2 injection constrain the movement of the CO2 plume in the storage interval. To improve the quantitative constraints on plume saturation using this dataset, we investigate spatial-temporal changes in the seismic attenuation of the first arrivals. The attenuation changes over the injection period (~60 h) are estimated by the amount of the centroid frequency shift computed by the local time-frequency analysis. Our observations include: at receivers above the packer seismic attenuation does not change in a physical trend; at receivers below the packer attenuation sharply increases as the amount of CO2 plume increase at the first few hours and peaks at specific points varying with distributed receivers, which are consistent with observations from time delays of first arrivals. Then, attenuation decreases over the injection time with increased amount of CO2 plume. This bell-shaped attenuation response as a function of time in the experiment is consistent with White’s patchy saturation model which predicts an attenuation peak at intermediate CO2 saturations. Our analysis suggests that spatial-temporal attenuation change is an indicator of the movement/saturation of CO2 plume at high saturations, a system state for which seismic measurements are typically only weakly sensitive to.",

            "abstract": "This two-week field course has been offered alternate summers since 2000 in Acadia National Park on Mount Desert Island, Maine and addresses the geological history, physical and biological oceanography and principles of community ecology applicable to terrestrial and/or marine communities of coastal Maine. The course is often transformative and deeply meaningful to the students, many of whom have limited travel experience. The essential components of experience-based learning are well represented in this class with multiple opportunities for abstract conceptualization, active experimentation, concrete hands-on experiences and reflective observation built into the course. Each day begins with a lecture introducing concepts, which are then made concrete though daily field trips (4-8 hours in duration) into the park that include rigorous hiking, some kayaking and one commercial nature cruise. Field trips include hands-on experience with lecture concepts, on-site lessons in field methods, and data collection for independent projects. Each field trip is tied to a specific independent project, which are generated by the instructor, but self-selected by the students. Every student is actively involved in data collection during each field trip, with one student in charge of the collection each day. Daily guided journaling in three parts (scientific, personal and creative) and evening discussions provide ample opportunity for the student to reflect on the scientific content of the course, examine their personal reactions to what they have experienced and to be creative, sharing prior experiences, prior learning and their personalities. The course includes two exams, each following a week of lecture and field experiences. Independent research projects include the production of a manuscript-formatted report complete with statistical analysis of the data and a literature-based discussion of the conclusions. The combination of experiential reinforcement of concepts, abundant opportunity for written and spoken reflection, the beauty of the setting, the challenges of working in the field and the resultant bonding of the students and instructors provide a highly effective and unforgettable learning experience.",

            "abstract": "Exposure to high concentrations of particulate matter (PM) present during acute pollution events is associated with adverse health effects. While many anthropogenic pollution sources are regulated in the United States, emissions from wildfires are difficult to characterize and control. With wildfire frequency and intensity in the western U.S. projected to increase, it is important to more precisely determine the effect that wildfire emissions have on human health, and whether improved forecasts of these air pollution events can mitigate the health risks associated with wildfires.\n One of the challenges associated with determining health risks associated with wildfire emissions is that the low spatial resolution of surface monitors means that surface measurements may not be representative of a population’s exposure, due to steep concentration gradients. To obtain better estimates of ambient exposure levels for health studies, a chemical transport model (CTM) can be used to simulate the evolution of a wildfire plume as it travels over populated regions downwind. Improving the performance of a CTM would allow the development of a new forecasting framework that could better help decision makers estimate and potentially mitigate future health impacts.\nWe use the Weather Research and Forecasting model with online chemistry (WRF-Chem) to simulate wildfire plume evolution. By varying the model resolution, meteorology reanalysis initial conditions, and biomass burning inventories, we are able to explore the sensitivity of model simulations to these various parameters. Satellite observations are used first to evaluate model skill, and then to constrain the model results. These data are then used to estimate population-level exposure, with the aim of better characterizing the effects that wildfire emissions have on human health.",

However, the amount of particle-phase ON (pON) is uncertain due to difficulty in measurement. In this study, we applied and evaluated three different methods to estimate the concentration of pON in the southeastern US based on the High-Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) measurements. The HR-ToF-AMS was deployed in both rural and urban sites in the greater Atlanta area, Georgia, and Centreville, Alabama for approximately one year, as part of Southeastern Center for Air Pollution and Epidemiology study (SCAPE) and Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS). The year-long measurements at multiple sites provide a unique opportunity to investigate the seasonal and spatial variation of pON in the SE US. We found that organic nitrates contributed 5-20% of total OA depending on season, site, and estimation method, suggesting that organic nitrates are important components in the ambient aerosol in the southeastern US. The uncertainties of each method will be discussed in detail. In addition to the ubiquitous presence of organic nitrates, we also found that the time series of less-oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol (LO-OOA), which was resolved from Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis, correlated well with organic nitrate. Both LO-OOA and pON reach a daily maximum at night, suggesting that they are related to nighttime nitrate radical chemistry. LO-OOA is found to be the second largest source of organic aerosol absorption, which implies potential climate impact of organic nitrates. In terms of health effect, LO-OOA only shows weak capability to generated reactive oxygen species as measured by dithiothreitol (DTT) assay.",

Dissolution of CO2 into the brine, resulting in stable stratification, has been identified as the key to long-term storage security. Here we present new analogue laboratory experiment method, advanced image processing method and optimized simulation method to characterize CO2 convective dissolution trapping process and gravitational finger behaviors, in order to study the effect of hydrodynamic dispersion on the CO2 convective dissolution process, as well as to study the effect of control physical parameters on the gravitational finger dynamics. Figure 1 shows the image processing method to analyze the finger dynamics. Understanding the effect of hydrodynamic dispersion and the finger dynamics are essential to evaluate whether convective dissolution occurs, as well as to predict how fast it occurs at the geological CO2 storage field scale. The effect of hydrodynamics dispersion and the finger dynamics can be applied to estimate the security of geological CO2 storage fields, in turn. Optimiezed simulation work is conducted to predict the CO2 dissolution rate at geological CO2 storage field.\nThe large experimental assembly will allow us to quantify in detail for the first time the relationship between convective dissolution rate and the controlling factors of the system, including permeability and driven force, which could be essential to trapping process at Bravo Dome geological CO2 storage field. We complement the homogeneous experiments with a detailed study of the scaling law of the convective flux with dispersion effect. The advanced image processing method with Fourier’s transform method allow us to understand the finger dynamics and corresponding control factors in porous media, for the first time. By applying the dispersion effect and finger dynamics we found from the experimental study, we optimize the simulation method of CO2 convective dissolution process, which will allow us have a better understanding of the convective dissolution trapping mechanism at natural geological CO2 scale.",

During the mission, MESSENGER acquired more than 250,000 images and made many other kinds of measurements. Names are often given to surface features that are of special scientific interest, such as craters.\nTo draw international attention to the achievements of the spacecraft and engineers and scientists who made the MESSENGER mission a success, the MESSENGER Education and Public Outreach (EPO) Team initiated a Name a Crater on Mercury Competition.Five craters of particular geological interest were chosen by the science team. In accordance with International Astronomical Union (IAU) rules for Mercury, impact craters are named in honor of those who have made outstanding or fundamental contributions to the arts and humanities. He or she must have been recognized as a historically significant figure in the arts for at least 50 years and deceased for the last three years. We were particularly interested in entries honoring people from nations and cultural groups underrepresented in the current list of crater names.\nFrom more than 3600 entries received from around the world, the EPO team was able to reduce the number of entries to about 1200 names of 583 different artists who met the contest eligibility criteria. Next, the proposed individuals were divided into five artistic field groups and distributed to experts in that respective field. Each expert reviewed approximately100 artists with their biographical information. They narrowed down their list to a top ten, then to a top five by applying a rubric. The final selection was based on the reviewer lists and scores, with at least three finalist names selected from each artistic field. Of the 17 finalists provided to the IAU, the following names were selected: Carolan crater, Enheduanna crater, Karsh crater, Kulthum crater, and Rivera crater.\nFor more information about this competition, please visit: http://namecraters.carnegiescience.edu/",

            "abstract": "Visualisation is an invaluable tool in the study of near sub-surface processes, whether by mathematical modelling or by geophysical imaging. Quantitative analysis can further assist interpretation of the ongoing physical processes, and it is clear that any reliable model should take direct observations into account. Using electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), localised areas can be surveyed to produce 2-D and 3-D time-lapse images. This study investigates combining quantitative results obtained via ERT with spatio-temporal motion models in tracer experiments to interpret and predict fluid flow.\nAs with any indirect imaging technique, ERT suffers specific issues with resolution and smoothness as a result of its inversion process. In addition, artefacts are typical in the resulting volumes. Mathematical models are also a source of uncertainty – and in combining these with ERT images, a trade-off must be made between the theoretical and the observed.\nUsing computational imaging, distinct regions of stable resistivity can be directly extracted from a time-slice of an ERT volume. The automated nature, as well the potential for more than one region-of-interest, means that multiple regions can be detected. Using Kalman filters, it is possible to convert the detections into a process state, taking into account pre-defined models and predicting progression. In consecutive time-steps, newly detected features are assigned, where possible, to existing predictions to create tracks that match the tracer model.\nPreliminary studies looked at a simple motion model, tracking the centre of mass of a tracer plume with assumed constant velocity and mean resistivity. Extending the model to factor in spatial distribution of the plume, an oriented semi-axis is used to represent the centralised second-order moment, with an increasing factor of magnitude to represent the plume dispersion. Initial results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, significantly improving reliability as the information in observations is increased. This is due to increased control over parameter and noise effects, and over balancing measurement with model predictions.",

            "abstract": "Sand can have a strong impact on gravel transport, increasing gravel transport rates by orders of magnitude as sand content increases. Recent experimental work by others indicates that adding sand to an armored bed can even cause armor to break-up and mobilize. These two elements together help explain observations from a bimodal sand and gravel-bedded river, where lateral migration into sand-rich alluvium breaks up the armor layer, encouraging further incision into the bed. Detailed bedload measurements were coupled with surface and subsurface grain size analyses and cross-sectional surveys in a seasonally-incised channel carved into the upper alluvial fan of the Pasig-Potrero River at Mount Pinatubo, Philippines. Pinatubo erupted in 1991, filling valleys draining the flanks of the volcano with primarily sand-sized pyroclastic flow debris. Twenty years after the eruption, sand-rich sediment inputs are strongly seasonal, with most sediment input to the channel during the rainy season. During the dry season, flow condenses from a wide braided planform to a single-thread channel in most of the upper basin, extending several km onto the alluvial fan. This change in planform creates similar unit discharge ranges in summer and winter. Lower sediment loads in the dry season drive vertical incision until the bed is sufficiently armored. Incision proceeds downstream in a wave, with increasing sediment transport rates and decreasing grain size with distance downstream, eventually reaching a gravel-sand transition and return to a braided planform. Incision depths in the gravel-bedded section exceeded 3 meters in parts of a 4 km-long study reach, a depth too great to be explained by predictions from simple winnowing during incision. Instead, lateral migration into sand-rich alluvium provides sufficient fine sediment to break up the armor surface, allowing incision to start anew and increasing the total depth of the seasonally-incised valley. Lateral migration is recorded in a series of inset terraces within the valley. The importance of sand on channel behavior thus extends beyond transport rates, affecting the depth of incision and volume of material excavated during a rainy to dry season transition.",

            "abstract": "Sedimentary lake-level records and ombrotrophic bog water-table depth records both document hydrologic variability over the Holocene. Lake level records have long temporal length (10,000+ years) and fidelity in preserving low-frequency trends and centennial to millennial length events. Hydrologic reconstructions based on peatland testate amoebae assemblage composition are sensitive to moisture variability at interannual to multidecadal time scales and precipitation on the bog surface is the sole moisture input. However, bog records are generally not as long as lake level records and bog development processes can confound centennial to millennial trends. In this study we present and combine new reconstructions from Giles Pond, Aurora, Maine, USA and Caribou Bog, Old Town, ME USA.\nThe lake-level record from Giles Pond extends a network of lake-level records from southern New England that show an orbitally driven long-term trend toward wetter conditions punctuated by low-water phases in the mid- to late-Holocene that each lasted 100 to 400+ years. Some of these low lake level events appear to be synchronous across multiple sites in New England (Newby, et al. 2014 GRL). Preliminary data from Giles Pond suggest that some of these events extended all the way to Maine. Thus, there were New England-wide dry periods within the last 5000 years that lasted more than 100 years. These long low stands are unlike anything observed during the historical period and the interannual to decadal variability during these low stands is poorly understood. This leads to challenges in understanding the modern and future implications of the lake-level record alone. The Caribou Bog record also builds on a network of peatland water-table reconstructions from the Northeast, and contributes higher-resolution hydroclimate information that adds interannual to multidecadal texture to the centennial to millennial variability of the Giles Pond record.\nOur multiproxy approach allows us to use the strengths of each of these co-located proxy records. In doing so, we develop a multi-scale reconstruction of the hydroclimate history of Maine and the broader region. The combined record is more closely comparable to instrumental climate data and future projections and therefore more relevant for resource managers and policymakers.",

This model was produced through the inversion of Rayleigh wave phase velocities calculated using ambient noise tomography and wave gradiometry, which allows for sensitivity to a broad depth range. Seismic velocities within this model highlight the diverse lithospheric character across the continent and preliminary results are consistent with potential active tectonics within the eastern US.\nPreliminary observations show that seismic velocities in the shallow crust correlate with sediment thickness, as the slowest velocities are observed along the Gulf Coast where thick sediment is found and the fastest velocities are observed in the cratonic north-central United States. Mid-crustal velocities appear to largely correlate with regions of active tectonics with slow velocities observed in the Basin and Range province, the Rio Grande Rift, and along the Pacific Coast. However, anomalous low velocity regions are observed in Iowa, Indiana, and West Virginia that warrant further investigation. Velocities between 30-40 km depth appear to be largely controlled by crustal thickness with fast velocities observed in regions of thinner crust and slower velocities in thick crustal regions.\nIn the upper mantle there is a sharp contrast between relatively slow seismic velocities in the western US and fast velocities in the eastern US that correlates well with the eastern limit of Laramide deformation. However, there are several pockets of low velocities in the upper mantle beneath western Virginia and New England that may suggest active tectonic processes in the mantle beneath these regions. Finally, within the deeper mantle (>100 km depth) the fastest velocities are observed beneath the cratonic regions of the north central US and slower velocities along the continental margins.\nThis model highlights the complexities of the lithospheric structure of the continental US and preliminary results are consistent with active tectonics occurring in pockets beneath the eastern US lithosphere. Future work will focus on better resolving and understanding these Eastern US velocity perturbations.",

The BAS logistics hub, Rothera Research Station on the Antarctic Peninsula supports deployment of deep-field and airborne field campaigns through much of the Antarctic continent, and an innovative new UK polar research vessel is under design, and planned to enter service in the Southern Ocean in 2019. BAS’s core science programme covering all aspects of physical, biological and geological science is delivered by our own science teams, but every year many other UK scientists and overseas collaborators also access BAS’s Antarctic logistics to support their own programmes. As an integrated science and logistics provider, BAS is continuously reviewing its capabilities and operational procedures to ensure that the future long-term requirements of science are optimally supported. Current trends are towards providing the capacity for heavier remote operations and larger-scale field camps, increasing use of autonomous ocean and airborne platforms, and increasing opportunities to provide turnkey solutions for low-cost experimental deployments. This talk will review of expected trends in Antarctic science and the opportunities to conduct science in Antarctica.

            "abstract": "Much effort has been devoted to understanding the climate of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) when the continent-wide Laurentide Ice Sheet resided in North America. It has been established, however, that the massive LGM ice sheet was a relatively short lasting (5–15 kyrs) \"glacial extreme\", and the longer build-up phase (around 75–85 kyrs in length) was dominated by an east-heavy ice configuration and largely ice-free conditions in the interior of the continent.\nThe present study aims to investigate whether first-order (large scale) interactions between the atmosphere and ice sheets can explain the asymmetric ice evolution and the limited glaciation of the continental interior in the larger part of the last glacial cycle. Simulations are conducted using a comprehensive atmospheric circulation model asynchronously coupled to an ice-sheet model. The atmospheric state is updated for every 2×106 km3 increase in ice volume and the coupled model is integrated to steady state. We resort to a simplified model setup, using a triangular representation of North America, with and without the influence of the Cordilleran region, in order to isolate the influence of the mountain range on the ice sheet evolution.\nIn the first experiment we use a flat continent with no background topography. The ice sheet evolves fairly zonally symmetric and the equilibrium ice sheet is continent wide and has the highest point in the center of the continent. In the second experiment we include a simplified representation of the Cordilleran region. The ice sheet's equilibrium state is here structurally different from the flat continent case; the center of mass is strongly shifted to the east and the interior of the continent remains ice-free – an outline resembling the geologically determined pre-LGM state. The ice sheet induces both mechanically and thermally forced stationary waves that result in a reduced cloudiness and hence an increased downwelling of radiation at the surface. This yields warmer summer temperatures that prevent the westward ice expansion. The climate is also more arid in the lee of the Cordillera, which further helps limit the expansion of the ice sheet. Hence, the present study suggests that the Cordillera played a key role for the spatial evolution of the pre-LGM ice sheet in North America.",

Satellite remote sensing allows for global measurements of aerosol radiative properties; however high confidence in these measurements, and their corresponding retrieval algorithms, requires in situ validation. The Laboratory for Aerosols, Clouds and Optics (LACO) at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC) has developed the Imaging Nephelometer, a uniquely accurate instrument concept for the measurement of in situ optical scattering properties.\nImaging Nephelometers provide measurements of the scattering coefficient, phase function and polarized phase function over an angular range of 3 to 177 degrees with an angular resolution better than one degree. The first of these instruments, the Polarized Imaging NEPHelometer (PI-NEPH) has taken part in five airborne field experiments and shown high accuracy in a wide variety of validation studies. In 2014 the open path, Open Imaging NEPHhelometer (OI-NEPH), was constructed at UMBC. This instrument provides measurements that are free from size biases introduced by a sampling inlet as well as changes in hydroscopic growth resulting from relative humidity changes.\nThis presentation will provide an intercomparison between the aerosol properties that are measured and retrieved by LACO Imaging Nephelometers and the corresponding remote sensing retrievals obtained during the California and Colorado DISCOVER-AQ field experiments. The primary goal of this work will be to compare the scattering-weighted, column-averaged in situ phase functions measured by Imaging Nephelometers with the corresponding phase function retrievals performed by collocated AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) sun photometers. These comparisons will include profiles with a wide range of aerosol loadings, including cases with low optical depth where the AERONET retrieval is less frequently evaluated and the quality of the resulting products is not well known.",

Such disturbances can be generated through tidal interactions between the two bodies, or through direct magnetic interaction between the magnetic fields of the star and the planet. The presence of an outer disturber and its influence on the generation of stellar activity, together with the knowledge about stars with no close planets, provide a unique laboratory for the investigation of plasma turbulence in stellar atmospheres. In this work we develop an integrated model covering the star and the planet as an interacting system where gravitational and electromagnetic forces are implemented self-consistently. The model is based on A.I.K.E.F. hybrid code for simulating stellar wind interaction with astronomical bodies. Compared to previous studies, the solar wind is no longer modeled as inflow/outflow boundary conditions, but created instead by a second body representing a star inside the simulation domain. The incorporation of the star is carried out based on Parker (1952) model for slow rotating stars with moderate stellar magnetic fields or on the sophisticated stellar wind model of Weber and Davis (1967) for fast rotators with strong stellar magnetic fields. Such an approach is not without scaling constraints, which will be discussed in this paper. Here, we present the first results for a configuration where the planet is within the star's Alfven radius, i.e., where the stellar wind flow velocity is subcritical. In this case, the resulting current system is extended and may even propagate against the inflowing stellar wind with possible consequences for the stellar activity.",

            "abstract": "As Voyager 2 moves further into the heliosheath, the region of subsonic solar wind plasma in between the termination shock and the heliopause, it has observed an increase of the magnetic field strength to large values, all while maintaining magnetic flux conservation. Dr. Burlaga will present these observations in the 2015 AGU Fall meeting (abstract ID: 59200). The increase in magnetic field strength could be a signature of Voyager 2 approaching the heliopause or, possibly, due to solar cycle effects. In this work we investigate the role the 11-year solar cycle variations as well as magnetic dissipation effects have on the heliosheath environments observed at Voyager 1 and 2 using a global 3D magnetohydrodynamic model of the heliosphere. We use time and latitude-dependent solar wind velocity and density inferred from SOHO/SWAN and IPS data and solar cycle variations of the magnetic field derived from 27-day averages of the field magnitude average of the magnetic field at 1 AU from the OMNI database as presented in Michael et al. (2015). Since the model has already accurately matched the flows and magnetic field strength at Voyager 2 until 93 AU, we extend the boundary conditions to model the heliosheath up until Voyager 2 reaches the heliopause. This work will help clarify if the magnetic field observed at Voyager 2 should increase or decrease due to the solar cycle. We describe the solar magnetic field both as a dipole, with the magnetic and rotational axes aligned, and as a monopole, with magnetic field aligned with the interstellar medium to reduce numerical reconnection within the heliosheath, due to the removal of the heliospheric surrent sheet, and at the solar wind – interstellar medium interface. A comparison of the models allows for a crude estimation of the role that magnetic dissipation plays in the system and whether it allows for a better understanding of the Voyager 2 location in the heliosheath.",

            "abstract": "In March 2014 a joint experiment IRO2/SMOSice was carried out in the Barents Sea. R/V Lance equipped with meteorological instruments, electromagnetic sea ice thickness probe and engine monitoring instruments, was performing a series of tests in different ice conditions in order to validate the ice route optimization (IRO) system, advising on his route through pack ice. In parallel cal/val activities for sea ice thickness product obtained from SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission) L-band radiometer were carried out. Apart from helicopter towing the EMbird thickness probe, Polar 5 aircraft was serving the area during the experiment with L-band radiometer EMIRAD2 and Airborne Laser Scanner (ALS) as primary instruments.\nSea ice Thickness algorithm using SMOS brightness temperature developed at University of Hamburg, provides daily maps of thin sea ice (up to 0.5-1 m) in polar regions with resolution of 35-50 km. So far the retrieval method was not taking into account surface roughness, assuming that sea ice is a specular surface. Roughness is a stochastic process that can be characterized by standard deviation of surface height σ and by shape of the autocorrelation function R to estimate it's vertical and horizontal scales respectively. Interactions of electromagnetic radiation with the surface of the medium are dependent on R and σ and they scales with respect to the incident wavelength. During SMOSice the radiometer was observing sea ice surface at two incidence angles 0 and 40 degrees and simultaneously the surface elevation was scanned with ALS with ground resolution of ~ 0.25 m. This configuration allowed us to calculate σ and R from power spectral densities of surface elevation profiles and quantify the effect of surface roughness on the emissivity of the sea ice. First results indicate that Gaussian autocorrelation function is suitable for deformed ice, for other ice types exponential function is the best fit.",

Here, we study the isotopic composition of cobble-sized rocks sourced subglacially and transported to the ice margin by ice flow and/or the subglacial hydrologic system.\nWe analyzed in situ cosmogenic 10Be in 86 cobbles collected directly from ice and outwash channels at three locations in western Greenland: Kangerlussuaq, Ilulissat, and Upernavik. These cobbles were eroded from up-ice bedrock surfaces and contain 10Be indicative of the exposure, burial, and erosion history of the now subglacial landscape. Measured 10Be/9Be ratios were detectable for all but several samples (average blank 10Be/9Be = 4.2 ± 1.7 x10-16, n = 24) and form a right-skewed distribution. Calculated 10Be concentrations are generally low (median = 1.0 x103 atoms g-1) but 6 of the 86 exceed 104 atoms g-1. One sample contains 1.1 x105 atoms g-1, two orders of magnitude above the median and equivalent to >20 ky of surface exposure at sea level. Concentrations of 10Be are not separable by sample site or type. Measured 10Be may have been produced during previous interglacial periods or the mid Holocene when the ice margin retreated, or by deep muogenic production of 10Be before glaciation of the landscape in the Pliocene. Because most cobbles preserve little inherited 10Be, we infer that the subglacial area from which the samples were sourced has been primarily warm-based. The few cobbles with more 10Be may have experienced exposure during the Holocene Optimum and/or previous interglacial periods when the ice margin retreated or may have been sourced from areas that were previously cold-based.\nWe also sampled three cobbles from outside the current ice margin at each of the three sites. These cobbles record exposure since the last deglaciation plus any nuclides inherited from previous interglacial periods. Measured 10Be concentrations in Kangerlussuaq and Ilulissat are similar to or slightly exceed (by several thousand atoms g-1, similar to the median 10Be concentration in the icebound cobbles) expected 10Be concentrations based on deglaciation age estimates from independent studies. Measured concentrations are less than expected in Upernavik, possibly reflecting post-glacial shielding of the cobbles or inherited 10Be in samples used to estimate deglaciation timing.",

The G-POD Service, SARvatore (SAR Versatile Altimetric Toolkit for Ocean Research & Exploitation) for CryoSat-2, is a web platform that provides the capability to process on-line, on-demand CryoSat-2 SAR/SARIN data, from L1a (FBR) data products until SAR/SARin Level-2 geophysical data products. The Processor makes use of the G-POD (Grid-Processing On Demand) distributed computing platform to deliver timely the output data products and interfaces with ESA-ESRIN FBR data archive. The output data products are generated in standard NetCDF format, and they are compatible with the Multi-Mission Radar Altimetry Toolbox and other NetCDF tools. Using the G-POD graphic interface, it is easy to select the geographical area of interest along with the time-frame of interest, based on the Cryosat-2 SAR/SARin FBR data products availability in the service's catalogue. The processor prototype is versatile in the sense that the users can customize and adapt the processing, setting a list of configurable options. After the task submission, the users can follow, in real time, the status of the processing task.\nThe processing service is now available to be used by the SAR Altimetry Community worldwide for R&D experiments, on site demonstrations/training in training courses, cross-comparison against third party products, preparation for the Sentinel-3 Surface Topography Mission, producing data and graphics for publications, etc. Initially, the processing was designed and optimized for open ocean studies solely, based on the SAMOSA model developed for Sentinel-3 Ground Segment using CryoSat data, but since June 2015, a new retracker (SAMOSA+) is offered in the service as dedicated retracker for coastal zone, inland water and sea-ice/ice-sheet. In the view of the Sentinel-3 launch, a new flavor of the service will be initiated specifically dedicated to process the Sentinel-3 mission data products. The scope of this new service will be to maximize the exploitation of the upcoming Sentinel-3 Surface Topography Mission over all surfaces. The service is open and free of charge and available at https://gpod.eo.esa.int/services/CRYOSAT_SAR/",

            "abstract": "The WISSARD project recovered sediment cores and other geological materials from beneath the Whillans Ice Stream in West Antarctica during two drilling seasons; Subglacial Lake Whillans (SLW) in 2013 and 100km downstream at the ice stream grounding-zone (WGZ) in 2015. SLW is characterized by 2 m of freshwater with a high suspended-sediment load, whereas WGZ has a 10 m column of clear, fully marine water with an active community of marine organisms. Three coring devices were deployed as part of WISSARD, including (1) a multicorer, which recovers 3 unaltered sediment-water interface cores, up to 0.5m, (2) a piston corer, also deployed as a gravity corer, with a 3m core barrel, and (3) a percussion coring system with a 5m core barrel. Sediments recovered from SLW are muddy diamicton with minimal stratification. The sediments are characteristic of active till, not water-column deposition. The till is weak and effective stresses very low, thus till flux from deformation must also be low. Water through flow is sufficient to carry suspended clays and silts, but not transfer large volumes of sediment in the current glaciological regime. Microfossils and geochemical tracers (e.g., biomarkers, 10Be and 14C) in SLW sediments indicate Pleistocene input from open water conditions, plus input and mixing of components derived from older Cenozoic strata. Diatoms and other sedimentary characteristics of SLW are entirely consistent with material previously recovered from upstream sites on the Whillans Ice Stream (UpB), but show evidence of further cumulative subglacial shear strain, suggesting downstream translation as deforming till. Sedimentary components from WGZ indicate significant input from sources other than from the Whillans Ice Stream. Sediment cores include distinct stratigraphic variability, with differing geochemical and sedimentary components indicative of input from changing source beds. Components indicate a mixture of Quaternary and older components. The lower ca. 10m of ice at WGZ contained abundant sedimentary debris, and active melting and rainout of basal debris was observed. We attribute much of the stratigraphy of the upper sedimentary layers at WGZ, which include soft mud and rock clasts, to ongoing basal melting. This may represent recent grounding line retreat.",

The CubeSats carry instrumentation for obtaining performance data on next-generation multi-junction solar cell technology flying in space for the first time. Each CubeSat’s solar cell experiment consists of two of the same solar cell, with one solar cell protected by a standard cover glass and the other cell flying without protection. The objective of the flight experiment is to observe the solar cell technology’s performance and degradation upon exposure to the space environment. Each CubeSat also has three miniature dosimeters that monitor different particle species of different energies that are associated with space weather and environmental effects on spacecraft systems. AC6-A carries the following dosimeters: a thin window low LET variant sensitive to >50 keV electrons and >600 keV protons, a thin window high LET variant sensitive to >600 keV protons, and a standard dosimeter sensitive to >1 MeV electrons and >20 MeV protons. AC6-B carries the same thin window variants and replaces the standard dosimeter with a high LET variant sensitive to >20 MeV protons only to enable particle species separation (and derivation of >1 MeV electron dose) when the two CubeSats are flying in close proximity. The observed degradation of the uncovered solar cells combined with dosimetry measurements indicate the presence of a significant population of low-energy (below a few hundreds keV) protons likely contributed to the degradation. Such CubeSat experiments are a low cost, rapid return method to study the impacts of space weather on current and future satellite components and systems.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake swarms, sequences of sustained seismicity, convey active subsurface processes that sometimes precede larger tectonic or volcanic episodes. Their extended activity and spatiotemporal migration can often be attributed to fluid pressure transients as migrating crustal fluids (typically water and CO2) interact with subsurface structures. Although the swarms analyzed here are interpreted to be natural in origin, the mechanisms of seismic activation likely mirror those observed for earthquakes induced by industrial fluid injection. Here, we use massive-scale waveform correlation to detect and precisely locate 3-10 times as many earthquakes as included in routine catalogs for recent (2014-2015) swarms beneath Mammoth Mountain, Long Valley Caldera, Lassen Volcanic Center, and Fillmore areas of California, USA. These enhanced catalogs, with location precision as good as a few meters, reveal signatures of fluid-faulting interactions, such as systematic migration, fault-valve behavior, and fracture mesh structures, not resolved in routine catalogs.\nWe extend this analysis to characterize source mechanism similarity even for very small newly detected events using relative P and S polarity estimates. This information complements precise locations to define fault complexities that would otherwise be invisible. In particular, although swarms often consist of groups of highly similar events, some swarms contain a population of outliers with different slip and/or fault orientations. These events highlight the complexity of fluid-faulting interactions.\nDespite their different settings, the four swarms analyzed here share many similarities, including pronounced hypocenter migration suggestive of a fluid pressure trigger. This includes the July 2015 Fillmore swarm, which, unlike the others, occurred outside of an obvious volcanic zone. Nevertheless, it exhibited systematic westward and downdip migration on a ~1x1.5 km low-angle, NW-dipping reverse fault at midcrustal depth.",

            "abstract": "Increasing pressures on ecosystems of the Colorado Plateau, in particular changes in land use and anthropogenically forced changes in climate, are moving these systems toward “thresholds” that may not be re-traversed once crossed. Recent studies have shown that changes in winter temperature and hydrological fluxes in the western United States are outside the range of natural variability. These observations suggest that the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are acting synergistically with underlying climatic trends associated with increased greenhouse gas forcings. Of particular importance for the Colorado Plateau (CP), future warming may alter the position and strength of the North American Monsoon (NAM), which is responsible for a sharp summertime moisture gradient across the region. Natural resource managers are faced with unprecedented challenges if these trends continue. The goal of the project was to describe historical and future projected inter-annual and multi-decadal variability of precipitation in the northern limits of the NAM region, analyze future projected changes on the hydrological regime, and discuss implications for management of these semi-arid ecosystems. Daily climate records were analyzed to quantify the current and historical spatio-temporal pattern of precipitation across the CP using results from ten CMIP5 climate models that best reproduce climate metrics of PDO and ENSO across the study area. Results suggest that a focus on the variability and pattern change in extreme climate anomalies, is vital to inform the management of natural resources. Specifically, inter- and intra-annual variability, seasonality of temperature and precipitation, as well as interactions between multi-decadal cycles trends driven by large-scale climate dynamics, need to be considered. Policies that guide management actions into the future should be based on strategies that cover a wide range of plausible climatic conditions.",

            "abstract": "Land use change associated with urbanization can alter natural flow regimes, typically resulting in larger peak flows for a given precipitation event than in a pre-urbanized watershed condition. The overall influence of urbanization on how flows of different frequencies might change over time, while important in hydrologic design, remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the effects of urbanization on flow duration curves (FDCs) and flow variability through a case study of watersheds in the Puget Sound Region of Washington State. Using different time windows of the flow record, we analyzed stream discharge, precipitation, and watershed urbanization for a minimum of 25 years between 1960 and 2010 to quantify how key FDC percentiles changed with time in response to urbanization in small watersheds with variable land use. Results of this analysis indicate that in watersheds with the highest degree of urbanization (average population growth rates in excess of 13 people/km2/year), the 95th-99th percentile of the daily-mean flow series increased by 0-94%, with an average increase of 35%. Similarly, the magnitude of small discharges (10th percentile) increased by up to 34%, with an average increase of 15%. Stream flashiness in urbanizing watersheds was found to have increased by an average of 46% over the analysis period. As there were no significant changes in annual precipitation over the study period, increases in FDC magnitude and flashiness in urbanizing watersheds is most likely a result of increasing population density and watershed imperviousness. Rural watersheds were found to have decreasing FDC magnitude, which is possibly due to anthropogenic extractions of groundwater, and increasing stream flashiness, which is likely a result of reductions in base flow and increasing precipitation intensity and variability.",

            "abstract": "Agricultural use of synthetic fertilizers and animal manure has led to increased crop production, but also elevated nitrogen concentrations in groundwater, resulting in impaired water quality. Groundwater oxygen concentrations are a key indicator of potential biogeochemical processes, which control water/aquifer interactions and contaminant transport. The U.S. Geological Survey’s National Water-Quality Assessment Program has a long-history of studying nutrient transport and processing across the United States and the Glacial Aquifer system in particular. A series of groundwater well networks in Eastern Wisconsin is being used to evaluate the distribution of redox reaction rates over a range of scales with a focus on dissolved O2 reduction rates. An analysis of these multi-scale networks elucidates the influence of explanatory variables (i.e.: soil type, land use classification) on reduction rates and redox reactions throughout the Fox-Wolf-Peshtigo watersheds. Multiple tracers including dissolved gasses, tritium, helium, chlorofluorocarbons, sulfur hexafluoride, and carbon-14 were used to estimate groundwater ages (0.8 to 61.2 yr) at over 300 locations. Our results indicate O2 reduction rates along a flowpath study area (1.2 km2) of 0.15 mg O2 L-1 yr-1 (0.12 to 0.18 mg O2 L-1 yr-1) up to 0.41 mg O2 L-1 yr-1 (0.23 to 0.89 mg O2 L-1 yr-1) for a larger scale land use study area (3,300 km2). Preliminary explanatory variables that can be used to describe the variability in reduction rates include soil type (hydrologic group, bulk density) and chemical concentrations (nitrite plus nitrate, silica). The median residence time expected to reach suboxic conditions (≤ 0.4 mg O2 L-1) for the flowpath and the land use study areas was 66 and 25 yr, respectively. These results can be used to elucidate and differentiate the impact of residence time on groundwater quality vulnerability and sustainability in agricultural regions without complex flow models.",

            "abstract": "Hematite-calcite fissure fills on the Gower Peninsula, Wales, preserve evidence of faulting, mineralization, and multiple fluid flow events. Fissures are associated with dilational strike-slip faults in early Carboniferous limestone and contain locally brecciated hematite, calcite, and red sediment. Hematite is macroscopically botryoidal, but lobes comprise an intricate aggregate of 0.15-0.5 μm-thick plates with high aspect ratios. Prior work suggests mineralization occurred in either late Carboniferous or late Triassic time. We combine hematite (U-Th)/He dating with apatite (U-Th)/He, apatite fission-track (AFT), and zircon (U-Th)/He thermochronology of fill materials to evaluate the timing and thermal effects of fluid circulation in these structures. Hematite He data from four fissures yield reproducible dates of 141.0 ± 5.1 Ma to 119.9 ± 5.0 Ma. Individual zircon He dates from a sandstone infill sample are ~402-260 Ma, reflecting erosion of source material, and imply a maximum late Permian depositional age. The sandstone AFT date of 131.4 ± 20.1 Ma overlaps with the hematite He results and the apatite He date is ~50 Ma. Reconstruction of the regional burial history from independent geologic constraints reveals modern exposures were not buried and reheated to temperatures hot enough to reset the AFT or hematite He systems in the Triassic-Early Cretaceous. Thus, these data do not simply record ambient cooling from erosion. Hot fluids (~100-150 °C) circulating through fissures in the Early Cretaceous reset the AFT system. Hematite either formed in the Triassic and was also reset by fluids or formed from these fluids. Similar hematite He dates from fault-related mineralization in adjacent south Glamorgan and Cumbria, England, imply concomitant regional hot fluid effects. Our data document hydrothermal fluid circulation, coeval with opening of the North Atlantic Ocean, in these higher permeability fissures and fault veins long after they initially formed. Results suggest hematite and apatite are susceptible to thermal resetting by hot fluids and that these thermochronology tools can be used to constrain paleofluid flow events in the shallow crust.",

            "abstract": "Starchitect (www.starchitect.net) is an online stellar and planetary evolution game developed for Facebook (though it can be played outside of Facebook as well). Funded through NASA and NSF, Starchitect was designed in part to explore the educational potential of a specific type of game design, in which players may only spend a few minutes with the game in a given sitting, but must come back repeatedly over days or weeks to make real progress. The intent was to determine if we could engage players and keep them \"minds on\" for longer periods of time, enhancing the educational value of the game. However this design leads to a variety of challenges and opportunities for the evaluation program. Players cannot easily be asked to \"play through\" the game while under observation, because the game is designed to be played over long periods. Even recruiting test players can be a challenge, since this particular game framework doesn’t appeal to everyone, and we need players to stay engaged long enough to have a meaningful experience. On the other hand, the game itself collects large amounts of data automatically, and can be strategically designed to collect even more. N in this case is very large (in excess of 11,000 players to date), and Facebook enhances the data by providing information about players that is not generally available to online activities (e.g., gender and age). All told this provides us with an intriguing double edged sword: challenges for traditional, in-person evaluation strategies, combined with new opportunities for online recruitment and automated data collection. This paper will discuss the strategies we've used to evaluate the project, including interviews, online surveys dynamically triggered by the game, targeted Facebook advertising, game data evaluation, embedded pre/post quizzes, and more.",

            "abstract": "The arctic is warming at twice the rate of the rest of the planet, with the greatest warming occurring during the winter months. Despite the cold temperatures during the winter, microbial activity continues and leads to a release of soil carbon during a criticial period when plant uptake has ceased. Due to the warming climate, huge pools of carbon stored in permafrost soils are expected to be released to the atmosphere. To identify the annual carbon balance of arctic ecosystems and potential impacts caused by a rise in temperatures, understanding the magnitude of winter respiration is essential. In order to refine current and future estimates of carbon loss from permafrost ecosystems, we conducted a pan-arctic synthesis of winter respiration from northern high latitude regions. We examined differences in cumulative winter respiration among permafrost zones, biomes, ecosystem types, and effects of measurement method on winter respiration estimates. We also examined effect of air temperature and precipitation (Worldclim database) on rates of winter respiration. The database contained 169 measurement points from 46 study sites located throughout the permafrost zones. We found that 21.6 % of annual respiration is happening during non-growing season, which can shift ecosystems from annual sinks during the growing season to net sources of carbon on an annual basis. Across studies, the average carbon loss during the winter was 66 g CO2-C. There was a strong relationship between mean annual air temperature and winter respiration, and lower respiration in continuous compared to discontinuous permafrost zones and northern areas without permafrost. The present results clarify the contribution of winter respiration to annual carbon balance and show the sensitivity of carbon release to rising temperatures in northern high latitudes. These results suggest that permafrost degradation and increased temperature will lead to a higher release of carbon from the Arctic in wintertime, highlighting the importance of including winter respiration in current and future carbon estimates for the northern region.",

However the relative influence of physical versus biological processes in this hard-to-study region is poorly understood due to limited observations. Here we present new findings from a profiling float equipped with biogeochemical sensors in the seasonal ice zone of the Ross Sea capturing, for the first time, under-ice pH profile data over a two year timespan from 2014 to the present. The relative influence of physical (e.g. vertical mixing and air-sea gas exchange) and biological (e.g. production and respiration) drivers of pH and O2 within the mixed layer are explored during the phases of ice formation, ice cover, and ice melt over the two seasonal cycles. During the austral fall just prior to and during ice formation, O2 increases as expected due to surface-layer undersaturation and enhanced gas exchange. A small increase in pH is also observed during this phase, but without a biological signal in accompanying profiling float chlorophyll data, which goes against common reasoning from both a biological and physical standpoint. During the phase of ice cover, gas exchange is inhibited and a clear respiration signal is observed in pH and O2 data from which respiration rates are calculated. In the austral spring, ice melt gives rise to substantial ice edge phytoplankton blooms indicated by O2 supersaturation and corresponding increase in pH and large chlorophyll signal. The influence of the duration of ice cover and mixed layer depth on the magnitude of the ice edge blooms is explored between the two seasonal cycles.",

This view is incompatible with recent results from global climate/ice sheet models that predict northern hemisphere glaciation only after CO2 falls below ~280 ppmv (occurring at 25 Ma) and with recent sediment evidence for Arctic iceberg rafting as early as the middle Eocene. However, the amount of northern hemisphere ice represented by these sediments is ambiguous and global ice budget calculations for the early Cenozoic are controversial.\nHere we use coupled Hf-Nd isotopes of oxyhydroxides in sediments from the upper Eocene to lower Oligocene section in ODP Site U1411 (Newfoundland Ridge) to determine when the circum-North Atlantic came under the influence of a mechanical weathering regime. Leached oxyhydroxide Hf-Nd isotopes are an indicator of weathering intensity because mechanical weathering by ice sheets mobilizes the zircon-bound Hf reservoir in the crust, which has extreme unradiogenic eHf values. Chemical weathering produces a distinct seawater array on Hf-Nd diagrams, while seawater exposed to the products of mechanical weathering plot on divergent arrays closer to the Terrestrial Array.\nHf-Nd isotopes of Site U1411 leachates are grouped in a near vertical trend between the seawater and terrestrial global reference arrays. Within this group there are four distinct arrays that can be delineated by age. Samples that are late Eocene in age fall along an array that is slightly divergent from the seawater array. The aspect of the Hf-Nd isotope data changes permanently after the first step of the EOT, falling along arrays that are systematically offset in the direction of the terrestrial arrays. The steepest array, most proximal to the terrestrial array, is comprised of samples deposited between 33.7 and 32.2 Ma. These results indicate a circum-North Atlantic weathering regime appeared in the earliest Oligocene.",

            "abstract": "Although negative cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning strokes occur much more frequently than positive CGs, sprites caused by negative CGs are very rare. Past observations indicate that the ratio of negative and positive sprites is 1:200-300 [Barrington-Leigh et al., J. Geophys. Res, 106, 1741, 2001; Taylor et al., Geophys. Res. Lett., 35, L14812, 2008; Li et al., J. Geophys. Res., 117, A09310, 2012; Cummer et al., J. Geophys. Res., 118, 5176, 2013]. This has been recognized as one of the polarity asymmetry problems in lightning research [Williams, Plasma Sources Sci. Technol., 15 (2), S91, 2006]. On 12 September 2014, a few negative sprites were observed over two thunderstorms near the east coast of Florida. The sferic data indicate that the parent lightning strokes are all extremely impulsive, with the inferred impulse charge moment changes ranging from 650 to 1300 C km. In this talk, we present the simulation results of the response of the lower ionosphere to the quasi-electrostatic field of the parent lightning discharges of the negative sprites. The results indicate that the modifications of the ionosphere density by the parent CGs of the negative sprites vary significantly. The most impulsive lightning stoke may have increased the ionospheric density by nearly four orders of magnitude. Finally, we show that the sprite streamer initiation theory that mesospheric perturbations created by atmospheric gravity waves are the source of the inhomogeneities initiating sprite streamers [Liu et al., Nat. Commun. 6:7540, 2015] also works for the observed negative sprites.",

            "abstract": "Deep long period (DLP) earthquakes are commonly observed in volcanic settings such as the Aleutian Arc in Alaska. DLPs are poorly understood but are thought to be associated with movements of fluids, such as magma or hydrothermal fluids, deep in the volcanic plumbing system. These events have been recognized for several decades but few studies have gone beyond their identification and location. All long period events are more difficult to identify and locate than volcano-tectonic (VT) earthquakes because traditional detection schemes focus on high frequency (short period) energy. In addition, DLPs present analytical challenges because they tend to be emergent and so it is difficult to accurately pick the onset of arriving body waves. We now expect to find DLPs at most volcanic centers, the challenge lies in identification and location. We aim to reduce the element of human error in location by applying back projection to better constrain the depth and horizontal position of these events.\nPower et al. (2004) provided the first compilation of DLP activity in the Aleutian Arc. This study focuses on the reanalysis of 162 cataloged DLPs beneath 11 volcanoes in the Aleutian arc (we expect to ultimately identify and reanalyze more DLPs). We are currently adapting the approach of Haney (2014) for volcanic tremor to use back projection over a 4D grid to determine position and origin time of DLPs. This method holds great potential in that it will allow automated, high-accuracy picking of arrival times and could reduce the number of arrival time picks necessary for traditional location schemes to well constrain event origins. Back projection can also calculate a relative focal mechanism (difficult with traditional methods due to the emergent nature of DLPs) allowing the first in depth analysis of source properties. Our event catalog (spanning over 25 years and volcanoes) is one of the longest and largest and enables us to investigate spatial and temporal variation in DLPs.",

            "abstract": "Watersheds are widely recognized as the basic functional unit for water resources management studies and are important for a variety of problems in hydrology, ecology, and geomorphology. Nevertheless, delineating a watershed spread across a large region is still cumbersome due to the processing burden of working with large Digital Elevation Model. Terrain Analysis Using Digital Elevation Models (TauDEM) software supports the delineation of watersheds and stream networks from within desktop Geographic Information Systems. A rich set of watershed and stream network attributes are computed. However limitations of the TauDEM desktop tools are (1) it supports only one type of raster (tiff format) data (2) requires installation of software for parallel processing, and (3) data have to be in projected coordinate system. This paper presents enhancements to TauDEM that have been developed to extend its generality and support web based watershed delineation services. The enhancements of TauDEM include (1) reading and writing raster data with the open-source geospatial data abstraction library (GDAL) not limited to the tiff data format and (2) support for both geographic and projected coordinates. To support web services for rapid watershed delineation a procedure has been developed for sub setting the domain based on sub-catchments, with preprocessed data prepared for each catchment stored. This allows the watershed delineation to function locally, while extending to the full extent of watersheds using preprocessed information. Additional capabilities of this program includes computation of average watershed properties and geomorphic and channel network variables such as drainage density, shape factor, relief ratio and stream ordering. The updated version of TauDEM increases the practical applicability of it in terms of raster data type, size and coordinate system. The watershed delineation web service functionality is useful for web based software as service deployments that alleviate the need for users to install and work with desktop GIS software.",

            "abstract": "Shale materials are important components in petroleum systems (e.g. sealing and source rocks) and play an important role in earthquake faults. However, their mechanical behavior is still poorly understood, as it can vary from plastic to brittle. The role of fluid pressure in seismicity triggering is also not fully understood. A unique, decametric scale experiment, which aims at reactivating a natural fault by high pressure injection, was performed in shale. The injection interval was surrounded by a dense monitoring network of pressure, deformation and seismic sensors, in a well-characterized geological setting. 37 seismic events, with very small magnitude (about -4) were recorded during five series of injections within the fault zone. The spatio-temporal distribution of these events, compared with the measured displacement at the injection points, shows that most of the induced deformation is aseismic. The locations of the microseismic events are strongly asymmetrical, with most events distributed East of the fault and South of the injection area. Focal mechanisms are predominantly consistent with shear slip on a family of calcified fractures. The shale mineralogy appears to be a critical parameter governing the seismogenic character of deformation, as only calcified structures slipped seismically. As no seismic event occurs in the close vicinity of the injection, high-fluid content seems to inhibit seismic slip. Consequently, stress changes induced by this highly-pressurized volume should more likely influence the spatial distribution of seismicity. Finally, the main fault, acting as a fluid flow and/or stress barrier, strongly modifies the stress transfer. From the monitoring point of view, this experiment reflects the difficulty in quantitatively following fluid propagation in a shale formation, as seismicity will be strongly influenced by the presence of calcified fractures and by the interaction between stress transfer and lithological heterogeneities.",

Air quality monitors are placed in networks across many cities globally. Typically these provide at best a few recording locations per city. However, large spatial variability occurs on the neighborhood scale. This study sets out to comprehensively characterize a full size distribution from 0.25 - 32 μm of airborne particulates on a fine spatial scale (meters) using two phases. In phase one the data is gathered at ground level on a near daily basis over the month of May, 2014 in a 100 km2 area encompassing parts of Richardson, and Garland, TX. Variograms were used to determine an appropriate spatial scale for future measurements to provide PM characterization on a neighborhood scale. The results showed the spatial scales varied, depending on the synoptic weather pattern, from 0.8 km to 5.2 km, with a typical spatial scale of 1.6 km. Phase two used a remote-controlled aerial vehicle to look at the horizontal, vertical, and temporal variability of airborne particulates within the first 150 m of the atmosphere. Four flights where conducted on December 4, 2014 between 12:00 pm and 5:00 pm local time. The first three flights flew a pattern of increasing altitude up to 140 m. The fourth flight was conducted at a near constant altitude of 60 m. The mean PM2.5 concentration for the three flights with varying altitude was 36.3 μgm^−3, with the highest concentration occurring below 10 m altitude. The overall vertical variation was very small with a standard deviation of only 3.6 μgm^−3. PM2.5 concentration did not change much throughout the day with mean concentrations variation of only 2.1 μgm^−3. The fourth flight, flown at a near constant altitude, corroborated the spatial scales found in phase one.",

For each TGF in the sample, we compare Monte Carlo simulated TGF spectra to the observed detector counts. For each comparison, the best fit intensity is found, including correcting the predicted spectrum for pulse pileup. Using likelihood, we determine which of the simulations are consistent with each TGF, thus constraining the properties (e.g., altitude, beam width, etc.) of the TGF.",

Firm information is the maximum information of a system can be guaranteed from an experimental design. The design is based on the Box-Hill expected entropy decrease (EED) before and after the experiment design and the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) framework. A max-min programming is introduced to choose the robust design that maximizes the minimal Box-Hill EED subject to that the highest expected posterior model probability satisfies a desired probability threshold. The EED is calculated by the Gauss-Hermite quadrature. The BMA method is used to predict future observations and to quantify future observation uncertainty arising from conceptual and parametric uncertainties in calculating EED. Monte Carlo approach is adopted to quantify the uncertainty in the posterior model probabilities. The optimal experimental design is tested by a synthetic 5-layer anisotropic confined aquifer. Nine conceptual groundwater models are constructed due to uncertain geological architecture and boundary condition. High-performance computing is used to enumerate all possible design solutions in order to identify the most plausible groundwater model. Results highlight the impacts of scedasticity in future observation data as well as uncertainty sources on potential pumping and observation locations.",

            "abstract": "The deformed schists and slates of the eastern Central Range of Taiwan (ECR) are characterized by a strike-parallel, or gently northeast-plunging stretching lineation. This first-order, regionally consistent characteristic could be explained by the early tectonic history, by strain partitioning, or by lateral extrusion. From west to east across the range, the stretching lineation varies from down dip to along-strike. Strain histories recorded by syntectonic fibers indicate that the western central Range experiences non-coaxial strain consistent with west-directed thrusting. In the ECR, fibers record down dip stretching followed by rotation of the stretching direction into parallelism with the subhorizontal lineation. Therefore, the rocks of the ECR record a history of deformation west of the divide that precedes advection of subsurface material from west to east across a regime of horiztontal stretching fixed relative to the orogenic topography. Thus, the lineation is the last fabric imparted on the rocks and not related to pre-collision tectonics. Two explanations remain: does material turn north relative to the orogenic topography as it advects beneath the divide, or does material turn to the south as the thermally weakened interior of the central range is extruded toward the region of lower topography? The first hypothesis is problematic given the lack of significant obliquity in the relative plate motion vector and the lack of consistency in the sense of strike slip from kinematic indicators such as quartz c-axis fabrics in granites of the Eastern Central Range. Extrusion of the core of the ECR could play a role in shaping of the landscape and crustal structure of the Hengchun peninsula in southern Taiwan. Topographic observations in the south are consistent with rock-uplift and horizontal strain pattern driven by on-going extrusion from the north. Such observations include progressively rotated drainage basins and a ‘V’ shaped pattern of high channel steepness that points to the south. We quantify these topographic patterns from a DEM, and model the topographic development using a landscape evolution model. The high obliquity between the arc and the Asian passive margin provides a mechanism for progressively squeezing the interior of the orogeny toward the south as the collision propagates laterally.",

Empirical evidence showing the relationship between fractal bed-topography and scaling of hyporheic travel-times is still lacking. We performed experiments to make high resolution observations of streambed topography and solute transport over naturally-formed sand bedforms in a large laboratory flume. We analyzed the results using both numerical and theoretical models. We found that fractal properties of the bed topography affected solute residence time distributions. Overall, our experimental, numerical and theoretical results provide evidence for a coupling between the sand-bed topography and the anomalous transport scaling in rivers. Larger bedforms induced greater hyporheic exchange and faster porewater turn-over relative to smaller bedforms, suggesting that the structure of legacy morphology may be more important to solute and contaminant transport in streams and rivers than previously recognized.",

This left a long line of heavy rocks in the top part of the ground. We don't know why the tearing stopped instead of forming a new big water place in the middle of the land. We also didn't know know if the deeper ground still looked like it was torn too, because we couldn't see it very well. We hoped by looking at the deep ground, we could figure out why the tearing stopped. \nI make pictures of the deep under ground places using waves that are made when the ground breaks quickly. I look at waves that go through the torn area and try to match them. I match the real waves by making my own pretend waves and changing how fast they move through the ground. After I match a lot of waves, I put them all together to make a picture that shows what's deep under ground.",

            "abstract": "In the inner magnetosphere, the energy-dependent convection of ring current ions can lead to the ring-type proton velocity distributions with ∂fp(vperp)/∂vperp > 0 and ring speeds around the Alfvén speed. This ring-type velocity distribution is known to drive fast magnetosonic waves at propagation quasi-perpendicular to the background magnetic field B0 and, with sufficient temperature anisotropy, electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves at propagation parallel to B0. While there is an abundant literature on linear theory and computer simulations of EMIC waves driven by bi-Maxwellian ion distributions, the literature on the instabilities associated with ring-type proton velocity distributions in the inner magnetosphere is less substantial. Even less studied is the interplay of the two instabilities which lead to the growth of EMIC and fast magnetosonic waves, respectively. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive picture of the instabilities responsible for the two types of waves and their interplay in the conditions of the inner magnetosphere, using linear dispersion theory and self-consistent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. For systematic analyses, two-component proton distributions fp = fr + fb are used, where fr represents a tenuous energetic proton velocity distribution with ∂fr(vperp)/∂vperp > 0 providing free energy and fb represents a dense Maxwellian background with sufficiently small beta corresponding to the inner magnetospheric condition. Both an ideal velocity ring and a partial shell with sinn-type pitch angle dependence will be considered for the fr component.",

A central goal of the Physics Learning Center is to address achievement/equity gaps (e.g. race, gender, socio-economic status, disability, age, transfer status, etc.) for undergraduate students pursuing majors and coursework in STEM fields. Students meet twice a week in small learning teams of 3-8 students, facilitated by a trained Peer Mentor Tutor or staff member. These active learning teams focus on discussing core physical concepts and practicing problem-solving. The weekly training of the tutors addresses both teaching and mentoring issues in science education such as helping students to build confidence, strategies for assessing student understanding, and fostering a growth mindset. A second weekly training meeting addresses common misconceptions and strategies for teaching specific physics topics. For non-science majors we have a small Peer Mentor Tutor program for Physics in the Arts. We will discuss the Physics Learning Center’s approaches to promoting inclusion, understanding, and confidence for both our participants and Peer Mentor Tutors, as well as examples from the geosciences that can be used to illustrate introductory physics concepts.",

Previous studies based on observations indicated that strong soil moisture gradients have higher probability of convective initiation than homogeneous soil moisture conditions, and that precipitation preferentially occurs over drier soils. In this study, remote-sensing datasets are used to investigate how soil moisture spatial distribution will be modified after afternoon precipitation events, and whether the subsequent soil moisture distribution in the next day's morning is advantageous to trigger convection. Preliminary results show that when soil conditions are dry, afternoon precipitation events tend to maintain or increase the soil moisture heterogeneity. This implies that the new soil moisture spatial distribution after the precipitation event might favor convective triggering, thus enhance precipitation persistence in semi-arid regions. We will further explore whether numerical models can capture such soil moisture variations and persistence.",

            "abstract": "Solar energy developments are projected to be deployed over desert wildland areas with deep soil inorganic carbon (SIC) deposits, which often involves elimination of deep-rooted vegetation. This land cover change may systemically alter SIC pools since respired CO2 is the carbon (C) source during SIC formation. We sought to understand how removal of creosote bush scrub affects soil C pools. We hypothesized that vegetation is important for maintaining SIC and soil organic C (SOC) pools and that disturbance to the vegetation and soil will change CO2 flux with increased losses from SIC. Soils were collected from sites that had intact creosote bush scrub habitat adjacent to disturbed, bare areas where the native vegetation had been previously removed. Samples were taken from beneath shrub canopies and interspaces in intact areas, and from random points in the disturbed area. Soils were analyzed for SIC, SOC, microbial and labile C, and δ13C. Soils were also incubated to determine the potential CO2 flux from disturbed and undisturbed soils along with the sources of CO2. Three replicates per soil underwent a control and water addition treatment and flux and δ13C of CO2 were measured continuously. Control replicates yielded no significant CO2 flux. CO2 flux from watered soils was higher beneath shrub canopy (18.57µmol g soil-1 day-1±1.86) than the interspace soils (0.86 µmol g soil-1 day-1±0.17). Soils collected from bare areas had an intermediate flux (5.41 µmol g soil-1 day-1±2.68 and 3.68 µmol g soil-1 day-1±0.85, respectively) lying between shrub canopy and interspace soils. There was no significant difference between the δ13C values of CO2 from shrub canopy and interspace soils, both of which had a very low δ13C values (-22.60‰±0.64 and -23.88‰±0.89, respectively), resembling that of organic C. However, the isotopic values of CO2 from disturbed soils were significantly higher (-16.68‰±1.36 and -15.22‰±2.12, respectively) suggesting that these soils effluxed a greater proportion of CO2 from an inorganic source than intact soils. Microbial and labile C were highest under shrub canopy, intermediate in interspaces, and lowest in bare areas. Vegetation removal to accommodate renewable energy developments may negatively impact soil C, potentially leading to unintended increased soil C losses from the SIC pool.",

            "abstract": "Nearly all streamflow at one time passes through or over a hillslope prior to reaching the stream network. Knowledge of how this water is attenuated and delayed over a variety of hillslope conditions is critical for understanding the mechanisms controlling the spatial and temporal distribution of streamflow response. In semi-arid rangeland environments, these mechanisms remain unclear. Non- invasive geophysical methods coupled with traditional hydrological tools can provide the necessary insights into the dynamics of how upland hillslopes and streams are episodically connected. We collected approximately 1.4 km of ground penetrating radar (GPR) data to characterize the subsurface structure of a rangeland hillslope in the Upper Crow Creek Watershed and identify subsurface fractures. A field study integrating variable intensity rainfall simulation with time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was then conducted on four runoff plots positioned on the hillslope, to quantify the real-time partitioning of rainfall into surface and subsurface response. Runoff varied significantly across the plots due to spatial variability in vegetation cover, with a maximum and minimum peak runoff rate of 82 mm hr-1 and 7 mm hr-1 respectively. Time-lapse ERT data suggest the potential for infiltrated water to move preferentially through fractured regions in the subsurface identified by the GPR. Conductivity probes and pressure transducers positioned in the adjacent stream showed changes in electrical conductivity and depth following rainfall applications, suggesting hillslope connectivity with fairly rapid subsurface flow. Information obtained from this study will allow us to improve our understanding of the coupling of upland hillslopes and adjacent stream networks in complex rangeland environments.",

In this study, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is employed as an assimilation scheme to initialize a coupled model the thermosphere and ionosphere. Comparative observing system simulation experiments are conducted for ground-based and space-based GNSS observations to examine the efficacy of coupled thermosphere-ionophsere approaches to ionospheric specification and forecast under different solar activities and seasons. Different combinations of thermospheric state variables, including neutral compositions, winds, and temperature, are inferred along with ionospheric state variables such as electron and ion densities from the GNSS observations in the EnKF. After each ensemble data experiment, an ensemble of the coupled thermosphere-ionosphere model simulations is launched by using resulting data assimilation analyses as their initial condition. Experiments show that estimating neutral compositions along with ionopsheric state variables by data assimilation can extend the ionospheric predictability more than 10 days. On the other hand, estimating neutral winds and neutral temperature can also improve the ionospheric forecast, however, the behavior is complex and diverse under different conditions.",

The algorithm uses deviation from climatological mean sea level pressure. The CMIP5 results for the historical period were evaluated relative to the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2). All models exhibit changes of the mean, variance and skewness of sea level pressure as the climate changes, with the larger changes in the northern portion of the study area. There is disagreement, however, among the different models about the sign and magnitude of these changes. Storm counts exhibit less variability over this region although generally show an increasing trend as the climate changes.",

In the past, high precision isotope measurements have primarily been carried out by isotope ratio mass spectrometry on flask samples that are usually collected at relatively low temporal resolution. During the EU project INGOS, we have deployed a fully automated gas chromatography - isotope ratio mass spectrometry system (GC-IRMS), together with two laser instruments, during a 4-months campaign in the field at the Cabauw Experimental Site for Atmospheric Research (CESAR). More than 1600 measurements for δ13C and δD were obtained with IRMS during this period. Measurements show clear isotope signals associated with methane elevations both on the diurnal as well as the synoptic scale.\nIn order to assess the added value of such measurements for constraining the CH4 budget, we performed coupled simulations of CH4 and δ13C-CH4 using the chemistry transport model TM5. We specifically assessed the relative impact of uncertainties in i) CH4 emissions, ii) CH4 isotope source signatures and iii) methane transport and chemistry throughout the atmosphere. By randomly perturbing CH4 emissions and δ13C source signatures, we identified areas where simulated variations are dominated by uncertainties in the emission strength and areas where uncertainties in the isotope signatures dominate. At observation sites where the uncertainties in CH4 emissions dominate the other sources of uncertainty, isotope observations should provide useful additional constraints on CH4 emissions. At locations where uncertainties in the isotope signatures dominate, the isotope measurements will be useful to better constrain the source signatures themselves.",

SSEs repeating at the same location have characteristic slip magnitude and duration. Contrary to earthquakes, however, average slip relates to neither duration nor area. Variations in duration, slip, and slip rate can instead be tied to variations in effective viscosity, calculated from a viscous definition of moment. In this paradigm, the observation that deep slow slip events are slower and longer, implies a higher effective viscosity than in shallower, colder SSEs. Observed variations in effective viscosity and slip rate can be interpreted in terms of differences in driving stress and shear zone width, and likely arise in anastomosing shear zones containing a heterogeneous mixture of materials.",

During the Exp. 348, cuttings, mud gas, and logging data were collected from Holes C0002N and C0002P down to 3058.5 mbsf. Cores were collected from 2163 to 2218 mbsf of Hole C0002P. Three lithologic units were identified at Site C0002 based on geological and geochemical characteristics of core and cuttings samples: Unit III (875.5-975.5 mbsf in Hole C0002N), Unit IV (975.5-1665.5 mbsf in Hole C0002N), and Unit V (1665.5-2325.5 mbsf in Hole C0002N, and 1965.5-3058.5 mbsf in Hole C0002P) (Tobin et al., 2015).\nTo evaluate whole thermal structure of the Site C0002, we performed vitrinite reflectance analysis for cuttings samples collected every ~100 m, and for borehole core samples collected every ~10 m of Hole C0002N and C0002P. Vitrinite reflectance (Ro) is an indicator to estimate maximum paleotemperature, which has been widely applied to reveal tectonic evolution of on-land accretionary complex in Southwest Japan (e.g. Underwood et al., 1992; Ohomori et al., 1997) and thermal anomalies along fault slip zones reflecting frictional heating due to seismic slip (e.g. Sakaguchi et al., 2011). This is the first study that applied vitrinite analyses systematically to the deep portion of modern accretionary prisms.\nIn this presentation, we report preliminary results of vitrinite reflectance analysis. Ro values are 0.15 to 0.20 in Unit III (forearc basin strata), 0.21 to 0.27 in Unit IV (accretionary prism strata), and 0.26 to 0.38 in Unit V (hemipelagic sediment), respectively. In general, Ro values tend to be gradually and continuously increasing with depth. Estimated paleotemperatures are ~67°C in Unit IV and ~77°C in Unit V. Estimated paleotemperatures are lower than estimated modern temperatures based on borehole temperature measurements and their downward extrapolations (Sugihara et al., 2014). Gaps on Ro values are showen at ~1400-1500 mbsf, ~1900-2000 mbsf and ~2400-2500 mbsf. Ro gap at ~1400-1500 mbsf is correspondent to an age boundary indicated by nannofossils (1435 mbsf), whereas Ro gap at ~2400-2500 mbsf is associated with lithology change where clay-size content partly increases in the silty claystone (start from 2360.5 mbsf).",

A complete understanding of the fate and transformations of organic carbon in the atmosphere therefore requires a detailed quantitative description of both gas- and particle-phase carbon, but attempts to understand the evolution of carbon through atmospheric oxidation has in nearly all cases resulted in a large fraction of “missing” or unidentified carbon. In our work, a large suite of state-of-the-art mass spectrometric and spectroscopic instrumentation was brought to bear on the oxidation by both ozone and OH of common biogenic emissions (α-pinene, β-pinene, β-caryophyllene), with OH concentrations spanning hours to days of simulated atmospheric aging. Organic carbon across all volatilities and functionalities was measured, from aerosols to high-volatility gases, including CO and formic acid. New chemical ionization and electron-impact ionization mass spectrometric instruments allowed for the characterization and quantification of low-volatility gases, which are observed to form quickly then decrease with growth in aerosol mass. Reaction conditions were varied to better understand the role played by measurement artifacts, such as loss of vapor to the walls, in typical laboratory oxidation experiments. By observing all carbon through multiple generations of oxidation, we examine the transitions between particles and lower-volatility gases with unprecedented detail and place them in the context of current simplified (i.e. two-dimensional) model frameworks, providing a more complete understanding of the evolution of organics in the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "The Radio Jove Project is a hands-on educational activity in which students, teachers, and the general public build simple radio telescopes, usually from a kit, to observe single frequency decameter wavelength radio emissions from Jupiter, the Sun, the galaxy, and the Earth usually with simple dipole antennas. Some of the amateur observers have upgraded their receivers to spectrographs and their antennas have become more sophisticated as well. The data records compare favorably to more sophisticated professional radio telescopes such as the Long Wavelength Array (LWA) and the Nancay Decametric Array. Since these data are often carefully calibrated and recorded around the clock in widely scattered locations they represent a valuable database useful not only to amateur radio astronomers but to the professional science community as well. Some interesting phenomena have been noted in the data that are of interest to the professionals familiar with such records. The continuous monitoring of radio emissions from Jupiter could serve as useful “ground truth” data during the coming Juno mission’s radio observations of Jupiter.\nRadio Jove has long maintained an archive for thousands of Radio Jove observations, but the database was intended for use by the Radio Jove participants only. Now, increased scientific interest in the use of these data has resulted in several proposals to translate the data into a science community data format standard and store the data in professional archives. Progress is being made in translating Radio Jove data to the Common Data Format (CDF) and also in generating new observations in that format as well. Metadata describing the Radio Jove data would follow the Space Physics Archive Search and Extract (SPASE) standard. The proposed archive to be used for long term preservation would be the Planetary Data System (PDS). Data sharing would be achieved through the PDS and the Paris Astronomical Data Centre (PADC) and the Virtual Wave Observatory (VWO). We believe that Radio Jove represents another fertile area for citizen science to contribute to overall scientific investigation.",

Here, we will report results from a comparative study of two extremely fast CME events: one on 29 October 2003 (Halloween 2003 epoch) and the other on 23 July 2012. Both shock events reached 1 AU within ~20 hours. We employed a global three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulation model (H3DMHD, Wu et al. 2007, JGR) to study these two events and compared the results with observations (e.g., 1 AU in-situ data, and coronal images from SOHO/LASCO or STEREO/ SECCHI). It was found that: (i) The peak temperature, velocity, and density of the solar wind for the shock/ICME event are 2 x 107 K, 2500 km s-1, and 35 cm-3, respectively. (ii) The peaks of magnetic field (B) are ~60 and 110 nT for the event on 29 October 2003 and 23 July 2012, respectively. Solar wind densities behind the shocks are extremely low which are due to rarefaction of the interplanetary shocks’ propagation. We will discuss this issue in the presentation. Simulations are vastly improved and forecasting arrival times should be done as noted in real time by Zhou and Dryer (Space Weather Quarterly, 2014) review, but CME and B therein is still a major challenge for storm prediction.",

            "abstract": "Recent work in fluvial seismology indicates that seismic noise near rivers can be used to monitor bedload transport, a process that remains very challenging to observe through other means. Theoretical studies have shown that bedload-induced noise can be separated from water-flow-induced noise, and suggest that bedload transport physics and fluxes can be inferred from river-induced noise. However, prior to using these models in geomorphological contexts, they need to be tested and validated from targeted experiments with independent measurements: this is the main goal of this study.\nWe conduct laboratory experiments with controlled bedload transport rates in a relatively large flume with typical mountain-river geometries (2 to 8% slopes, 9 to 25 cm flow depths, 3 to 10 cm grain sizes). In these experiments, we simultaneously monitor the micro-mechanics and the ambient seismic noise caused by bedload transport from accelerometers embedded in moving grains (smart rocks) and a seismometer placed nearby the flume. The smart rock measurements allow us to provide new constraints on the dependence upon hydraulic parameters of bedload transport characteristics (grain downstream velocities, hop sizes) and grain impact statistics (probability distributions of impact amplitudes and rates). By incorporating these new constraints into a modified mechanical model of bedload-induced seismic noise, we show that bedload transport fluxes can be accurately inverted from ambient seismic noise. These results validate the application of our theoretical frameworks to estimate realistic bedload sediment fluxes from seismic noise, which is particularly encouraging for future field applications.",

            "abstract": "The stream power incision model (SPIM) has a long history of use in modeling landscape evolution. Despite simplifications made in its formulation, it has emerged over the last 30 years as a powerful tool to interpret the histories of tectonically active landscapes and to understand how they evolve over millions of years. However, intense interest in the relationship between climate and erosion has revealed that the standard SPIM has some significant shortcomings. First, it fails to account for the role of erosion thresholds, which have been shown to be important and require an approach that addresses the variable or stochastic nature of erosion processes and drivers. Second, the standard SPIM does not address the influence of catchment hydrology, which modulates the incoming precipitation to produce discharge that in turn drives fluvial erosion. Hydrological processes alter in particular the frequency and magnitude of extreme events which are highly relevant for landscape erosion.\nTo address these weaknesses we introduce a new analytical stochastic-threshold formulation of the stream power incision model that is driven by probabilistic hydrology. The hydrological model incorporates a stochastic description of soil moisture which takes into account the random nature of the rainfall forcing and the dynamics of the soil layer. The soil layer dynamics include infiltration and evapotranspiration which are both modelled as being dependent on the time varying soil moisture level (state dependent). The stochastic approach allows us to integrate these effects over long periods of time to understand their influence on the longterm average erosion rate without the need to explicitly model processes on the short timescales where they are relevant. Our model can therefore represent the role of soil properties (thickness, porosity) and vegetation (through evapotranspiration rates) in the longterm catchment-wide water balance, and in turn the longterm erosion rate. We identify these catchment-wide ecohydrological dynamics as a key aspect of the model that can have a nonlinear and potentially dominant influence on the longterm rate of landscape erosion and we estimate over what climatic and ecological regimes this influence may be important.",

            "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Climate change and variability, market and policy changes are shaping pastoral communities’ decisions on what pathways their future livelihoods will take and how the steppe landscapes and river basins, are managed. Recent droughts and damaging winter storms (zuds) of the past two decades have exacerbated the situation and undermined the natural capital on which the pastoral livelihoods depend upon. River basins are critical natural resources well-being of social-ecological systems in Mongolia. River basins provide the ecosystem services which support pastoral communities and industrial and urban development. Green development strategies are strongly dependent on water resources. Consequently, integrated planning of river basin management is needed to maintain these critical ecosystem services to meet the multiple needs of livelihoods of communities in these basins and to support sustainable development activities within the basins.\nFor this study our team worked in nine sums (i.e., county level administrative areas) in three river basins in two provinces (aimags) to collect household data from 144 households. We also collected census data from the aimags and national level to understand trends at the level of ecosystems and river basins. We have selected 3 sums in each river basis, representing forest steppe, steppe and desert steppe regions for comparison across river basins and ecological zones.\nFINDINGS: Integrated planning efforts would be enhanced through, one, use of a social-ecological framework and, two, the development of a cross-ministerial working group to address natural resource considerations. Across the three basins agriculture, pastoral, industrial, and urban needs vie for similar ecosystem services. The natural capital and ecosystem services of these basins need to be assessed to understand the vulnerability and capacity of the resources. The most frequently listed “best coping strategy” across all ecosystem types was for herders to have better cooperation, both among themselves and with administrators. They frequently expressed the idea that people working alone can’t accomplish anything in comparison to when they work together. Development of cross ministry and cross-sectoral working groups were viewed as one such mechanism.",

Although this phenomenon is known as skin formation, its microscopic mechanism is still unknown. As a part of a Japanese National hydrate research program (MH21, funded by METI), we carried out an experiment on the clogging of fine particles in sand sediments. A transparent core holder was newly developed to directly visualize the behavior of fine particles in the pore of frame sands and formation of skin. It was observed that there seems to be an induction time before the clogging starts to occur. Once clogging occurs, the upstream fine particles cannot move downstream anymore and the skin is formed. It was found that the rate of skin formation is related to the total volume of injected fine particles while the flow velocity has something to do with the length of the induction time.",

Here we present a numerically accurate, computationally efficient, high-resolution model for sea level. Unlike contemporary models that are based on spherical-harmonic formulation, the model can operate efficiently in a flexible embedded finite-element mesh system, thus capturing the physics operating at km-scale yet capable of simulating geophysical quantities that are inherently of global scale with minimal computational cost. One obvious application is to compute evolution of sea level fingerprints and associated geodetic and astronomical observables (e.g., geoid height, gravity anomaly, solid-earth deformation, polar motion, and geocentric motion) as a companion to a numerical 3-D thermo-mechanical ice sheet simulation, thus capturing global signatures of climate driven mass redistribution. We evaluate some important time-varying signatures of GRACE inferred ice sheet mass balance and continental hydrological budget; for example, we identify dominant sources of ongoing sea-level change at the selected tide gauge stations, and explain the relative contribution of different sources to the observed polar drift. We also report our progress on ice-sheet/solid-earth/sea-level model coupling efforts toward realistic simulation of Pine Island Glacier over the past several hundred years.",

In this presentation we will discuss the mobility of clay nanoparticles as detected by laser-induced breakdown detection (LIBD) as a function of fracture surface roughness and groundwater chemistry. The on site observed Tc-99, U-233, Np-237, Pu-242 and Am-243 sorption/desorption kinetics with and without natural or synthetic clay minerals (smectites) are compared to laboratory studies under similar groundwater conditions. The desorption or redox kinetics were monitored over a duration of up to 426 days using natural fracture filling material as a concurrence ligand and monitoring the colloid attachment via detection of Al, Si, Ni and Zn as smectite structural elements. For trivalent actinides smectite desorption rates in the range of 1.2-3.7E-3 per hour could be determined and significantly lower desorption rates for tetravalent actinides were found. This results will be compared with field data of migration experiments performed at the Grimsel Test Site (GTS, Switzerland) using the same radionuclides and clay colloidal phases varying the fracture residence time by flow rate adjustment. Furthermore, the long-term actinide mobility will be addressed by presenting AMS/RIMS measurements of (a) samples collected several months into the tailing of the breakthrough curves not any longer detectable by HR-ICP-MS and (b) background samples of different GTS ground waters showing fallout U-236, whereas fallout Pu could not be detected indicating a much lower mobility under the given conditions.",

The knowledge of ground parameters are very important in developing seismic code of seismic prone regions like Himalaya for better design of buildings. The ground parameters recorded in recent earthquake event and aftershocks are compared with attenuation relations for the Himalayan region, the predicted ground motion parameters show good correlation with the observed ground parameters. The results will be of great use to Civil engineers in updating existing building codes in the Himlayan and surrounding regions and also for the evaluation of seismic hazards.

            "abstract": "The radiative effect of cloud snow interaction is one of physical processes influencing model performances. According to sensitivity experiments in a coupled general circulation model, the presence of cloud snow radiation has been found to alternate the vertical distribution of atmospheric radiation, moist and dynamic processes in the atmosphere over cloudy regions in the Pacific. Its imprints on upper oceans via vertical mixing are observed as well where cooler sea surface temperature (SST) and subsurface ocean temperature are attributable to stronger surface wind stress. To complement previous works, this study focuses on the model behavior in terms of ocean heat content and meridional overturning circulation with and without the cloud snow radiative effect. Consistent with SST and subsurface ocean temperature, the presence of cloud snow radiation generates pronouncedly less ocean heat content in the top of 300 m between the Intertropical Convergence Zone and South Pacific Convergence Zone and more ocean heat content in the Pacific storm tracks, which reduces biases relative to observations. In addition, the presence of snow cloud radiation induces Pacific meridional overturning circulation anomalies in upper 700 m between 10oN and 20oS where more southward mass is transported south of the equator and more northward mass is transported north of the equator. The divergence of mass transport is likely to be linked to less ocean heat content in the subtropical Pacific. This study illustrates the importance of cloud snow radiation to energy redistribution in oceans in the modeling climate system.",

            "abstract": "Subsurface drainage is a very common practice in the agricultural U.S. Midwest. It is typically installed in poorly drained soils in order to enhance crop yields. The presence of tile drains creates a route for agrichemicals to travel and therefore negatively impacts stream water quality. This study estimated through end-member analyses the contributions of tile drainage, groundwater, and surface runoff to streamflow at the watershed scale based on continuously monitored data. Especial attention was devoted to quantifying tile drainage impact on watershed streamflow and nutrient export loads. Data analyzed includes streamflow, rainfall, soil moisture, shallow groundwater levels, in-stream nitrate+nitrite concentrations and specific conductance. Data were collected at a HUC12 watershed located in Northeast Iowa, USA. Approximately 60% of the total watershed area is devoted to agricultural activities and forest and grassland are the other two predominant land uses. Results show that approximately 20% of total annual streamflow comes from tile drainage and during rainfall events tile drainage contribution can go up to 30%. Furthermore, for most of the analyzed rainfall events groundwater responded faster and in a more dramatic fashion than tile drainage. The State of Iowa is currently carrying out a plan to reduce nutrients in Iowa waters and the Gulf of Mexico (Iowa Nutrient Reduction Strategy). The outcome of this investigation has the potential to assist in Best Management Practice (BMP) scenario selection and therefore help the state achieve water quality goals.",

            "abstract": "We describe slow slip events and dynamic rupture events generated on a newly constructed large-scale biaxial friction apparatus at Cornell University that provide insights into the mechanisms of aseismic and seismic slip. We find that, under nominally similar experimental conditions, the 760 mm long granite sample sometimes slips in dynamic stick-slip events and sometimes relieves accumulated shear stress through slow slip events. To provide insights into this curious behavior and the underlying mechanisms, fault slip and shear stress are each measured at 8 locations along the 760 mm long fault. This allows us to map slow slip fronts and the nucleation and propagation of dynamic fault rupture. The granite sample is also instrumented with an array of piezoelectric sensors that are the laboratory equivalent of a seismic network. When the sample is loaded relatively slowly, at 0.03 MPa/s, slow slip occurs on large sections of the fault and the slow slipping region soon expands to the sample boundary. In this case, stress is released in a slow slip event with peak slip velocities < 2 mm/s. Alternatively, when one end of the sample is loaded rapidly (4 MPa/s), or the sample is allowed to heal in stationary contact for a few minutes, slow slip initiates near the load point and accelerates to slip velocities exceeding 200 mm/s before the slow slipping region expands all the way to the sample boundary. This produces a dynamic slip event (stick-slip). The dynamic slip events radiate seismic waves equivalent to a M = -2.5 earthquake. In contrast, the laboratory-generated slow slip events are predominantly aseismic and produce only bursts of tiny and discrete seismic events (M = -6) reminiscent of swarms of microseismicity. The experiments illustrate how a single fault can slide slowly and aseismically or rapidly and dynamically depending on stress state and loading conditions. We compare the behavior observed on this Cornell apparatus to the behavior of other large-scale biaxial machines at the NIED in Tsukuba, Japan, and at the USGS in Menlo Park, California. While the Cornell machine is smaller than the NIED (1.5 m) and USGS (2.0 m) machines, the stress levels are higher (14 MPa compared to 7 MPa), and the relatively high stiffness (6 GPa/m) of the loading frame likely promotes slow slip.",

            "abstract": "In contrast to the continuity of mid-ocean ridge magmatism, arc volcanism is episodic, characterized by flareups lasting 10 – 50 My which, for reasons that remain unclear, end abruptly in <10 My. Key to understanding the origins of episodic arc behavior lie in constraining the roles of subducting vs. overriding lithosphere. Here, we show that upper mantle xenoliths from the Sierra Nevada arc, CA, USA represent mantle wedge residues that were thickened and rapidly cooled at ~3 GPa and 750 C, presumably at the slab-mantle interface. Pervasive melt infiltration from wedge-derived basalts transformed the depleted residues into refertilized lherzolite. Olivine crystal-preferred orientations (CPO) are weak and show predominantly axial-(010) and one lherzolite with B-type CPO. Measured water contents by SIMS in olivine and pyroxene are low, 5 – 9 ppm and 30 – 500 ppm, respectively. Assuming olivine lost water during eruption, recalculated olivine water in equilibrium with pyroxene does not exceed 35 ppm, resulting in reconstructed bulk rock water content similar to the MORB source. Extrapolation of experimental olivine water solubility to the xenoliths’ final PT conditions ranges from 30 to 270 ppm, indicating that the peridotites are water-undersaturated. Such low water contents are not sufficient to produce axial-(010) and B-type CPO. Instead, we propose that the observed CPO was inherited from the prior melt infiltration event, which deformed the peridotites via grain-size sensitive, diffusion creep (e.g., grain boundary sliding). Therefore, water played little role in deformation of arc mantle. Low water contents in thick, cold arc roots result in very high viscosities which preclude significant deformation at final PT. In the Sierran case, rapid cooling also helped to freeze in geochemical and microstructural evidence of earlier melt-assisted deformation, and allowed the preservation of arc mantle lithosphere for ~80 My after it was formed. Only when the Farallon slab rolled back in the Late Cenozoic was the Sierran arc root finally destabilized. Thus, thickening, dehydration, and cooling of lithospheric roots (part of the upper plate) can modulate the tempo of arc magmatism by episodically growing into the melt-producing mantle wedge, thereby shutting off volcanism.",

            "abstract": "Nitrate reduction reactions, as one of the most important redox reactions in a subsurface system, are strongly influenced by various heterogeneity factors which influence transport of chemical species and spatial distribution of redox substances and consequently have an effect on overall nitrate reduction capacity.\nIn this presented work, the influence of two heterogeneity factors, spatially heterogeneity of hydrological parameters versus spatial heterogeneity of geochemical reactive substances distribution, are discussed with a focus on nitrate transport and redox transformation processes. For this purpose, a coupling interface OGS#IPhreeqc is employed. This code combines Finite-Element groundwater flow and multi-species transport code of OpenGeoSys (OGS) with the IPhreeqc module of open source geochemical solver PHREEQC. The resulting coupled model is applied for simulation of nitrate reduction processes with a series of hypothetical aquifer systems, built using exponentially-correlated log-normal distributed hydraulic conductivity and reactive substances. The spatially heterogeneous aquifer system is realized by a RandomFields package using a statistical program R.\nResults show that the heterogeneous hydraulics conductivity field has larger impact on nitrate reduction capacity than heterogeneous reactive substances distribution. Moreover, nitrate reduction capacity can be increased by enhanced mixing in heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field however its overall reduction capacity has gradually decreased as a degree of heterogeneity has increased since accessibility of the chemical species by the reactive substances may be limited. These results support that appropriate characterization of the variance of hydraulic conductivity within the aquifer is important to predict contaminant fate and transport and quantify the impact of uncertainty on numerical groundwater simulation.",

            "abstract": "Blowing snow transport theory is currently limited by its dependency on the coupling of time-averaged measurements of particle saltation and suspension and wind speed. Details of the stochastic process of particle transport and complex bed interactions in the saltation layer, along with the influence of boundary-layer turbulence are unobservable with classic measurement techniques. In contrast, recent advances in two-phase sand transport understanding have been spurred by development of high-frequency wind and particle velocity measurement techniques. To advance the understanding of blowing snow, laser illuminated high-speed videography and ultrasonic anemometry were deployed in a mountain environment to examine saltation of snow over a natural snowpack in detail. A saltating snow measurement site was established at the Fortress Mountain Snow Laboratory, Alberta, Canada and instrumented with two Campbell CSAT3 ultrasonic anemometers, four Campbell SR50 ultrasonic snow depth sounders and a two dimensional Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) system. Measurements were collected during nighttime blowing snow events, quantifying snow particle response to high frequency wind gusts. This novel approach permits PTV to step beyond mean statistics of snow transport by identifying sub-species of saltation motion in the first 20 mm above the surface, as well as previously overlooked initiation processes, such as tumbling aggregate snow crystals ejecting smaller grains, then eventually disintegrating and bouncing into entrainment. Spectral characteristics of snow particle ejection and saltation dynamics were also investigated. These unique observations are starting to inform novel conceptualizations of saltating snow transport mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "Model calculations suggest that changes in short-lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) such as ozone and aerosol may have contributed significantly to rapid Arctic warming over the past century. Arctic tropospheric budgets of SLCPs are impacted by long-range transport of trace gases and aerosols from Europe, Asia and N. America, but also by local sources such as gas flaring, shipping and boreal fires. Recently, the POLARCAT Model Intercomparison Project (POLMIP) showed that significant model biases persist through the depth of the European and North American high latitude troposphere in modelled trace-gas abundances. Evaluation of models over the Siberian high latitudes is challenging due to a severe paucity of available observations, despite the potential importance of this region as a route for European pollution export to the Arctic. Despite the existence of a number of limited datasets, which could be used for model evaluation in this region, until now no effort has been made to synthesise and exploit these observations to evaluate modelled abundances of SLCPs such as tropospheric ozone & aerosol.\nIn this presentation, we will show evaluation of simulated aerosol, tropospheric ozone, and precursor species in several global chemical transport models, using a synthesis of available surface, aircraft and satellite observations over the high latitude pan-Eurasian region. We use models and observations to investigate source regions contributing to remote Siberian SLCP abundances over the annual cycle, and show substantial biases in simulated aerosol and trace gas concentrations that are consistent across a suite of different models. These comparisons constitute the first multi-model evaluation of tropospheric composition in the pan-Eurasin region using observations from across the broad region. Finally, we use the model simulations to determine optimum locations for the development of future monitoring activities in high latitude Eurasia with an aim of better constraining SLCP sources and sinks in this region.",

However, they do not preserve a record of early-formed (Hadean and Archean) depleted mantle domains, either by earlier cycles of ridge-related depletion, continent extraction, or subcontinental lithospheric mantle erosion. The lack of preservation of early-formed (Hadean and Archean) depleted Os-isotopic compositions is consistent with the lack of preservation of Hadean 142Nd/144Nd variability in the modern convecting mantle, but is in stark contrast to the existence of early-formed (early-Hadean), heterogeneous 129Xe/130Xe isotopic anomalies in the modern mantle.\nMukhopadhay (Nature, 2012) suggested that the erasure of 142Nd/144Nd, but not 129Xe/130Xe, anomalies from the convecting mantle may be due to the small magnitude of the 142Nd/144Nd anomalies (< 0.004% variability has been observed in terrestrial Archean terraines) compared to 129Xe/130Xe anomalies (>10% variability observed) because the smaller 142Nd/144Nd anomalies would have been more easily erased than the larger magnitude 129Xe/130Xe anomalies. This model does not work for the Re-Os system because the magnitude of Os-isotopic heterogeneities in the mantle are large, yet early-formed Os-isotopic signatures have been erased. For example, the 187Os/188Os of early-formed depleted mantle at 4.55 Ga was ~0.095, which is >25% lower than the modern mantle. Given that there were substantial amounts of mantle partial melting throughout the Hadean and Archean, it is hard to understand how some refractory residues retaining some vestige of these low, early-formed Os isotopic compositions have not have been preserved in the modern mantle. Therefore, the lack of preservation of early-formed, large magnitude 187Os/188Os excursions in the modern convecting mantle suggests that the preservation of early geochemical heterogeneities was not necessarily a function of the original geochemical anomaly. We explore alternative solutions to the paradox of preservation of Hadean 129Xe/130Xe anomalies, but the lack of Hadean 142Nd/144Nd and 187Os/188Os signatures, in the modern oceanic mantle.",

Since 2008, the USGS has reported over 165 felt earthquakes in the Fort Worth (Barnett Shale) Basin located in northern Texas. Five earthquake sequences warranted deployment of local seismic networks, and there are currently 30+ temporary seismic stations operating in the basin. Event size has increased over time. The 2008/2012 DFW Airport and 2009 Cleburne sequences had maximum event magnitudes of 3.3 and 2.8, respectively. The 2013/2014 Azle-Reno and 2014/2015 Irving-Dallas swarms contain multiple M3.5 earthquakes, and the M4.0 May 2015 Venus earthquake is the largest event recorded to date. Causative faults strike NNE-SSW to NE-SW and are associated with normal faulting, consistent with fault reactivation in the current stress regime. The active faults range from 2-5 km in length, are steeply dipping (45-70º) and can dip to the SE (DFW Airport; Irving-Dallas) or NW (Azle-Reno; Venus). Events occur between 2-6 km depth in the DFW, Cleburne, and Venus sequences but extend to 8 km in the Irving-Dallas and Azle-Reno earthquake swarms. These depths are consistent with reactivation of ancient faults located in the basement granites and/or overlying sedimentary units. The top of the Ordovician Ellenburger group, which serves as a wastewater injection unit in the basin, ranges from 1.4-2.7 km depth across the seismogenic area, is ~1 km thick on average, and generally overlies the Precambrian basement. The DFW Airport, Cleburne, and Azle-Reno sequences have been linked to nearby wastewater injection and/or production activity associated with shale gas extraction. Causal studies of the 2014/2015 Irving-Dallas and 2015 Venus sequences are ongoing and will be updated here.",

However, they have only been accurately recorded in the last few decades, limiting their representativeness to only a subset of possible tracks in a changing large-scale environment. Taking into account various climate conditions, synthetic tracks can be generated to produce a much larger sample of cyclone tracks to understand variability of cyclone activity and assess future changes. To evaluate how well the synthetic tracks capture the characteristics of the historical tracks, several statistical metrics have been developed to characterize and compare their shapes and movements. In one metric, the probability density functions of storm locations are estimated by modeling the position of the storms as a Markov chain. Another metric is constructed to capture the mutual information between two variables such as velocity and curvature. These metrics are then applied to the synthetic and historical tracks to determine if the latter are plausibly a subset of the former. Bootstrap sampling is used in applying the metrics to the synthetic tracks to accurately compare them with the historical tracks given the large sample size difference. If we confirm that the synthetic tracks capture the variability of the historical ones, high confidence intervals can be determined from the much larger set of synthetic tracks to look for highly unusual tracks and to assess their probability of occurrence.",

            "abstract": " Hotspot tracks have been widely used to estimate the velocities of the plate relative to the lower mantle. Here we analyze the hotspot azimuth data set of Morgan and Phipps Morgan [2007] and show that the errors in plate velocity azimuths inferred from hotspot tracks in any one plate are correlated with the errors of other azimuths in the same plate. We use a two-tier analysis to account for this correlated error. First, we determine an individual best-fitting pole for each plate. Second, we determine the absolute plate velocity by minimizing the misfit while constrained by the MORVEL relative plate velocities [DeMets et al. 2010]. Our preferred model, HS4-MORVEL, uses azimuths from 9 major plates, which are weighted equally. We find that the Pacific plate rotates 0.860.016°Ma-1 right handed about 63.3°S, 96.1°E. Angular velocities of four plates (Amur, Eurasia, Yangtze and Antarctic) differ insignificantly from zero. The net rotation of the lithosphere is 0.24°±0.014° Ma-1 right handed about 52.3S, 56.9E. The angular velocities differ insignificantly from the absolute angular velocities inferred from the orientation of seismic anisotropy [Zheng et al. 2014]. The within-plate dispersion of hotspot track azimuths is 14°, which is comparable to the within-plate dispersion found from orientations of seismic anisotropy. The between-plate dispersion is 6.9±2.4° (95% confidence limits), which is smaller than that found from seismic anisotropy.\nThe between-plate dispersion of 4.5° to 9.3° can be used to place bounds on how fast hotspots under one plate move relative to hotspots under another plate. For an average plate absolute speed of ≈50 mm/yr, the between-plate dispersion indicates a rate of motion of 4 mm/yr to 8 mm/yr for the component of hotspot motion perpendicular to plate motion. This upper bound is consistent with prior work that indicated upper bounds on motion between Pacific hotspots and Indo-Atlantic hotspots over the past 48 Ma of 8−13 mm/yr [Koivisto et al. 2014], but differs in giving a non-zero lower bound on the rate of motion between hotspots.",

With an initial model derived from traditional asymptotic surface wave tomography method [Guo et al., 2015], adjoint tomography updates 3-D model by iteratively minimizing the frequency-dependent traveltime misfits between EGFs and synthetic Green’s functions in four pass bands: 6 s - 15 s, 10 s - 20 s, 15 s - 30 s, and 20 s - 40 s. Our new model show shear wavespeed anomalies well correlated with known tectonic units such as Xing’an-Mongolia Orogenic Belt, Changbai Mountain Range, and the basins of Songliao, Erlian, Hailer, and Sanjiang. The new model also reveals a distinct structure beneath the Tan-Lu Fault Zone - a significant low-wavespeed anomaly located in the mid-lower crust and uppermost mantle.

Each meteorite will be processed by the full suite of observations and measurements: petrographic/microscopic studies, density, porosity, albedo, shock effects, thermal conductivity, heat capacity, emissivity, and acoustic velocity. Of these measurments, density and porosity are the most studied to date (Macke, 2010; Britt and Consolmagno, 2003). The thermal properties of meteorites are less well understood. Thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and thermal emissivity are important data for a number of applications but especially to understanding the behavior of a meteor as it passes through the atmosphere. Opeil et al. (2010) have shown that meteorites have a thermal conductivities lower than the pure minerals they are composed of by a factor of 3 to 10, with the values coming to a roughly constant number from 150 to 300 K. Calculated conductivity numbers from Yomogida and Matsui (1983) show the H chondrites have the higest conductivity in the range of 3.8 W/m*K at 200 K and then slowly decreases to 3.2 W/m*K at 400 K. Whereas they show the LL chondrites do not reach 1 W/m*K over the temperature range 100 to 400 K. While there have been several high temperature spectroscopic studies of meteorites, to date all experimental data for the physical properties of meteorites were obtained at temperatures below 400 K, since previous studies were made in attempts to understand the formation and evolution of asteroids. Our laboratory will focus on understanding the thermal properties of materials at temperatures above 300 K and, where possible, up to atmospheric entry temperatures. Work on pure minerals has shown that thermal conductivity decreases as temperatures exceed 300 K but it is unknown whether this holds true for meteorites. We will describe our laboratory and procedures, and present some preliminary data, at the meeting.",

Landslides and debris flows were very active and caused river channel change over the affected mountain area. River channel changes due to the earthquake.Many potentially dangerous debris filledgullies have yet to be identified. In this paper,we present a study in the Longxi river watershed of the upper Min River located in Dujiangyan, discussingthe unconsolidated deposits and debris flows and their relationship with the riverbed changes. The secondary geological disasters triggered by this earthquake is delineated across the Longxi Rvier basin. Based on remote sensing and image interpretation of two QuickBird panchromatic images and comparison between two DEM data of different time periods, wevalidatedthe data with field survey by a differential GPS and laser rangefinder. Several variables were systematically measured (width, slope, bed level change, sediment size) along an18.22 km stretch of the river for specific sites.\nWe have found from the study that: (1) the significant feature of geological disaster was near the Longxi river, where it had the mostintensity; (2) the longitudinal profile of channel bed was changed; (3) channel changes were associated with the land use and cover change, especially with the forest degradation and reforest, and post-quake reconstruction;(4)the landslide and debris flows caused the morphology changes in the Longxi River watershed, leading to sharp changes of the riverbed profiles and the slope in the upper and lower reaches.\nKeywords: Earthquake ;landslides; debris flows; channel change; riverbed evolution",

            "abstract": "Starchitect (www.starchitect.net) is an online, end-to-end stellar and planetary evolution game designed to teach players about a variety of astronomy and planetary topics. Supported by NASA and NSF, and developed at the National Center for Interactive Learning at the Space Science Institute, the game uses the \"sporadic play\" model of games such as Farmville, where players might only take actions a few times a day, but continue playing for months. This framework is a natural fit for teaching about the evolution of stars and planets. Starchitect’s systems evolve at a million years a minute, so that while massive stars will supernova almost immediately, lower mass stars like our sun will live for weeks of game time, possibly evolving life before passing through a red giant stage and ending their lives as white dwarfs.\nThe game has now been live for over a year, playable both on Facebook and externally, and over 14,000 solar systems have been created by over 11,000 players. Since the game itself is heavily instrumented we now have access to a wealth of data that can be used to examine how people are playing the game and what tasks they are successfully engaging with. Through an embedded quiz game we are even in the position to assess the prior knowledge of our audience and execute pre/post assessments tied to game play. This paper will briefly describe the game and its educational strategies, then summarize some of our current results.",

We conclude that routine simulation, and accompanying measurements of aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions that sample naturally covarying meteorological and aerosol conditions are essential for constraining the magnitude of aerosol-cloud radiative forcing.",

We examine the seasonal and interannual variations in the tracers (and inferred transport time scales), and relate to meteorological processes and climate modes. It is shown that there are large seasonal variations in the interhemispheric transport time scales but generally smaller interannual variations. The significant interannual variations are found over the Indian Ocean, and linked to the Asian monsoon and seasonal movement of intense convection. Smaller variations are found over the Eastern Pacific and linked to seasonality of the ITCZ and ENSO.",

            "abstract": "Coupled apatite (U-Th)/He and fission-track (AFT) thermochronology data from the same sample can be used to decipher complex low temperature thermal histories and evaluate compatibility between these two methods. Existing apatite He damage-diffusivity models parameterize radiation damage annealing as fission-track annealing and yield inverted apatite He and AFT dates for samples with prolonged residence in the He partial retention zone. Apatite chemistry also impacts radiation damage and fission-track annealing, temperature sensitivity, and dates in both systems. We present inverted apatite He and AFT dates from the Rae craton, Baffin Island, Canada, that cannot be explained by apatite chemistry or existing damage-diffusivity and fission track models. Apatite He dates from 34 individual analyses from 6 samples range from 237 ± 44 Ma to 511 ± 25 Ma and collectively define a positive date-eU relationship. AFT dates from these same samples are 238 ± 15 Ma to 350 ± 20 Ma. These dates and associated track length data are inversely correlated and define the left segment of a boomerang diagram. Three of the six samples with 20-90 ppm eU apatite grains yield apatite He and AFT dates inverted by 300 million years. These samples have average apatite Cl chemistry of ≤0.02 wt.%, with no correlation between Cl content and Dpar. Thermal history simulations using geologic constraints, an apatite He radiation damage accumulation and annealing model, apatite He dates with the range of eU values, and AFT date and track length data, do not yield any viable time-temperature paths. Apatite He and AFT data modeled separately predict thermal histories with Paleozoic-Mesozoic peaks reheating temperatures differing by ≥15 °C. By modifying the parameter controlling damage annealing (Rmr0) from the canonical 0.83 to 0.5-0.6, forward models reproduce the apatite He date-eU correlation and AFT dates with a common thermal history. Results imply apatite radiation damage anneals at higher temperatures than fission-track damage and the impact on coupled apatite He and AFT dates is magnified for protracted cooling histories. Further experimental and field-based tests are important for refining radiation damage and fission-track annealing parameters for accurate interpretation of apatite He- and AFT-derived thermal histories.",

            "abstract": "Recent experimental studies, performed at seismic slip rates (≥ 1 m/s), suggest that the friction coefficient of seismic faults is significantly lower than at sub-seismic (< 1 mm/s) speeds. Microstructural observations, integrated with theoretical studies, suggest that the weakening of seismic faults could be due to a range of thermally-activated mechanisms (e.g. gel, nanopowder and melt lubrication, thermal pressurization, viscous flow), triggered by frictional heating in the slip zone. The presence of pseudotachylyte within both exhumed fault zones and experimental slip zones in crystalline rocks suggests that lubrication plays a key role in controlling dynamic weakening during rupture propagation.\nThe Outer Hebrides Fault Zone (OHFZ), UK contains abundant pseudotachylyte along faults cutting varying gneissic lithologies. Our field observations suggest that the mineralogy of the protolith determines volume, composition and viscosity of the frictional melt, which then affects the coseismic weakening behaviour of the fault and has important implications for the magnitudes and distribution of stress drops during slip episodes.\nHigh velocity friction experiments at 18 MPa axial load, 1.3 ms-1 and up to 10 m slip were run on quartzo-feldspathic, metabasic and mylonitic samples, taken from the OHFZ in an attempt to replicate its coseismic frictional behaviour. These were configured in cores of a single lithology, or in mixed cores with two rock types juxtaposed. All lithologies produce a general trend of frictional evolution, where an initial peak followed by transient weakening precedes a second peak which then decays to a steady state. Metabasic and felsic single-lithology samples both produce sharper frictional peaks, at values of μ = 0.19 and μ= 0.37 respectively, than the broader and smaller (μ= 0.15) peak produced by a mixed basic-felsic sample. In addition, both single-lithology peaks occur within 0.2 m slip, whereas the combined-lithology sample displays a slower transition to the steady state, with the peak occurring after almost 2 m. Our results show that the frictional behaviour of faults in crystalline rocks, where different lithologies are in contact, is complex. Protolith composition determines the physical properties of the melt, which controls the evolution of coseismic friction.",

            "abstract": "Watershed managers need to quantify sediment storage and delivery timescales to understand the time required for best management practices to improve downstream water quality. To address this need, we route sediment downstream using a random walk through a series of valley compartments spaced at 1 km intervals. The probability of storage within each compartment, q, is specified from a sediment budget and is defined as the ratio of the volume deposited to the annual sediment flux. Within each compartment, the probability of sediment moving directly downstream without being stored is p=1-q. If sediment is stored within a compartment, its “resting time” is specified by a stochastic exponential waiting time distribution with a mean of 10 years. After a particle’s waiting time is over, it moves downstream to the next compartment by fluvial transport. Over a distance of “n” compartments, a sediment particle may be stored from 0 to n times with the probability of each outcome (store or not store) specified by the binomial distribution. We assign q = 0.02, a stream velocity of 0.5 m/s, an event “intermittency “of 0.01, and assume a balanced sediment budget. Travel time probability density functions have a steep peak at the shortest times, representing rapid transport in the channel of the fraction of sediment that moves downstream without being stored. However, the probability of moving downstream “n” km without storage is pn (0.90 for 5 km, 0.36 for 50 km, 0.006 for 250 km), so travel times are increasingly dominated by storage with increasing distance. Median travel times for 5, 50, and 250 km are 0.03, 4.4, and 46.5 years. After a distance of approximately 2/q or 100 km (2/0.02/km), the median travel time is determined by storage timescales, and active fluvial transport is irrelevant. Our model extracts travel time statistics from sediment budgets, and can be cast as a differential equation and solved numerically for more complex systems.",

            "abstract": "Inverse modeling seeks model parameters given a set of observed state variables. However, for many practical problems due to the facts that the observed data sets are often large and model parameters are often numerous, conventional methods for solving the inverse modeling can be computationally expensive. We have developed a new, computationally-efficient Levenberg-Marquardt method for solving large-scale inverse modeling. Levenberg-Marquardt methods require the solution of a dense linear system of equations which can be prohibitively expensive to compute for large-scale inverse problems. Our novel method projects the original large-scale linear problem down to a Krylov subspace, such that the dimensionality of the measurements can be significantly reduced. Furthermore, instead of solving the linear system for every Levenberg-Marquardt damping parameter, we store the Krylov subspace computed when solving the first damping parameter and recycle it for all the following damping parameters. The efficiency of our new inverse modeling algorithm is significantly improved by using these computational techniques. We apply this new inverse modeling method to invert for a random transitivity field. Our algorithm is fast enough to solve for the distributed model parameters (transitivity) at each computational node in the model domain. The inversion is also aided by the use regularization techniques. The algorithm is coded in Julia and implemented in the MADS computational framework (http://mads.lanl.gov). Julia is an advanced high-level scientific programing language that allows for efficient memory management and utilization of high-performance computational resources. By comparing with a Levenberg-Marquardt method using standard linear inversion techniques, our Levenberg-Marquardt method yields speed-up ratio of 15 in a multi-core computational environment and a speed-up ratio of 45 in a single-core computational environment. Therefore, our new inverse modeling method is a powerful tool for large-scale applications.",

We outline these occurrences, their duration, and their general characteristics. We show that most high β events are associated with night-and-dusk-side injections and can last from minutes to hours, depending on the nature and cause of the injection. Most of these events have β < 2, with a few observations having β > 7. Other observations of particular note are high β events during quiet-time solar wind activity. We present a number of high β injection examples for both active and quiet times. Additionally, we present examples of high β plasma with and without associated magnetospheric wave generation. Given the high level of instrumentation on the Van Allen Probes, we are able to characterize injection events with unprecedented detail, potentially supporting new discoveries in fundamental plasma physics.",

The current system develops and evolves along the ionospheric terminator and it is thus termed as the terminator field-aligned currents. The discovery was based on the reconstructions from the Ionospheric Dynamics and Electrodynamics Data Assimilation Model (IDED-DA) with the ingestion of observational measurements. In this presentation, we show the results of a follow-on study using the IDED-DA, in which the solar, seasonal, and geomagnetic dependencies of the terminator field-aligned currents are explored. The new current system is the first field-aligned current system in the high-latitude ionosphere that is not directly driven by the magnetospheric dynamics and has an ionospheric origin. A systematic study of its electrodynamic and plasma dynamics as well as dependencies on various solar-terrestrial conditions will help us to explore the active role of the ionosphere in the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling and improve the physical understanding of the electrodynamics and plasma dynamics of many small-scale structures in the polar ionosphere.

            "abstract": "Earth and environmental systems models (EESMs) are continually growing in complexity and dimensionality with continuous advances in understanding and computing power. Complexity and dimensionality are manifested by introducing many different factors in EESMs (i.e., model parameters, forcings, boundary conditions, etc.) to be identified. Sensitivity Analysis (SA) provides an essential means for characterizing the role and importance of such factors in producing the model responses. However, conventional approaches to SA suffer from (1) an ambiguous characterization of sensitivity, and (2) poor computational efficiency, particularly as the problem dimension grows.\nHere, we present a new and general sensitivity analysis framework (called VARS), based on an analogy to ‘variogram analysis’, that provides an intuitive and comprehensive characterization of sensitivity across the full spectrum of scales in the factor space. We prove, theoretically, that Morris (derivative-based) and Sobol (variance-based) methods and their extensions are limiting cases of VARS, and that their SA indices can be computed as by-products of the VARS framework. We also present a practical strategy for the application of VARS to real-world problems, called STAR-VARS, including a new sampling strategy, called “star-based sampling”. Our results across several case studies show the STAR-VARS approach to provide reliable and stable assessments of “global” sensitivity across the full range of scales in the factor space, while being at least 1-2 orders of magnitude more efficient than the benchmark Morris and Sobol approaches.",

To achieve this, the project seeks to create a derived database containing only the most relevant information, accelerating the analysis process. The database is designed to be an ancillary tool for the researcher, not an archival database to replace the original data. This approach is aimed at improving performance by reducing the overall size by way of condensing the data. The primary challenges of the project include:\n- The nature of the research question(s) may not be known ahead of time.\n- The thresholds for determining anomalies may be uncertain.\n- Problems associated with processing cloudy, missing, or noisy satellite imagery.\n- The contents and method of creation of the condensed dataset must be easily explainable to users.\nThe architecture of the database will reorganize spatially-oriented satellite imagery into temporally-oriented columns of data (a.k.a., “data rods”) to facilitate time-series analysis. The database itself is an open-source parallel database, designed to make full use of clustered server technologies. A demonstration of the system capabilities will be shown.\nApplications for this technology include quick-look views of the data, as well as the potential for on-board satellite processing of essential information, with the goal of reducing data latency.",

            "abstract": "Thanks to the great success of the coral microatoll technique for paleoseismology and paleogeodesy, as well as many recent ruptures, the Sumatran Sunda megathrust has emerged from obscurity to become one of the best-studied faults in the world. Though the reliable historical record is short compared to other areas such as Japan or South America, seismic cycle deformation with high spatial resolution has been reconstructed over multiple cycles based on coral records. This unique level of detail has revealed many complexities that would be difficult to discern using other methods. Some of these features may be specific to the Sumatran case, but it is likely that many other subduction megathrusts and other fault systems exhibit similar behaviors.\nThe low elevations of Holocene corals throughout the outer arc islands indicate little or no active permanent upper plate deformation, suggesting that the Sunda megathrust behaves almost purely elastically. At first order, the fault behavior is well-described by the classical model of fault segmentation with quasi-periodic characteristic ruptures along each segment. Two well-defined segment boundaries, barriers to rupture that persist over multiple seismic cycles, have been identified. However, within each segment there are potentially multiple fault asperities that may rupture individually or combine to form larger events. The Nias-Simeulue segment is relatively short and appears dominated by single end-to-end ruptures, while the longer Mentawai segment characteristically exhibits supercycles. In the supercycle case, each long interseismic period culminates in a temporal cluster of partially overlapping ruptures that in summation relieve stress over the entire segment. Each rupture sequence in our record evolved uniquely, likely indicating that fault slip is controlled by variations in fault frictional properties at spatial scales of ~100 km and temporal scales of a decade. The megathrust is also segmented along dip: the very shallow portions also occasionally rupture seismically, though less frequently than the primary seismogenic area. This patchwork of frictional properties, presumably rooted in structure and rheology along the fault interface, ultimately produces both the short-term rupture variability and the longer-term segmentation we observe.",

            "abstract": "Methane is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas. Although the global atmospheric methane budget is well constrained, the magnitude and trends of methane emissions from different source types and source regions are highly uncertain. Many studies have shown that bottom-up methane emission inventories are inconsistent with top-down approaches. China is the top emitter of greenhouse gases, and effective characterization of methane emissions is the key to cap Chinese carbon emissions by 2030. However, so far there have been very few top-down constraints on Chinese methane emissions at local to regional scales, due to a lack of in-situ measurements. In this study, mobile measurements of methane and other important tracers (NH3, CO2) were conducted on the North China Plain during the CAREBeijing/NCP campaigns in both 2013 and 2014. Simultaneous detection of multiple gas species provides chemical fingerprinting of methane emission sources. The high resolution (10 Hz) and large spatial coverage (5000 km) enable fine-grained mapping of methane concentrations over large area. Extended plumes with high methane mixing ratio (> 2.1 ppmv) were observed over the Beijing metropolitan area. Continuous mobile sampling over the 4th Ring Road in Beijing indicates that the urban background methane mixing ratio (1st percentile of each loop around the Ring Road) peaked at night due to the accumulation of emissions under the stable, shallow mixing layer. The on-road methane mixing ratio was 2.3±0.1 ppmv at noontime and 2.7±0.5 ppmv at night. To simulate atmospheric transport affecting the mobile measurement locations, we use a Lagrangian backward particle dispersion model (FLEXPART) driven by the WRF model with a nested spatial resolutions of 1 km near Beijing and 3 km in the entire North China Plain. Footprints given by FLEXPART-WRF and measurements of other tracers indicate that the Beijing urban area is a strong source of methane. Inverse methods will be applied to quantify and attribute the surface fluxes of methane on the North China Plain with a special focus on the Beijing metropolitan area.",

            "abstract": "Renewal processes, point prccesses in which intervals between consecutive events are independently and identically distributed, are frequently used to describe this repeating earthquake mechanism and forecast the next earthquakes. However, one of the difficulties in applying recurrent earthquake models is the scarcity of the historical data. Most studied fault segments have few, or only one observed earthquake that often have poorly constrained historic and/or radiocarbon ages. The maximum likelihood estimate from such a small data set can have a large bias and error, which tends to yield high probability for the next event in a very short time span when the recurrence intervals have similar lengths.\nOn the other hand, recurrence intervals at a fault depend on the long-term slip rate caused by the tectonic motion in average. In addition, recurrence times are also fluctuated by nearby earthquakes or fault activities which encourage or discourage surrounding seismicity. These factors have spatial trends due to the heterogeneity of tectonic motion and seismicity. Thus, this paper introduces a spatial structure on the key parameters of renewal processes for recurrent earthquakes and estimates it by using spatial statistics. Spatial variation of mean and variance parameters of recurrence times are estimated in Bayesian framework and the next earthquakes are forecasted by Bayesian predictive distributions. The proposal model is applied for recurrent earthquake catalog in Japan and its result is compared with the current forecast adopted by the Earthquake Research Committee of Japan.",

            "abstract": "Asymmetric effects of spring and autumn warming on the terrestrial carbon cycle in the northern Hemisphere has been generally documented, but the mechanisms behind this phenomenon remain highly uncertain. Soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition is controlled by microbe-derived extracellular enzymes (EEs), however, the environmental factors driving EE temperature sensitivity remains largely uncertain. This study is the first to explore whether early versus late growing seasons or soil factors play a bigger role in driving EEs temperature sensitivity in forest soils. We found that EEs temperature sensitivity was highly dependent of growing season and late growing (LG) season exhibited higher sensitivity than early growing (EG) season. The higher temperature sensitivity was consistent with the higher activation energy, which reflects low substrate availability in LG season. Growing season played a bigger role in changing soil physicochemical factors than elevation, but NH4+-N failed to show seasonal difference with a clear elevational pattern in the two seasons. LG season exhibited lower soil moisture and hot water extractable carbon than EG season, but was much higher in NO3-N and soil temperature. Our findings highlight next generation of earth system models should incorporate the seasonal discrepancy in temperature sensitivity of SOM enzymatic degradation to more accurately project future climate and carbon cycle feedbacks.",

            "abstract": "As a major component of an NSF-funded STEM program, a seminar-style course called the Catalyst Seminar was developed and offered over three consecutive semesters. The program included undergraduate students in the geosciences, computer science, mathematics and physics. The Catalyst Seminar was designed to expose scholars to the interdisciplinary research options and careers in these disciplines. The Seminar also provided a venue for scholars to meet regularly, build a sense of community and to engage in research projects that would enhance their preparation for multi and interdisciplinary careers in the sciences. The first semester of the Seminar was devoted to Exposure and Connections, accomplished through lectures by invited speakers on topics related to the disciplines participating in the Program. Scholars were required to read journal articles related to the lectures and to write a final short paper reflecting on the experience, all activities that are known to students at this level. Overall, this was a somewhat passive learning approach to research in classrooms. In the following two semesters a more active approach to engage students in interdisciplinary research was used. Students were asked to take ownership of their learning process through disciplinary and interdisciplinary engagement in a project. In one semester this process was guided by the seminar coordinator who was in charge of selecting and leading the ‘research project’ which although challenging to scholars, was ‘safe’ enough that answers were readily available. In the other semester the approach was student-centered, with a coordinator that merely facilitated the formation of interdisciplinary research teams that took complete charge of the entire research enterprise. I will discuss our observations and assessment of the outcomes of this instructional experience with relation to the teaching of geoscience, in particular to attracting students into this field.",

This study focuses on changes in the mean and the variability of the wind stress magnitude, the heat fluxes, the near surface temperature and the precipitation on meso-scale. The atmospheric and the ocean components of the coupled modeling system are the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) and the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) respectively. The ocean and the atmospheric models exchange data fields using the Model Coupling Toolkit (MCT). The ocean surface currents are passed to the atmospheric model for use in surface layer schemes to allow for the current to change the wind shear. The wind stress and heat fluxes computed by the WRF surface scheme are passed to the ocean model, which allows both models to use the same fluxes at the interface. The inclusion of the wind-current shear results in weaker surface stress over most of the Gulf of Mexico compared to the wind-alone estimate. Changes are also being found in the air-sea heat fluxes. The weekly averaged Latent Heat Flux (LHF) decreases by 1%~2% over most of the Gulf of Mexico by considering the currents effect, but localized LHF increases of ~10% are found in the Loop current. The sensible heat flux changes (> 5%) due to using the wind-current shear are found in the Loop Current as well as over the land. The air-sea heat fluxes associated with surface wind stress feedback onto the upper-ocean thermodynamics. The weekly mean SSTs increase over most of the Gulf of Mexico by using the wind-current shear, and significant increases (>0.2 K) are found next to the Loop Current and ocean eddies. However, the SSTs slightly decrease (~0.05 K) in the Loop Current.",

Baram1, M. Read1, D. Smart2, T. Harter1, J Hopmans1\n1Department of Land, Air & Water Resources University of California Davis\n2Department of Viticulture and Enology University of California Davis\nEstimates of water and fertilizer losses below the root zone of nitrogen (N) intensive agricultural orchard crops are major concern in groundwater protection. However, microscopic and macroscopic heterogeneity in unsaturated soils make accurate loss estimates very challenging. In this study we aimed to examine field scale variability in nitrate (NO3-) losses below the root zone (>250cm) of a 15 years old almond orchard in Madera county California. Based on a soil variability survey, tensiometers and solution samplers were installed at 17 locations around the 40 acre orchard. The hydraulic potential and the NO3- concentrations were monitored over two growing seasons. Nitrate concentrations varied spatially and temporarily, and ranged from below to more than 30 times higher than the drinking water contamination standard of >10 mg NO3--N L-1. Principal component analysis of the relations between the NO3- concentration, presence of a hard pan in the subsurface, its depth and thickness, and the fertigation and irrigation events indicated that none of these factors explained the observed variability in pore-water NO3- concentrations, with hard pan being the most dominant factor. Throughout the irrigation season minimal leaching was observed, yet post-harvest and preseason flooding events led to deep drainage. Due to the high spatial and temporal variability in the NO3- concentration and the potential for deep drainage following a wet winter or flooding event we conclude that the most efficient way to protect ground water is by transitioning to high frequency low nitrogen fertigation which would retain NO3-in the active root zone for longer time periods and thus enhance root absorption.",

Rapid rebuilding of the ~1 MeV electron population near geosynchronous during periods of strongly southward IMF BZ is well modeled by computing test-particle trajectories in MHD magnetospheric model fields. The build up of ~2 MeV electrons at lower L, observed by the Van Allen Probes, is also reproduced in the test-particle model. It is not known however to what extent adiabatic transport is sufficient to produce the observed multi-MeV flux enhancements in the outer belt. By comparing observations with model results, we can determine the inward extent and high energy limit of radiation belt rebuilding due to ULF driven radial transport alone. Results from case studies of several recent geomagnetic storms occurring in conjunction with recovery of the outer radiation belts will be presented.",

            "abstract": "There is increasing theoretical and empirical evidence, from the Apollo era and after, of volatiles deep in the lunar interior, in the crust and deeper, both hydrogen-rich and otherwise. This comes in the form of fire fountain samples from Apollo 15 and Apollo 17, of hydrated minerals excavated by impacts which reach the base of the lunar crust e.g., crater Bullialdus, of hydration of apatite and other minerals, as well as predictions of a water-concentrated layer along with the KREEP material at the base of the lunar crust. We discuss how the presence of these volatiles might be directly explored. In particular water vapor molecules percolating to the surface through lunar regolith might be expected to stick and freeze into the regolith, at depths of several meters depending on the regolith temperature profile, porosity and particle size distribution, quantities that are not well known beyond two meters depth. To explore these depths in the regolith we use and propose several modes of penetrating radar. We will present results using the SELENE/Kaguya's Lunar Sounding RADAR (LSR) to probe the bulk volatile dielectric and loss structure properties of the regolith in various locations, both within permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) and without, and within neutron suppression regions (NSRs) as traced by epithermal neutrons and without. We also propose installation of ground penetrating RADAR (GPR) on a roving lunar platform that should be able to probe between 0.2 and 1.6 GHz, which will provide a probe of the entire depth of the lunar regolith as well as a high-resolution (about 4 cm FWHM) probe of the upper meter or two of the lunar soil, where other probes of volatiles such as epithermal neutron absorption or drilling might be employed. We discuss predictions for what kinds of volatile density profiles might be distinguished in this way, and whether these will be detected from orbit as NSRs, whether these must be restricted to PSRs, and how these might appear in LSR measurements.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_2015_Poster_Final_Draft4.pdf\nSince its eruption in 1980, Mount St. Helens has experienced multiple inflation-deflation cycles associated with dome building eruptions. During the most recent dome-building episode, which spanned 2004 to 2008, GPS recorded the transition from pre-eruptive inflation to co-eruptive deflation and a final transition back to inflation. Such observations provide important constraints on the timing and mechanics of cyclic magma recharge and extrusion. Currently, the subtle surface deformation signal at St Helens is monitored primarily by ground based geodetic techniques like GPS. Satellite-based InSAR has the potential to substantially augment these techniques by providing spatially continuous, precise measurements of surface displacements, and may also reveal other volcanic or surficial processes too localized to be detected by ground based methods.\nTraditional interferometry is challenging to apply to volcanoes in the Cascades. Widespread phase decorrelation caused by persistent snow cover and dense vegetation, combined with large, elevation dependent atmospheric phase delays, mask or make deformation signals difficult to detect. By applying StaMPS, a Persistent Scatterers (PS) technique, phase decorrelation is mitigated by utilizing only the pixels with the highest, statistically derived, signal to noise ratio. However, atmospheric water vapor, which delays the radar signal, remains problematic, particularly on the volcano edifice. To assess the bias imposed by the atmosphere, we perform a series of sensitivity tests using a suite of methods including several that rely on the linear or power-law correlation of phase delay to topography and knowledge of the spatial scale of the signal. We also apply methods that calculate wet and dry phase delay from atmospheric reanalysis datasets such as ERA-Interim provided by the ECMWF. SAR data from the ERS, Envisat, and ALOS satellites, along with newer datasets, are processed with these tools to create a time series spanning nearly two decades at Mount St Helens. Our results indicate that any pre-eruptive inflation signal must be subtle, at or below the level of atmospheric noise. We also successfully identify scatterers on the edifice showing that InSAR has potential to complement GPS for monitoring near field volcanic deformation in the Cascades.",

These projections are potentially useful for driving regional-scale models needed for informing land-use and management interactions. Here, we applied global gridded RCP land-use projections within a regional-scale state-and-transition simulation model (STSM) projecting land-use change in the conterminous United States. First, we cross-walked RCP land-use transition classes to land-use classes more relevant for modeling at the regional scale. Coarse grid RCP land-use transition values were then downscaled to EPA Level III ecoregion boundaries using historical land-use transition data from the USGS Land Cover Trends (LCT) dataset. Downscaled transitions were aggregated to the ecoregion level. Ecoregions were chosen because they represent areas with consistent land-use patterns that have proven useful for studying land-use and management interactions. Ecoregion-level RCP projections were applied in a state-and-transition simulation model (STSM) projecting land-use change between 2005 and 2100 at the 1-km scale. Resulting RCP-based STSM projections were compared to STSM projections created using scenario projections from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) and the USGS LCT dataset. While most land-use trajectories appear plausible, some transitions such as forest harvest are unreasonable in the context of historical land-use patterns and the socio-economic drivers of change outlined for each scenario. This effort provides a method for using the RCP land-use projections in a wide range of regional scale models. However, further investigation is needed into the performance of RCP land-use projections at the regional scale.",

These include the 1960 M 9.5 Valdivia, 2010 M 8.8 Maule, and 2014 M 8.1 Iquique earthquakes. Slip heterogeneity for both the 2010 and 2014 earthquakes has been noted in various studies. In order to explore both spatial variations in the continued aftershocks of the 2010 event, and also seismicity to the north along Iquique prior to the 2014 earthquake relative to the high slip regions, we are expanding the catalog of small earthquakes using template matching algorithms to find other small earthquakes in the region. We start with an earthquake catalog developed from regional and local array data; these events provide the templates used to search through waveform data from a temporary seismic array in Malargue, Argentina, located ~300 km west of the Maule region, which operated in 2012. Our template events are first identified on the array stations, and we use a 10-s window around the P-wave arrival as the template. We then use a waveform cross-correlation algorithm to compare the template with day-long seismograms from Malargue stations. The newly detected events are then located using the HYPOINVERSE2000 program. Initial results for 103 templates on 19 of the array stations show that we find 275 new events ,with an average of three new events for each template correlated. For these preliminary results, events from the Maule region appear to provide the most new detections, with an average of ten new events. We will present our locations for the detected events and we will compare them to patterns of high slip along the 2010 rupture zone of the M 8.8 Maule earthquake and the 2014 M 8.1 Iquique event.",

Currently, the detection of ambient biological materials in real-time is mainly based on the presence of fluorophores in the particles. In this study, we present the wideband integrated bioaerosol spectrometer (WIBS) measurement results to characterize the fluorescent aerosol particles (FAP) at a polluted regional site (Xianghe, 39.80 °N, 116.96 °E) in the North China Plain. We observed substantially much higher number concentration of FAP as compared with those of previous studies in clean environments. We found the good agreement between the FAP number fraction in coarse mode particles (> 1 mm) and BC mass fraction in fine particles (< 1 mm), possibly indicating a majority of the observed FAP is to a certain extent related to the anthropogenic burning activities nearby. This interference and uncertainty should be especially noticed when performing fluorescence measurements in the polluted area, where the certain non-biological compounds (such as SOA, PAH and soot) may significantly lead to a positive fluorescence measurement artifacts and an overestimation of actual fluorescent biological aerosol particles. We also suggested to introduce the classification analysis of fluorescence spectral patterns from single FAP into the data analysis, which aims to reduce the potential misattribution and provide extra dimensions in the differentiation and identification of fluorescent aerosol particle.",

We analyzed the frequency and area burned on public lands by large (>1,000 acres) wildfires in Alaska over the time period 1950-2014. This analysis considered wildfire statewide and also on sub-regional levels. Over the period, the average number of wildfires each year has increased. The decadal average number of large wildfires each year shows a pronounced increase beginning in the 1990s with a doubling over the most recent two and a half decades compared to the first four. The area burned by all large wildfires shows no discernible trend, but removing the very large wildfires (> 50,000 acres) shows and overall increase in recent decades. The wildfire season in Alaska is now 40 percent longer overall than at the beginning of the study period. One sub-regional result is the Arctic region of Alaska appears to be experiencing an emerging large wildfire regime in recent decades that had been absent for perhaps thousands of years. We also look at the correlations between relevant climate factors (annual and sub-annual), such as temperature, precipitation, and Pacific Decadal Oscillation phase and wildfire behavior. Finally, we look at the wildfire trend dependence on choice of time frame and other wildfire data products, such as Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) that began in 1984.",

            "abstract": "Archean and Proterozoic komatiites and ferropicrites are mantle plume-related, low-viscosity, high-temperature, mafic to ultramafic lava flows. They are hosts to Ni-Cu±(PGE) sulphide mineralisation, which generally formed due to the segregation of sulphides following thermo-mechanical erosion and assimilation of sulphur-rich crustal rocks. We numerically simulated erosion and assimilation during the turbulent emplacement of iron-rich Martian lavas displaying chemical and rheological analogies with terrestrial mafic to ultramafic lavas, on a variety of basaltic and sedimentary sulphate-rich substratum. With the adoption of the lava flow and erosion model of Williams et al. (JGR, 1998), thermodynamic simulations were implemented to (semi-) quantify the potential changes in melt parameter (i.e., chemistry, temperature, and oxygen fugacity) that dictate the sulphur capacity of silicate melts. Modelling was also performed to assess the role of volatile degassing (Gaillard et al., SSR, 2013) on the sulphur inventory of Martian lavas.\nOur modelling show that lavas emplacing over basaltic crust are governed by low cooling rates, as well as low erosion and assimilation capacities, thus resulting in calculated near-cotectic proportions of sulphides segregating relatively late upon lava emplacement (usually > 100 km flow distance). The rapid assimilation of highly erodible and sulphate-rich Martian regolith may trigger sulphide supersaturation and batch segregation of sulphides well above cotectic proportions relatively early during the establishment of magmatic flow (<100 km flow distance). However, the assimilation of sulphate, which serves as a strongly oxidising agent, could result in dramatic sulphur loss due to increased volatile degassing rates. This process may limit or even counteract the overall positive effect of sulphate assimilation on achieving sulphide supersaturation, sulphide segregation and the genesis of Ni-Cu±(PGE) sulphide mineralisation.",

            "abstract": "Even though many basic properties of non-volcanic rifted margins are predicted by uniform extension of the lithosphere, uniform extension fails to explain other important characteristics. Particularly significant discrepancies are observed at: 1) the Iberia-Newfoundland conjugate margins (Type I), where large tracts of continental mantle lithosphere are exposed at the seafloor, and at; 2) ultra-wide central South Atlantic margins (Type II) where continental crust spans wide regions below which it appears that lower crust and mantle lithosphere were removed. Neither corresponds to uniform extension in which crust and mantle thin by the same factor. Instead, either the crust or mantle lithosphere has been preferentially removed during extension. We show that the Type I and II styles are respectively reproduced by dynamical numerical lithospheric stretching models (Models I-A/C and II-A/C) that undergo depth-dependent extension. In this notation A and C imply underplating of the rift zone during rifting by asthenosphere and lower cratonic lithosphere, respectively. We also present results for models with a weak upper crust and strong lower crust, Models III-A/C, to show that lower crust can also be removed from beneath the rift zone by horizontal advection with the mantle lithosphere. From the model results we infer that these Types I, II, and III margin styles are controlled by the strength of the mid/lower crust, which determines the amount of decoupling between upper and lower lithosphere during extension and the excision of crust or mantle. We also predict the styles of sedimentary basins that form on these margins as a test of the concepts presented.",

These pickup ions (PUIs) make up the dominant contribution to the plasma thermal energy in the heliosheath despite their small number density relative to the SW plasma. The separation of energy between thermal and pickup ions therefore significantly influences the width of the heliosheath. We present a multi-fluid MHD-neutral model of the heliosphere with PUIs treated as a separate ion fluid. The contribution of PUIs is adjusted both through source terms for charge exchange and through boundary conditions at the termination shock, taking into account reflection and transmission of ions at the shock. This approach allows us to decrease the heliosheath width in accordance with Voyager 1 observations. We present results of our numerical simulation of the time-dependent heliosphere. In particular, our previous solar cycle models are upgraded with a new approach and comparison is made both between one-ion- and two-ion-fluid models and with observational data. These results are aimed to improve our understanding of Voyager and IBEX observations through numerical modeling.",

Previous work in the watershed identified a difference in stream runoff north of the Maryland-Pennsylvania border (north) relative to that south of that border (south). Previous work also identified a temporal difference in runoff, with data from 1927 through 1969 (early) behaving differently than data from 1970 through 2012 (late). Spring center time (CT) of runoff or precipitation is defined as the flow-weighted timing or “center of mass” of water. We analyzed spring CT for 18 north watersheds (watershed areas of 303-62,418 km2) and nine south watersheds (watershed areas of 572-24,996 km2) and compared the results of the two time intervals. CT of runoff shifted by 1.4 days earlier in the north but 1.6 days later in the south during 1970-2012 relative to 1927-1969. In contrast, CT of precipitation shifted by 1.2 days (north) and 0.9 day (south) later for the same time intervals.\nThe percent of annual precipitation that fell as snow in the north was less in the later interval (56%) relative to the early interval (62%). In addition, air-temperature data for the north indicates that mean air temperature for January through May was warmer in the later interval (2.2 degrees C) relative to the early interval (2.0 degrees C). As a consequence of less snowfall and warmer air temperature in the north, CT of runoff has shifted to earlier in the season; had CT of precipitation not been later for the same time interval, CT of runoff likely would have been even earlier. In contrast, in the south, lacking the confounding influence of snowpack, CT of both runoff and precipitation has shifted to later in the season. These seasonal changes in the timing of precipitation and stream runoff have potential implications for aquatic biota and water quality in streams in the CB watershed.",

Here we obtain high resolution tremor locations by applying cross-station cross-correlations [Armbruster et al., 2014] to seismic data from the Meso-America Subduction Experiment deployment. A few 3-station detectors are adopted to capture detailed deformation styles in the tremor “transient zone” and the downdip “sweet spot” as defined in Frank et al., 2014. Similar to Cascadia, tremor activities in our study region were comprised mostly of short tremor bursts lasting minutes to hours. Many of these bursts show clear migration patterns with propagation velocities of hundreds of km/day, comparable to those in Cascadia. However, the propagation of the main tremor front was often not in a simple unilateral fashion. Before the 2006 SSE, we observe 4 large tremor episodes during which both the transient zone and the sweet spot participated, consistent with previous findings [Frank et al., 2014]. The transient zone usually became active a few days after the sweet spot. We find many along-dip migrations with recurrence intervals of about a half day within a region about 10 km along strike and 35 km along dip in the sweet spot, suggesting possible tidal modulation, after the main front moved beyond this region. These migrations appear not to originate at the main front, in contrast to tremor migrations from a few km to tens of km across observed in Cascadia [Rubin and Armbruster, 2013; Peng et al., 2015; Peng and Rubin, submitted], but possibly similar to Shikoku, Japan [Shelly et al., 2007]. We do not observe obvious half-day periodicity for the migrations farther downdip within the sweet spot. During the SSE, the recurrence interval of tremor episodes decreased significantly in both the transient zone and the sweet spot, with that of the former being much shorter. Within the sweet spot, the number of tremor events and the rupture area of each episode also decreased relative to the large pre-SSE episodes. The updip portion of the sweet spot often became active before the downdip portion, consistent with loading from farther updip where the slow slip was concentrated. In contrast, the pre-SSE episodes generally originated farther downdip.",

The Ashokan reservoir is one of 6 surface water reservoirs that constitute about 90% of New York City’s drinking water supply. This study quantified turbidity levels and SSCs at 10 locations throughout the upper Esopus Creek watershed for 3 years prior to the implementation of 2 stream stabilization projects and for 18 months after the projects were completed. More than 93 percent of the total-suspended sediment load occurred on days with flows greater than or equal to the 90th percentile of flows observed during the study period. Discharge, SSC, and turbidity were strongly related at the outlet of the upper Esopus Creek, but not at every monitoring site. In general, relations between discharge and SSC and turbidity were strongest at sites with high SSCs, with the exception of Stony Clove Creek, the largest tributary. Stony Clove Creek, consistently produced higher SSCs and turbidity than any of the other Esopus Creek tributaries. Nonetheless, there was not a strong relation between either turbidity or SSC and discharge because there was a series of eroding banks in contact with fine grained glacio-lacustrine deposits and associated hill slope failures within the Stony Clove Creek watershed that delivered elevated turbidity and SSCs to the stream during all flow conditions. Stream bank stabilization projects were completed at two of the largest bank failures. After the projects were completed there was decrease in stream SSC and turbidity however, flows during the 18 months following the projects were lower than before the projects. Nevertheless, a shift in the SSC and turbidity discharge rating curves suggests that the stream stabilization projects resulted in lower turbidity levels and SSCs for similar discharge conditions as compared to before the projects thereby reducing sediment yields within the watershed as a result of those projects.",

            "abstract": "The New Horizons spacecraft was launched in 2006, passed Jupiter and its magnetotail, took continuous measurements in the solar wind throughout the recent years, and flew by Pluto in July 2015. The onboard PEPSSI instrument measures ion and electron intensities, masses, and energies in the keV to MeV range. The closest approach distance to Pluto was 11 Pluto radii, inside the orbit of Charon. Data taken near Pluto is downlinked throughout August. We will present analysis of this data and set it into context with previous measurements.\nWe expect a number of interesting particle structures around Pluto. Parts of Pluto’s molecular nitrogen atmosphere is escaping and will co-orbit with Pluto, potentially forming a partial gas torus. This torus can be additionally sourced by other Kuiper belt objects. The neutrals are eventually ionized and pick-up by the solar wind brings them into the PEPSSI energy range. The measured ion densities can be used to constrain the Pluto torus.\nPluto is not expected to have an intrinsic magnetic field, but the energetic particle data can be used to infer its properties, if any. Pluto interacts instead with the solar wind via the pick-up of its ions and the magnetic fields created by currents in its ionosphere. The relative role of these mechanisms can be revealed by the flyby data and directly compared to data that was taken at Jupiter with identical instrumentation.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Poster.pdf\nNASA's New Horizons mission successfully made its closest approach to Pluto on July 14, 2015, at 11:49A.M. UTC. The flyby nature of the mission, distance to the system, and multiple planetary bodies to observe with a diverse instrument set required a complex imaging campaign marked by numerous trade-offs; these lead to a more complicated crater population mapping than a basic orbital mission. The Pluto and Charon imaging campaigns were full-disk or mosaics of the full disk until ≈3.5 hrs before closest approach when the pixel scale was 0.9 km/px. After this, several LORRI-specific imaging campaigns were conducted of the partial disk and later the full crescent, while additional strips were ride-alongs with other instruments. These should supply partial coverage at up to 70–80 m/px for Pluto and 160 m/px for Charon. The LORRI coverage at ≈0.4 km/px does not cover the entire encounter hemisphere, but the MVIC instrument provided comparable full-disk coverage (0.5 km/px) and partial disk at 0.3 km/px. The best images of the non-encounter hemispheres of Pluto and Charon are ≈21 km/px (taken midnight July 10-11). As with any single flyby mission, we are constrained by the best pixel scales and incidence angles at which images were taken during the flyby. While most high-resolution imaging by quantity has been done over areas of variable solar incidence as the spacecraft passed by Pluto and Charon, these cover a relatively small fraction of the bodies and most coverage has been at near-noon sun which makes crater identification difficult. Numerous team members are independently using a variety of crater mapping tools and image products, which will be reconciled and merged to make a more robust final database. We will present our consensus crater database to-date of both plutonian and charonian impact craters as well as correlations with preliminary geologic units. We will also discuss how the crater population compares with predictions and modeled Kuiper Belt Object size-frequency distributions.",

            "abstract": "As trees extract water from a wide variety of potential subsurface reservoirs and transpire it into the forest boundary layer they link Earth and atmosphere and influence the critical zone (CZ). In seasonally dry climates there is growing evidence that some tree species derive their primary source of water from a deep weathered bedrock reservoir below the soil and saprolite while other species use a wide range of water sources in a more opportunistic manner. As trees extract water from these different sources they can change the behavior of stream baseflow, recharge dynamics in both the subsurface and streams, and impact water availability for evapotranspiration (ET). Each of these changes in turn change the site-specific hydrological balance in very different ways as well as the nature of how well buffered the CZ is in response to climate and climate change. I will present examples from the Critical Zone Observatory network on (1) where different tree species derive their water in the CZ ranging from less that a meter deep to many tens of meters deep, (2) how this compares to the diversity of known water reservoirs in the subsurface from the surface of the Earth to fresh bedrock, (3) how this impacts baseflow and recharge dynamics of the CZ, and (4) how the manner and magnitude of tree water use can feedback and feed forward to change local climate and the strength of the linkages between Earth and atmosphere as modulated by trees in the critical zone.",

Dune plants are uniquely adapted to the harsh coastal environment, and are able to tolerate high temperature, drought, salt spray, and burial by sand. Accurate modeling of coastal dunes relies on understanding how coastal plants respond to these stresses, and how the dune building feedback is modified as a result. We use two years of data from an experimental planting on Hog Island, VA, USA to parameterize a logistic growth model that explicitly includes the effects of plant burial on three species of common dune plants on the US East Coast: Spartina patens, Ammophila breviligulata, and Uniola paniculata. We couple this new plant growth model to the Coastal Dune Model of Durán and Moore (2013). Using this enhanced model we explore the consequences of plant sensitivity to burial on coastal dune growth. These results will add to the growing literature on coupled vegetation and sand transport models, specifically the modeling of coastal dunes.",

            "abstract": "Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and wetlands represent the largest natural source of methane to the atmosphere. However, much of the methane generated in anoxic wetlands never gets emitted to the atmosphere; up to >90% of generated methane can get oxidized to carbon dioxide. Thus, oxidation is an important methane sink and changes in the rate of methane oxidation can affect wetland methane emissions. Most methane is aerobically oxidized at oxic–anoxic interfaces where rates of oxidation strongly depend on methane and oxygen concentrations. In wetlands, oxygen is often the limiting substrate. To improve understanding of belowground oxygen dynamics and its impact on methane oxidation, we deployed two planar optical oxygen sensors in a thermokarst bog in interior Alaska. Previous work at this site indicated that, similar to other sites, rates of methane oxidation decrease over the growing season. We used the sensors to track spatial and temporal patterns of oxygen concentrations over the growing season. We coupled these in-situ oxygen measurements with periodic oxygen injection experiments performed against the sensor to quantify belowground rates of oxygen consumption. We found that over the season, the thickness of the oxygenated water layer at the peatland surface decreased. Previous research has indicated that in sphagnum-dominated peatlands, like the one studied here, rates of methane oxidation are highest at or slightly below the water table. It is in these saturated but oxygenated locations that both methane and oxygen are available. Thus, a seasonal reduction in the thickness of the oxygenated water layer could restrict methane oxidation. The decrease in thickness of the oxygenated layer coincided with an increase in the rate of oxygen consumption during our oxygen injection experiments. The increase in oxygen consumption was not explained by temperature; we infer it was due to an increase in substrate availability for oxygen consuming reactions and/or abundance of key microbial populations. Together, the data provide an explanation for the seasonal decrease in methane oxidation: rates of oxygen consumption increase over the season, which decreases the amount of oxygen dissolved in porewater at the peatland surface and reduces rates of methane oxidation.",

            "abstract": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) is currently the third most important greenhouse gases (GHG) after methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Global N2O emission increased substantially primarily due to reactive nitrogen (N) enrichment through fossil fuel combustion, fertilizer production, and legume crop cultivation etc. In order to understand how climate system is perturbed by anthropogenic N2O emissions from the terrestrial biosphere, it is necessary to better estimate the pre-industrial N2O emissions. Previous estimations of natural N2O emissions from the terrestrial biosphere range from 3.3-9.0 Tg N2O-N yr−1. This large uncertainty in the estimation of pre-industrial N2O emissions from the terrestrial biosphere may be caused by uncertainty associated with key parameters such as maximum nitrification and denitrification rates, half-saturation coefficients of soil ammonium and nitrate, N fixation rate, and maximum N uptake rate. In addition to the large estimation range, previous studies did not provide an estimate on preindustrial N2O emissions at regional and biome levels. In this study, we applied a process-based coupled biogeochemical model to estimate the magnitude and spatial patterns of pre-industrial N2O fluxes at biome and continental scales as driven by multiple input data, including pre-industrial climate data, atmospheric CO2 concentration, N deposition, N fixation, and land cover types and distributions. Uncertainty associated with key parameters is also evaluated. Finally, we generate sector-based estimates of pre-industrial N2O emission, which provides a reference for assessing the climate forcing of anthropogenic N2O emission from the land biosphere.",

            "abstract": "From 1930 through 2012 Louisiana lost approximately 1,880 sq mi (4,870 sq km) of coastal wetlands due to land subsidence, erosion, and sea level rise among other factors. Louisiana could potentially lose an additional 1,750 sq mi (4,530 sq km) of coastal wetlands by 2062 if no action is taken to prevent this land loss (CPRA, 2012). If risk is defined as probability multiplied by consequence (Vrijling, 2006), such land loss will significantly increase the risk of flooding in coastal communities and communities located farther inland. Vital coastal infrastructure will also be at a heightened risk of flood damage. This will be attributable to the increase in frequency of hurricane storm surge events featuring greater depths and farther inland extent. This risk can be described by contrasting the surface area of land and water along the Louisiana coast. Using aerial or satellite imagery, isopleths can be plotted along the coast that describe the land to water (L:W) ratio over time (e.g., Gagliano et al., 1970, 1971 plotted the calculated 50% L:W ratio isopleths for the years 1930, and 1970, with an estimated 2000 isopleth). Risk to coastal infrastructure and coastal communities increases as the L:W ratio is reduced.\nOne possible way to reduce the depth and extent of storm surge is to increase the land area along the coast. A second way is to modify the land cover (i.e. vary the type and density of vegetation). The L:W ratio can be used to quantify storm surge attenuation and assess such contributing factors. For this study, storm surge is simulated along coastal Louisiana for various instances – with increased land area and separately with different land cover types and densities – to determine which of these factors most effectively reduce the depth and extent of storm surge. New metrics involving hydrologic basins for evaluating storm surge attenuation are also described. The results of this study should inform policy makers which factors contribute the most to storm surge attenuation and risk reduction along the Louisiana coast.",

            "abstract": "In the last decade, it has been possible to better understand the impact of agricultural human practices on the global environmental change at different spatial (from local to global) and time (from seasonal to decadal) scales. This has been achieved thanks to: big dataset continuously acquired by Earth Observation (EO) satellites; the improved capabilities of remote sensing techniques in extracting valuable information from the EO datasets; the new EO data policy which allowed unrestricted data usage; the net technologies which allowed to quickly and easily share national, international and market-derived information; an increasingly performing computing technology which allows to massively process large amount of data easier and at decreasing costs.\nTo better understand the environmental impacts of agriculture and to monitor the consequences of human agricultural activities on the biosphere, scientists require to better identify crops and monitor crop conditions over time and space. Traditionally, NDVI time series maps derived from optical sensors have been used to this aim. As well-known this important source of information is conditioned by cloud cover.\nUnlike passive systems, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ones are almost insensitive to atmospheric influences; thus, they are especially suitable for crop identification and condition monitoring. Among the other SAR systems currently in orbit, the Italian Space Agency (ASI) COSMO Sky-Med® (CSK®) constellation (X-band, frequency 9.6 GHz, wavelength 3.1 cm), especially for its peculiar high revisit capability (up to four images in 16 days with same acquisition geometry) seems to be particular suitable for providing information in addition and/or in alternative to other optical EO systems.\nTo assess the capability of the CSK® constellation in identifying crops and in monitoring crops condition in 2013 ASI started the “AGRICIDOT” project. Some of the main project achievements will be presented at the congress.",

            "abstract": "The distribution of cloud phase determines a multitude of cloud properties, such as albedo, precipitation and temporal evolution. The crucial role of primary ice formation has been recognized decades ago, yet only in the last years our knowledge has reached a level that allows for approximate estimations of the aerosol-dependent effect of ice nucleation in high resolution cloud simulations. However, besides primary formation of cloud particles, also their thermodynamic trajectories as well as particle-particle interactions are determinants of the cloud phase. Although the conversion of liquid to ice in the mixed-phase regime is unidirectional, a perturbation in the primary ice formation (with increased aerosol concentrations as a trigger) does not necessarily yield higher ice fractions. This can be attributed to the modified efficiencies of depositional particle growth, liquid-ice-collisions and particle sedimentation. Consequently a modified mixed-phase regime impacts both warm (T>0°C) and cold (T<-40°C) parts of the atmosphere by sedimentation and vertical advection, respectively.\nOur study is motivated by the question how the liquid-ice partitioning is modulated by perturbed ice nuclei concentrations. By suppressing the feedback of microphysical perturbations on the model dynamics we are able to extract the microphysical effects. We define different microphysical regimes based on liquid and ice mass changes in order to analyze the processes which have led to those regimes. We find that conversion via the vapor phase is dominant only in distinct temperature regimes, while liquid mass changes are often linked to riming-dominated regimes, and sedimentation efficiencies make an important contribution to ice mass changes which finally determine the surface precipitation via melting. For our case of deep convection, cloud albedo is highly sensitive to the amount of small droplets reaching the homogeneous freezing level.\nWe investigated simulations of three-dimensional, idealized, single convective clouds as well as limited area model simulations with different cloud types on larger scales. The results are based on the COSMO-ART model (Vogel et al., 2009) and an extended version of the two-moment cloud microphysics scheme based on Seifert and Beheng (2006).",

            "abstract": "Two decades of satellite observations have documented substantial mass loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet in response to ocean- and atmospheric-driven melting. During this period, ice mass has fluctuated over a range of timescales, from seasonal cycles in surface melt to decadal and longer responses to the surrounding climate. Mass loss is also highly variable in space, as a result of the distinct geometries and boundary conditions of different glaciological catchments. Resolving changes in ice sheet mass at both a high spatial resolution and temporal sampling frequency is necessary for understanding the timescales and drivers of glaciological change, but has remained a challenge for all satellite geodetic techniques. While radar altimetry has the potential to sample elevation change at a high (~ monthly) temporal frequency and with moderate (~ 5 km) spatial resolution, observations of Greenland Ice Sheet elevation change and mass balance have been challenging because of the kilometer scale resolution of pulse limited elevation measurements and the impact of highly variable snowpack conditions upon the backscattered echo. In this study we investigate the ability of CryoSat to derive estimates of Greenland Ice Sheet elevation change. We use an along-track approach to map ice sheet elevation changes between 2011 and 2014 and evaluate our results using ICEBridge airborne altimetry. Particular attention is given to the influence of changing snowpack conditions on the received echo, and the impact of the extensive 2012 summer melt event on the derived estimates of surface elevation change.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_Poster_2015_ARCTIC_Fuyao_steve.pdf\nThe large-scale atmospheric circulation aloft is the dominant driver of surface weather conditions, including extreme weather events. Many previous studies have related extreme weather to the large-scale atmospheric circulation. Here, we analyzed the behavior of mid-tropospheric geopotential heights in order to understand trends in extreme weather events. Daily fields of 500 hPa geopotential height, surface air temperature and precipitable water from the NCEP-NCAR Reanalysis I were used over the greater North American study region (20°N – 90°N, 140°W – 40°W). For each grid point and each day of the year, an extreme high (low) event is defined when the geopotential height is above (below) the 95th (5th) percentile of values for that day during the time period from January 1948 to December 2014. Extreme temperature and precipitable-water events were defined the same way. The temporal and spatial variability of the area covered by extremely high and low geopotential heights were then analyzed.\nGenerally, the area covered by extremely high (low) geopotential heights increases (decreases) with time, and the strongest trend is in summer (JJA). The time series of extremely high geopotential heights also shows a clear regime shift around years 1963, 1977 and 1999, while that of extremely low geopotential heights shows clear regime shifts around 1977 and 1999.\nThe time series of extreme geopotential height extent correlates significantly with that of extreme temperature and precipitable water. For example, the recent trend toward drought conditions in California is consistent with more extreme ridging and less extreme troughing along the West Coast since 1999. We also find that the recent increase in the coverage of extremely inflated heights is most pronounced over the mid-latitudes (south of 40oN), which is consistent with a positive regional trend in hot, moist weather conditions.",

            "abstract": "Earth's core is composed of iron with the inclusion of light elements to compensate for the difference between seismically obtained densities and the density of pure Fe at relevant pressure and temperature conditions. As the most abundant and lightest element in the solar system, hydrogen is a plausible contributor to this core density deficit. Nearly stoichiometric iron hydride (FeHx) has been shown to result from the reaction of Fe and hydrous silicates, and is stable up to at least 80 GPa [1]. Iron hydride formation at Earth’s surface is unlikely because the equilibrium hydrogen solubility in iron at atmospheric conditions is prohibitively low, yet as hydrogen solubility increases with pressure, so does the likelihood of FeHx formation within the Earth’s interior [2]. Recent experimental and ab initio attempts disagree on the equation of state parameters needed to describe the compressional behavior of FeHx [3-5]. The work presented here combines synchrotron x-ray diffraction of laser-heated diamond anvil cell compressed samples with high-pressure, ambient temperature nuclear resonant inelastic scattering (NRIXS) and synchrotron Mössbauer spectroscopy (SMS) to better constrain the behavior of the fcc phase of FeHx at elevated pressures and temperatures. By pairing P-V-T data for iron hydride with the sound velocity information available through high-pressure NRIXS studies, we can better understand the degree to which hydrogen may contribute to the density deficit of Earth’s iron core.

Our ability to validate the ionospheric models is limited by the lack of point measurements and those measurements that essentially constitute characterization of horizontal gradients. In this talk, we discuss and demonstrate the use of various types of crowd-sourced information that enables us to extend our coverage over these regions. We will discuss new sources of these data, concepts for new experiments and the use of these data in assimilative models.

Interpreting the distribution of total column BrO between the stratosphere and troposphere depends strongly on the contribution of very short lived (VSL) bromocarbons to stratospheric inorganic bromine (Bry). Salawitch et al.

Additionally, we will assess how modifications to kinetics regulating the partitioning between BrO and BrONO2 proposed by Kreycy et al.

Since these clouds are linked to the surface through fluxes of heat, moisture, and aerosols, they are quite sensitive to the large seasonal variability in meteorology and biology that tend to drive large swings in seasonal aerosol concentrations, cloud condensation nuclei concentrations, and cloud droplet number concentrations. The A-Train has created a reliable and long-term measurement data record of these clouds that includes vertical profiles of radar reflectivity and microwave brightness temperature from CloudSat and solar reflectances from MODIS. We are examining this data record for seasonal swings in cloud properties that are obvious in the measurements. In addition we have implemented a unique cloud and precipitation property retrieval algorithm that allows us to examine, for instance, the covariance of the albedo and precipitation susceptibility as a function of season. We are finding that the measurements support the idea of large seasonal oscillations in cloud properties.",

LAI is a key parameter of vegetation in characterizing interactions of energy and mass between the Earth's surface and atmosphere. On the other hand, MAIAC BRF is retrieved from a new atmospheric correction algorithm, which has higher spatial resolution and is believed to have more reliable cloud/aerosol detection technique than standard MODIS BRF product. Two main objectives of this study are: 1). Maintaining the radiative transfer theory based LAI algorithm’s look up table (LUT) unchanged, to compare LAI product retrieved from different versions of BRF products (MODIS collection 5, collection 6 and MAIAC); 2). To adjust the LUT to resolve LAI’s possible systematic discrepancies resulting from atmospheric correction methods within the input BRF other than our LAI algorithm. Before the LUT adjusting, comparing to standard MODIS products shows that MAIAC LAI product will overestimate among herbaceous biome types which have low LAI values, while underestimate among woody biome types which have relatively higher values. Based on the theory of radiative transfer of canopy spectral invariants, two biome and MAIAC specific configurable parameters (Single Scattering Albedo and Uncertainty) in the LUT are adjusted to minimize the inconsistency due to input BRFs. Experiments shows that our new result: 1). has good agreement with field measured data (e.g. DIRECT); 2) is consistent with standard MODIS LAI product.",

            "abstract": "The South Yellow Sea (SYS) is located along the boundary between the North China Block (NCB) and the South China Block (SCB). Hence, studying the geologic structure of the SYS is significant for understanding the collision process between the NCB and SCB and for exploring natural resources in the region. The South Yellow Sea is composed of four main geologic units: the Qianliyan Uplift Zone, the Northern Basin, the Central Uplift Zone, and the Southern Basin. To interpret the basin structure of the SYS, the density and the basement depth were inverted using regional gravity and magnetic data. Due to the low resolution of the gravity and magnetic data, there are much uncertainties in the detail branches, distribution and mechanisms of the faults in the South Yellow Sea. In this study, we interpreted the major faults and their branches in SYS using a wide angle seismic profile data. The interpreted faults are mapped onto the gravity and magnetic maps to further constrain the interpretation of major faults. The result shows that the South Yellow Sea Basin was initiated and controlled by a serial of strike-slip faults. Those faults were generated at the time when the SCB and NCB collided with each other, and were re-activated at the time when the Pacific Plate subducted beneath the East Asia. Our approach of jointly interpreting seismic, gravity and magnetic data is applicable for better delineation of the crustal structure in other regions.",

            "abstract": "Arctic warming has sparked a growing interest because of its possible impacts on mid-latitude climate. A number of unusually harsh cold winters have occurred in many parts of East Asia and North America in the past few years, and observational and modelling studies have suggested that atmospheric variability linked to Arctic warming might have played a central role. Here we identify two distinct influences of Arctic warming which may lead to cold winters over East Asia or North America, based on observational analyses and extensive climate model results. We find that severe winters across East Asia are associated with anomalous warmth in the Barents–Kara Sea region, whereas severe winters over North America are related to anomalous warmth in the East Siberian–Chukchi Sea region. Each regional warming over the Arctic Ocean is accompanied by the local development of an anomalous anticyclone and the downstream development of a mid-latitude trough. The resulting northerly flow of cold air provides favourable conditions for severe winters in East Asia or North America. These links between Arctic and mid-latitude weather are also robustly found in idealized climate model experiments and CMIP5 multi-model simulations. We suggest that our results may help improve seasonal prediction of winter weather and extreme events in these regions.",

            "abstract": "Drought in Algeria is a recurring phenomenon and prolonged dry condition exerts a significant impact on local society. For instance, the most recent (1999-2002) drought, as part of a widespread drying in N-Hemisphere, brought this country considerable loss in regards to water resource and agricultural yields. A comprehensive understanding of past climate anomaly is relevant to predicting and mitigating future climate change effects. A few high-resolution well-dated paleoclimate records were recently established using speleothems in the Central and E-Mediterranean basin, but the scarcity of such records in W-Mediterranean prevents us from correlating past climate evolutions across the basin. Besides, climate deteriorations have long been argued to be linked with past cultural disruptions. However, in many cases such linkage is equivocal, in part due that existing climatic evidence has been derived from areas outside the distribution of ancient settlements, leading to uncertainty from complex spatial heterogeneity in both climate and demography. Here we present the first decadal-resolution Mid-Holocene climate proxy records from the W-Mediterranean basin based on the stable carbon and oxygen isotopes analyses of two U/Th dated stalagmites from the Gueldaman GLD1 Cave, N-Algeria. Comparing our records with those from Italy and Israel reveals synchronous (multi) centennial dry phases centered at ca. 5600 yr BP, ca. 5200 yr BP and ca. 4200 yr BP across the Mediterranean. New radiocarbon dating from this study well constrains the age of anthropogenic deposits (e.g., faunal remains, pottery, charcoal) excavated inside the cave. In-situ comparisons of evidence of climate and cultural change show that the timing of a prolonged drought at ca. 4400-3800 yr BP blankets the onset of cave abandonment shortly after ca. 4400 cal yr BP, supporting the hypothesis that a climate anomaly may have played a role in this cultural disruption.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between temperature and the updip limit of seismicity has been demonstrated for accretionary margins where the incoming sediment is thick relative to basement relief (e.g., Oleskevich et al., JGR 1999). Here we show an example offshore the Osa Peninsula where this relationship does not appear to hold. At this non-accreting margin, the incoming sediment thickness is thin and the basement relief is substantial. The MW 6.4, 16 June 2002, Osa, Costa Rica earthquake occurred along the plate interface, 25 km landward of the trench at a depth of approximately 5-10 km (Arroyo et al., G3, 2014). Two-dimensional thermal models indicate that the temperature at this position is approximately 70-90° C (Harris et al., G3, 2010), and is cooler than the reported correlation between temperature and the updip limit of seismicity. We estimate the incoming fluid budget based on the 100 m section from the Costa Rica Seismogenesis Project reference site (IODP Exp. 334 Site U1381) using porosity and bulk mineral assemblage based on X-ray diffraction analysis of core samples. The porosity (76%) combined with the water content in smectite (~40 vol.%) and biogenic silica (~24 vol.%), leads to a total sedimentary water influx estimate of 6.9 m3/yr per m of trench length. The dehydration source term is calculated with respect to silica diagenesis and clay diagenesis using the thermal model. Peak mineral dehydration occurs at temperatures of approximately ~100 °C, 40-30 km landward of the trench and 5-10 km landward of the shallowest seismicity (Arroyo et al., G3, 2014). These results suggest that in this region the presence of subducting bathymetric relief may be more important in influencing the updip extent of seismicity than the thermal regime. This interpretation is consistent with the observed patchy seismicity (Bilek et al. Geology, 2003) and emphasizes the importance of frictional heterogeneities along the subduction thrust (Bilek and Lay, GRL, 2002).",

            "abstract": "UNAVCO, a non-profit, university consortium that supports geoscience research using geodesy, began with the ingenious recognition that the nascent Global Positioning System constellation (GPS) could be used to investigate earth processes. The consortium purchased one of the first commercially available GPS receivers, Texas Instrument’s TI-4100 NAVSTAR Navigator, in 1984 to measure plate deformation. This early work was highlighted in a technology magazine, GPSWorld, in 1990. Over a 30-year period, UNAVCO and the community have helped advance instrument design for mobility, flexibility, efficiency and interoperability, so research could proceed with higher precision and under ever challenging conditions. Other innovations have been made in data collection, processing, analysis, management and archiving. These innovations in tools, methods and data have had broader impacts as they have found greater utility beyond research for timing, precise positioning, safety, communication, navigation, surveying, engineering and recreation.\nInnovations in research have expanded the utility of geodetic tools beyond the solid earth science through creative analysis of the data and the methods. For example, GPS sounding of the atmosphere is now used for atmospheric and space sciences. GPS reflectrometry, another critical advance, supports soil science, snow science and ecological research. Some research advances have had broader impacts for society by driving innovations in hazards risk reduction, hazards response, resource management, land use planning, surveying, engineering and other uses. Furthermore, the geodetic data is vital for the design of space missions, testing and advancing communications, and testing and dealing with interference and GPS jamming. We will discuss three decades (and counting) of advances by the National Science Foundation’s premiere geodetic facility, consortium and some of the many geoscience principal investigators that have driven innovations in research, instrumentation, data management, cyberinfrastructure and other applications.",

Light rail vehicles present advantages as a measurement platform, including the absence of in-situ fossil fuel emissions, repeated transects across a urban region that provides both spatial and temporal information, and relatively low operating costs.

Playas are typically crusted and the shape of these crusts changes through time. Here we show examples of playa crusts monitored by terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) over hours, days, months and years, detecting changes of up to 30 mm/week. This modifies the aerodynamic roughness by as much as 3 mm/week which can change dust emission potential by 350%. Along with surface elevation, we also use TLS to infer relative surface moisture patterns. This novel use of TLS enables the detection of feedbacks between surface roughness, moisture and pattern development. During periods of low temperature and high relative humidity (typically winter evenings), atmospheric, subsurface and surface interactions lead to changes in inter-pore moisture which help to modify roughness, particularly where polygonal ridges have been initiated. On closed, flat surfaces or during warmer spring conditions, these changes are less noticeable. The high resolution and moisture sensitive capabilities of TLS enable us to identify these interactions and feedbacks for the first time.",

            "abstract": "Conceptual models predicting the geometry and evolution of normal fault arrays are vital to assess rift physiography, syn-rift sediment dispersal and seismic hazard. Observations from data-rich rifts and numerical and physical models underpin widely used fault array models predicting: i) during rift initiation, arrays are defined by multiple, small, isolated faults; ii) as rifting progresses, strain localises onto fewer larger structures; and iii) with continued strain, faulting migrates toward the rift axis, resulting in rift narrowing. Some rifts display these characteristics whereas others do not. Here we present several case studies documenting fault migration patterns that do not fit this ideal. In this presentation we will begin by reviewing existing fault array models before presenting a series of case studies (including from the northern North Sea and the Gulf of Corinth), which document fault migration patterns that are not predicted by current fault evolution models. We show that strain migration onto a few, large faults is common in many rifts but that, rather than localising onto these structures until the cessation of rifting, strain may ‘sweep’ across the basin. Furthermore, crustal weaknesses developed in early tectonic events can cause faults during subsequent phases of extension to grow relatively quickly and accommodate the majority if not all of the rift-related strain; in these cases, strain migration does not and need not occur. Finally, in salt-influenced rifts, strain localisation may not occur at all; rather, strain may become progressively more diffuse due to tilting of the basement and intrastratal salt décollements, thus leading to superimposition of thin-skinned, gravity-driven and thick-skinned, plate-driven, basement-involved extension. We call for the community to unite to develop the next-generation of normal fault array models that include complexities such as the thermal and rheological properties of the lithosphere, specific regional tectonic boundary conditions, crustal weaknesses and intrastratal rheology variations. Only then will we be able to make accurate assessments of tectono-stratigraphic setting and seismic hazard for a particular rift with a particular set of boundary conditions and parameters.",

            "abstract": "Axial seamount is the most active volcanic feature on the Juan de Fuca Ridge having previously erupted in 1998 and 2011. In 2014, the Ocean Observatories Initiative installed a multidisciplinary, cabled observatory on Axial seamount that includes a compact network of 7 seismometers spanning the southern half of the summit caldera with another seismometer located at the base of the volcano. Real-time data from the seismic network has been archived at the IRIS Data Management Center from mid-November 2014. We have implemented an automated algorithm to detect earthquakes, pick P and S wave phases, determine hypocenters and estimate magnitudes. Over 5 months to mid-April earthquake rates increased from an average of ~100 per day to >500 per day. Most of the earthquakes were small (MW ≤ 1.5) and occurred in swarms beneath the east and west walls of the caldera at depths clustering around 1.5 km. On April 23, 2015 at 1700-2100 GMT there was a sizeable swarm of earthquakes near the east wall of the caldera with most activity north of the network. The main seismic crisis, which coincided with ~2 m of deflation at the center of the caldera (Nooner et al., this meeting), commenced at 0500 GMT on April 24. For the first 2 hours epicenters were confined near the east wall north of the network. The southern limit of seismicity then migrated ~3 km south over one hour to beneath the network where very high levels of seismicity (~500 per hour) persisted until 1500 GMT. During the seismic crisis, the caldera seismometers were swamped by nearby earthquakes, including ~100 per hour with MW ≥ 2; additional analysis is required to determine if seismicity also migrated outside the caldera. In the following weeks, earthquake rates beneath the caldera decreased to <10 per day. An exciting discovery during this period was the detection of a large number of impulsive water borne signals, each comprising a train of water column multiples with arrival times consistent with sound sources on the seafloor 15-20 km to the north of the network. These events commenced at the end of the seismic crisis, peaked at a rate of >2000 per day on April 26 and continued at decreasing levels until mid-May. Recent seafloor mapping and observations have confirmed that these impulsive events mark the site of an eruption on the north rift of the volcano (Kelley et al., this meeting).",

            "abstract": "It has long been appreciated that chemical interactions have a major effect on rock porosity and permeability evolution and may alter the behavior or performance of both natural and engineered reservoir systems. Such reaction-induced permeability evolution is of particular importance for geological CO2 sequestration and storage associated with enhanced oil recovery. In this study we used a three-dimensional Darcy scale reactive transport model to simulate CO2 core flood experiments in which the CO2-equilibrated brine was injected into dolostone cores collected from the Arbuckle carbonate reservoir, Wellington, Kansas. Heterogeneous distributions of macro pores, fractures, and mineral phases inside the cores were obtained from X-ray computed microtomography (XCMT) characterization data, and then used to construct initial model macroscopic properties including porosity, permeability, and mineral compositions. The reactive transport simulations were performed by using the Nonisothermal Unsaturated Flow and Transport (NUFT) code, and their results were compared with experimental data. It was observed both experimentally and numerically that the dissolution fronts became unstable in highly heterogeneous and less permeable formations, leading to the development of highly porous flow paths or wormholes. Our model results indicate that the continuum-scale reactive transport models are able to adequately capture the evolution of distinct dissolution fronts as observed in carbonate rocks at a core scale. The impacts of rock heterogeneity, chemical kinetics and porosity-permeability relationships were also examined in this study. The numerical model developed in this study will not only help improve understanding of coupled physical and chemical processes controlling carbonate dissolution, but also provide a useful basis for upscaling transport and reaction properties from core scale to field scale.

            "abstract": "The physiography of Madagascar is characterised by high-elevation and low relief topography. Cretaceous limestones at elevations of ~300 m above sea level and newly dated emergent ~125 ka coral reefs suggest that Madagascar and its margins have been uplifted during Cenozoic times. Rivers in Madagascar are often deeply incised and contain steepened reaches, which implies that they are responding to changes in uplift rate. However, apatite fission track and (U-Th)/He thermochronology, and 10Be derived erosion rates suggest that both Cenozoic and recent denudation rates have been low. Extensive laterite-capped flat surfaces also suggest there were long periods of tectonic quiescence during the Cenozoic. To bridge the gap between evidence for uplift and quiescence, we inverted 2566 longitudinal river profiles using a damped non-negative, least-squares inversion scheme for histories of uplift rate. We used a simplified version of the stream power erosional model (∂z/∂t = -KAmSn + U, where n = 1). Longitudinal profiles were extracted from the 90 m resolution Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation model. Calibration of the stream power erosional model is based on new radiometric dating of marine terraces and incised lateritic peneplains. Fits to observed river profiles are excellent. Results indicate that Madagascar's topography grew by 1 - 2 km during the last 15-20 Ma. Calculated uplift and denudation is consistent with independent observations. Our results suggest that drainage networks in Madagascar contain coherent signals that record regional uplift. Admittance calculations and nearby oceanic residual age-depth measurements from the passive margins suggest that as much as 0.8 – 1.1 km of Cenozoic uplift in Madagascar was supported by the mantle.",

            "abstract": "Spring snowmelt is a critical resource in mountainous and alpine regions. Accurate representation of snowmelt processes in hydrological models is thus necessary for water managing purposes, flood prediction and resource allocation, among others. This task, however, remains a challenge because of the complexity of the interactions between the different controlling processes. In this study, we combine local and distributed measurements of snowpack ablation at the Dischma river basin (~40 km2) near Davos, Switzerland, to study relationships between snow ablation, basin morphology, subsurface water routing and watershed response with the overarching objective of improving snowmelt representation in distributed hydrological models. Weekly terrestrial laser scans were performed to reveal spatial ablation patterns at slope scales throughout the melting season. Four local stations installed in representative slopes are used to continuously monitor snowpack temperature profiles, snowpack output, and soil moisture throughout the melting season. Basin response was captured at three stream gages, one at the outlet and two at smaller tributaries within the basin. Results for the 2015 spring season will be presented, including 9 weekly terrestrial laser scans and the continuous snowmelt and streamflow measurements. These measurements are compared to modeling results from the spatially distributed and physically based Alpine3D model to evaluate model accuracy and detect areas that require improvement in model representation of snowmelt processes. Insights of these comparisons and future directions will be discussed.",

To image crustal structure around the MGA, we analyzed the P-wave trains of 119 teleseismic earthquakes at these stations using the time-domain iterative-deconvolution method of Ligorria and Ammon (1999), the waveform-fitting method of Van der Meijde et al. (2003), and the H-κ stacking method of Zhu and Kanamori (2000). Our aim was to resolve intra-crustal layering and Moho characteristics.\nDespite considerable noise related to station installation constraints, we find that outside of the MGA, the Moho is sharp and relatively flat, both beneath the Archean Superior Province as well as beneath the Proterozoic terranes to its south. This Moho produces consistent P to S converted phases in the analyzed receiver functions. Receiver functions show much more complexity along the MGA, where P to S converted phases from the Moho are much weaker and more variable with azimuth and epicentral distance. Similar results have been found in Iowa by French et al. (2009). For many stations along the MGA, multiple weak S phases arrive around the time expected for the Moho-converted phase. In addition, strong P-to-S converted phases are observed from the base of shallow sedimentary layers. The base of the sedimentary layer is fairly shallow outside of the MGA, thickens near the flanks where gravity anomalies are low and shallows again in the center where the gravity peaks.\nWe conclude that the Moho is not a strong feature of the MRS, that the transition from crust to mantle occurs over a 10-20 km thick layer with somewhat sharp upper and lower bounds, and confirm, as expected, that the remaining Moho in the Precambrian region is relatively sharp and flat.",

            "abstract": "Green's functions can be recovered through the cross correlation of ambient seismic noise. These Green's functions can be used to image the subsurface or for monitoring geological settings where we expect rapid seismic velocity changes (e.g. volcanoes, reservoirs). The criterion for the successful recovery of the Green's functions is that the wavefields used for the cross correlation are diffuse. This assumption is fulfilled if either the noise sources are uniformly distributed around the receivers or the scattering in the medium is high enough to mitigate any source directivity. The locations of the noise sources are usually unknown and they change with time. Therefore, apparent changes in seismic wave velocity can be observed which are caused by temporal and spatial changes in the noise source location.\nIn order to investigate these apparent changes in the Green's functions we undertook an experiment in Tenerife. The experiment was running for 3 months. A small airgun, with exactly known source position, was used as an active source. It was shooting every 15 minutes and several seismic stations laterally and vertically distributed around the airgun recorded the active shots. Coincident to the active shots seismic noise was recorded. Therefore apparent velocity changes measured through the cross correlation of noise can be compared to velocity changes recovered from the repetitive shots. This gives us the opportunity to distinguish between apparent changes due to changes in the noise sources and real velocity changes in the medium. In addition barometric pressure, temperature, rain fall and humidity were recorded in order to avoid misinterpretation of the velocity changes caused by weather fluctuations.",

We show that visible light photolysis contributes significantly to the isotope enrichment of O3 both in laboratory photolytic recycling experiments and throughout most of the troposphere. The fractionation due to photolysis is mass dependent. We also determined the (low-resolution) wavelength dependence of the fractionation associated with photolysis and find a much weaker wavelength dependence compared to semi-empirical model calculations. The fractionation in photolysis is shown not to depend on temperature, and the temperature dependent isotope enrichments found in photolysis recycling experiments can be corrected for the effect of photolysis to yield for the first time isotope effects in the O3 formation reaction only. These enrichments are then used to reassess the relative rate coefficients of several O3 – forming isotopic reaction channels.",

            "abstract": "About 25% of the crust formed at slow spreading mid-ocean ridges includes a component of tectonically exhumed and partially serpentinized mantle-derived peridotites. Exhumation occurs along large offset normal faults (detachment faults). In this presentation we outline a conceptual and testable model for serpentinization at slow-spreading ridges, based on petrological observations of samples of variably serpentinized peridotites from the Mid Atlantic and Southwest Indian ridges, on tectonic and geophysical data and on current interpretations of plate-boundary processes at slow spreading ridges. Serpentinization at mid-ocean ridges is a heterogeneous and multistage process occurring along fractures, in the footwall of axial detachments. The initial and most pervasive stage of serpentinization results in the typical serpentine mesh texture. We propose that it occurs when hydrothermal fluids reach extensively microfractured fresh peridotite. Subsequent stages of serpentinization appear to involve higher fluid-rock ratio along larger fractures and veins that are spaced by at least a few decimeters. Experimental data indicate that each stage of serpentinization identified in a given sample may have occurred at very high rates relative to the rates of tectonic exhumation. However, serpentinization (initial and later stages) may be a protracted process at the km-scale, associated with complex fracturation of the detachment's footwall due to combined tectonic and reaction-induced stresses. We outline possible consequences of this conceptual model in terms of crustal structure, hydrogen production and of the relations between serpentinization and black smoker-type hydrothermal circulation at slow-spreading ridges.",

For their age, the MRS rocks are well preserved and have not been deeply buried, yet a thorough understanding of the regional thermal history is necessary to constrain the processes that emplaced the mineral deposits and how post-burial alteration may have affected various paleo-records.\nTo understand the thermal history of the MRS better, this study presents carbonate clumped isotope (Δ47) temperatures from deposits on the north and south sides of the rift. Due to the age of these deposits and known post-depositional processes, uncertainties exist about whether the clumped isotope signature has been reset. To test this, three generations of calcite were analyzed from the Nonesuch Fm. from the White Pine mine in Michigan including: sedimentary limestone beds, early diagenetic carbonate nodules, and hydrothermal calcite veins associated with the emplacement of copper mineralization. Clumped isotope temperatures from the White Pine mine range from 84 to 131°C, with a hydrothermal vein producing the hottest temperature. The clumped isotope temperature range for samples throughout the rift expands to 41–134°C. The hottest temperatures are associated with areas of known copper mineralization, whereas the coolest temperatures are found on the northern arm of the rift in Minnesota, far from known basin-bounding faults. Our hottest temperatures are broadly consistent with preexisting maximum thermal temperature estimates based on clay mineralogy, fluid inclusions, and organic geochemistry data. Clumped isotope results will also be compared to new hydrocarbon maturity data from the Nonesuch Fm., which suggest that bitumen maturities consistently fall within the early oil window across Michigan and Wisconsin.",

The goals of the campaign were to document the structure of atmospheric rivers (ARs) that deliver much of the water vapor associated with major winter storms along the U.S. West Coast and to investigate the modulating effect of aerosols on precipitation. Aerosol sources that may influence orographic cloud properties for air lifted over the mountains in California in winter include pollution, biomass burning, soil dusts and marine aerosols, but their roles will also be influenced by transport, vertical stratification, and scavenging processes. We present results from a comprehensive study of aerosol distributions, compositions, and cloud nucleating properties during an intense winter storm during February 2015, including data from an NSF-supported measurement site at Bodega Bay, from the DOE-ARM Cloud Aerosol Precipitation Experiment that included sampling on the NOAA RV Ron Brown offshore and the G-1 aircraft over ocean and land, and with context provided by other NOAA aircraft and remote sensing facilities. With a special focus on the coastal site, we discuss changes in aerosol distributions, aerosol hygroscopicity, and number concentrations of fluorescent particles, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), and ice nucleating particles (INPs) during the AR event. We compare with periods preceding and following the event. For example, total aerosol number and surface area concentrations at below 0.5 μm diameter decreased from typical values of a few thousand cm-3 and 100 μm2 cm-3, respectively, to a few hundred cm-3 and 10 μm2cm-3 at Bodega Bay during the AR event. CCN concentrations were similarly lower, but hygroscopicity parameter (kappa) increased from typical values of 0.2 to values > 0.5 during the AR.INP and fluorescent particle number concentrations were generally lower during the AR event than at any other times.",

            "abstract": "As the surface expression of deep mantle dynamics, Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) are associated with the edges of large low shear velocity provinces (LLSVP) rooted at the core-mantle boundary. Instabilities in the LLSVP can cause periodic upwellings of material in the form of mantle plumes, which impact the lithosphere forming LIPs. However, the time frames of these massive lava outpourings are still uncertain. While continental LIPs are more readily accessible, oceanic LIPs have only been studied through drilling and sampling of fragments accreted to continental margins or island arcs, hence, they are relatively less understood. The impact of oceanic LIPs on oceanic biota is conspicuously recorded in global occurrences of black shale deposits that evidence episodes of anoxia and mass extinctions shortly after the formation of LIPs that ultimately can affect life on the entire planet. Our new geochemical and geochronological data of accreted Pacific LIPs found in the coasts of Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica record three LIP pulses possibly reflecting upwelling periods of the LLSVP at 140, 120 and 90 Ma. In order to test different models of origin of these LIPS, we created a complete reconstruction of the Pacific Plate configuration from the Mid-Jurassic to Upper-Cretaceous to show the existing correlation between upwelling pulses at edges of the Pacific LLSVP, oceanic anoxic events and the age from Pacific LIPs. We propose that since the formation of the Pacific plate at circa 175-180 Ma, a series of upwellings that interacted with mid-ocean ridge systems separated by 10-20 Ma have affected the planet periodically forming oceanic LIPs that still can be found today on the Pacific seafloor and accreted along the plate margins.",

Site suitability guidelines include evidence of lack of fluid flow in basement, for example lack of significant topographic relief, or evidence of ancient and/or saline groundwater at depth. However, lack of local topographic relief does not preclude regional hydraulic gradients created by recharge and discharge at distant outcrops; and precisely because of hydraulic isolation, the crystalline basement has the potential to be over- or under-pressured relative to overlying units. In the absence of previous boreholes in the area of a potential site, hydraulic gradients at depth are difficult to predict, and the possibility remains that a deep borehole drilled for the disposal of waste will encounter vertical or lateral driving forces for fluid flow. This study asks the question: How large a driving force can be tolerated while still maintaining repository performance? We use PFLOTRAN (an open source, massively parallel subsurface flow and reactive transport code) and a 3-D model domain (representing a disposal borehole in crystalline basement overlain by sedimentary strata) to examine the influence of horizontal and vertical hydraulic gradients on the long-term performance of a deep borehole radioactive waste repository. Simulations include steady-state lateral hydraulic gradients and transient vertical hydraulic gradients, and predict radionuclide concentrations in an overlying aquifer to quantify the potential influence of regional hydraulic gradients on repository performance.",

Here we present the first results of (U–Th)/He dating of detrital zircon collected from Ordovician – Devonian strata of Pioneer and October Revolution islands (Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago) along with Sedov Island. Twelve detrital zircon grains from two samples of Ordovician-Silurian strata yielded (U-Th)/He ages ranging from 583.8 ± 46.7 to 429.0 ± 34.3 Ma with a peak age of ca. 465 Ma. In Devonian strata, 36 detrital zircon grains from four samples yielded (U-Th)/He ages ranging from 1028.9 ± 82.31 to 332.9 ± 26.6 Ma showing major peaks at ca. 375 Ma and a smaller peak at ca. 465 Ma. The (U-Th)/He ages are older than depositional ages of host rocks for all samples from the Ordovician – Devonian strata of Severnaya Zemlya Archipelago, indicating the samples were not buried deep enough (~6-8 km) to reset the (U-Th)/He age, thus the ages indicate the exhumational history of the clastic source region. The (U-Th)/He detrital zircon ages from Ordovician- Silurian strata, with a peak age of ca. 465 Ma, suggest the primary source region was located within the Caledonian Orogen, which is unknown in the vicinity of Severnaya Zemlya. The abundance of Caledonian ages in the studied samples suggests a continuation of Caledonides northeastward across Barents shelf as previously inferred from subsequent Permo-Carboniferous rifting trend illustrated by geophysical data. In contrast to older clastic rocks, (U-Th)/He detrital zircon ages from the Devonian deposits show a mixture of Ellesmerian and Caledonian ages with age peaks at ca. 375 Ma and 465 Ma and the youngest grains nearing the age of sedimentation. The ages suggest the clastic source area of Devonian sandstones likely contained rocks affected by both Caledonian and Ellesmerian orogenies.",

This model self-consistently calculates the production, transport, and condensation of hydrocarbons from the surface to the exosphere. New features of the model include the condensation of molecules and their sublimation back into the gas. The Alice observations of C2H2 and C2H4 provide strong constraints on the rate of eddy mixing in the altitude region 100-600 km altitude region. Inferred mixing rates are low, consistent with slow downward transport of long-lived photochemical products to Pluto’s lower atmosphere where loss by condensation occurs. We present an interpretation of the observed hydrocarbons as a test of our understanding of Pluto’s atmosphere photochemistry.",

The coupling of these cloud-resolving models directly to land surface model instances, rather than passing averaged atmospheric variables to a single instance of a land surface model, the logical next step in model development, has recently been accomplished. This new configuration offers conspicuous improvements to estimates of precipitation and canopy through-fall, but overall the model exhibits warm surface temperature biases and low productivity.\nThis work presents modifications to a land-surface model that take advantage of the new multi-scale modeling framework, and accommodate the change in spatial scale from a typical GCM range of ~200 km to the CRM grid-scale of 4 km.\nA parameterization is introduced to apportion modeled surface radiation into direct-beam and diffuse components. The diffuse component is then distributed among the land-surface model instances within each GCM cell domain. This substantially reduces the number excessively low light values provided to the land-surface model when cloudy conditions are modeled in the CRM, associated with its 1-D radiation scheme.\nThe small spatial scale of the CRM, ~4 km, as compared with the typical ~200 km GCM scale, provides much more realistic estimates of precipitation intensity, this permits the elimination of a model parameterization of canopy through-fall. However, runoff at such scales can no longer be considered as an immediate flow to the ocean. Allowing sub-surface water flow between land-surface instances within the GCM domain affords better realism and also reduces temperature and productivity biases.\nThe MMF affords a number of opportunities to land-surface modelers, providing both the advantages of direct simulation at the 4 km scale and a much reduced conceptual gap between model resolution and parameterized processes.",

            "abstract": "Fluid transport in shales and other argillaceous formations is difficult to study because these materials often have extremely low permeability. However, recent investigations have revealed a number of instances of apparently isolated highs or lows in pore fluid potential in shallow (< ~ 1 km depth) argillaceous formations in intraplate settings. The presence (or absence) of such pressure anomalies may provide clues to fluid flow. Formations with the pressure anomalies are distinguished by (1) smaller ratios of hydraulic conductivity to formation thickness and (2) smaller hydraulic (or pressure) diffusivities than those without anomalies. This is consistent with water-saturated transient Darcian flow caused by strain at rates of ~ 10-17 to 10-16 s-1, by significant perturbing events in the past 104 to 106 years or by some combination of the two. Plausible causes include erosional downwasting, tectonic strain, and glaciation. In this conceptualization the anomalies constrain formation-scale flow properties, flow history, and local geological forcing in the last 106 years and in particular indicate zones of low permeability (10-19 – 10-22 m2) that could be useful for isolation of nuclear waste.",

Comprised of sandy sediment, this baymouth bar’s formation is attributed largely to littoral drift from the Wisconsin South Shore and minor sediments from the outflows of the St. Louis and Nemadji Rivers. Due to continuing differential isostatic rebound of the basin, local lake level at Duluth is presently rising at approximately 25 centimeters/century. The objective of this project is to understand how the baymouth bar has evolved in response to lake level change. Although it is a young, non-marine system in which hydrocarbons are not developing, this baymouth bar is a useful analogue for similar, much larger system in basins experiencing sea-level change. Using an approach similar to that used to study the seismic geomorphology of a sand-prone marine system using 3D seismic data, the geomorphic expression of the baymouth bar’s response to lake level change is investigated using 3D Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) data. Vibracore sampling is used to calibrate the collected GPR data. Radiocarbon dating of samples taken from the cores will be used to establish a chronology for the evolution of the bar, making it possible to draw linkages between the various phases of the system and changes in local lake level.",

            "abstract": "The Water Quality Portal (WQP) is a cooperative project between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) overseen by the National Water Quality Monitoring Council (NWQMC). It was launched in April of 2012 as a single point of access for discrete water quality samples stored in the USGS NWIS and EPA STORET systems. Since launch thousands of users have visited the Water Quality Portal to download billions of results that are pertinent to their interests. Numerous tools have also been developed that use WQP web services as a source of data for further analysis. Since the launch of the Portal, the WQP development team at the USGS Center for Integrated Data Analytics has worked with USGS and EPA stakeholders as well as the wider user community to add significant new features to the WQP. WQP users can now directly plot sites of interest on a web map based on any of the 164 WQP query parameters, and then download data of interest directly from that map. In addition, the WQP has expanded beyond just serving out NWIS and STORET data, and provides data from the US Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service STEWARDS system, the USGS BioData system and is working with others to bring in additional data. Finally, the WQP is linked to another NWQMC-supported project, the National Environmental Methods Index (NEMI), so WQP users can easily find the method behind the data that they are using. Future work is focused on incorporating additional biological data from the USGS BioData system, broadening the scope of discrete water quality sample types from STORET, and developing approaches to make the data in the WQP more visible and usable. The WQP team is also exploring ways to further integrate with other systems, such as those operated the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forest Service and other federal agencies to facilitate the overarching goal of improving access to water quality data for all users.",

            "abstract": "The composition and thickness of crustal layering is fundamental to understanding the evolution and dynamics of continental lithosphere. Lowry and Pérez-Gussinyé (2011) found that the western Cordillera of the United States, characterized by active deformation and high heat flow, is strongly correlated with low bulk crustal seismic velocity ratio. They interpreted this observation as evidence that quartz controls continental tectonism and deformation. We will present new imaging of two-layer crustal composition and structure from cross-correlation of observed receiver functions and model synthetics. The cross-correlation coefficient of the two-layer model increases significantly relative to an assumed one-layer model, and the lower crustal thickness map from raw two-layer modeling (prior to Bayesian filtering with gravity models and Optimal Interpolation) clearly shows Colorado plateau and Appalachian boundaries, which are not apparent in upper crustal models, and also the high vP/vS fill the most of middle continental region while low vP/vS are on the west and east continental edge. In the presentation, we will show results of a new algorithm for joint Bayesian inversion of thickness and vP/vS of two-layer continental crustal structure. Recent thermodynamical modeling of geophysical models based on lab experiment data (Guerri et al., 2015) found that a large impedance contrast can be expected in the midcrust due to a phase transition that decreases plagioclase and increases clinopyroxene, without invoking any change in crustal chemistry. The depth of the transition depends on pressure, temperature and hydration, and in this presentation we will compare predictions of layer thicknesses and vP/vS predicted by mineral thermodynamics to those we observe in the USArray footprint.",

To examine the behavior of these biogeochemical constituents under ice, we collected water column and sediment time series biogeochemical data from hyper-eutrophic Shelburne Pond (SP) and eutrophic Missisquoi Bay (MB), Vermont USA, from January to April 2015. Based on temporal changes in the concentration of Al, Ca, Fe, Mn and P in sediment, coupled with density and oxygen gradients in water, we demonstrate that water column variability in metal and P concentration and spatial distribution is impacted by redox cycling near the SWI, as well as episodic input from each system’s watershed. These processes are manifest differently in each system due to differences in lake-watershed configuration and sediment composition. Our data suggest that under ice nutrient and metal partitioning, flux and concentration distribution is highly dynamic in both time and space, and a complex interaction between SWI redox chemistry, hydrodynamics, and winter weather. These drivers control the biogeochemical evolution of the under ice system during the winter, with the potential to impact water quality and spring/summer ecosystem productivity.",

Airborne magnetic and terrestrial gravity data from the area have been analysed and modelled in detail. Results obtained using a variety of edge enhancement (derivative) methods applied to high-resolution, airborne magnetic data reveal widespread magmatic intrusions (mainly volcanic/sub-volcanic rocks, with an areal extent greater than 12000 km2) and numerous geological structures. Rose (azimuth frequency) plots show that the geological structural trends are predominantly NE – SW, NW – SE and ESE – WNW with minor ENE –WSW/N – S trends and thus suggest that the area has undergone several phases of tectonic deformation at different geological times. Integrated two-dimensional (2-D) gravity and magnetic modelling along five profiles constrained by 2-D magnetic depth-to-source estimates and available seismological velocity models indicates the presence of a number of distinct crustal bodies and thin crust. Moho depth varies from ca. 21 – 29 km, while the crustal thickness ranges between ca. 19 and 29 km. Shallower Moho and thinner crust are observed along the trough axis. Results from the study also reveal that the amount of crustal thinning and crustal stretching factor (β) across the area varies from 3.3 – 14.5 km and 1.11 – 1.78, respectively. Broad positive to near positive Bouguer gravity anomalies in the region of the trough axis are due to the combined effects of dense (intermediate to basic) magmatic intrusions (both intra-sedimentary and intra-basement/crustal ones), shallow basement horsts (basement uplift zones) and thin crust replaced by dense abnormal upper mantle bodies. Reactivated intra-basement structures and/or shear zones appear to have controlled the emplacement of elongated (NE-SW trending) high density magmatic (igneous) bodies along the basement-trough’s margins.",

With the projected change in the future watershed hydrology, including shift of snowmelt timing, increasing occurrence of extreme precipitation, and change in drought frequencies, there is a need to investigate how the regional hydropower generation may change correspondingly. To evaluate the sensitivity of watershed storage and hydropower generation to future climate change, a lumped Watershed Runoff-Energy Storage (WRES) model is developed to simulate the annual and seasonal hydropower generation at various hydropower areas in the United States. For each hydropower study area, the WRES model use the monthly precipitation and naturalized (unregulated) runoff as inputs to perform a runoff mass balance calculation for the total monthly runoff storage in all reservoirs and retention facilities in the watershed, and simulate the monthly regulated runoff release and hydropower generation through the system. The WRES model is developed and calibrated using the historic (1980–2009) monthly precipitation, runoff, and generation data, and then driven by a large set of dynamically- and statistically-downscaled Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate projections to simulate the change of watershed storage and hydropower generation under different future climate scenarios. The results among different hydropower regions, storage capacities, emission scenarios, and timescales are compared and discussed in this study.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying the delivery of suspended sediment from upland sources to downstream receiving waters is important for watershed management, but current routing models fail to accurately represent lag times in delivery resulting from sediment storage. In this study, we route suspended sediment tagged by a characteristic tracer using a 1-dimensional model that implicitly includes storage and remobilization processes and timescales. From an input location where tagged sediment is added, the model advects suspended sediment downstream at the velocity of the stream (adjusted for the intermittency of transport events). Deposition rates are specified by the fraction of the suspended load stored per kilometer of downstream transport (presumably available from a sediment budget). Tagged sediment leaving storage is evaluated from a convolution equation based on the probability distribution function (pdf) of sediment storage waiting times; this approach avoids the difficulty of accurately representing complex processes of sediment remobilization from floodplain and other deposits. To illustrate the role of storage on sediment delivery, we compare exponential and bounded power-law waiting time pdfs with identical means of 94 years. In both cases, the median travel time for sediment to reach the depocenter in fluvial systems less than 40km long is governed by in-channel transport and is unaffected by sediment storage. As the channel length increases, however, the median sediment travel time reflects storage rather than in-channel transport; travel times do not vary significantly between the two different waiting time functions. At distances of 50, 100, and 200 km, the median travel time for suspended sediment is 36, 136, and 325 years, orders of magnitude slower than travel times associated with in-channel transport. These computations demonstrate that storage can be neglected for short rivers, but for longer systems, storage controls the delivery of suspended sediment.",

            "abstract": "We introduced “compact phase space retrievals” (CPSRs) for assimilating atmospheric composition observations in Mizzi et al. (2015). CPSRs address many of the challenges associated with assimilating retrievals by: (i) removing the contribution of the retrieval prior, (ii) diagonalizing the associated error covariance, and (iii) compacting the phase space retrievals. Mizzi et al. (2015) showed that the CPSRs reduced assimilation computational costs by approximately one-third while maintaining the relevant forecast skill metrics. In this paper, we examine phase space retrievals and compare CPSRs to more conventional retrieval assimilation methods. Specifically we compare the assimilation of CPSRs with that of (i) raw retrievals where the observation error is based on the diagonal of the retrieval error covariance, (ii) quasi-optimal retrievals (QORs) where the observation error is determined as (i), and (iii) QORs where the observation error is based on an SVD-based transform of the error covariance. Method (i) is the easiest to interpret because the assimilation occurs in retrieval space. Method (ii) explicitly removes the retrieval prior term’s contribution but is more difficult to interpret because the assimilated observations are residuals. Finally, method (iii) is the phase space retrieval algorithm of Migliorini et al. (2008). We consider two variants: (i) withholding the inverse square scaling and (ii) using phase space filtering for optimization. We apply those methods to month-long forecast/assimilation experiments with continuous cycling.",

            "abstract": "The nature of the heating of the Sun’s corona has been a long-standing unanswered problem in solar physics. Beginning with the work of Parker (1972), many authors have argued that the corona is continuously heated through numerous small-scale reconnection events known as nanoflares. In these nanoflare models, stressing of magnetic flux tubes by photospheric motions causes the field to become misaligned, producing current sheets in the corona. These current sheets then reconnect, converting the free energy stored in the magnetic field into heat. In this work, we use the Adaptively Refined MHD Solver (ARMS) to perform 3D MHD simulations that dynamically resolve regions of strong current to study the reconnection between twisted flux tubes in a plane-parallel Parker configuration. We investigate the energetics of the process, and show that the flux tubes accumulate stress gradually before undergoing impulsive reconnection. We study the motion of the individual field lines during reconnection, and demonstrate that the connectivity of the configuration becomes extremely complex, with multiple current sheets being formed, which could lead to enhanced heating. In addition, we show that there is considerable interaction between the twisted flux tubes and the surrounding untwisted field, which contributes further to the formation of current sheets. The implications for observations will be discussed.\nThis work was funded by a NASA Earth and Space Science Fellowship, and by the NASA TR&T Program.",

Solar wind protons charge exchange with neutral particles in the extended Martian corona, forming a stream of energetic neutral atoms which penetrate through the magnetosphere unaffected by electromagnetic fields, still retaining the solar wind velocity. The resulting hydrogen beam interacts with the dense neutral atmosphere at low altitudes, producing three different charge states (H+, H, H-), the ratio of which depends upon the energy-dependent collision cross sections with neutral species (dominantly CO2 at low altitudes). We first discuss the utility of the penetrating proton population as a solar wind proxy, demonstrating the systematic organization of magnetospheric structure and escaping fluxes by the penetrating proton measurements. We then compare H+ and H- fluxes at periapsis to the upstream solar wind flux, as a function of solar wind energy and atmospheric density, to constrain the energy dependence of the relevant electron stripping, electron attachment, and charge exchange cross sections. Next, we investigate the spatial and temporal organization of the penetrating fluxes observed during the MAVEN mission, which allow us to determine both the effects of crustal magnetic fields and the seasonal variability of the Martian corona. Finally, we discuss the relevance of observed hydrogen deposition for the short-term and long-term evolution of the Martian atmosphere and magnetosphere. ",

Comparisons of Terra/MOPITT carbon monoxide (CO) and IASI/Metop CO observation assimilations will be presented. We use the DART Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter to assimilate observations in the CAM-Chem global chemistry-climate model. Data assimilation impacts due to both different instrument capabilities (i.e. vertical sensitivity and global coverage) will be discussed. Coverage is global but sparse, often with large uncertainties in individual measurements that limit examination of local and regional atmospheric composition over short time periods. This has hindered the operational uptake of these data for monitoring air quality and population exposure, and for initializing and evaluating chemical weather forecasts. By the end of the current decade there are planned geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) satellite missions for atmospheric composition over North America, East Asia and Europe with additional missions proposed. Together, these present the possibility of a constellation of geostationary platforms to achieve continuous time-resolved high-density observations of continental domains for mapping pollutant sources and variability on diurnal and local scales. We describe Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) to evaluate the contributions of these GEO missions to improve knowledge of near-surface air pollution due to intercontinental long-range transport and quantify chemical precursor emissions. Our approach uses an efficient computational method to sample a high-resolution global GEOS-5 chemistry Nature Run over each geographical region of the GEO constellation. The demonstration carbon monoxide (CO) observation simulator, which will be expanded to other chemical pollutants, currently produces multispectral retrievals (MOPITT-like) and captures realistic scene-dependent variation in measurement vertical sensitivity and cloud cover.

            "abstract": "ePoster - Porter_AGU2015.pdf\nTropospheric ozone (O3) pollution levels have widely observed correlations to daytime surface temperatures, especially in highly polluted regions. This nonlinear correlation occurs through a variety of temperature-dependent mechanisms related to O3 precursor emissions, lifetimes, and reaction rates, making the reproduction of temperature sensitivities – and the associated human health risks connected to increased pollution – a problematic task. Here we examine the observed summertime O3 climate penalty across several regions worldwide using quantile regression, allowing for an examination of temperature sensitivities across the O3 response distribution. Through this methodology, we show significant differences between the sensitivities of high vs. low O3 percentiles, suggesting that climate penalties based on means and ordinary least squares regressions may in fact underestimate the magnitude of expected changes to extreme O3 events. We then examine these relationships as reproduced by the global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem, perturbing individual mechanisms within the model to both highlight possible explanations for model/observation discrepancies, and also better understand the regionality and magnitude of individual mechanism contribution to the observed penalty. Finally, we explore the future consequences of the climate penalty as forecast by commonly used global climate models, proposing corrections based on the quantile and regional differences from observed sensitivities.",

            "abstract": "The study considers a north-south pair of mid-latitude rings of atmospheric mass, symmetric with respect to the equator, and rotating with respect to the distant stars. The mass and angular velocity are assigned similar to the annual and zonal mean upper level westerlies. Their relatively rapid rotation is assumed to allow a rigid body approximation on long time and space scales. The rings are constrained to move as if rigidly connected to a common axis of rotation. The pair thus constitutes a symmetric top with a fixed pivot point at the center of mass. Analysis of the dynamics follows the classical mechanics approach used for precession of the equinoxes. The theoretical rate of precession for this highly idealized system yields a period on the order of decades. The predicted dynamics appears consistent with three prior studies of observational data: latitudinal movements of atmospheric circulation above far Southern Australia, latitudinal movements of ocean circulation in the Kuroshio Extension, and changes in global Atmospheric Angular Momentum before and after 1976. Each of these observational records indicates correlation with the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. The theoretical dynamics in combination with the observations suggests the axis of rotation of the atmospheric westerlies is offset from the Earth axis by a few degrees, and further, that this axis precesses around a mean axis on a time scale of a few decades.",

            "abstract": "Methane advecting through continental margin sediments may enter the water column and potentially contribute to ocean acidification and increase atmospheric methane concentrations. Anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM), mediated by syntrophic consortia of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea and sulfate-reducing bacteria (ANME-SRB), consumes nearly all dissolved methane in methane-bearing sediments before it reaches the sediment-water interface. Despite the significant role ANME-SRB play in carbon cycling, our knowledge of these organisms and their surrounding microbial communities is limited. Our objective is to develop a metabolic model of ANME-SRB within methane-bearing sediments and to couple this to a geochemical reaction-transport model for these margins. As a first step towards this goal, we undertook fluorescent microscopic imaging, 16S rRNA gene deep-sequencing, and shotgun metagenomic sequencing of sediments from the US Pacific (Washington) and northern Atlantic margins where ANME-SRB are present. A successful Illumina MiSeq sequencing run yielded 106,257 bacterial and 857,834 archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequences from 12 communities from the Washington Margin using both universal prokaryotic and archaeal-specific primer sets. Fluorescent microscopy confirmed the presence of cells of the ANME-2c lineage in the sequenced communities. Microbial community characterization was coupled with measurements of sediment physical and geochemical properties and, for samples from the US Atlantic margin, 14C-based measurements of AOM rates and 35S-based measurements of sulfate reduction rates. These findings have the potential to increase understanding of ANME-SRB, their surrounding microbial communities, and their role in carbon cycling within continental margins. In addition, they pave the way for future efforts at developing a metabolic model of ANME-SRB and coupling it to geochemical models of the US Washington and Atlantic margins.",

            "abstract": "The eddy-covariance technique is widely applied to observe the exchange of energy and scalars between the earth’s surface and its atmosphere. In practice, fast (≥10 Hz) sonic anemometry and enclosed infrared gas spectroscopy are used to determine fluctuations in the 3-D wind vector and trace gas concentrations, respectively. Here, two contradicting requirements need to be fulfilled: (i) the sonic anemometer and trace gas analyzer should sample the same air volume, while (ii) the presence of the gas analyzer should not affect the wind field measured by the 3-D sonic anemometer. To determine the optimal positioning of these instruments with respect to each other, a trade-off study was performed.\nTheoretical formulations were used to determine a range of positions between the sonic anemometer and the gas analyzer that minimize the sum of (i) decorrelation error and (ii) wind blocking error. Subsequently, the blocking error induced by the presence of the gas sampling system was experimentally tested for a range of wind directions to verify the model-predicted placement: In a controlled environment the sonic anemometer was placed in the directed flow from a fan outfitted with a large shroud, with and without the presence of the enclosed gas analyzer and its sampling system.\nBlocking errors were enhanced by up to 10% for wind directions deviating ≥130° from frontal, when the flow was coming from the side where the enclosed gas analyzer was mounted. Consequently, we suggest a lateral position of the enclosed gas analyzer towards the aerodynamic wake of the tower, as data from this direction is likely affected by tower-induced flow distortion already. Ultimately, this physical implementation of the sonic anemometer and enclosed gas analyzer resulted in decorrelation and blocking errors ≤5% for ≥70% of all wind directions. These findings informed the design of the National Ecological Observatory Network’s (NEON) eddy-covariance system, which is currently being deployed at all NEON sites.",

            "abstract": "The Radar and/or LiDAR measurements of sea ice freeboard provide an indirect approach to infer sea ice thickness via isostasy. The underlying assumption is that the LiDAR signal returns at the air/snow interface and radar signal at the snow/ice interface. The surface roughness at the air, snow and ice interface has a significant impact on the LiDAR/Radar return waveforms, which can lead to very large errors in the ice thickness retrievals for rough deformed sea ice. To understand and quantify the sea ice surface roughness effects, a combined EM rough surface and volume scattering model was developed to simulate radar returns from the rough sea ice ‘layer cake’ structure. A waveform matching technique was also developed to fits observed waveform to a physically-based waveform model by adjusting surface roughness parameters in the model. In this way, we were able to retrieve surface elevation and estimate the surface roughness at the same time. We applied this technique to co-incident LiDAR/Radar measurements collected during a Cryosat-2 under-flight by the NRL and the NASA IceBridge missions and found that not only the waveform model fits very well to the measured radar waveform, but also the roughness parameters derived independently from the LiDAR and radar data agree very well for both level and deformed sea ice. Comparisons with in-situ survey data from the coordinated CRREL/NRL field campaign suggest that the physically-based retrieval algorithm performs well over very rough deformed sea ice, suggesting that sea ice surface roughness effects can be modeled and corrected based solely on the radar return waveforms.",

            "abstract": "Recent activity at Augustine Volcano, located in Cook Inlet, Alaska, has been dominated by intermediate composition lavas and relatively small explosions. Earlier in Augustine’s history, however, a thick (~30 m) rhyolite fall was erupted ca. 25 ka, containing at least three distinct rhyolite lithologies. Numerous studies have documented evidence of magma mixing in the more recently-erupted material. Here we attempt to evaluate similar mixing events that may have affected the 25 ka rhyolitic magma prior to its eruption.\nBasaltic to basaltic-andesitic deposits are found interbedded with the rhyolite at Augustine, so at least two magmas were present in Augustine’s plumbing system at the same or nearly the same time. Hints at interactions between two or more magmas are also evident on a smaller scale. Xenocrysts of olivine and clinopyroxene are present in the rhyolite, each with mafic melt inclusions. Additionally, two of the three rhyolitic lithologies studied contain high-aluminum amphiboles that are compositionally similar to amphiboles from mafic enclaves entrained during the 2006 eruption and thus may be xenocrystic.\nTo further investigate possible heating by secondary melts and the history of mixing, we use the titanium-in-quartz geothermometer (TitaniQ) on chemical zonation in quartz phenocrysts. We find that most quartz has a distinct 3-zone pattern, though one lithology also contains some complex zoning patterns in phenocryst cores, perhaps suggesting a xenocrystic origin. Additionally, we examine relationships between trace elements in the silicate melt inclusions from a variety of phenocryst types to determine if there is evidence for input of additional magma of different compositions. Finally, we apply results of a preliminary investigation of the mineralogy of a high-phosphorus dacite that stratigraphically overlies the rhyolite to assess their similarity and the degree of mixing, if any, that may have led to the transition from rhyolitic to dacitic magma.",

The changes in SOM turnover resulting from the addition of organic and/or inorganic substrates are termed ‘priming effects’. In this study we examine the effects of root exudates on the priming of cellulose added as particulate organic matter. We amended soil microcosms with 13C-cellulose in the presence or absence of artificial root exudate additions and incubated over time for 45 days. Soils receiving the root exudate (RE) were given either one large dose or multiple, small doses of RE. In each treatment we tracked operational taxonomic units (OTUs) assimilating 13C from cellulose (herein, known as a ‘responder’) over time using DNA stable isotope probing coupled with next generation sequencing. In all treatments the same amount of cellulose-13C was respired indicating the addition of RE did not result in the priming of cellulose decomposition. However, cellulose responders were different depending on treatment and time of sampling (days 14, 28 and 45). We identified a total of 10,361 OTUs, of which there were 369 cellulose responders in the cellulose only treatment, 273 in the repeated, small dose RE treatment, and 358 in the RE single, large dose treatment. Most of the cellulose responders found in all treatments belonged to phyla Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes, Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Chloroflexi. The response time of phyla varies; for instance, more OTUs in Bacteroidetes were observed on day 14 and diminish with each subsequent sampling time. On the other hand, OTUs in Verrucomicrobia increased in response over time. Our study shows no priming effect resulting from the addition of root exudates, although the identity of the microbial mediators of cellulose decomposition varies in each treatment.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies have found that the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) have significant impacts on rainfall over East Africa (EA) during the short rains (Oct-Dec). However, not all ENSO and IOD events are associated with significant precipitation anomalies over EA. Our analysis shows that the IOD and ENSO influence EA rainfall by modifying the MJO. Composite analysis of rainfall and outgoing longwave radiation data show that the MJO over the Indian Ocean (phases 2 and 3 of the Wheeler and Hendon index) is associated with significant increase in precipitation over EA during El Niño. In La Niña and non-ENSO years, the MJO over the Indian Ocean has very weak impacts on EA convection and precipitation. Although previous studies have found that El Niño / La Niña events are associated with anomalous wetness/dryness over EA, the associations are not evident in the absence of the MJO. Similarly, the IOD exhibits strong associations with EA precipitation when there is MJO activity over the Indian Ocean. During the positive phase of the IOD, the MJO over the Indian Ocean has impacts that extend to EA. In the absence of the MJO, however, the IOD shows weak associations with EA precipitation. Furthermore, there are more MJO days in the Indian Ocean during El Niño and positive IOD events, which implies stronger impacts on EA. During La Niña events more MJO days are observed in the Pacific Ocean, favoring subsidence over the western Indian Ocean and dry anomalies over EA. These observations suggest two critical MJO-related questions that must be addressed in order to explain EA short rain variability typically attributed to ENSO or IOD: first, how do ENSO and IOD modify background conditions in a way that causes Indian Ocean MJO activity to be more strongly connected to EA under El Niño and IOD positive conditions, and second, why is it that El Niño and IOD positive states slow MJO propagation over the Indian Ocean and speed it over the Pacific? This presentation will review mechanisms consistent with each phenomenon, including changes in lower troposphere wind patterns, upper level mean flow, vorticity gradients associated with ∂2U/∂2y, and zonal temperature gradients affecting the coupling between convection and the induced convergence of moist static energy.",

            "abstract": "The Imaging UltraViolet Spectrograph (IUVS) on the MAVEN spacecraft has detected two distinct types of auroral emission on Mars. First, we report the discovery of a low altitude, diffuse aurora spanning much of Mars’ northern hemisphere coincident with a solar energetic particle outburst. IUVS observed northerly latitudes during late December 2014, detecting auroral emission in virtually all nightside observations for ~5 days spanning virtually all geographic longitudes. The vertical profile showed emission down to ~70 km altitude (1 microbar), deeper than confirmed at any other planet. The onset and duration of emission coincide with the observed arrival of solar energetic particles up to 200 keV precipitating directly and deeply into the atmosphere. Preliminary modeling of the precipitation, energy deposition and spectral line emission yields good matches to the observations. These observations represent a new class of planetary auroras produced in the Martian middle atmosphere. Given minimal magnetic fields over most of the planet, Mars is likely to exhibit aurora more globally than Earth.\nSecond, we confirm the existence of small patches of discrete aurora near crustal magnetic fields in Mars' southern hemisphere, as observed previously by SPICAM on Mars Express (Bertaux et al., Nature, 435, 790-794 (2005)). IUVS observed southern latitudes in July and August 2015, detecting discrete auroral emission in ~1% of suitable observations. Limb scans resolved both vertically and along-slit indicate this type of auroral emission was patchy on the scale of ~40 km, and located at higher altitudes ~140 km. The higher altitudes imply a lower energy of precipitating particles. The mix of spectral emissions also differed signficiantly from the discrete aurora, indicating different excitation and quenching processes.\nWe will discuss the observed properties of the aurora and associated charged particle precipitation, as well as the broader implications of this high-energy deposition into Mars' atmopshere.",

The advantage to in-situ measurements is that they lead to a well-demonstrated and traceable accuracy. The drawbacks are the costs and labor-intensive nature of those approaches. The development of multi-platform constellations and the need to ensure radiometric consistency across them has led to the implementation of automated ground sites and the accuracy of the results from these automated sites make them suitable for harmonizing the radiometric output from multiple sensors. The results shown here applied to instruments from NASA’s Terra platform as well as Landsats 7 and 8 demonstrate the utility of automated sites as well as the feasibility of making the data from such sites more widely available to the instrument teams. The accuracy of the calibration for a single sensor typically meets the calibration requirements for most earth imagers and harmonization to better than 1% is feasible.",

            "abstract": "The relation between the interstellar magnetic field (ISMF) controlling the configuration of the “ribbon” of energetic neutral atoms discovered by IBEX, and the ISMF in deep space, can be probed with polarized starlight. Starlight is polarized in a dichroic interstellar medium formed by interstellar dust grains that are aligned with respect to the ISMF. Our ongoing survey of polarized starlight traces the ISMF within 40 parsecs. The local ISMF direction was evaluated using the weighted means of the linear polarization vectors. The dominant nearby magnetic field direction is within 7.6 (+14.9,-7.6) degrees of the ISMF direction that is traced by the IBEX ribbon. A low level of random magnetic turbulence is obtained from the polarization data that best trace the IBEX ribbon field direction, 9 (+/-1) deg, which explains the continuity of the IBEX ISMF out into space where it can be traced by starlight polarization. The ISMF direction is perpendicular to the velocity of the cloud around the heliosphere, and it orders the kinematics of the other local interstellar clouds.\nThese results are obtained only after a well-defined subset of the polarization data is omitted from the sample. A separate analysis shows that these polarization vectors are oriented toward the upwind direction of the interstellar gas flowing into the heliosphere. This group of polarization data traces an elongated filamentary-type feature that is perpendicular to the hydrogen deflection plane. We suggest a heliosheath origin for the grains that create this polarized feature.\nOne characteristic shown by the polarization and IBEX field directions is that the ribbon ISMF extends to the boundaries of the BICEP2 region where the polarized CMB background has been studied. Inside of the BICEP2 region other nearby magnetic components are also present. The sightline toward the star Capella suggests that the polarization mechanism is very efficient in this nearby cloud.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between climate variability and an ecosystem process, such as forest growth, is frequently not fixed over time, but changes due to complex interactions between unobserved ecological factors and the process of interest. Climate data and forecasts are frequently spatially and temporally misaligned with ecological observations making inference regarding the effects of climate on ecosystem processes particularly challenging. Here we develop a Bayesian dynamic hierarchical model for annual tree growth increment that allows the effects of climate to evolve over time, applies climate data at a spatial-temporal scale consistent with observations, and controls for individual-level variability commonly encountered in ecological datasets. The model is applied to individual tree data from northern Minnesota using a modified Thornthwaite-type water balance model to transform PRISM temperature and precipitation estimates to physiologically relevant values of actual and potential evapotranspiration (AET, PET), and climatic water deficit. Model results indicate that mean tree growth is most sensitive to AET during the growing season and PET and minimum temperature in the spring prior to growth. The effects of these variables on tree growth, however, are not stationary with significant effects observed in only a subset of years during the 111-year study period. Importantly, significant effects of climate do not result from anomalous climate observations, but follow from large growth deviations unexplained by tree age and size, and time since forest disturbance. Results differ markedly from alternative models that assume the effects of climate are stationary over time or apply climate estimates at the individual scale. Forecasts of future tree growth as a function of climate follow directly from the dynamic hierarchical model allowing for assessment of forest change. Current work is focused on extending the model framework to include regional climate and ecosystem effects for application to a larger tree growth dataset spanning a latitudinal gradient within the US from Maine to Florida.",

            "abstract": "Lake Chad, the fourth largest lake in Africa, is well known as a shrinking lake due to adverse impact of climate change and increased population during drought periods in the 1980s and 1990s. While the shrinkage of the Lake has been studied broadly using remote sensing data, the main cause of shrinkage is still uncertain due to limited availability of ground-truth data. Lack of infrastructure, insecure site conditions, vandalism, and limited site accessibility make it difficult to establish a real-time monitoring network in many parts of Africa including the Lake Chad Basin. For a better understanding of how the Lake responds to the change of weather patterns and other hydrologic processes such as runoff, groundwater flow, and evapotranspiration, a real-time monitoring network is essential in the region. In early 2015, a team from NASA, the Lake Chad Basin Commission, and the University of Missouri – Kansas City set up a hydrologic real-time observatory network in the Chari-Logone catchment, the main feeder of water to the Lake, to monitor meteorological conditions, soil moisture, and groundwater. The TAHMO (Trans-African Hydro-Meteorological Observatory) weather stations were adopted to monitor rainfall, relative humidity, solar radiation, wind speed, and temperature. The present study shows preliminary analysis of the correlations between meteorological and hydrological parameters from real-time monitoring data in the Chari-Logone catchment. We also discuss the importance of partnership with local government and community involvement for data collection and share for sustainable hydrological research in the Lake Chad Basin.",

            "abstract": "Previous work has suggested that prior to 2.5 Ga, Sr isotope compositions of seawater were essentially mantle buffered and the effects of continental weathering on seawater chemistry were negligible. To test this, we collected Sr isotope data from 2.93 and 2.80 Ga carbonates that are part of the Red Lake and Steep Rock groups (Canada), respectively. To better understand carbonate formation and any post-depositional alteration, Sr isotopes are considered with O isotopes and REEs, as well as Rb and Sr contents, including correction for decay of 87Rb. All samples have Y/Ho ratios higher than chondrite and have positive La anomalies, which, combined with low Rb contents suggests that clastic contamination is negligible. Samples we consider near pristine have δ18O (VSMOW) values >20‰. Samples with the highest Y/Ho ratios and largest La anomalies from Red Lake and Steep Rock have initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios of 0.7018-0.7020. This Sr isotope composition is significantly more radiogenic than contemporaneous mantle (0.7011-0.7012), especially at a time when the isotopic difference between the crust and mantle was much less than today. This implies that radiogenic continental crust was emergent and shed detritus into the world’s oceans prior to 3.0 Ga, in contrast with proposals for submerged continental crust, but in line with new estimates that continental crust at 3.0 Ga was 60-70% of current volume. We contend that this large amount of crust combined with enhanced Archean weathering could account for the radiogenic Sr isotope compositions we report here, and suggests a significant impact from continental weathering on ocean chemistry during the Archean.",

            "abstract": "Eddy-covariance and profile measurements are widely used to develop and test parameterizations of land-atmosphere interactions in earth system models. However, a fundamental challenge for these comparisons lies in the scale mismatch: Observations represent temporally varying and small source areas (100–101 km2), while simulations produce temporally regular, regional-scale grids (102–103 km2). The environmental response function (ERF) method provides a promising link through unveiling the regional flux field underlying the observed surface-atmosphere exchange. This is achieved by relating sub-hourly turbulent fluxes to meteorological forcings and surface properties, and utilizing the resulting relationships for spatio-temporal mapping.\nHowever, a new challenge arises: At sub-hourly time scales, surface-atmosphere exchange is rarely resolved completely by the turbulent flux alone. Specifically in the case of taller towers, storage beneath the turbulent flux measurement height can comprise a substantial amount of the actual surface-atmosphere exchange.\nHere, we show how temporally resolved maps of heat, water and carbon net ecosystem exchange can be produced by applying ERF to turbulent and storage flux. For this purpose, eddy-covariance and profile observations from the 447 m tall AmeriFlux Park Falls WLEF tower in Wisconsin, USA are used. To construct the coupled ERF, eddy-covariance and profile observations are related to surface properties using a flux and a scalar concentration source-area model, respectively. Through superposition, we demonstrate enhanced performance in mapping observed net ecosystem exchange, and the potential to also diagnose advective contributions. These advances promise significant improvements for model-data comparison, assimilation and model building.",

            "abstract": "As part of a project on the cycling of mercury (Hg) from the ocean to fog and deposition to land in coastal California, the whiskers of pumas from coastal and inland populations in California were analyzed for total Hg (HgT). Previous studies have shown that fog water in coastal California contains enhanced concentrations of monomethyl Hg (MMHg) compared to rain water. The likely source of fog MMHg is from evasion and demethylation of dimethyl Hg (DMHg) from coastal ocean upwelling. The California coast receives seasonal inputs of fog drip, and we hypothesized that if fog water deposition of MMHg was making an impact, the observable effects might be seen in high trophic level predators of the terrestrial ecosystem. Puma whiskers from 88 individuals from the Santa Cruz Mountains, a sub-range of the California Coast Range, were obtained and compared with puma whiskers from 12 individuals from the foothills of the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Mean total Hg in puma whiskers from the coastal population is 1.0 ± 1.5 ug Hg / g whisker (ppm), whereas mean HgT from the inland puma population is 0.13 ± 0.09 ppm. The difference between these means is significant to the 95% confidence level. For the coastal puma population, the whiskers from 10 individuals had HgT concentrations > 2.0 ppm and 3 individuals had HgT > 4 ppm, which exceeds the U.S. EPA reference dose for humans (1 ppm) approaches a level of concern found for other large mammals such as polar bears (5 ppm). The study is ongoing and HgT concentrations will be determined in the fur and flesh of deer from the same locations as the puma whiskers, since deer comprise ~95% of the puma diet. Samples of plants that are likely fed upon by deer that span the coastal-inland transect will also be analyzed for HgT. Estimates of fog frequency spatial patterns, derived from weather satellite observations and topographic modeling, will be compared with the HgT content of plant and animal tissue in coastal California to quantify relationships between biological uptake of HgT and summertime fog frequencies.",

The IPR survey results suggested that much of the glacier area investigated was underlain by fiord channels that extended as much as 50 km inland from the present Gulf of Alaska coastline. Maximum measured fiord channel bed depths exceeded 200 m below sea level, while the maximum ice thickness measured was more than 850 m. The IPR survey was conducted to test a hypothesis (Molnia and Jones, 1989) that unusual airborne radar backscatter features observed on a November 1986 X-band, high-resolution, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image of the glacier’s surface were expressions of the glacier’s bed morphology, surface topography, surface wetness, ice structure, and ice flow characteristics. The most significant type of feature seen on the SAR image were several 10-25 km-long by 1.5-2.5-km-wide, north-south trending fiord-like glacial valleys, each with adjacent cirque-like amphitheaters. Field surveys in 1989 showed the valleys were topographic lows, while the cirque-like features were heavily crevassed topographic highs. Closely spaced IPR soundings showed that the ice associated with the valleys is substantially thicker than the ice over the adjacent cirques.\nIn 2008 and again in 2012, NASA’s airborne Warm Ice Sounding Explorer (WISE) was flown over Malaspina Glacier, producing more than 500 km of new soundings. Not only did this provide an opportunity to better map the glacier’s bed, calculate ice thickness, and determine ice surface elevations, it also provided an opportunity to reexamine the Molnia and Jones hypothesis.\nBed morphology profiles generated from the WISE data were co-registered to and compared with the 1986 X-band radar image. The results show a strong correlation between radar surface low backscatter surface channel features and areas of maximum bed depth.",

Improved site preference information will help constrain thermodynamic descriptions of the substitution mechanisms, making them more useful to geobarometric and geothermometric techniques.\nUsing high field magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), we constrain the site preferences of minor and trace amounts (2000 to 400 mol ppm) of aluminum in extremely pure synthetic forsterite, clinoenstatite and periclase. The primary challenge of this research is determining how much of each of the aluminum species observed by NMR in the bulk sample (abundances and coordinations) resides in the major synthesized mineral. In our samples, the aluminum partitions between small amounts (often <1%) of impurity phases with high aluminum concentrations, such as glass and accessory crystals, and the major, intended phase with low aluminum concentrations. We use EPMA composition maps to locate scarce impurity phases and EPMA point analyses to determine the aluminum concentrations in both the intended major phase and in the impurity phases. Long NMR acquisitions (several days) and careful subtraction of rotor background signals (present in even ‘low-Al’ zirconia rotor materials) are required to obtain adequate signal-to-noise ratios at such low concentrations.\nOrdered octahedral aluminum has been identified in forsterite, clinoenstatite, and periclase. Disordered 4, 5 and 6 coordinated aluminum species have also been observed, but it is still unclear if the disordered species are in the major mineral phases, the impurity phases or both.",

Such exchanges therefore act to influence nutrient fate and transport, and have not yet been captured and incorporated into our understanding of stream nutrient retention and export. Along Colorado’s Front Range, research in alpine and subalpine catchments has documented consistent increases in nitrate export, likely due to increased nitrogen deposition from industrialization and fertilization in eastern Colorado. The state of montane zone catchments with respect to their ability to cycle nitrate is not as well understood, however, and such ecosystems have complex hydrologic regimes relative to alpine areas. We applied a fully informed hydrologic mass balance model and nitrate mass balance model that include gross gains and gross losses (bidirectional exchanges) along a 1000 m study reach, to better understand physical and biological nitrate removal for a Colorado montane zone catchment, Lower Gordon Gulch. We collected data during five synoptic stream tracer and sampling campaigns along our study reach during the 2014-2015 water year, and installed wells along the north-facing and south-facing riparian corridor to capture changing water tables. Four distinct hydrologic regimes are captured in our results, including two experiments during baseflow, one experiment following snowmelt, one experiment following late-spring rainfall, and one experiment during the start of the seasonal hydrograph recession in mid-summer. Results show a transition from hydrologic sources of nitrate following snowmelt, to biological sources during rainfall, to biological removal during summer, and finally to hydrologic removal during baseflow. Our findings also corroborate earlier work in montane zone streams that shows preferential flow on south-facing slopes and matrix flow with greater microbial activity on north-facing slopes following snowmelt. Our model acts as a tool to separate physical and biological processes acting to influence nitrate transport, while allowing us to analyze the relative importance of each in tandem.",

            "abstract": "Although large opportunities exist for compressed air energy storage (CAES) in aquifers and depleted natural gas reservoirs, only two grid-scale CAES facilities exist worldwide, both in salt caverns. As such, experience with CAES in porous media, what we call PM-CAES, is lacking and we have relied on modeling to elucidate PM-CAES processes. PM-CAES operates similarly to cavern CAES. Specifically, working gas (air) is injected through well(s) into the reservoir compressing the cushion gas (existing air in the reservoir). During energy recovery, high-pressure air from the reservoir flows first into a recuperator, then into an expander, and subsequently is mixed with fuel in a combustion turbine to produce electricity, thereby reducing compression costs. Energy storage in porous media is complicated by the solid matrix grains which provide resistance to flow (via permeability in Darcy’s law); in the cap rock, low-permeability matrix provides the seal to the reservoir. The solid grains also provide storage capacity for heat that might arise from compression, viscous flow effects, or chemical reactions. The storage of energy in PM-CAES occurs variably across pressure gradients in the formation, while the solid grains of the matrix can release/store heat. Residual liquid (i.e., formation fluids) affects flow and can cause watering out at the production well(s). PG&E is researching a potential 300 MW (for ten hours) PM-CAES facility in a depleted gas reservoir near Lodi, California. Special considerations exist for depleted natural gas reservoirs because of mixing effects which can lead to undesirable residual methane (CH4) entrainment and reactions of oxygen and CH4. One strategy for avoiding extensive mixing of working gas (air) with reservoir CH4 is to inject an initial cushion gas with reduced oxygen concentration providing a buffer between the working gas (air) and the residual CH4 gas. This reduces the potential mixing of the working air with the residual CH4. Compositional simulations of this approach using TOUGH2 with a detailed 3D model of the PG&E test reservoir show the pre-conditioning approach is effective at decreasing CH4entrainment and oxygen mixing.\nAcknowledgment: We thank Joe Chan (PG&E), Jim Fairchild (Fairchild & Assoc.), and Charlie Stinson (CS Energy Ventures) for support and collaboration.",

The model includes a prognostic aerosol scheme where accumulation mode aerosol particles can be activated into cloud droplets, impaction scavenged, and regenerated upon cloud droplet evaporation or ice crystal sublimation. Two sets of simulations were performed, one with a constant aerosol concentration in the boundary layer and free troposphere, and one with enhanced free tropospheric concentrations based on observed aerosol concentration profiles. We find that the rate of aerosol depletion in the boundary layer is an order of magnitude larger than the median surface emission rates measured over the open water, indicating that for the present case the surface emissions are unlikely to compensate for aerosol loss due to interactions with clouds. In this case study, when the enhanced free troposphere aerosol concentrations are included, the entrainment of these particles into the boundary layer is able to offset the loss of particles from aerosol-cloud interactions. These results suggest that enhanced levels of accumulation mode particles, if located at the cloud top, may be an important source of accumulation mode particles in the Arctic boundary layer.\n[1] The Arctic Summer Cloud Ocean Study (ASCOS) was conducted in 2008 with the overall aim to improve our understanding of stratus cloud formation and possible climate feedback processes over the central Arctic Ocean.

            "abstract": "Exposure to wildfire smoke plumes represents an episodic, uncertain, and potentially growing threat to public health in the western United States. The area burned by wildfires in this region has increased over recent decades, and the future of fires within this region is largely unknown. Future fire emissions are intimately linked to future meteorological conditions, which are uncertain due to the variability of climate model outputs and differences between representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios. We know that exposure to wildfire smoke is harmful, particularly for vulnerable populations. However the literature on the heath effects of wildfire smoke exposure is thin, particularly when compared to the depth of information we have on the effects of exposure to smoke of anthropogenic origin.\nWe are exploring the relationships between climate, fires, air quality and public health through multiple interdisciplinary collaborations. We will present several examples from these projects including 1) an analysis of the influence of fire on ozone abundances over the United States, and 2) efforts to use a high-resolution weather forecasting model to nail down exposure within specific smoke plumes. We will also highlight how our team works together. This discussion will include examples of the university structure that facilitates our current collaborations, and the lessons we have learned by seeking stakeholder input to make our science more useful.",

            "abstract": "The classical view of relating mid-Miocene rhyolites of the tri-state area of Oregon, Nevada, and Idaho to the flood basalts of the Columbia River Basalt was that a mantle plume impinging along the Oregon-Idaho border first causes eruption of the flood basalts but shortly thereafter causes generation of rhyolites at the McDermitt volcanic field from which then hot-spot track rhyolites developed progressively younging towards Yellowstone. More recent work reveals rhyolites as old as found at McDermitt (~16.5 Ma) to occur along a wide E-W tangent along the Oregon-Nevada-Idaho border. And now, our data extend such early rhyolites (>16 Ma) to several locations further north within and in the periphery of the Lake Owyhee Volcanic Field (LOVF) adding to the geographically orphaned old age of 16.7 Ma of the Silver City Rhyolite, Idaho. Hence, the rhyolite flare-up associated with flood basalt magmatism occurred within a circular area of ~400 km centered 100 km NNE of McDermitt. Consequently, no south-to-north progression exists in the onset of rhyolite volcanism; instead, rhyolites started up at the same time over this large area. Province-wide rhyolite volcanism was strongest between ~16.4 and 15.4 Ma coincident with eruptions of the most voluminous member of the CRBG – the Grande Ronde Basalt (GRB). Field evidence for such bimodal volcanism consists of intercalated local GRB units with the Dinner Creek Tuff and Littlefield Rhyolite in the Malheur River Gorge corridor. GRB eruption sites exist and were likely fed from reservoirs residing below or near rhyolitic chambers. Presently, we have petrological evidence for pinning down GRB storages sites to areas from where rhyolites of the Dinner Creek Tuff and lava flows of the Littlefield Rhyolite erupted. In summary, input of GRG and other CRBG magmas were driving co-CRBG rhyolite volcanism which in turn may have influenced whether flood basalt magmas erupted locally or travelled in dikes to more distally located areas.",

Although the majority of spacecraft do not carry dedicated dust detectors, those with antenna-based instruments routinely observe impulsive signals from dust impacts on the spacecraft and antennas. Recent analysis of signals from the STEREO spacecraft WAVES electric field sensors, and unexpected high-altitude observations at Mars by MAVEN’s LPW instrument, highlight the opportunity for in-situ dust detection by such spacecraft.\nHowever, quantitative interpretation of the spacecraft data currently suffers from large uncertainties, including the quantity and energy distribution of charged particles released, the effect of the spacecraft configuration and impact location, and the near-spacecraft electric fields and plasma environment. We report a series of experiments conducted at the IMPACT hypervelocity dust accelerator facility at the University of Colorado Boulder, to investigate (1) the effects of spacecraft and antenna potential on charge recollection and consequent signals, (2) the energy distribution of charged particles produced by dust impacts on realistic spacecraft materials at various speeds, and (3) the influence of spacecraft geometry, using impacts distributed across a high-fidelity model of the STEREO spacecraft. Implications for future spacecraft observations are also discussed.",

The relative contribution of each heavy ion species to ULF wave generation and propagation still needs to be further investigated to understand ring current heavy ion dynamics. We present data from the ion composition (Radiation Belt Storm Probes Ion Composition Experiment; RBSPICE) and field (Electric and Magnetic Field Instrument Suite and Integrated Science; EMFISIS) instruments onboard Van Allen Probes to examine ULF wave activity in the presence of heavy ions and the scattering of heavy ions.

            "abstract": "Non-uniqueness for extended fault slip inversions is well-known and current efforts are focused on assessing and understanding the uncertainties. These ambiguities can be explored through Popperian falsification, where trial models either become members of the solution ensemble or are falsified resulting due to a large data misfit. Classification of slip-maps according to different measures of similarity can help to interpret the inversion results and test different hypotheses for the source process. As a feasibility study, we selected two moderate sized earthquakes with observed source directivities, the 2011 Mw 5.2 Lorca (Spain) mainshock and Mw 4.6 foreshock. We first obtained the Apparent Source Time Functions (ASTF) from a deconvolution using the largest aftershock (Mw 3.9) as an empirical Green's function. We then used a global inversion scheme for random slip-maps with a von Karman autocorrelation function in order to fit the ASTFs. The resolution of rupture directivity is assessed with two quantitative parameters, the direction and amount of asymmetry of the solution slip-maps. This is performed using the moment centroids of the solutions and displayed as directivity rose plots. The individual solutions of the ensembles for the mainshock and foreshock show a similar directivity distribution but have a variable fine structure of slip. We therefore applied a spatial comparison test to find slip-map families with similar rupture patterns. This can be used to identify sub-groups of slip models within the overall solution ensemble according to specified similarity criteria, and evaluate the resolution and ambiguities of the Popperian solution set.",

            "abstract": "Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) events in the atmosphere are important physical phenomena that occur through both man-made and natural processes, such as lightning, and can be disruptive to surrounding electrical systems. Due to the disruptive nature of EMP, it is important to accurately predict EMP evolution and propagation with computational models. In EMP, low-energy conduction electrons are produced from Compton electron or photoelectron ionizations with air. These conduction electrons continue to interact with the surrounding air and alter the EMP waveform. Many EMP simulation codes use an equilibrium ohmic model for computing the conduction current. The equilibrium model works well when the equilibration time is short compared to the rise time or duration of the EMP. However, at high altitude, the conduction electron equilibration time can be comparable to or longer than the rise time or duration of the EMP. This matters, for example, when calculating the EMP propagating upward toward a satellite. In these scenarios, the equilibrium ionization rate becomes very large for even a modest electric field. The ohmic model produces an unphysically large number of conduction electrons that prematurely and abruptly short the EMP in the simulation code. An electron swarm model, which simulates the time evolution of conduction electrons, can be used to overcome the limitations exhibited by the equilibrium ohmic model.\nWe have developed and validated an electron swarm model in an environment characterized by electric field and pressure previously in Pusateri et al. (2015). This swarm model has been integrated into CHAP-LA, a state-of-the-art EMP code developed by researchers at Los Alamos National Laboratory, which previously calculated conduction current using an ohmic model. We demonstrate the EMP damping behavior caused by the ohmic model at high altitudes and show improvements on high altitude EMP modeling obtained by employing the swarm model.",

These data can reduce our uncertainty of the regional effects of contrail-generated cirrus on global radiative forcing, and thus improve our estimation of the impact of aviation on climate change. We continue our work to create a multi-year climatology of the physical properties of linear contrails from multi-spectral satellite observations.\nWe use an automated contrail detection algorithm (CDA) to determine the coverage of linear persistent contrails over the Northern Hemisphere during 2012. The contrail detection algorithm is a modified form of the Mannstein et al. (1999) method, and uses several channels from thermal infrared MODIS data to reduce the occurrence of false positive detections. Global aircraft emissions waypoint data provided by FAA allow comparison of detected contrails with commercial aircraft flight tracks. A pixel-level product based on the advected flight tracks defined by the waypoint data and U-V wind component profiles from the NASA GMAO MERRA reanalyses has been developed to assign a confidence of contrail detection for the contrail mask. To account for possible contrail cirrus missed by the CDA, a post-processing method based on the assumption that pixels adjacent to detected linear contrails will have radiative signatures similar to those of the detected contrails is applied to the Northern Hemisphere data.\nResults from MODIS measurements during 2012 will be presented, representing a near-global climatology of contrail coverage. Linear contrail coverage will be compared with coverage estimates determined previously from 2006 MODIS data and with maps of potential persistent contrail formation derived from MERRA reanalysis data for both 2006 and 2012. In addition, contrail physical properties such as optical depth and particle size derived from the contrail coverage data using a multi-spectral cloud property retrieval method will also be shown. The contrail coverage and physical property data will also be included in radiative transfer calculations to estimate radiative forcing due to linear contrails over the Northern Hemisphere during 2012.",

The convection process is modeled by a system of partial differential equations describing the conservation of mass, momentum and energy. Characteristic to mantle flow is the vast disparity of length scales from global to microscopic, turning mantle convection simulations into a challenging application for high-performance computing. As system size and technical complexity of the simulations continue to increase, design and implementation of simulation models for next generation large-scale architectures is handled successfully only in an interdisciplinary context. A new priority program - named SPPEXA - by the German Research Foundation (DFG) addresses this issue, and brings together computer scientists, mathematicians and application scientists around grand challenges in HPC. Here we report from the TERRA-NEO project, which is part of the high visibility SPPEXA program, and a joint effort of four research groups. TERRA-NEO develops algorithms for future HPC infrastructures, focusing on high computational efficiency and resilience in next generation mantle convection models. We present software that can resolve the Earth's mantle with up to 10$^{12}$ grid points and scales efficiently to massively parallel hardware with more than 50,000 processors. We use our simulations to explore the dynamic regime of mantle convection and assess the impact of small scale processes on global mantle flow.",

Using the quartz fiber filter-collected samples, elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), inorganic ionic species, and organic markers were measured. More than 100 organic markers including levoglucosan, a marker of open burning, were measured using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) after derivatization. Using the Teflon filter-collected samples, particulate mass, elements, and biological redox activity using an in-vitro rat alveolar macrophage reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay were measured. The PM2.5 concentrations were higher in February–March and the annual average was 13.6 μg m–3. The EC and OC concentrations were higher in March and September. Levoglucosan concentrations were remarkably higher in fall and winter (September–March) with maximum in November, suggesting enhanced biomass burning contribution. The ROS activity of the PM2.5 (per air volume) was higher in spring (April) and summer (July). PM2.5 sources as estimated by a chemical mass balance model using the organic markers, and relationships of redox activity with chemical species and emission sources will be presented.",

            "abstract": "In September 2013, the Boulder Creek watershed (BCW) was severely affected by a 1000-year precipitation event when 17 inches of rain – nearly the annual average – fell over Boulder, Colorado, USA in just eight days. This rainfall caused an unprecedented flood within the BCW. While the enormous amount of water that fell appeared to have left within days, we hypothesize that a majority of the water that fell during the event was not discharged via surface runoff, but infiltrated into the subsurface.\nThis study aims to understand how the subsurface responds to extreme precipitation events by quantifying the volume of precipitation that infiltrates into the vadose zone, the change in subsurface water storage, and the spatial and temporal scale of these effects as caused by extreme events. This study focuses on a small drainage basin that lies within the BCW. This site is actively monitored and provides data of importance for hydrologic modeling. The data include groundwater elevation, soil moisture, stream discharge, and precipitation records. The hydrologic structure of the basin consists of a thin, sandy soil layer that caps weathered regolith and saprolite sourced from underlying crystalline basement bedrock.\nWe use the HYDRUS model to numerically solve the Richards equation for variably saturated flow to simulate 2D groundwater flow both below the groundwater table and in the vadose zone. Average annual precipitation values and groundwater elevation measurements are used to estimate the initial subsurface conditions prior to the event. Atmospheric boundary conditions estimated from meteorological stations are then applied to the top of the model to simulate the extreme event. Preliminary results indicate that the extreme event led to a rise in the groundwater table of up to a meter at low-lying elevations near basin drainages and up to two meters below hillslopes that persisted for over a month after the rain stopped.",

            "abstract": "East Antarctica is a keystone in the Gondwana, Rodinia and the Columbia supercontinents. Recent aerogeophysical research, augmented by satellite magnetic, gravity and seismological data is unveiling the crustal architecture of the continent. This is helping comprehend the impact of supercontinental processes such as subduction, accretion, rifting and intraplate tectonics on its evolution.\nA mosaic of Precambrian basement provinces is apparent in interior East Antarctica (Ferraccioli et al., 2011, Nature). A major suture separates the Archean-Neoproterozoic Ruker Province from an inferred Grenvillian-age orogenic Gamburtsev Province with remarkably thick crust (up to 60 km thick) and thick lithosphere (over 200 km thick). The age of the suturing and its linkages with supercontinental assembly is debated with both Rodinia and Gondwana candidates being proposed. Further east, magnetic highs delineate a Paleo to Mesoproterozoic Nimrod-South Pole igneous province (Goodge and Finn, 2010 JGR) that flanks a composite Mawson Continent- including the Gawler Craton of South Australia (Aitken et al., 2014 GRL). An over 1,900 km long magnetic and gravity lineament is imaged along the western flank of the Wilkes Subglacial Basin and is interpreted here as a major Paleoproterozoic suture zone linked to the collision of Laurentia and East Antarctica within Columbia. The proposed suture played a pivotal role helping localise Neoproterozoic Rodinia rifted margin evolution and forming a backstop for the Ross-Delamerian cycle of Gondwana amalgamation.\nAeromagnetic and gravity imaging help determine the extent of a Keweenawan-age (ca 1.1 Ga) large igneous province in the Coats Land Block -isotopically tied with the Mid-Continent Rift System of Laurentia (Loewy et al., 2011 Geology). Imprints of Grenvillian magmatic arc accretion link together the Namaqua-Natal and Maud belts in South Africa and Dronning Maud Land within Rodinia. The aeromagnetically distinct Southeast Dronning Maud Land province (Mieth and Jokat, 2014 GR) may represent a separate 1000-900 Ma Oceanic Arc Superterrane (Jacobs et al., 2015 Prec. Res.). New geophysical views of the Shackleton Range suture lend weight to more complex collisional and indentation tectonic models for the Pan-African age assembly of Gondwana.",

It has been demonstrated for both MODIS and Landsat sensors that temperature measurements from floating buoys maintained by NOAA along with atmospheric information provided by radiosonde profile data can be used to model top-of-atmosphere calibration truth. However, this process is highly sensitive to accurate atmospheric knowledge. This work improves upon the previous methodologies by substituting North American Regional Re-analysis (NARR) data for radiosonde profiles in the top-of-atmosphere modeling process. A streamlined procedure is developed to automatically ingest NOAA buoy temperature data along with the appropriate NARR atmosphere data in order to model the expected top-of-atmosphere radiance for the given sensor (Landsat 8/TIRS in this case).",

In this paper, we present results from ASTRA’s Ionospheric Data Assimilation Four-Dimensional (IDA4D) algorithm to compare and contrast ionospheric response to the 2009 and 2013 SSW events. The ionospheric response in both years was characterized by above normal TECs during the day-time and below average TECs during the night-time. We compared the IDA4D results to highlight significant differences between the ionospheric responses to the 2009 and 2013 SSWs. The ionospheric anomaly during the 2009 SSW event was primarily driven by the non-migrating semidiurnal tide. This is in contrast to the ionospheric variability seen during the 2013 SSW event which exhibited a distinct structure of a migrating semidiurnal tide. These results pose a question as to whether these differences were due to the differences in tides generated in the lower atmosphere or in-situ forcing. We use measurements from the NASA Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) mission to understand the role of various upward atmospheric tides and planetary waves on the ionosphere during the 2009 and 2013 SSW events.",

            "abstract": "We analyzed 12.6-cm Earth-based radar images of the Moon to search for older craters (pre-Copernican) that display high values of the circular polarization ratio (CPR) on their interior walls. These craters have highly eroded rims and ejecta, indicating that there must be a source exposed within the crater interior that is continuously creating a rougher surface. Of particular interest are craters between 10-25 km in diameter that occur in smooth plains in the highlands, where competent layers are not expected as they are for the mare. After identifying these high-CPR interiors in pre-Copernican craters, we studied LROC NAC and Kaguya TC images to search for possible albedo and layering on crater interior walls that might signal the presence of anomalous material. Our results indicate that high-CPR craters generally have boulder fields clustered around their upper interior walls. We divide the high-CPR craters into three types: (1) craters on the layered mare lava flows; (2) craters in the highlands that correlate to mapped locations of smooth plains; and (3) craters on the highlands that are not associated with smooth plains. Most of the high-CPR craters in the highlands are associated with Eratosthenian-period craters, and most of these are also on smooth plains, indicating that impact melt sheets are a likely source for the boulders exposed on their interior walls. Statistical analyses will be performed after incorporating multiple lunar datasets into GIS to quantify these preliminary interpretations.\nFigure 1.

            "abstract": "The effects of aerosols on climate are poorly understood, specifically with respect to their influence on cloud properties. Since oceans cover >70% of Earth’s surface, sea spray aerosols (SSA), which act efficiently as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), may have important implications on Earth’s radiation budget. Surface active organic species readily accumulate in the sea surface microlayer (SML), located at the ocean-atmosphere interface, and transfer onto nascent SSA. While it is understood that SSA are commonly enriched with organics, the resulting effect of the organic content on CCN activation remains unresolved. The hygroscopicity parameter, kappa (k), allows for the cloud nucleating properties of individual components to be predicted in particles of mixed composition; however, most studies typically infer k from ambient measurements without assessing the contribution of the individual components to the overall k. In this study, a method for quantifying the cloud nucleating properties of the organic species in surface seawater using k-Kohler theory is proposed. Ambient SML and bulk water samples will be collected and atomized to generate particles such that the overall k can be inferred from CCN measurements. The inorganic and organic components will be quantified, and the organic component will be separated so that the hygroscopicity of only the organic constituents can be determined. By comparing the inferred k values for the samples before and after removal of the inorganic component, the hygroscopicity of the organic constituents alone can be calculated, providing insight on the effect of organic species on CCN activation in SSA.",

We have established a sub-annual resolution depth-age relationship for the upper 198 meters of a 208 m ice core recovered in 2013 from Mt. Hunter (3,900 m asl), Denali National Park, central Alaska. The dating of the ice core was accomplished via annual layer counting of glaciochemical time-series combined with identification of reference horizons from volcanic eruptions and atmospheric nuclear weapons testing. Using the continuous ice core melter system at Dartmouth College, sub-seasonal samples have been collected and analyzed for major ions, liquid conductivity, particle size and concentration, and stable isotope ratios. Annual signals are apparent in several of the chemical species measured in the ice core samples. Calcium and magnesium peak in the spring, ammonium peaks in the summer, methanesulfonic acid (MSA) peaks in the autumn, and stable isotopes display a strong seasonal cycle with the most depleted values occurring during the winter. Thin ice layers representing infrequent summertime melt were also used to identify summer layers in the core. Analysis of approximately one meter sections of the core via nondestructive gamma spectrometry over depths from 84 to 124 m identified a strong radioactive cesium-137 peak at 89 m which corresponds to the 1963 layer deposited during extensive atmospheric nuclear weapons testing. Peaks in the sulfate and chloride record have been used for the preliminary identification of volcanic signals preserved in the ice core, including ten events since 1883. We are confident that the combination of robust annual layers combined with reference horizons provides a timescale for the 20th century that has an error of less than 0.5 years, making calibrations between ice core records and the instrumental climate data particularly robust. Initial annual layer counting through the entire 198 m suggests the Denali Ice Core record will span the past 1000 years.",

            "abstract": "The central Andes is the type example of a Cordilleran orogen where mountain-building coincides with Nazca plate subduction. Crustal thicknesses of 50-70 km are due primarily to shortening of the South American crust and magmatic addition from below. The orogen has been further modified by processes that remove mass, such as subduction erosion, ablation, surface erosion, and convective removal of the deep lithosphere. Here, we address mantle dynamics below the Puna plateau in the southern central Andes. Seismic tomography and other geophysical studies show that the mantle lithosphere is thin (<30 km) despite the thickened crust. This region is also characterized by localized (<100 km wide) areas of anomalous surface uplift/subsidence and magmatism that is derived from both lithospheric and asthenospheric sources. These can not be explained by orogenic shortening, as paleoelevation studies indicate that this region achieved its modern elevation by 40 Ma, and structural studies show that most current shortening is localized on the eastern side of the plateau. We use numerical models to demonstrate that the localized dynamics may be related to small-scale lithospheric removal induced by the presence of dense pyroxenite. To create a significant surface deflection, the pyroxenite must originate within, or just below, the crust. If the pyroxenite is removed as small drips (diameter <10 km), the drips can melt during descent. This is followed by decompression melting of the upwelling asthenosphere. The models also highlight the role of the crust in modulating the surface expressions of removal. If the crust is thick and warm (Moho >600C), flow within the deep crust can be triggered during removal, resulting in surface uplift prior to pyroxenite removal. In addition, flow of hot crust toward the dripping pyroxenite results in significant local crustal heating on timescales <20 Ma.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Final Poster 12.14.15.pdf\nTransformed from the largest wetland system on the west coast of the United States to agriculture, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta is an extreme teaching example of anthropogenic threats to sustainability. For over 6,000 years, over 280,000 ha of intertidal freshwater marsh accreted due to seal level rise and sediment deposition. Farming of organic soils since 1850 resulted in land subsidence caused primarily by oxidation. Over 2 billion cubic meters of soil were lost resulting in elevations on Delta islands ranging from -1 to -8 m and increased risk of levee failures and water supply disruption. Alteration of water flows and habitat caused dramatic declines in aquatic species. A cycle in which oxidation of organic soils leads to deepening of drainage ditches to maintain an aerated root zone which in turn results in sustained oxidation and subsidence is perpetuated by the momentum of the status quo despite evidence that agricultural practices are increasingly unsustainable. Flooding of the soils breaks the oxidation/subsidence cycle.\nWe assessed alternate land uses and the carbon market as a potential impetus for change. Using the peer-reviewed and locally calibrated SUBCALC model, we estimated net global warming potential for a range of scenarios for a representative island, from status quo to incorporating significant proportions of subsidence-mitigating land use. We analyzed economic implications by determining profit losses or gains when a simulated GHG offset market is available for wetlands using a regional agricultural production and economic optimization model, We estimated baseline GHG emissions at about 60,000 tons CO2-e per year. In contrast, modeled implementation of rice and wetlands resulted in substantial emissions reductions to the island being a net GHG sink. Subsidence would be arrested or reversed where these land uses are implemented. Results of economic modeling reveal that conversion to wetlands can have significant negative farm financial impacts even when a GHG offset market is in place. Conversion to large areas of rice would result in near carbon neutrality and increased farm income. Our derived wetland supply function can help inform future policy that may incentivize adoption of a more sustainable landscape.",

            "abstract": "Bedrock river channel erosion is an important factor in the evolution of landscapes, driving the relief of mountainous drainage basins and setting the lowest erosional positions of terrestrial landscapes. The mechanics behind erosional processes (predominantly plucking and abrasion) in these rivers are only recently being explored in depth. Plucking, the fracture and extraction of jointed blocks, is observationally an order of magnitude more efficient than abrasion, but if a river cannot provide the force necessary to move the plucked block, erosion by plucking cannot proceed. Therefore, incipient motion of blocks starting at rest on a solid surface is an important factor in erosion by plucking. Calculations of forces necessary for incipient motion require values of drag coefficients, which do not exist for bedrock contact geometry. We discovered from experiments on a flume that drag coefficients (CD) are inversely proportional to aspect ratios (RA), defined as the frontal block height to width. We used the relationship with field data from plucked blocks at a stream at Montgomery Bell State Park in Burns, TN, a mixed-alluvial bedrock channel with an actively incising knick zone, to support our theory and experimental data. Sizes of plucked blocks were compared to the velocities needed to move them, and then calculations done for bankfull velocities at the stream at Montgomery Bell to determine if it could attain these velocities. It was discovered that this stream has a bankfull depth-averaged velocity of 1.26 m s-1 and is capable of moving a large range of plucked block sizes. Therefore, erosion of this particular stream is plucking-limited, not transport-limited.",

            "abstract": "Since 2009, NASA's Operation IceBridge mission has undertaken an annual campaign of measuring sea ice thickness in the western Arctic. The combined suite of laser, radar, visible, and infrared instruments provides an incredibly rich set of data for accurately measuring sea ice thickness at a variety of scales, and has broad implications for extension beyond the IceBridge mission. The traditional approach to measuring sea ice thickness is taken from hydrostatic balance assumptions and measurements of the sea ice freeboard and snow thickness. In going beyond the traditional methods previously employed, this work will present new techniques for the remote sensing of sea ice thickness, which will allow for a more accurate record focusing on retrieval of the full thickness distribution of sea ice. The retrieval of thin sea ice thickness is shown through the use of a simple thermodynamic calculation and surface temperature retrievals from a new high resolution thermal infrared camera installed on the IceBridge mission in 2015. The retrieval of sea ice thickness from ridged and deformed sea ice is shown through use of the high resolution of the IceBridge ATM laser altimeter. Together with surface topography measurements, the high spatial resolution ultra-wideband radar suite on the IceBridge mission is currently being used to provide information on the thickness of snow on sea ice. We will discuss how the extension of the IceBridge radar and topography results has wide applicability to improving the retrieval of sea ice freeboard and thickness from CryoSat-2 since the physical mechanisms governing the scattering of radar returns are very similar. Lastly, we will demonstrate a new approach which synthesizes the combined knowledge generated by the IceBridge airborne data set along with satellite and model data sources to produce a record of sea ice thickness change in the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "In most clay-rock geological formation studied for the storage of nuclear waste, pore water compositions are expected to be at equilibrium with carbonate minerals, which are always included in predictive models for pore water composition calculations [1]. Among the carbonates known to be present, dolomite may be problematic in the pore water composition calculation because its solubility spans a large range of values as a function of its crystallinity in thermodynamic databases. In addition, the composition of dolomite minerals observed in clay-rock formations such as Callovian-Oxfordian or Opalinus clay formation differs from this of a pure dolomite: the Ca/Mg stoichiometry is not ideal, and the minerals contain minor amounts of Fe and traces of many other elements [2].\nTo understand the influence of secondary phases precipitation during dolomite dissolution on pore water chemistry, the dissolution of monocrystals of dolomite were investigated at 25 °C and at 80 °C in a pH range 3 to 8 for various time periods (30 minutes to 21 days) in sealed PTFE reactors. Solution analyses evidenced a stoichiometric release of Ca and Mg in solution during dolomite dissolution. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Raman and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) analyses did not evidence secondary Mg-bearing minerals precipitation, but revealed the formation of Fe-bearing particles on the dolomite surface. Morphological characterizations performed with Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) evidenced that the precipitation occurs along a specific crystallographic plane of the dolomite monocrystal. Thus, the precipitated nanoparticles clustered on specific surface sites, and are made of Fe-rich phases poorly crystallized (carbonates, oxides and hydroxides).\n[1] Tournassat et al. 2015.

In fact, the past five years have shown dramatic variation in snowpack from a high of 174% of normal in 2010-11 to a low of 11% for 2014-15, one of the lowest on record. During this timeframe, we have monitored the stable isotopes of water within the Willamette River twice monthly, and mapped the spatial variation of water isotopes across the basin. Within the Willamette Basin, stable isotopes of water in precipitation vary strongly with elevation and provide a marker for determining the mean elevation from which water in the Willamette River is derived. In the winter when snow accumulates in the mountains, low elevation precipitation (primarily rain) contributes the largest proportion of water to the Willamette River. During summer when rainfall is scarce and demand for water is the greatest, water in the Willamette River is mainly derived from high elevation snowmelt. Our data indicate that the proportion of water from high elevation decreased with decreasing snowpack. We combine this information with the river flow data to estimate the volume reduction related to snow pack reduction during the dry summer. Observed reductions in the contribution of high elevation water to the Willamette River after just two years of diminished snowpack indicate that the hydrologic system responds relatively rapidly to changing snowpack volume. Reconciling the demands between human use and biological instream requirements during summer will be challenging under climatic conditions in which winter snowpack is reduced compared to historical amounts.",

One potential strategy that have been developed with this purpose is the use of P sorption materials (PSMs) to sequester P from water systems, which is the objective of this study.\nWe evaluated the performance of steel slag, an industrial by-product with high P sorption potential, through a flume experiment under two different subsurface hydrological conditions, drainage and saturation, and two input P concentrations, 1 and 5 ppm.\nThe 10-m flume configuration, designed to simulate processes occurring in a drainage ditch, is comprised of four 2.5-m sequential segments: a sediment bed, a slag bed over sediment, a slag dam built over a slag bed, and another sediment bed. In the experiments, all four segments of the flume were set to either saturation or with a constant drainage (percolation) of 0.1 L/min for each segment. The experiment was conducted with a constant flow of elevated P water at 7.3 L/min for 4 hrs (adsorption run) and followed 24 hrs later by a 4-hr run of deionized water (desorption run) at the same inflow rate. The adsorption-desorption cycle was repeated three times with the same sediment and slag materials, to allow testing of the resilience of P sorption under different PSM placement, subsurface hydrologic and P loading conditions.\nPreliminary results from the first adsorption and desorption cycle show that the flow-through slag section sequestered the most P during the adsorption runs. By comparing the different P inflow concentrations analysis, it is clear that the removal process is concentration driven: 83% of the injected P was removed in the 5 ppm as compared to 46% in the 1 ppm saturation run. Because of the higher P removal at 5 ppm P inflow, slightly higher release was also observed during the desorption run. Analyses of the persistence of steel slag as PSM under repeated adsorption and desorption cycles and how subsurface hydrology affects the overall P mass balance will also be presented. Findings of this research will provide additional data and information to develop a strategy to use steel slag in a P removal structure.",

            "abstract": "The prediction of the position and the velocity of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and orbital debris has become particularly important as their number has considerably increased. Some space missions that include measurements of the Earth require the knowledge of the state (position and velocity) of the spacecraft that takes the measurements. Collision avoidance is also a major issue that can only be solved with a particular accurate orbit determination of the objects in orbit. The CYclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) that aims to improve the prediction of tropical cyclones by using a constellation of eight satellites is a good example of a mission that requires a high level of accuracy in the orbit propagation of each of the satellites.\nAfter gravity, the main force acting on LEO satellites is atmospheric drag. The drag force acting on the satellite is directly proportional to the thermospheric density, which is complex to model and predict because of the strong coupling of the thermosphere with the lower atmosphere, the ionosphere (itself driven by the magnetosphere), and the Sun. Therefore, uncertainties in the density are not negligible at these altitudes and are an important cause of the uncertainties on the position of a satellite.\nMany groups have worked on the prediction of inputs of the space environment that impact the density of the thermosphere (solar wind speed, Interplanetary Magnetic Field, F10.7, Ap/Kp). However, quantifying the uncertainty on these predictions is also essential. Ensemble forecasts can help quantify how uncertainties in drivers affect the uncertainty in the orbital position of satellites. We use ensemble simulations of the thermosphere, including both empirical and physics-based models, to quantify the relationship between uncertainties in the drivers and orbital position.",

Recently, viable IN bacteria in precipitation have been used as a metric of their possible role in precipitation formation. Although bacterial IN activity is deactivated by a variety of common environmental stresses, we present data showing that IN found in a potpourri of decayed plant leaves, bacteria, molds and fungi etc. in plant litters are exceptionally stable and active over decades while in storage. As such, their atmospheric IN potential is worthy of further study due to their environmental persistence.\nIn August 1970 litter collected in a grove of deciduous trees near Red Deer, AB, Canada was tested for IN (drop freezing technique). The sample initiated ice at -4C with 109 IN per gram of litter active at -10C. A few kilograms were stored in a plastic bag and tested every few years for IN content; the IN activity remained essentially unchanged over 40 years.\nIn 2011, litter collected in the same grove had the same IN activity as the sample tested over the intervening 40 years. Boiling a gram sample of this litter in 100 grams of water deactivated 99 % of the IN activity down to -13C. None of 88 different bacteria cultures several of which appeared to Pseudomonads (common IN producing bacteria) from the fresh litter produced any active IN.\nA sample of the litter was placed on the top of a 15 cm column of laboratory grade kaolin and water dripped onto the litter. Ten days later the water reached the bottom of the column. The kaolin was dried and tested for IN. The prior essentially IN free kaolin now exhibited IN activity at -4C with 105 IN active at -10C. The litter exposed kaolin retained the IN activity for 25 years. Baking the kaolin removed the active IN. This suggests that IN activity attributed to kaolin particles sometimes seen at the nucleus of snow crystals could be of biological origin.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - JK_AGU_Poster2015_v1.pdf\nThe CUAHSI Hydrologic Information System (CUAHSI HIS) provides open access to a large number of hydrological time series observation and modeled data from many parts of the world. Several software tools have been designed to simplify searching and access to the CUAHSI HIS datasets. These software tools include: Desktop client software (HydroDesktop, HydroExcel), developer libraries (WaterML R Package, OWSLib, ulmo), and the new interactive search website,\nhttp://data.cuahsi.org\n. An issue with using the time series data from CUAHSI HIS for further analysis by hydrologists (for example for verification of hydrological and snowpack models) is the large heterogeneity of the time series data. The time series may be regular or irregular, contain missing data, have different time support, and be recorded in different units. R is a widely used computational environment for statistical analysis of time series and spatio-temporal data that can be used to assess fitness and perform scientific analyses on observation data. R includes the ability to record a data analysis in the form of a reusable script. The R script together with the input time series dataset can be shared with other users, making the analysis more reproducible. The major goal of this study is to examine the use of R as a Web Processing Service for transforming time series data from the CUAHSI HIS and sharing the results on the Internet within HydroShare. HydroShare is an online data repository and social network for sharing large hydrological data sets such as time series, raster datasets, and multi-dimensional data. It can be used as a permanent cloud storage space for saving the time series analysis results. We examine the issues associated with running R scripts online: including code validation, saving of outputs, reporting progress, and provenance management. An explicit goal is that the script which is run locally should produce exactly the same results as the script run on the Internet. Our design can be used as a model for other studies that need to run R scripts on the web.",

            "abstract": "Large rivers are important biogeochemistry. The freshwater inputs associated with major river plumes modify the local and regional sea surface salinity (SSS) and in the mean time carry a large amount of organic and inorganic particulates into the ocean. Monitoring of the spatial and temporal variability of river plumes extension is therefore important to the physics and biophysical interaction at regional scales.\nWith the launches of the NASA Aquarius/Sac-D missions and the ESA Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), we are now able to use the low-resolution SSS observations in combination with altimetry and high-resolution ocean color observations to monitor the physical and biogeochemical properties of river plumes.\nOur study focuses on the Amazon River, the world’s largest river in terms of discharge. Waters from the Amazon River are carried northwestward across the equator along the Brazilian shelf by the North Brazilian Current (NBC) and eastward along the North Equatorial Counter Current. Large oceanic rings shed off the NBC retroflection near 8∘N in the North Tropical Atlantic Ocean. Large-scale gradients of SSS, colored detrital matter (cdm) and sea surface temperature (SST) associated with these rings are visible from space using SSS, SST and ocean color sensors. These rings carry freshwaters highly concentrated in organic and inorganic matter towards the Caribbean Sea and offshore.\nIn this study, the surface properties of the river plume oligotrophic waters trapped into these large eddies are analyzed. We use a Lagrangian advection method to track the particles trapped in NBC rings and follow their biophysical properties along the northwestward trajectories using measurements from Aquarius, SMOS, and Aqua MODIS. The pathways of the Amazon plume waters can therefore be analyzed, enabling an investigation of the physical and biogeochemical processes associated with the Amazon River freshwaters as they are advected and mixed from the river mouth to the open ocean.",

            "abstract": "The ROSETTA spacecraft of ESA is in the environment of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko since August 2014. Among the experiments onboard the spacecraft, the ROSINA experiment (Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis) includes two mass spectrometers (DFMS and RTOF) to analyze the composition of neutrals and ions, and a pressure sensor (COPS) to monitor the density and velocity of neutrals in the coma [1].\nWe will here analyze and discuss the data of the ROSINA/RTOF instrument during the comet escort phase. The Reflectron-type Time-Of-Flight (RTOF) mass spectrometer possesses a wide mass range and a high temporal resolution [1,2]. It was designed to measure cometary neutral gas as well as cometary ions.\nA detailed description of the main volatiles (H2O, CO2, CO) dynamics and of the heterogeneities of the coma will then be provided. The influence of various parameters on the coma measurements is investigated on a statistical basis, with the parameters being distance to the comet, heliocentric distance, longitude and latitude of nadir point. Our analysis of the northern hemisphere summer season shows the presence of water vapor mostly in the illuminated northern hemisphere near the neck region with cyclic diurnal variations whereas CO2 was confined to the cold southern hemisphere with a more spatially homogeneous composition, in agreement with previous observations of 67P [2] or Hartley 2 [3]. A comparison will also be provided with the COPS total density and DFMS abundance measurements.\n[1] Balsiger et al., \"ROSINA - Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis\", Space Sci.

The flights took place near the California coast at Monterey, to investigate the effects of sea surface temperature and algal blooms on oceanic particulate emissions, the diurnal mixing of urban pollution with other airmasses, and the impacts of biological aerosols on the California atmosphere. The aircraft’s payload included an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS), a differential mobility analyzer, a cloud condensation nuclei counter, a counterflow virtual impactor, a cloudwater collector, and two instruments designed to detect biological aerosols – a wideband integrated biological spectrometer and a SpinCon II – as well as a number of meteorology and aerosol probes, two condensation particle counters, and instruments to measure gas-phase CO, CO2, O3, and NOx. Here, we describe in depth the objectives and outcomes of BOAS and report preliminary results, primarily from the AMS. We detail the spatial characteristics and meteorological variability of speciated aerosol components over a strong and persistent bloom of Pseudo-Nitzschia, the harmful algae that cause ‘red tide’, and report newly identified AMS markers for biological particles. Finally, we compare these results with data collected during BOAS over urban, forested, and agricultural environments, and describe the mixing observed between oceanic and terrestrial airmasses.",

            "abstract": "The development and melting of the seasonal snowpack depends on complex interactions among climate elements. Previous work (Woods 2009, Adv. Wat. Res.) showed how the typical seasonal variation of temperature and precipitation rate influence snowpack development. Results were expressed in terms of three dimensionless variables for: seasonal temperature regime; seasonality of precipitation; and depth of the snowpack relative to the energy available for melting. However, that theory does not take account of sub-seasonal fluctuations in temperature and precipitation, and as a consequence, makes poor predictions of snow storage in some climates.\nHere we write a stochastic differential equation for snow storage, and then derive an equation for time variation of the probability distribution (pdf) of snow water equivalent (SWE). This provides a detailed but compact understanding of how temperature and precipitation interact to influence the seasonal accumulation and melt of snow. From this equation, we can estimate statistics such as the mean and standard deviation of SWE on any day of the year, and the mean residence time of snow, and see how they are related to climate characteristics.\nTo develop the equation, we first describe temperature and precipitation with 4 parameters each, defining the mean, seasonal amplitude, seasonal timing, and sub-seasonal fluctuations. To simulate the response of the snowpack to climate, we use a temperature index model with two parameters: a degree-day melt factor and a threshold temperature.\nBy writing the equation for snow storage in dimensionless form, we reduce the problem to five dimensionless parameters, three of them the same as found by Woods (2009), plus one each for the sub-seasonal fluctuations in precipitation and temperature. In the special case of no fluctuations in temperature and precipitation, the new equation reduces to the deterministic case of Woods (2009).\nWe verify by Monte Carlo simulation that that the probability distribution of snow water equivalent is correctly reproduced for an idealised case. Examples will be presented using SNOTEL data from the USA, in a variety of climates, and possible applications to catchment hydrology will be briefly introduced, by integrating the point-scale snowmelt hydrograph over the distribution of elevation.",

Addressing pressing issues such as disaster risk management, climate change, resource depletion, and environment-conflict interactions requires accessing and integrating different types of data from diverse sources, often collected with quite disparate methods, scales, levels of uncertainty and quality, and access and usage rights. Particular challenges for geocuration include identifying relevant data sets from diverse sources, assessing their suitability for integration, conversion to forms that enhance interoperability, obtaining suitable access and usage rights for data, documentation of methods in ways understandable to diverse users, and evaluation of the effectiveness of geocuration efforts. We describe here a number of efforts to develop geocurated data collections in such areas as environmental indicators, land use/land cover change, and human settlements and infrastructure. In addition to describing the incremental development of these collections, we examine how planning and anticipation of the needs of user communities are important to the collection development process. We assess the development and continuing enhancement of the cyberinfrastructure and capabilities needed to support efficient and effective geocuration throughout the data lifecycle. We conclude with selected observations and lessons learned from the development of these geocurated collections.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric rivers (ARs) produce 25% to 50% of the annual precipitation and the major wintertime flooding events in most rivers along the U.S. West Coast. ARs can be significantly modulated by large-scale atmospheric features and have been related with different Rossby wave breaking types. In this work we link large-scale variability with the risk of AR associated flooding by associating AR features with different Rossby wave breaking types directly impacting two river basins: Chehalis basin (Washington State) and Russian river basin (California State).\nWhile the moisture sources for both types of ARs are of tropical-subtropical origin, ARs of anticyclonic wave breaking (AWB) type have ~10% more of tropical-subtropical (<=35°N) sources but ~10% less of extratropical (>35°N) sources than cyclonic wave breaking (CWB) events. In addition, ARs of AWB type have larger impinging angles to the coast and lower wind speed at the 850mb level. Because their impinging angle is almost perpendicular to the mountains, ARs of AWB type have higher impact on precipitation in the Chehalis basin and Cascade Mountains. Snow cover increases 10~20% over the Cascade Mountains after AWB events while the increase after CWB events are below 10%. The extreme streamflow measured by gauges within the Chehalis basin can be mostly explained by AWB events. However, CWB type ARs with larger amount of water vapor transport result in more precipitation over the Russian river basin on the coastal region and the northern Sierra Nevada. Snow cover increases by 20~30% over the northern Sierra Nevada but decreases slightly (<10%) in regions with lower elevation. Slight increases in snow (<10%) over lower elevation regions are caused by AWB events. This is likely the reason why extreme AR-related streamflow vary from station to station. Finally, CWB AR events are more likely to happen during El Nino years in both basins; more AWB AR events tend to happen during La Nina years in the Russian river basin but no strong correlation is found for the Chehalis basin possibly due to the variations of wave breaking positions.",

This study presents a detailed analysis of geomechanical and petrophysical properties of 20 lacustrine mudstones from the Mesozoic Newark Rift Basin, the largest of exposed rift basins in eastern North America, considered as a potential CO2 sequestration site. The samples were selected to represent variable lithology, organic content, redox state, structure (massive and thinly bedded), degree of matrix anisotropy, and burial depths. An extensive characterization program was funded by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), and included laboratory CT scans, XRD, SEM, MICP, porosity, permeability, and acoustic velocity measurements, as well as geomechanical testing of both matrix and fracture strength under a range of confining pressures. Core measurements were integrated with available logging data to allow for multiscale comparison and correlation. Most of the analyzed mudstones have the clay content of 50-70%, with abundant mica and detrital grains. The pore system is dominated by narrow micropores (mostly <5-100 microns wide), and nano-scale pore throats (0.005-0.05 microns). Full Mohr-Coulomb failure envelopes built for each mudstone type indicate a large variability in projected unconfined strength and the coefficient of internal friction. The dataset allows building empirical relations between compositional, structural and mechanical properties of these lacustrine mudstones, as well as physical parameters such as acoustic velocity (both laboratory and logging) and elastic moduli. These relations can be applied to other lacustrine mudstones in the East American rift basins, and provide important information for caprock stability modeling in these basins.",

Numerous techniques have been used in environmental modelling studies for sensitivity analysis. However, it is often overlooked that the scale of modelling study, and the metric choice can significantly change the assessment of model sensitivity and uncertainty. In order to identify important hydrological processes across various scales, we conducted a multi-criteria sensitivity analysis using a novel and efficient technique, Variogram Analysis of Response Surfaces (VARS). The analysis was conducted using three different hydrological models, HydroGeoSphere (HGS), Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and Modélisation Environmentale–Surface et Hydrologie (MESH). Models were applied at various scales ranging from small (hillslope) to large (watershed) scales. In each case, the sensitivity of simulated streamflow to model processes (represented through parameters) were measured using different metrics selected based on various hydrograph characteristics such as high flows, low flows, and volume. We demonstrate how the scale of the case study and the choice of sensitivity metric(s) can change our assessment of sensitivity and uncertainty. We present some guidelines to better align the metric choice with the objective and scale of a modelling study.",

            "abstract": "We conducted an analysis that utilized the National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) Jobs and Economic Development Impact (JEDI) models to estimate the temporary and permanent jobs, earnings, and state sales tax revenues that would be created by various scenarios of the National Energy with Weather System (NEWS) simulator. This simulator was created by a collaboration between the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) at the University of Colorado and the Earth Systems Research Laboratory (ESRL NOAA). The NEWS simulator used three years of high-resolution (13-km, hourly) weather and power data to select the most cost-efficient, resource-maximizing, and complementary locations for wind, solar photovoltaic, and natural gas power plants along with high-voltage direct-current transmission, thereby providing the cheapest possible electricity grid that facilitates the incorporation of large amounts of wind and solar PV. We applied various assumptions to ensure that we produced conservative estimates, while keeping costs in line with those of the NEWS simulator.\nOur analysis shows that under the lowest carbon-emitting scenario of the NEWS carried out (80% reduction in CO2 compared with 1990 levels), almost ten million new jobs could be created by 2030. Of those jobs, over 400,000 would be permanently supporting the operations of the power plants. That particular scenario would also add over $500 billion to the paychecks of American workers and $75 billion to state tax revenues by 2030. All of this is achieved with average electricity costs of 10.7¢/kWh, because the electric system relies less heavily on fuel and more on jobs constructing, operating, and maintaining infrastructure.\nWe use the current presentation to describe the methods used to reach these findings and examine some potential impacts of our estimates on public policy. Although we are able to identify some systematic problems with the JEDI model, we find that these problems are unavoidable due to the limited data available about the new renewable energy industry. Our discussion will include estimates for many of the twenty-seven NEWS-generated energy mix scenarios, comparisons of the jobs gained through a lower-carbon energy mix to those lost by the coal industry, and the directions for future study.",

In 2004 an autonomous sensor network (ASN) was installed in the Llanganuco Valley in the Cordillera Blanca, Peru consisting of two automatic weather stations (AWS) located at the base and upper ridge of the valley connected by four air temperature/humidity micro-loggers at equal elevation intervals. The ASN permits high resolution evaluations of the micro-scale meteorology within the valley. Twenty-four hour composites and monthly averages of wind, solar insolation, air temperature profiles, and precipitation obtained from the ASN were analyzed for the historical wet and dry seasons between the years of 2005 and 2015. The evidence suggests that teleconnections exist between eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures and meteorological forcing within the Valley. Comparisons between the two AWS units reveal similar ENSO impacts during the wet season that are not replicated in the dry season. We found that warm and cold ENSO create anomalies that appear unique to this region of the outer Tropics. Warm ENSO phases promote wetter than normal dry seasons and dryer than normal wet seasons and visa versa for cold phases of ENSO. Air temperature is strongly positively correlated to warm ENSO phases during the wet season and depends on elevation during the dry season. Insolation is negatively correlated to warm ENSO phases at higher elevations with weak positive correlation at lower elevations. We attribute observed seasonality, in part, to interactions between channeling of synoptic flow and thermally driven winds. Although the sporadic availability of data prevents definitive conclusions at this time, recent improvements in the ASN infrastructure will facilitate deeper understanding of ENSO impacts on meteorological forcing within pro-glacial valleys of the Cordillera Blanca.",

Operating from its base in Fairbanks, AK, the CARVE aircraft covers a range of principle flight paths in the Alaskan interior, the Yukon River valley, and the northern Alaska coast around Barrow and Dead Horse. Flight paths are chosen to maximize ecosystem variability and cover burn-recovery/regrowth sequences. CARVE observations cover the Arctic Spring/Summer/Fall seasons, with multiple flights per season and principle flight path. Science operations started in 05/2012 and will conclude in 11/2015.\nThe CARVE suite of instruments includes flask measurements, in situ gas analyzers for CO2, CH4 and CO observations, and a three-band polarizing Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) for column measurements of CO2, CH4, CO, their interfering species (e.g., H2O), and O2. The FTS covers the spectral regions of 4,200-4,900 cm-1 (CH4, CO), 5,800-6,400 cm-1 (CO2), and 12,900-13,200 cm-1 (O2), with a spectral resolution of 0.2 cm-1. Aircraft-based FTS science observations in Alaska have been performed since 23-05-2012. First-version data products from all CARVE instruments derived from observations during the 2012 campaign were publicly released earlier in 2013.\nThe FTS has performed well during flight conditions. A recent overhaul of the retrieval algorithm has led to improvements in FTS data quality. We present results from FTS column observations of CO2, CH4, and CO, obtained over the entire CARVE observation record from 2012 to 2015, including comparisons of CARVE FTS measurements with satellite observations of GOSAT CO2 and CH4 retrieved by NIES, GOSAT CO2 from JPL/ACOS, MOPITT CO, and CO2 from OCO-2. The comparisons emphasize coincident CARVE/OCO-2 observations over Alaska during the 2015 CARVE flights.",

            "abstract": "Odontotaenius disjuctus is a wood feeding beetle that processes large amounts of hardwoods and plays an important role in forest carbon cycling. In its gut, plant material is transformed into simple molecules by sequential processing during passage through the insect’s digestive system. In this study, we used multiple 'omics approaches to analyze the distribution of microbial communities and their specific functions in lignocellulose deconstruction within the insect’s gut.\nFosmid clones were selected and sequenced from a pool of clones based on their expression of plant polymer degrading enzymes, allowing the identification of a wide range of carbohydrate degrading enzymes. Comparison of metagenomes of all gut regions demonstrated the distribution of genes across the beetle gut. Cellulose, starch, and xylan degradation genes were particularly abundant in the midgut and posterior hindgut. Genes involved in hydrogenotrophic production of methane and nitrogenases were more abundant in the anterior hindgut. Assembled contigs were binned into 127 putative genomes representing Bacteria, Archaea, Fungi and Nematodes. Eleven complete genomes were reconstructed allowing to identify linked functions/traits, including organisms with cellulosomes, and a combined potential for cellulose, xylan and starch hydrolysis and nitrogen fixation. A metaproteomic study was conducted to test the expression of the pathways identified in the metagenomic study. Preliminary analyses suggest enrichment of pathways related to hemicellulosic degradation. A complete xylan degradation pathway was reconstructed and GC-MS/MS based metabolomics identified xylobiose and xylose as major metabolite pools. To relate microbial identify to function in the beetle gut, Chip-SIP isotope tracing was conducted with RNA extracted from beetles fed 13C-cellulose. Multiple 13C enriched bacterial groups were detected, mainly in the midgut.\nOur multi-omics approach has allowed us to characterize the contribution of the gut microbiota to the transformation of woody biomass and the distribution of microbial-driven function in the beetle’s gut. Through the study of such highly evolved polymer deconstruction and fermentation system we want to identify criteria for design of improved lignocellulosic fuel production processes.",

            "abstract": "Axial volcano, on the Juan de Fuca ridge, erupted in April 2011, and again in April 2015. Both eruptions were captured on ocean bottom hydrophones (OBHs). The 2011 eruption was recorded by three OBHs deployed near or within the caldera, although one instrument was overrun by lava and its data could not be recovered. The 2015 eruption was captured in real time by a network of ocean bottom seismometers and hydrophones deployed as part of the Ocean Observatories Initiative Cabled Array. Intense seismicity preceded and accompanied both eruptions. Earthquakes are recognizable in the hydroacoustic record by the timing of surface reflections: secondary and tertiary pulses are consistent with arrivals coming from below the hydrophone and reflecting off of the sea surface. The 2015 eruption also produced signals that initiate in the water column, interpreted as water-lava interactions. Surface reflections for these water column events are consistent with a more distant source, and the relative polarity of arrivals on the co-located OBH and OBSs are consistent with a signal traveling through the water rather than the subsurface. Comparisons of arrivals on the hydroacoustic and seismic channels show that there is little energy on the EW seismic channel, consistent with an impulsive signal arriving from the north. These water column events are absent from the 2011 eruption, despite the fact that preliminary estimates suggest that the eruptions were of comparable volume. Also observed during the 2015 event were a number of a diffuse broadband (10-100 Hz) signals that last from several minutes to over an hour. These events appear similar to hydroacoustic signals recorded in association with explosive degassing at other submarine volcanoes including NW Rota-1 (Marianas) and West Mata (Lau Basin). A comparison of hydroacoustic data recorded in the two events indicates that the 2015 eruption was more vigorous than the 2011 event and resulted in more explosive lava-water interactions. This may reflect a larger gas content or higher effusion rate in 2015. The combination of hydroacoustic and seismic data provides an excellent means of investigating eruption styles in the submarine environment.",

During the 2015 fall semester, I am conducting World Climate exercises for fellow graduate and undergraduate students at San Francisco State University. At the end of the exercise, I will have collected the responses to an anonymous questionnaire in which the participants indicate age and gender. The questionnaire asks participants to describe their hopes and fears for the future and to propose public and personal actions for achieving a strong climate change agreement. I am tracking differences to determine whether participants’ age and gender correlate with particular patterns of feeling and thinking. My future research will aim to determine whether and how strongly the World Climate Exercise has affected participants’ actual policy engagement. This work will also reflect on my experiences as a World Climate facilitator. I will describe the facilitation process and then discuss some of my observations from the sessions.

            "abstract": "A global Subduction Zone Observatory (SZO) presents an exciting opportunity to broaden involvement in scientific research and to ensure multidisciplinary impact. Most subduction zones feature dynamic interactions of the seafloor, the coastline, and the onshore environments also being perturbed by global climate change. Tectonic deformation, physical environment changes (temperature and chemistry), and resulting ecological shifts (intertidal population redistribution, etc.) are all basic observables for important scientific investigation. Yet even simple baseline studies like repeated transects of intertidal biological communities are rare. A coordinated program of such studies would document the local variability across time and spatial scales, permit comparisons with other subducting coastlines, and extend the reach and importance of other SZO studies. One goal is to document the patterns, and separate the component causes of, coastal uplift and subsidence and ecological response to a subduction zone earthquake using a database of pre-event biological and surveying observations. Observations would be directed by local scientists using students and trained volunteers as observers, under the auspices of local educational entities and using standardized sampling and reporting methods. The observations would be added to the global, Internet-accessible, database for use by the entire scientific community. Data acquisition and analysis supports the educational missions of local schools and universities, forming the basis for educational programs. All local programs would be coordinated by an international panel convened by the SZO. The facility would include a web-hosted lecture series and an annual web conference to aid organization and collaboration. Small grants could support more needy areas. This SZO collaboratory advances not only scientific literacy, but also multinational collaboration and scholarship, and (most importantly) produces important scientific results.",

            "abstract": "Eucalypt plantations cover about 20 M hectares worldwide and expansion is expected to mainly occur in marginal growing areas where dry conditions may lead to water conflicts. One of the principal reasons for the expansion of Eucalyptus plantations is rapid wood growth but these forests also transpire large amounts of water. Genotype selection and planting density, are key factors regulating carbon and water tradeoffs at a stand scale, but few studies have examined these simultaneously especially in highly productive clonal plantations. Our goal in this study was to examine the effects of planting density on carbon and water interactions using a drought tolerant and drought sensitive eucalyptus clone. This work is part of a larger study (TECHS project - Tolerance of Eucalyptus Clones to Hydric and Thermal Stresses) and is located in a flat Oxisol in southeast of Brazil. A drought tolerant (E. grandis x E. camaldulensis (Grancam) and drought sensitive clone E. grandis x E. urophylla (Urograndis) were planted at four densities ranging from 600 to 3.000 stem ha-1. We measured transpiration using thermal heat dissipation probes, wood growth, canopy interception and stemflow during a full year (21 to 33 months old). Precipitation during the study period was 738 mm. Independently of genetics, growth increased with increasing density. Transpiration also increased with planting density and ranged from 515-595 mm at wider spacing to 735-978 mm at tighter spacing. Interception increased with planting density representing 18-22% of precipitation versus 13-14% in wider spacing while stem flow represented 2-5% in denser spacing and 1-2% at broader spacing. When density was higher than 1.250 and 1.750 stems ha-1 in Urograndis and Grancam clones, respectively, the water balance were negative. On a stand scale, results show both genetics and spacing can be used as silvicultural tools to better manage the tradeoff between wood growth and water consumption.",

Dooley Mountain and Buchanan rhyolite complexes are located along the northern termination near Baker City and along the western periphery near Burns of this rhyolite flare-up, respectively. Despite their importance for understanding co-genetic rhyolite volcanism to CRBG magmatism prior data on both complexes are sparse. Limited geochemical data exist only for Dooley Mountain and there is only one age date for either complex.\nOur ongoing study of both complexes is targeted to establish eruptive units and stratigraphy, to determine activity span, and to detail the petrology of rhyolite units by mapping or remapping key areas building on prior work (e.g., Evans, J. G., 1992, U.S.G.S. Map GQ-1694), by petrographic analysis and whole rock geochemistry, and by Ar-Ar geochronology.\nBoth complexes are multi-phase, apparently long-lived centers that erupted mostly rhyolite lava flows and domes but locally derived pyroclastic units occur as well but are subordinate in volume. Rhyolite activity is currently pinned at 15.5-14.7 Ma at Dooley Mountain and at 16.1 Ma at Buchanan but is expected to be extending with more dating. Rhyolites range from aphyric to containing ~ 15% phenocrysts dominated by feldspar or quartz. Rhyolites range from low- to high-silica varieties and indicate variable degrees of differentiation as established by the following ranges for Ba, Sr, and Eu/Eu*, respectively: 1500-500, 200-75, 0.6-0.15 for Dooley Mountain and 1700-100, 250-8, 0.88-0.19 for Buchanan. In addition, preliminary data indicate rhyolites range in their affinity from calc-alkaline to more A-type rhyolites. We speculate that A-type varieties coincide in these peripheral rhyolite complexes with the peak of Grande Ronde Basalt activity that impacted the greater area.",

            "abstract": "This research aims to improve the representation of stochastic water inflows to hydropower plants used in a grid-wide, power production scheduling model in central Chile. The model prescribes the operation of every plant in the system, including hydropower plants located in several basins, and uses stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP) with possible inflow scenarios defined from historical records. Each year of record is treated as a sample of weekly inflows to power plants, assuming this intrinsically incorporates spatial and temporal correlations, without any further autocorrelation analysis of the hydrological time series. However, standard good practice suggests the use of synthetic flows instead of raw historical records.\nThe proposed approach generates synthetic inflow scenarios based on hydrological modeling of a few basins in the system and transposition of flows with other basins within so-called homogeneous zones. Hydrologic models use precipitation and temperature as inputs, and therefore this approach requires producing samples of those variables. Development and calibration of these models imply a greater demand of time compared to the purely statistical approach to synthetic flows. This approach requires consideration of the main uses in the basins: agriculture and hydroelectricity. Moreover a geostatistical analysis of the area is analyzed to generate a map that identifies the relationship between the points where the hydrological information is generated and other points of interest within the power system. Consideration of homogeneous zones involves a decrease in the effort required for generation of information compared with hydrological modeling of every point of interest. It is important to emphasize that future scenarios are derived through a probabilistic approach that incorporates the features of the hydrological year type (dry, normal or wet), covering the different possibilities in terms of availability of water resources. We present the results for Maule basin in Chile’s Central Interconnected System (SIC).",

            "abstract": "Sharp or unexpected changes in stream water solute concentrations and fluxes can often provide important insights into potential sources, supply versus transport controls, and threshold behavior in watersheds. Identifying these “hot moments” is critical for furthering our understanding of biogeochemical processes and for developing accurate mechanistic models to manage water quality. Use of in-situ, high-frequency optical sensors, while in its infancy, has shown considerable promise in capturing fine resolution time series data on solute concentrations. Here, we highlight key lessons from the North East Water Resources Network (NEWRnet), a regional water quality network (Delaware, Rhode Island and Vermont) instrumented with optical sensors on a suite of stream sites (forested, agricultural, and urban watersheds in each state). Sensor data is coupled with traditional hydrologic and water chemistry sampling for baseflow and storms, laboratory-based UV and fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) to characterize organic matter composition, and stable carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotopes to identify solute sources. Both dissolved and particulate forms of C and N are being studied. Sampling is performed throughout the year with special attention to large storm events, droughts, diel variations, and key seasonal transitions including snowmelt and autumn leaf fall. We leverage these complimentary data to reveal both – process controls on C and N as well as methodological constraints and challenges with the sensors. Particulate and dissolved concentrations of C and N are compared for large storm events to disentangle supply and transport controls. Simultaneously, the accuracy of sensors is evaluated for interferences from varying particle size classes. Coupled changes in C and N concentrations and shifts in C composition during autumn leaf fall and snowmelt are investigated to identify biogeochemical/ecological controls. However, we also investigate how variability in organic matter composition may affect sensor predictions and calibrations within and across the study sites. Climate-change predictions indicate an intensification of the hydrologic cycle, thus, these sensors represent a critical tool for capturing and understanding water quality hot moments in aquatic ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Microorganisms degrade soil organic matter (SOM) and apportion newly acquired substrates into enzyme production, biomass growth, and respiration. The fraction of acquired substrate that is released into the atmosphere as heterotrophic respiration is determined by the microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE), commonly defined as the fraction of carbon uptake that is allocated to microbial growth and enzyme production. Despite recent demonstrations that changes in CUE can greatly affect predictions of global soil C stocks, most models do not incorporate process-level representation of CUE or how it varies with substrate stoichiometry. Here we introduce coupled C and N cycling into a prognostic CUE model that uses the dynamic energy budget theory to predict CUE at each time step. We solve this model over a range of substrate C:N to simulate the effects of N addition on CUE, and test the model against previously published measurements of CUE after nutrient enrichment with a range of substrates. We find that CUE declines with microbial N limitation due to C overflow and acquisition strategies that favor N immobilization. We also demonstrate that including an intracellular reserve pool in the model alleviates decreases in CUE by allowing excess C to be stored during periods of N limitation. Consistent with previous studies, we find that predictions of soil C stocks are highly sensitive to CUE. Furthermore, we show that interactive effects between substrate inputs and temperature result in a wide range of possible CUE values under global change scenarios.",

The plasma flow is idealized as an incompressible flow around a conducting obstacle. We compute changes in plasma composition resulting from this interaction as well as the reaction rates integrated over the simulation domain for several upstream plasma conditions (ion density, ion temperature and flow velocity). We show that for all cases, the main atmospheric loss process is the symmetrical charge exchange of O2, which results in the production of fast neutrals. This neutral production rate is about an order of magnitude larger than the production of ions. This conclusion is relevant to future missions to Europa that aim to detect fast neutrals. The neutral ejection resulting from this charge exchange creates an oxygen cloud around the orbit of the moon that is very extended radially but also very tenuous, and has not yet been directly detected.",

            "abstract": "Near realtime reservoir storage information is essential for accurate flood monitoring and prediction, especially over data sparse regions and international river basins. Although the combined use of elevation values from radar altimetry instruments and water area values from optical bands offers promise for estimating reservoir storage variations from space, the altimeter’s long return period and the optical sensor’s constrains to cloud-free conditions has inhibited applications which require high temporal resolution data. In this study, a new algorithm is developed to estimate reservoir surface area by fusing passive microwave and optical observations. The daily horizontal brightness temperatures at 36.5 GHz and 0.25° resolution are collected from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer–Earth Observing System (AMSR-E on NASA’s Aqua satellite). By calibrating against area estimations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) from 2003 to 2007, a set of weighting parameters are identified for each AMSR-E grid cell over the reservoir and in its vicinity. These parameters are then applied to the AMSR-E data to calculate surface area from 2008 to 2010. Storage variations are then inferred from the area and a pre-determined area-elevation relationship. For validation, the derived reservoir storage time series are compared with gauge observations over four reservoirs in South Asia. It is found that the storage results are highly correlated with observations (with R2 values ranging from 0.62 to 0.83 for the 16-day results, and from 0.52 to 0.66 for the 4-day results). This suggests that the data fusion algorithm developed in this study can be used for deriving reliable reservoir storage estimations under all weather conditions.",

            "abstract": "Accurate estimation of snowmelt flux is of primary importance for runoff hydrograph prediction, which is used for water management and flood forecasting. Lateral flows and preferential flow pathways in porous media flow have proven critical for improving soil and groundwater flow models, but though many physically-based layered snowmelt models have been developed, only 1D matrix flow is accounted for in these models. Therefore, there is a need for snowmelt models that include these processes so as to examine the potential to improve snowmelt hydrological modelling. A 2D model is proposed that enables an improved understanding of energy and water flows within deep heterogeneous snowpacks, including those on slopes. A dual pathway theory is presented that simulates the formation of preferential flow paths, vertical and lateral water flows through the snow matrix and flow fingers, internal energy fluxes, melt, wet snow metamorphism, and internal refreezing. The dual pathway model utilizes an explicit finite volume method to solve for the energy and water flux equations over a non-orthogonal grid. It was run and evaluated using in-situ data collected from snowpit - accessed gravimetric, thermometric, photographic, and dielectric observations and novel non-invasive acoustic observations of layering, temperature, flowpath geometry, density and wetness at the Fortress Mountain Snow Laboratory, Alberta, Canada. The melt of a natural snowpack was artificially generated after detailed observation of snowpack initial conditions such as snow layer properties, temperature, and liquid water content. Snowpack ablation and liquid water content distribution over time were then measured and used for model parameterization and validation. Energy available at the snow surface and soil slope angle were set as mondel inputs. Model verification was based on snowpack property evolution. The heterogeneous flow model can be an important tool to help understand snowmelt flow processes, how snowmelt-derived streamflow forecasting might be improved and shows great promise from this initial field evaluation.",

            "abstract": "Very small glaciers (<0.5km2) currently account for up to 80% of the total number of glaciers in mountain ranges around the globe. Although their total area and volume is small compared to larger glaciers, they are a relevant component of the cryosphere contributing to landscape formation, local hydrology and sea-level rise, and represent a valuable climate archive. Very small glaciers have generally shorter response times than valley glaciers and their mass balance is strongly dependent on snow redistribution processes. Worldwide glacier monitoring has focused on medium-sized to large glaciers leaving us with a relatively limited understanding of the behavior of very small glaciers.\nWith warming climate there is an increasing concern that very small glaciers might be the first to disappear. Already in the next decades this might result in the complete deglaciation of mountain ranges with glacier equilibrium lines close to the highest peaks, such as in the Rocky Mountains, the European Alps, the Andes or parts of High Mountain Asia. In this contribution, we present a comprehensive modelling framework to assess past and future changes in very small glaciers at the mountain-range scale. Among other processes our model accounts for snow redistribution, changes in glacier geometry and dynamic changes in debris-coverage, and computes e.g. distributed mass balance, englacial temperature and proglacial runoff. Detailed glacier projections until 2060 are shown for the Swiss Alps based on new data sets, and the 21st century contribution of all very small glaciers worldwide to sea-level rise is quantified using a global model.\nGrid-based modelling of surface mass balance and retreat for 1133 very small glaciers in Switzerland indicates that 70% of them will completely vanish within the next 25 years. However, a few avalanche-fed glaciers at low elevation might be able to survive even substantial atmospheric warming. We find relatively high static and dynamic sensitivities for gently-sloping glaciers. At the global scale, glaciers presently smaller than 1 km2 make up for only 0.7% of total ice volume but account for 6.7% of sea-level rise contribution during the period 2015-2025. This indicates that very small glaciers are a non-negligible component of global glacier change, at least in the near future.",

This product is generated through the combination of multiple IceBridge instrument data, primarily the ATM laser altimeter, DMS georeferenced imagery and the CReSIS snow radar, and is available on a campaign-specific basis as all upstream data sets become available. Version 1 data (IDCSI2) was the initial data production; we have subsequently received community feedback that has now been incorporated, allowing us to provide an improved data product. All data now available to the public at the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) have been homogeneously reprocessed using the new IDCSI4 algorithm. This algorithm contains significant upgrades that improve the quality and consistency of the dataset, including updated atmospheric and oceanic tidal models and replacement of the geoid with a more representative mean sea surface height product. Known errors with the IDCSI2 algorithm, identified by the Project Science Office as well as feedback from the scientific community, have been incorporated into the new algorithm as well. We will describe in detail the various steps of the IDCSI4 algorithm, show the improvements made over the IDCSI2 dataset and their beneficial impact and discuss future upgrades planned for the next version.",

            "abstract": "Analysis of earthquake source parameters requires correction of path effect, site response, and instrument responses. Empirical Green’s function (EGF) method is one of the most effective methods in removing path effects and station responses by taking the spectral ratio between a larger and smaller event. Traditional EGF method requires identifying suitable event pairs, and analyze each event individually. This allows high quality estimations for strictly selected events, however, the quantity of resolvable source parameters is limited, which challenges the interpretation of spatial-temporal coherency. On the other hand, methods that exploit the redundancy of event-station pairs are proposed, which utilize the stacking technique to obtain systematic source parameter estimations for a large quantity of events at the same time. This allows us to examine large quantity of events systematically, facilitating analysis of spatial-temporal patterns, and scaling relationship. However, it is unclear how much resolution is scarified during this process. In addition to the empirical Green’s function calculation, choice of model parameters and fitting methods also lead to biases. Here, using two regional focused arrays, the OBS array in the Mendocino region, and the borehole array in the Salton Sea geothermal field, I compare the results from the large scale stacking analysis, small-scale cluster analysis, and single event-pair analysis with different fitting methods to systematically compare the results within completely different tectonic environment, in order to quantify the consistency and inconsistency in source parameter estimations, and the associated problems.",

In this study, we examine the radiative impact of shallow cumulus clouds on a month-long cloud-permitting (Δx = 1 km) WRF simulation of convection over the Amazon region during the GoAmazon2014/5 field campaign. Compared to observations collected at the DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Mobile Facility (AMF), the model underestimates the frequency of shallow cumulus clouds during daytime, resulting in large positive biases in downward shortwave radiation reaching the surface. This overestimation of shortwave heating in turn drives excessive surface latent and sensible heat fluxes in the model. As a result, simulated deep convection peaks too early during the day and total precipitation is excessive compared to observations. We use the AMF observations to develop a shallow cumulus cloud parameterization scheme that mitigates the bias in shallow cumulus cloud radiative effects. Impacts of the new parameterization of shallow cumulus on the simulation of deep convection and precipitation are examined. Our results highlight the importance of cloud-radiative interactions and land-atmosphere feedbacks on the diurnal cycle of convection in this region.",

            "abstract": "The study of Silicon (Si) isotopes in Ocean Island Basalts (OIB) has the potential to elucidate between possible heterogeneities in the mantle. Relatively large (~several per mil per atomic mass unit) Si isotope fractionation occurs in low-temperature environments during biochemical and geochemical precipitation of dissolved Si, where the precipitate is preferentially enriched in the lighter isotopes [1]. In contrast, only a limited range (~tenths of a per mil) of Si isotope fractionation has been observed in high-temperature igneous processes [2]. Therefore, Si isotopes may be useful as tracers for the presence of crustal material (derived from low-temperature surface processes) in OIB source regions in a manner similar to more conventional stable isotope systems, such as O.\nHere we present the first comprehensive set of high-precision Si isotope data obtained by MC‑ICP‑MS for a diverse suite of OIBs, including new data for the Canary Islands. Samples represent the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean basins and include representative end-members for the EM-1, EM-2, and HIMU mantle components. Average δ30Si values for OIBs representing the EM‑1 (−0.32 ± 0.06‰, 2 sd), EM‑2 (−0.30 ± 0.01‰, 2 sd), and HIMU (−0.34 ± 0.09‰, 2 sd) mantle components are all in general agreement with previous estimates for the δ30Si value of Bulk Silicate Earth [3]. However, small systematic variations are present; HIMU (Mangaia, Cape Verde, La Palma) and Iceland OIBs are enriched in the lighter isotopes of Si (δ30Si values lower than MORB). Further, the difference in Si isotope composition between La Palma and El Heirro (Canary Islands) has previously been observed for O isotopes [4], suggesting a relationship between the Si and O isotope mantle systematics. The Si isotope variations among OIBs may be explained by the sampling of a primitive mantle reservoir enriched in the light isotopes of Si, as suggested by [5], but most likely reflects the incorporation of recycled altered oceanic crust and lithosphere in the plume source.\n ",

            "abstract": "Dunes are constantly moved and shaped by the wind but avalanche patterns and grain fall dynamics are particularly difficult to quantify without disturbing the lee slope. Here we use terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) to measure surface change over minutes, hours and a week where wind directions vary and lee slope reworking occurs. Changes in topography are linked to high resolution measurements of three dimensional airflow patterns at the brink of the dune. Grain fall is identified within a zone approximately 0.9 m from the brink that is constantly eroded. Several different avalanche patterns occur that can be related to slope characteristics, wind direction and slope reworking. We find that during oblique winds, horn reworking can reduce the lee slope. When normal winds return, this slope takes longer to start avalanching, but when avalanches are finally initiated, they are catastrophic. Conversely, avalanches in the centre of the dune are typically discrete and follow similar trajectories. Our findings help elucidate dune mobility mechanics and pattern modifications at the storm event scale.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU Poster draft3.pdf\nSnow photochemical processes drive production of chemical trace gases in snowpacks, including nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) and hydrogen oxide radicals (HOx = OH + HO2), which are then released to the lower atmosphere. Coupled atmosphere–snow modelling of theses processes on global scales requires simple parameterisations of actinic flux in snow to reduce computational cost. The disagreement between a physical radiative-transfer model and a parameterisation based upon the e-folding depth of actinic flux in snow is evaluated. In particular, the photolysis of nitrate (NO3-), nitrite (NO2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in snow and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in the snowpack interstitial air are considered. The emission flux from the snowpack is estimated as the product of the depth-integrated photolysis rate coefficient and the concentration of photolysis precursors in the snow. The depth-integrated photolysis rate coefficient is calculated (a) explicitly with a radiative-transfer model (RT), and (b) with a simple parameterisation based on e-folding depth. The metric for the evaluation is based upon the deviation of the ratio of the depth-integrated photolysis rate coefficient (R) determined by the two methods from unity. R depends primarily on the position of the peak in the photolysis action spectrum of chemical species, solar zenith angle and physical properties of the snowpack, i.e. strong dependence on the light-scattering cross section and the mass ratio of the light-absorbing impurity (i.e. black carbon and HULIS), but only a weak dependence on density. For the photolysis of NO2, NO2-, NO3- and H2O2 the ratio R varies within the range of 0.82–1.35, 0.88–1.28, 0.93–1.27 and 0.91–1.28 respectively. The e-folding depth parameterisation underestimates for small solar zenith angles and overestimates at solar zenith angles around 60º compared to the RT method. A simple algorithm has been developed to improve the parameterisation which reduces values of R to 0.97–1.02, 0.99–1.02, 0.99–1.03 and 0.98–1.06 for photolysis of NO2, NO2-, NO3- and H2O2, respectively. The e-folding depth parameterisation may give acceptable results for the photolysis of NO3- and H2O2 in cold polar snow with large solar zenith angles, but it can be improved by a correction based on solar zenith angle and for cloudy skies.",

            "abstract": "Holography is a well-established imaging technique that uses the interference of light to record and reproduce three-dimensional images of objects. Its use began in the 1960s with the invention of the laser. Digital holographic microscopy (DHM) has several advantages over ordinary imaging microscopy which make it ideal for field and astrobiology use, including no need for focus or scanning so that instruments are readily made autonomous. DHM can produce simultaneous bright-field and quantitative phase-contrast images of the same field, providing additional information about transparent objects, e.g., refractive index and/or thickness; thus it inherently supports effective label-free imaging. We have built a fieldable DHM for detection of microorganisms in bodies of water and in brines collected from sea ice. Ice that appears solid to the eye contains interconnected brine-filled microscopic pores and veins which are occupied by populations of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The presence of life in “solid” ice has important implications for exploration of icy worlds, where it is unlikely that the first missions will be able to access the subsurface oceans. Using this new instrument, we examined several dozen samples from three different sites around Nuuk, Greenland. In all samples, mixed populations of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic microorganisms were observed. Many of the organisms were motile immediately upon extraction from sea ice, and others became motile after warming or addition of sugars and/or amino acids. Meaningful motility was readily distinguished from turbulence or fluid flow. The spatial resolution of the instrument was better than 1 µm, leading to unambiguous recognition of subcellular structures in eukaryotes, including nuclei and chloroplasts. We present mission scenrios for both orbiters and landers in which DHM may be used as a valuable complement to chemical-based life detection techniques for discovery of cellular life on icy worlds.",

This event is the only great (Mw > 8.0) earthquake in the past two decades to rupture at a depth greater than 300 km and is the only deep earthquake to be detected by modern geodetic tools such as DART pressure sensors, continuous GPS, and GRACE. Continuous GPS stations along the Kamchatka Peninsula and Kuril Islands recorded sub-centimeter static displacements including subsidence across the peninsula, inferring a spatially extensive region of uplift within the Sea of Okhotsk likely generating a low-amplitude, but long-wavelength tsunami wave. We use water column height changes recorded at 10 regional DART pressure sensors, to evaluate the detectability and usability of these tsunami sensors in identifying tsunami waves from such deep earthquakes. Of the 10 sites, only 2 were triggered by the event, enabling capture of high-rate (one sample per minute) pressure data. The remaining sites reported at the background rate of 15 minutes per sample. From these sensors we observed sub-centimeter tsunami waves, in general agreement with synthetics computed using normal mode theory, following the framework of Ward (1980). Additionally, despite remaining at the low-frequency background rate, we were able to identify wave periods around 9000 s across multiple DART stations. We will report on our observations of the long-period tsunami waves from these sensors, and our analysis of how they compare to both reported, and our best-fit determination of the Okhotsk earthquake focal mechanism and location.",

            "abstract": "Subduction zones are host to the planet’s largest recorded earthquakes and tsunamis. The strength and slip behavior of the megathrust plate interface is tightly linked to the in situ conditions and physical state of sediments that are entrained along the plate interface. The mechanical properties of these sediments change as they are heated, consolidated, and metamorphosed with progressive subduction and burial beneath the forearc; understanding this evolution of rock properties is essential toward quantitative interpretation of geophysical signatures in the context of stress state, pore fluid pressure, and composition down-dip along the megathrust. In particular, observed zones of high-amplitude seismic reflectivity, low P- and S-wave velocities (Vp and Vs), and high Vp/Vs along subduction megathrusts have been widely interpreted to indicate near-lithostatic pore fluid pressure, yet the role of low-velocity and highly anisotropic metasediments along and beneath the plate interface remain weakly constrained.\nTo address this question, we conducted triaxial deformation experiments on a suite of argillaceous metasedimentary fault zone rocks exhumed from ~12-15 depth in the Aleutian subduction zone, in order to define Vp and Vs at mean effective stresses up to ~100 MPa. In our experiments we observed a rapid increase in Vp with increasing effective stress that we interpret to be microcrack closure. We also observed significant velocity anisotropy in samples tested perpendicular and parallel to foliation with respective Vp of 5.0 km/s and 5.9 km/s (17% anisotropy) at peak stress. Velocity predictions based on whole rock composition and simple assumptions about pore structure and volume tend to over predict observed velocities, but this discrepancy may be reconciled if pores are highly elongate. Synthetic waveform modeling shows that these wavespeeds are broadly consistent with observed reflectivity and low-frequency low velocity zones at 20-40 km depth (10-30 km from the trench) at this margin, raising the possibility that these signatures could be explained by the presence of optimally foliation of weak metasediments, without requiring highly elevated pore fluid content or pressure.",

            "abstract": "Several models to compute the thermal emission in the microwave domain of snow-covered areas have been developed in the past few decades and have become very popular, like HUT, MEMLS and a few others based on the DMRT theory. These models have many differences between each other. Numerous studies have exploited one of them and have drawn conclusions about their skills or used them to retrieve snow properties or assimilate observations, etc. Nevertheless the portability of this knowledge to the other models is a concern. An increasing number of studies have also compared pairs of these models to show, in specific conditions, the differences between simulations and skills with respect to observations. There is a consensus on the fact that none of these models performs always (or sufficiently often) better than all the others. Nevertheless, the strategies developed to perform these comparisons are so dependent on how the model differences are handled, that the scope of numerically-based comparisons is limited. The diversity of investigated snow conditions and the ground truth uncertainties are also limiting factors. With the raising need to consolidate its findings, the snow passive microwave remote sensing community is eager to understand the profound similarities and differences of their models and to this end has started to re-cast the different model formulations in a common framework. In this work, we address this question for a few specific points of the models: the description of the micro-structure (grain size parameters and underlying assumption) and the solution method of the radiative transfer theory (multi-stream versus N-stream and phase function representation). We show that existing models are not so different from each other, especially when consistent parameters (or representations) are used. At last, we present propositions to build a new-generation model that would be sufficiently modular to encompass the (small) diversity of current models.",

            "abstract": "Soil water dynamics, especially on hillslopes, is mainly controlled by conditions defined by topography, climate, vegetation cover and soil properties. In many areas of northeastern Brazil, semi-arid tropical soils are being rapidly modified by land-use changes which usually lead to a decrease in infiltration rates and to an increase in surface runoff and soil erosion, as well as to a reduction in groundwater recharge. This study focus on the effects of these land-use changes on the main hydrological processes close to the soil surface, especially on the soil infiltration rates and hillslope hydrology dynamics on highly weathered thick tropical soils at the southwestern portion of the Bahia state. The Caetité experimental basin (CEB) presents portions with natural savanna, agriculture, grazing, as well as those resulting from a uranium mining and milling activities. The watershed (75 km2) has an average total annual rainfall is about 710 mm, with a long dry period. Bedrock is comprised by gneisses and granites with a gentle topography covered by thick (>3m) soils. In order to assess the role played by topography, soil properties and vegetation cover in controlling soil water infiltration and redistribution along a typical hillslope, 6 soil matrix potential nests (SMPN) were installed along a 1.4 km long transect. Each nest is composed by 7 soil matrix potential sensors (installed up to 3.0 m depth), 1 soil temperature sensor and a datalogger. In parallel, field experiments were carried out at different points of the CEB in order to estimate soil infiltration rates and field-saturated hydraulic conductivities. At these points, undisturbed soil samples were collected to characterize soil texture, porosity (micro and macro), bulk density, as well as to define the soil water retention curves. The results show that dense savanna presents the highest infiltration capacity values, independently of soil and topography conditions. Besides, maximum infiltration rates may be reduced by a factor of 3 and of 30 under agriculture and grazing, respectively. Rainfall intensity, steepness and soil physical properties played major roles in controlling the temporal and spatial distribution of soil water along the transect.",

            "abstract": "Geostationary satellite observations of the Earth are increasingly made more frequent. For example, Himawari-8 of Japanese Meteorological Agency takes images of the planet every 10 minutes in multiple bands. Similarly, the GOES-R satellite of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will make observations every 5 to 15 minutes. Products, like shortwave (solar) radiation budget at the surface, derived from these observations have or will have similar rapid refresh rates. Routine, near-real time assessment of the quality of these products ideally requires the availability of near-real time reference data. Such near-real time data has recently become available from the NOAA Surface Radiation Budget Network (SURFRAD). These data are disseminated every 15 minutes. However, in contrast to non-real-time data with fully quality control, which have a latency of 24 hours or more, the near-real time data have less quality control applied to them in order to achieve low latency. To assess applicability of this near-real time SURFRAD data for the evaluation satellite products we are using them experimentally to evaluate the quality of Downward Shortwave Radiation at the surface (DSR) retrieved operationally every hour from GOES and made available in the Geostationary Surface and Insolation Product (GSIP) . Metrics (accuracy and precision) are computed to characterize the level of agreement between satellite retrievals and the near-real time reference data. These metrics are then compared with metrics from the evaluation with the non-real time, fully quality controlled reference. The comparison shows that monitoring of DSR with near-real time data is not very different from monitoring it with non-real time data and so DSR retrievals can be evaluated hourly or shorter times depending on reference data availability.",

Measuring and modeling DeN are particularly challenging in tidal systems, which play a vital role in buffering adjacent coastal waters from nitrogen inputs. These systems are hydrologically and biogeochemically complex, varying on fine temporal and spatial scales. We assessed the spatial and temporal variability of soil nitrate (NO3-) levels and O2 availability, two primary drivers of DeN, in surface soils of Winant salt marsh located in Yaquina estuary, OR during the summers of 2013 and 2014. We found low temporal variability in soil NO3- concentrations across years, tide series, and tide cycles, but high spatial variability linked to elevation gradients (i.e., habitat types); spatial variability within the high marsh habitat (0 - 68 μg N g-1 dry soil) was correlated with distance to major tide creek channels and connectivity to upslope N-fixing red alder. Soil O2 measurements collected at 5 cm below ground across three locations on two spring tide series showed that O2 drawdown rates were also spatially variable. Depending on the marsh location, O2 draw down ranged from sub-optimal for DeN (> 80 % O2 saturation) across an entire tide series (i.e., across days) to optimum (i.e., ~ 0 % O2 saturation) within one overtopping tide event (i.e., within hours). We are using these results, along with empirical relationships created between DeN and soil NO3- concentrations for Winant to improve on a pre-existing tidal DeN model. We will develop the first version of a fully probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian tidal DeN model to quantify parameter and prediction uncertainties, which are as important as determining mean predictions in order to distinguish measurable differences across the marsh.",

            "abstract": "A new standard reference material consisting of finely ground muscovite flakes has been developed and utilized at Washington State University to calibrate hydrogen isotope ratio (D/H) measurements to the VSMOW scale. This standard was prepared from a single crystal 'book' of a muscovite-bearing pegmatite near Deary, ID. The value we obtained for this muscovite standard (MMM) is: δD VSMOW = -79.1 ± 2.0‰ relative to NBS-30 biotite at -65.7‰ compared to a VSMOW value of 0.00‰. This mean value was determined for the muscovite and has been used as our working standard. There have been many recent geological applications to continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectroscopy. When hydrogen isotope ratios are of interest, a suitable standard for hydrogen in silicate systems often is not available. With supplies of the older NBS-30 biotite standard exhausted, much D/H data measured on silicate minerals have been linked to the VSMOW scale via non-silicate reference materials which may not behave similarly to minerals under study. Some recent studies have shown the NBS-30 standard to have poor intra-laboratory agreement with that material's measured and accepted isotopic values (Qi et al., 2014). Many laboratories which would measure D/H in silicate minerals would benefit from using a silicate-based standard for hydrogen. With further characterization, this muscovite may also be useful as a standard for silicate oxygen ratios as well as for some major element cations. This muscovite standard gives consistent values and it is easy to work with and does not leave much combustion residue. Also, because muscovite contains little iron, metal-hydride formation and associated fractionation factors is greatly reduced during the sample combustion. A new silicate-hydrogen standard is needed by the community, and this work represents an example of what a replacement standard material could look like.",

We determined P-wave seismic receiver functions for 50 broadband seismographic stations located within or adjacent to three volcanic fields: Harrats Lunayyir, Rahat, and Khaybar. There are 18 seismographic stations within Lunayyir, 11 in Khaybar, and 15 in Rahat with average interstation spacing of 10 km, 30km, and 50 km. For each station we calculated 300 to 600 receiver functions with an iterative time-domain deconvolution; noisy receiver functions (outliers) were rejected by cross correlating each receiver function with a station stack; we only accepted those with a cross correlation coefficient ≥ 0.6. We used these receiver functions to create a common-conversion point (CCP) image of the crust and upper mantle. The Moho and lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB) are clearly imaged, particularly beneath Lunayyir, and have average depths of about 38 km and 60 km. We do not find any evidence for structural disruption of the Moho within our ~70 km x 70 km image of the Moho beneath Lunayyir. We image a clear crust-mantle boundary beneath Rahat and Khaybar also at ~38 km, 2–3 km deeper than anticipated from prior receiver function results outside of the harrats. Mid-crustal low velocity zones seen locally beneath all three harrats, most commonly at 10–15 km or 15–20 km in depth, may more likely represent silicic Precambrian basement than accumulations of magma. Estimates of up to ~0.5 km3 of magma erupted during each eruptive episode are consistent with the lack of a disrupted Moho. However, the total erupted volume of magma, e.g. > 1000 km3 at Rahat, together with associated intrusions from the mantle, is consistent with crustal thickening of ~2 km beneath the harrats.",

The Congo River, which drains pristine tropical forest and savannah is the second largest exporter of terrestrial carbon to the ocean, and represents a historically understudied basin. Our ongoing projects in the Congo Basin aim to provide pertinent information on transport and emissions of carbon by rivers that need to be incorporated into carbon budgets of terrestrial ecosystems. To date the Congo Basin has seen only limited perturbation but the carbon locked away in the Congo, as in other tropical rainforests is increasingly vulnerable to release into the aquatic system and the atmosphere. However, riverine carbon transport (both of OM to the oceans and release of CO2 to the atmosphere) as a driver of global carbon cycling is still largely overlooked. Here we present data from a multi-season field campaign to quantify the transport fluxes, mineralization fluxes, and chemical character of Congo River OM, and to elucidate how these properties relate to each other and vary seasonally driven by hydrology within the Congo Basin. Existing data demonstrates that although tropical rivers do not experience the seasonal climatic extremes of temperate or northern high-latitude rivers, they all demonstrate similar effects due to changing hydrologic inputs with respect to OM dynamics. Specifically flushing periods appear to warrant further study as maximal export of reactive freshly leached plant material occurs during this time period.",

Radiation-based Priestley-Taylor changes are smaller than both of these, while empirical, temperature-based Thornthwaite changes are larger than both. These differences in PET change translate to large differences in change of water availability; when combined with a form of the Budyko water-balance relation, the PET methods predict a wide range of runoff changes. Furthermore, all PET methods result in bias that indicates drier conditions globally than those computed by the climate models themselves, and all PET methods overestimate the changes in actual evapotranspiration in non-water-stressed seasons/regions relative to the changes in the climate models. We conclude that use of PET methods that are inappropriate for climate-change applications is a source not only of uncertainty, but also of more drying than suggested by climate models, in hydrologic impact analyses. In view of the bias, it is advised that a no-PET-change analysis be used to define a wet upper bound on potential hydrologic impacts.",

            "abstract": "Oceanographic variables such as mean sea level, tides, storm surges, and waves are drivers of erosion, and they act on different time scales ranging from hours (associated with weather) to seasonal and decadal variations and trends (associated with climate). Here we explore how the related sea-state conditions affect the erosion risk in the northern Gulf of Mexico for past and future climate scenarios. From the climate perspective we find that long-term trends in the relevant variables have caused an increase of ~30% in the erosion risk since the 1980s; at least half of this increase was due to changes in the wave climate. In the next decades, sea level rise will likely become the dominating driver and may, in combination with ongoing changes in the wave climate (and depending on the emission scenario), escalate the erosion risk by up to 300% over the next 30 years. We also find significant changes in the seasonal cycles of sea level and significant wave height, which have in combination caused a considerable increase of the erosion risk in summer and decrease in winter (superimposed onto the long-term trends). The influence of weather is assessed with a copula-based multivariate sea storm model in a Monte-Carlo framework; i.e. we simulate hundreds of thousands of artificial but physically consistent sea-state conditions to quantify how different our understanding of the present day erosion risk would be if we had seen more or less extreme combinations of the different sea-state parameters over the last three decades. We find, for example, that total water levels (tide + surge + wave run-up) associated with 100-year return periods may be underestimated by up to 30% and that the average number of impact hours – when total water levels exceeded the height of the dune toe (collision) or dune crest (overwash) – could have been up to 50% higher than what we inferred based on the actually observed oceanographic conditions. Assessing erosion risk in such a probabilistic way while accounting for non-stationarity due to climate variability and change can help decision makers and planners to implement improved monitoring and adaptation strategies for long-term sustainability of the coastline and barrier islands.",

Because the majority of the solar wind observed at Earth is slow wind, understanding its origin is essential for understanding and predicting Earth’s space weather environment. In-situ and remote observations show that, compared to the fast wind, the slow solar wind corresponds to higher freeze-in temperatures, as indicated by charge-state ratios, and more corona-like elemental abundances. These results indicate that the most likely source for the slow wind is the hot plasma in the closed-field corona; however, the release mechanism for the wind from the closed-field regions is far from understood. Here we present the first fully dynamic, 3D MHD simulations of a coronal-hole boundary driven by photospheric convective flows. We determine in detail the opening and closing of coronal flux due to photospheric motions at the base of a helmet streamer. These changes should lead to the release of plasma from the closed magnetic field at the edge of the streamer. Our analysis demonstrates that the bulk of the release is due to interchange reconnection. We calculate the effective of numerical Lundquist number on the dynamics and discuss the implications of our results for theories of slow-wind origin, in particular the S-Web model. We also discuss the implications of our results for observations, in particular from the upcoming Solar Orbiter and Solar Probe Plus missions.\nThis work was supported by the NASA SR&T and TR&T Programs.",

It is also important for the retrieval of sea ice thickness from radar and laser altimetry data since snow on sea ice uncertainties constitute one of the largest sources of error in the retrieval of sea ice thickness. Since 2009, NASA's Operation IceBridge mission has utilized a novel ultra-wideband snow radar system to take measurements of spring time snow depth on sea ice over a large portion of the Arctic basin. In this work we describe the physics of the often-times complex radar returns from snow-covered sea ice which are observed in the data sets and show how varying surface roughness and instrument characteristics impact the retrieval of geophysical properties. An improved technique for the retrieval of snow depth using a best model fit is shown which accounts for the varying surface types encountered as well as changing instrument characteristics. The newly processed IceBridge snow depth data sets are then combined with snow depth estimates from other sources using an optimal interpolation technique, allowing for basin-wide snow depth results to be used for snow depth studies and sea ice thickness determination from altimetry data.",

The basin currently faces many challenges such as flooding, drought, high temporal and spatial variation of rainfall, deforestation, land degradation, climate change and high population growth rate. These challenges put pressure on the quantity and quality of the water resources in the basin. Current infrastructure developments in the basin have already impacted on the hydrological cycle, and future development plans potentially pose a threat to the sustainability of the resources if not appropriately managed. Information on runoff and sediment loads is a very important requirement for sustainable management of the water resources in the basin.\nThis study therefore seeks to assess runoff and sediment loads in the White Volta Basin using the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and provide understanding of how climate change impacts on future runoff and sediment loads in the basin.The model was calibrated for the period 1991 to 2003 and validated for the period 2004 to 2013.The model was also validated at one gauging station on the main river and another on a tributary. Analysis of the water balance of the basin shows that 4.90% of the simulated mean annual precipitation is converted to surface runoff while 84.37% evapotranspires. The results also show that the White Volta Basin contributes approximately 5.68x106tonnes/yr of sediment load into the Volta Lake.\nThe calibrated model was used to simulate the water balance for the present time slice (1975-2005) as the basis for comparing with the future (2025-2055) water balance in the WhiteVolta Basin. The results show that annual surface runoff and sediment loads could increase by 56% and 70% respectively. A projected reduction by 0.54% in actual evapotranspiration is however estimated for the selected time period in the basin.",

The time a particle spends in storage remains a critical knowledge gap in understanding particle trajectories through landscapes. We dated floodplain deposits in South River, VA, using fallout radionuclides (Pb-210, Cs-137), optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), and radiocarbon dating to determine sediment ages and construct sediment waiting time distributions. We have a total of 14 age dates in two eroding banks. We combine these age dates with a well-constrained history of mercury concentrations on suspended sediment in the river from an industrial release. Ages from fallout radionuclides document sedimentation from the early 1900s to the present, and agree with the history of mercury contamination. OSL dates span approximately 200 to 17,000 years old. We performed a standard Weibull analysis of nonexceedance to construct a waiting time distribution of floodplain sediment for the South River. The mean waiting time for floodplain sediment is 2930 years, while the median is approximately 710 years. When the floodplain waiting time distribution is combined with the waiting time distribution for in-channel sediment storage (available from previous studies), the mean waiting time shifts to approximately 680 years, suggesting that quantifying sediment waiting times for both channel and floodplain storage is critical in advancing knowledge of particle trajectories through watersheds.",

Additionally, constraining the englacial temperature provides a test of the steady state solution of such models. Whilst direct measurements of the basal properties and temperature can only be made at a limited number of borehole sights, radio echo sounding provides a means to infer the spatial distribution of both throughout entire ice sheets. The radar-inference of basal melt is possible due to a wet basal interface having a ~10-15 decibel higher reflection coefficient than an ice-bedrock interface, and the radar-inference of englacial temperature is possible due to there being an exponential Arrhenius relationship with the radar attenuation rate.\nIn our study we use ~10 years of radio echo sounding data to map the spatial distribution of basal melt and depth-averaged temperature for the Greenland ice sheet. A necessary precursor to our investigation has been the development of a refined algorithm to infer the radar attention rate using the variation in bed-returned power with ice thickness. The algorithm is conditioned using a prior Arrhenius model calculation of the attenuation rate, and enables sample regions to be selected that are not significantly biased by an inhomogeneous bed. We demonstrate that, for the first time, this algorithm approaches the necessary accuracy to distinguish basal melt directly, with the uncertainty for the radar-inferred attenuation loss less than the decibel separation in reflection coefficients for wet and dry beds. We further cross-validate our method by using the radar-inferred attenuation loss as a constraint to predict the spatial distribution of geothermal heat flux, and to reconstruct temperature profiles that are closer to borehole measurements than zeroth order thermomechanical ice sheet models.",

            "abstract": "Restoring the M9-class earthquake cycle in subduction zones is challenging in particular when dealing with the vertical deformation through the different phases of the cycle. Field investigations using geologic, geomorphologic, geodetic and seismological approaches including independent (and significant) uncertainties to estimate the Pleistocene, Holocene, coseismic and postseismic active deformation come to an independent estimation of the return period for M9-class earthquakes. The 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake (Mw 9.0) caused significant land-level changes in NE Honshu where GPS and leveling data reveal a 500-km-long section with > 0.10 m coseismic subsidence reaching 1.15 m close to the epicenter. A similar trend is observed for the 120 years preceding the earthquake. Conversely, CGPS data during the 880 days (2.4 years) following the 2011 main shock suggest a logarithmic uplift trend with up to 0.25 m of postseismic upheaval. Uplift is similarly recorded on the long term by late Quaternary marine terraces that exhibit 0.1 - 0.4 mm/yr uplift rate. The drainage network that incises terraces also documents long-term uplift as shown by the pattern of incision depth, river profile convexity and knickpoint migration. Since offshore M8 earthquakes have negligible permanent effect on the coast and no major active fault occurs along the coastline north of the epicentre, the long-term vertical deformation can be used as a proxy to reveal the M9-class earthquake cycle. On the Pleistocene timescale, the coseismic M9-class coastal subsidence appears to be concealed by the post- and interseismic deformation. The deformation budget across the whole cycle reflects temporal variations in plate boundary coupling and suggests a concealing time of 500-1000 years for the 2011 earthquake, which we propose as the minimum recurrence interval of M9-class earthquakes. This matches well the suggested 3 to 4 giant earthquakes identified in tsunami deposits for the past 3 kyr, and the 350-700 yr interval derived from the slip deficit.",

The Research Data Alliance (RDA) takes a more holistic view and considers infrastructure as a complex body of relationships between people, machines, and organisations.\nThis paper will describe how this more ecological perspective leads RDA to define and govern an agile virtual organization. We seek to harness the power of the volunteer, through an open problem solving approach that focusses on the problems of our individual members and their organisations. We focus on implementing solutions that make data sharing work better without defining a priori what is necessary. We do not judge the fitness of a solution, per se, but instead assess how broadly the solution is adopted, recognizing that adoption is often the social challenge of technical problem.\nWe seek to encourage a bottoms up approach with light guidance on principles from the top. The goal is to develop community solutions that solve real problems today yet are adaptive to changing technologies and needs.",

            "abstract": "Investigating linkages between subsurface and surface properties at various spatial and temporal scales is crucial for terrestrial ecosystem understanding because near-surface soil hydrological and biogeochemical processes are generally influenced by both compartments and because co-interactions between sampled soil properties and remote sensing data is crucial to extrapolate soil characteristics in sufficiently high resolution over modeling-relevant scales. In this study, we investigate linkages between soil and landscape property dynamics in the Arctic tundra in Barrow, AK along transects that traverse a range of geomorphological conditions, including low- to high- centered polygons. Landscape characteristics are inferred from topographic, multi-spectral and thermal-infrared imaging measurements using either a kite-, pole- and tram- based platform at various temporal and spatial scales from continuous monitoring along a 35 m long transect to occasional campaigns along 500x40 m corridors. Soil properties are inferred using electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), time-domain reflectometery (TDR), temperature measurements, and soil samples analysis.\nOverall, this study enables the identification of spatiotemporal links between various soil and landscape properties (incl. water inundation, vegetation, topography, thaw layer thickness, soil water content, temperature, electrical conductivity, snow thickness) and inform on the complementary nature of various ground- and aerial-based approaches and proxies to estimate soil properties within a framework that considers uncertainty, resolution, and spatial coverage. Among other results, a relatively strong relationship is observed between changes in soil electrical conductivity, water content, thaw layer thickness and vegetation state. This confirms the importance of water distribution on various processes including vegetation dynamics, thermal conductivity, surface-subsurface energy exchange, redox reactions and biogeochemical mechanisms. Identifying such links is crucial to extrapolate strong knowledge from point-scale and core-based biogeochemical measurements at specific sites over larger scales to ultimately improve parameterization of models simulating ecosystem feedbacks to climate.",

Quantification and spatial distribution of methane and carbon dioxide produced by livestock is needed to develop bottom-up estimates for carbon monitoring. These estimates serve as stand-alone international emissions estimates, as input to global emissions modeling, and as comparisons or constraints to flux estimates from atmospheric inversion models. Recent results for the US suggest that the 2006 IPCC default coefficients may underestimate livestock methane emissions. In this project, revised coefficients were calculated for cattle and swine in all global regions, based on reported changes in body mass, quality and quantity of feed, milk production, and management of living animals and manure for these regions. New estimates of livestock methane and carbon dioxide emissions were calculated using the revised coefficients and global livestock population data. Spatial distribution of population data and associated fluxes was conducted using the MODIS Land Cover Type 5, version 5.1 (i.e. MCD12Q1 data product), and a previously published downscaling algorithm for reconciling inventory and satellite-based land cover data at 0.05 degree resolution. Preliminary results for 2013 indicate greater emissions than those calculated using the IPCC 2006 coefficients. Global total enteric fermentation methane increased by 6%, while manure management methane increased by 38%, with variation among species and regions resulting in improved spatial distributions of livestock emissions. These new estimates of total livestock methane are comparable to other recently reported studies for the entire US and the State of California. These new regional/global estimates will improve the ability to reconcile top-down and bottom-up estimates of methane production as well as provide updated global estimates for use in development and evaluation of Earth system models.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic land use change (LUC) has had a major impact on the climate by altering the amount of carbon stored in vegetation, changing surface albedo and modifying the levels of both biogenic and pyrogenic emissions. While previous studies of LUC have largely focused on the first two components, there has recently been a recognition that changes to aerosol and related pre-cursor gas emissions from LUC are equally important. Furthermore, it has also recently been recognised that the pre-industrial (PI) to present day (PD) radiative forcing (RF) of climate from aerosol cloud interactions (ACI) due to anthropogenic emissions is highly sensitive to the amount of natural aerosol that was present in the PI. This suggests that anthropogenic RF from ACI may be highly sensitive to land-use in the PI.\nThere are currently two commonly used baseline reference years for the PI; 1750 and 1860. Rapid LUC occurred between 1750 and 1860, with large reductions in natural vegetation cover in Eastern Northern America, Europe, Central Russia, India and Eastern China as well as lower reductions in parts of Brazil and Africa. This LUC will have led to significant changes in biogenic and fire emissions with implications for natural aerosol concentrations and PI-to-PD RF.\nThe focus of this study is therefore to quantify the impact of LUC between 1750 and 1860 on aerosol concentrations and PI-to-PD RF calculations from ACI. We use the UK Met Office HadGEM3-UKCA coupled-chemistry-climate model to calculate the impacts of anthropogenic emissions and anthropogenic LUC on aerosol size distributions in both 1750 and 1860. We prescribe LUC using the KK10 historical dataset of land cover change. Monoterpene emissions are coupled directly to the prescribed LUC through the JULES land surface scheme in HadGEM3. Fire emissions from LUC were calculated offline using the fire module LPJ-LMfire in the Lund-Potsdam-Jena dynamic global vegetation model. To separate out the impacts of LUC from anthropogenic emissions a further simulation where only LUC and natural emissions are considered is undertaken.\nWe then explore the sensitivity of PI-to-PD aerosol number concentrations, cloud drop number concentrations and the RF on assumed land-cover in the PI. This work will help determine the need for accurate descriptions of historical LUC in calculations of ACI.",

In addition, African large savannah fires occur each year during the dry season, mainly for socio-economical purposes.\nIn this study, we will present the most recent developments of African anthropogenic combustion emission inventories, stressing African specificities.\n(1)A regional fossil fuel and biofuel inventory for gases and particulates will be presented for Africa at a resolution of 0.25° x 0.25° from 1990 to 2012. For this purpose, the original database of Liousse et al. (2014) has been used after modification for emission factors and for updated regional fuel consumption including new emitter categories (waste burning, flaring) and new activity sectors (i.e. disaggregation of transport into sub-sectors including two wheel ). In terms of emission factors, new measured values will be presented and compared to litterature with a focus on aerosols. They result from measurement campaigns organized in the frame of DACCIWA European program for each kind of African specific anthropogenic sources in 2015, in Abidjan (Ivory Coast), Cotonou (Benin) and in Laboratoire d’Aérologie combustion chamber. Finally, a more detailed spatial distribution of emissions will be proposed at a country level to better take into account road distributions and population densities.\n(2) Large uncertainties still remain in biomass burning emission inventories estimates, especially over Africa between different datasets such as GFED and AMMABB. Sensitivity tests will be presented to investigate uncertainties in the emission inventories, applying methodologies used for AMMABB and GFED inventories respectively.\nThen, the relative importance of each sources (fossil fuel, biofuel and biomass burning inventories) on the budgets of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, black and organic carbon, and volatile organic compounds emission will be discussed for the years 1990-2012 at the region (West and Central Africa) and country (Ivory Coast and Benin) level and compared to existing inventories. Finally, a first tentative estimation of uncertainties will be conducted allowing to vary fuel consumption and emission factors for gases and particles.",

In the TFM, the time dependence is formulated in terms of frequencies, and the horizontal wave pattern on the globe is formulated in terms of vector spherical harmonics. For a wide range of frequencies, the equations of mass, energy and momentum conservation are solved to compile a transfer function. The transfer function can then be easily combined with a time-dependent source whose spatial extent is also expressed in spherical harmonics, to produce a global atmospheric response, including gravity waves. This approach has significant benefits in that the solution is grid-independent (without any inherent limits on resolution), and the solutions do not suffer from singularities at the poles. We will show results from our simulations that couple the output of the TFM to an ionospheric model, to predict traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) driven by the simulated gravity waves.",

Through a hedonic analysis, we find that two important water-quality variables have had significant effects on lakefront property values, including Secchi disc reading, a technical measure of water clarity, and the presence of Eurasian watermilfoil, an aquatic invasive species. We further explore the spatial heterogeneity of water-quality benefits along the urban-rural gradient and find that access to urban amenities has strengthened the water-quality benefits in the lakefront housing market.

Here we expand upon this work using ACE data. Using compositional data we investigate the solar wind with velocity less than 450 km/s and present arguments for the presence of multiple source regions: coronal holes and closed loops opened by reconnection. Finally, we find that the compositional and kinetic properties of the solar wind point to Alfvén wave acceleration in both the fast and slow solar wind. Thus, we develop the Unified Wind Scenario, where the solar wind has two different source regions – open magnetic field regions in coronal holes, and closed quiescent loops opened be reconnection, and one single acceleration mechanism: Alfvén wave acceleration.",

However, what really matters for society is the variability of sea level at regional scales as the impact of sea level variations occur at those scales. Regional sea level (RSL) is not only affected by the same processes that GMSL (thermal expansion/contraction and water addition/removal) but also by the redistribution of mass. In particular, due to atmospheric forcing (i.e. atmospheric sea level pressure and wind stress) is the principal mechanism for the water redistribution in the ocean and accounts for a large fraction of the coastal sea level variance. In particular, it is the dominant mechanism for the variability in the subtidal to intraseasonal range (i.e. from days to months). This includes storm surge events, which are responsible for the largest damages in coastal regions. At frequencies from seasonal to interannual, its relevance is comparable to the steric contribution, specially at high and low latitudes (Fukumori et al. 1998). For the decadal to multidecadal range it is usually assumed that it has a secondary role, but this has not yet been studied in depth.\nIn this presentation we will show the results obtained from a new global simulation of atmospherically induced sea level variability for the period 1871-2012. This simulation uses the NOAA Twentieth Century Reanalysis (Compo et al., 2011) to force a global ocean barotropic model (TUGO, Carrère and Lyard, 2003). We will focus on the description of the impact of mass redistribution on coastal sea level variability at interannual to multidecadal scales and from a global perspective. We will also show how this mass redistribution can induce errors in GMSL trends and accelerations derived from tide gauge reconstructions.",

One example is in western Canada, at the boundary between Proterozoic/ Archean cratonic lithosphere and the accreted terranes of the Canadian Cordillera. This boundary is marked by an eastward decrease in surface heat flow and increase in elastic thickness and mantle seismic velocity. Together, these indicate that lithosphere thickness increases from ~60 km for the Cordillera to >150 km for the craton. High-resolution seismic images show that the transition occurs over a horizontal distance of 50-100 km and reconstructions show that the boundary has persisted for >50 Ma.\nIn this study, thermal-mechanical numerical models are used to address the dynamics of lithospheric steps on timescales of 50-100 Ma. Models start with the juxtaposition of 60 km thick lithosphere (“Cordillera”) and 160 km thick lithosphere (“craton”). The density and rheology of the craton are varied to simulate changes in composition and water content. For all densities, a steep transition (>50°) is maintained only if the craton is stronger than a dry olivine rheology. As water content increases, the transition in thickness evolves to a lower angle, as the craton undergoes gravitational instability. If the compositional density of the craton and underlying mantle are similar, the step is eroded through downwellings, and the boundary migrates below the craton. Conversely, a compositionally buoyant craton destabilizes through upwellings that underplate the Cordillera. The models demonstrate that the observed sharp Cordillera-craton transition in western Canada requires a dry craton lithosphere. The results also have implications for the long-term stability of cratonic lithosphere, as even a small amount of water enables convective erosion.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the hydrological behaviour of low topography, wetland-dominated sub-arctic areas is one major issue needed for the improvement of large scale hydrological models. These wet organic soils cover a large extent of Northern America and have a considerable impact on the rainfall-runoff response of a catchment. Moreover their strong interactions with the lower atmosphere and the carbon cycle make of these areas a noteworthy component of the regional climate system. In the framework of the Changing Cold Regions Network (CCRN), this study aims at providing a model for wetland water dynamics that can be used for large scale applications in cold regions. The modelling system has two main components : a) the simulation of surface runoff using the Modélisation Environmentale Communautaire – Surface and Hydrology (MESH) land surface model driven with several gridded atmospheric datasets and b) the routing of surface runoff using the WATROUTE channel scheme. As a preliminary study, we focus on two small representative study basins in Northern Canada : Scotty Creek in the lower Liard River valley of the Northwest Territories and Baker Creek, located a few kilometers north of Yellowknife. Both areas present characteristic landscapes dominated by a series of peat plateaus, channel fens, small lakes and bogs. Moreover, they constitute important fieldwork sites with detailed data to support our modelling study. The challenge of our new wetland model is to represent the hydrological functioning of the various landscape units encountered in those watersheds and their interactions using simple numerical formulations that can be later extended to larger basins such as the Mackenzie river basin. Using observed datasets, the performance of the model to simulate the temporal evolution of hydrological variables such as the water table depth, frost table depth and discharge is assessed.",

            "abstract": "The relationships among drought, surface water flow, and groundwater recharge are not straightforward for most forest ecosystems due to the strong role that vegetation plays in the forest water balance. Hydrologic responses to drought can be either mitigated or exacerbated by forest vegetation depending upon vegetation water use and how drought affects forest population dynamics. Because different species and functional groups vary in their ecophysiological traits that influence water use patterns, changes in species assemblages can alter hydrological processes from the stand to the watershed scales. Recent warming trends and more prolonged and frequent droughts have accelerated the spread and intensity of insect attacks in the western US that kill nearly all of the canopy trees within forest stands, changing the energy balance of the land surface and affecting many hydrologic processes. In contrast, some eastern forest tree species and size classes can tolerate drought better than others, suggesting the potential for drought-mediated shifts in both species composition and structure. Drought-related shifts in species composition may impact streamflow; however, predicting how these changes will impact hydrologic processes at larger spatial scales presents a considerable challenge. The biogeochemical consequences of drought are closely linked to changes in vegetation and hydrology. For example, droughts can have a concentrating effect on solutes in stream water due to the limited volume of water. As with other natural disturbances, droughts are difficult to prepare for because they are unpredictable. However, there are management options that may be implemented to minimize the impacts of drought on water quantity and quality. Examples include reducing leaf area by thinning and regenerating cut forests with species that consume less water.",

            "abstract": "Interactions of West Antarctic ice streams with meltwater at their beds, and with seawater at their grounding lines, are widely considered to be the primary drivers of ice stream flow variability on different timescales. Understanding of processes controlling ice flow variability is needed to build quantitative models of the Antarctic Ice Sheet that can be used to help predict its future behavior and to reconstruct its past evolution. The ice plain of Whillans Ice Stream provides a natural glaciological laboratory for investigations of Antarctic ice flow dynamics because of its highly variable flow rate modulated by tidal processes and fill-drain cycles of subglacial lakes. Moreover, this part of Antarctica has one of the longest time series of glaciological observations, which can be used to put recently acquired datasets in a multi-decadal context. Since 2007 Whillans Ice Stream has been the focus of a regional glaciological experiment, which included surface GPS and passive-source seismic sensors, radar and seismic imaging of subglacial properties, as well as deep borehole geophysical sensors. This experiment was possible thanks to the NSF-funded multidisciplinary WISSARD project (Whillans Ice Stream Subglacial Access Research Drilling). Here we will review the datasets collected during the WISSARD glaciological experiment and report on selected results pertaining to interactions of this ice stream with water at its bed and its grounding line.",

Past work suggests that I can range from less than 3 % to 27% of gross precipitation in semi-arid systems. For many years the hydrologic flow paths in vegetation canopies has been treated as a black box. For example, when researching canopy interception loss, researchers typically monitored total rainfall above and below the vegetation canopy. More recently, the spatial pattern of throughfall (TF) and stemflow (SF) have been of interest. Past research on the spatial patterning of TF under forest canopies has documented that persistent patterns of TF can occur. These patterns create “hot spots” of throughfall. Like trees, persistent spatial patterns of TF may exist under shrubs. To test the changes in the throughfall depth and distribution with changing local meteorological conditions, we monitored throughfall and stemflow under three sagebrush shrubs (n=64 throughfall gauges for each shrub). Rainfall interception loss under the shrubs ranged from 31 to 100% for storm events ranging from 0.4 to 52 mm in size. Stemflow only occurred during larger storm events (>10 mm). Stemflow is likely limited because the tortuous nature of the canopy architecture that readily sheds water from the canopy. The canopy architecture also resulted in temporally and spatially persistent drip points. For storms sufficient to saturate the canopy, temporally and spatially persistent drip points generated water inputs that were 1.5 time greater than gross precipitation.",

            "abstract": "Dust is a highly variable forcing mechanism altering martian atmospheric dynamics. The greatest variability in atmospheric dust opacity occurs during Mars’ northern hemisphere fall and winter, the canonical “dust storm season”. The northern polar vortex develops during this season and can be stretched, weakened, or strengthened by variations in atmospheric dust. Additionally, Mars’ north polar vortex manifests as an annulus of high potential vorticity around the geographic pole, which is distinctly different than Earth’s stratospheric polar vortices where potential vorticity peaks at the pole. We examine the role of dust in shaping and altering the martian polar vortices in a series of idealized MarsWRF general circulation model simulations. Increasing dust loading disrupts the northern polar vortex near the winter solstice leading to a “mid-winter warming”, and this is also seen in observations from the Mars Climate Sounder and Thermal Emission Spectrometer during large dust events. These appear loosely analogous with terrestrial “sudden stratospheric warming” events, where the strong westerly jet around the pole weakens and air inside the vortex quickly warms. The southern hemisphere winter polar vortex is distinctly different from that of the northern hemisphere, and we show that the fundamental “handedness” of the current martian climactic regime makes the southern hemisphere vortex less sensitive to dust forcing.",

            "abstract": "The Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (GPM) offers the opportunity for a greatly increased understanding of global rainfall and the hydrologic cycle. By employing a constellation of radiometers, coverage and sampling are greatly increased (Hou et al. 2014), while the core satellite acts as a standard, enabling consistent retrievals across constellation members. The combination of GPM core active and passive microwave sensors are used, following techniques developed using the predecessor Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, to construct observationally constrained databases of precipitation profiles for use in constellation member retrieval algorithms. The method uses a conservative approach that begins with the operational GPM combined radar-radiometer retrieval algorithm and adjusts its solution while maintaining a match to observed radar reflectivities and radiometer brightness temperature (Tb) in all GMI frequencies. Adjustments include adding a graupel species for convective pixels, cloud ice for improved agreement in the high frequency channels, and drizzle below the sensitivity of the radar. In order to build a robust, statistically representative database for use in a Bayesian retrieval scheme, non-raining pixels must also be proportionally represented. Tbs are modeled in non-raining areas using atmospheric and surface information consistent with the combined retrieval and observed Tbs, and the procedure is performed over all ocean and land surfaces. The resulting profiles include surface characterization, atmospheric information, and hydrometeor profiles, radiometrically consistent with the observed Tb. The profiles can then, using forward radiative transfer, be used to create databases for each of the GPM constellation radiometers. Early results indicate good agreement and high correlations between database simulated and observed Tbs. The database will be implemented within the GPROF algorithm for passive microwave rainfall retrievals applied to radiometers that form the GPM constellation.",

            "abstract": "This study seeks to investigate the performance of the 1-Dimensional lake model coupled to WRF over East Africa. The Africa Great lakes exert a great influence on the climate of the region and a number of studies have shown how the lake influences the circulation and the total precipitation over the region. The lakes have highly variable depths, with Lake Victoria having an average depth of 40m and Lake Tanganyika a depth of 450m. The Lake model for WRF was tested and calibrated for the Great lakes, however it was not tested for tropical lakes. We hypothesize that the inclusion of a 1-dimensional lake will reduce the precipitation bias as compared to the WRF model without the lake model. In addition initializing the lake temperature using a vertical temperature profile that closes resembles the one over these lakes will greatly reduce the spin up time. The simulations utilized three nested domains at 36, 12 and 4km. The 4km domain is centered over Lake Victoria Basin, while the 12 km domain includes all the lakes in East Africa. The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) datasets are used in evaluating the precipitation, and the following statistics were calculated: root mean square error, standard deviation of the model and observations and mean bias.\nThe results show that the use of the 1-dimensional lake model improves the precipitation over the region considerably compared to an uncoupled model. The asymmetrical rainfall pattern is evident in the simulations. However using the default vertical temperature profile with a three-month spin up is not adequate to transfer heat to the bottom of the lake. Hence the temperatures are still very cold at the bottom. A nine-month spin up improves the lake surface temperatures and lake temperatures at the bottom. A two year spin up greatly improves the lake surface temperatures and hence the total precipitation over the lake. Thus longer spin up time allows for adequate heat transfer in the lake. Initializing the vertical temperature with a temperature that closes resembles the observed profile, reduces the spinup time and precipitation bias.",

In situ observations show that PAN is formed rapidly in fire plumes, and its eventual decomposition can provide an important NOx redistribution pathway capable of sustaining efficient ozone production under the right conditions. Satellite measurements of PAN from the Aura Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) offer a new opportunity to look at when and where elevated PAN abundances in the troposphere are due to fires, placing new constraints on our understanding of the air quality impacts of smoke plumes. We will present an overview of what we have learned about fires and PAN from TES, and what types of analyses have been required to pull information out of this emerging dataset. We will focus on TES retrievals of PAN over Asia and North America collected between 2005 and 2011 during spring and summer months. We have found that fires are a major source of the PAN observed by TES in both regions, but there is significant observed interannual variability driven by a combination of emissions and dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The ability of soils and sediments to produce in-situ activation of persulfate was investigated for treatment of 1,4-dioxane (dioxane). Experiments were conducted with both batch-reactor and column systems to examine reaction rates and activation mechanisms. Four soils and aquifer sediments were used. ICP-MS, SEM-EDS, and XRD analyses were used to characterize geochemical properties. For the batch experiments, degradation of dioxane was significantly greater in the presence of each of the four subsurface geomedia compared to the controls with no geomedia. This indicates that all four geomedia induced persulfate activation. The use of a binary oxidant system, with the addition of hydrogen peroxide, further enhanced dioxane degradation. It is hypothesized that iron associated with the geomedia is primarily responsible for activation, and that the degree of degradation enhancement relates in part to iron content. For the miscible-displacement experiments, slight retardation and minimal mass loss of persulfate was observed for transport in the column packed with the selected soil. And no dioxane degradation was observed, likely due to the low hydraulic residence time. Conversely, oxidant decomposition, sulfate generation, and dioxane degradation were observed upon injection of persulfate and H2O2. The results of this study indicate that geomedia can induce activation of persulfate to enhance in-situ chemical oxidation applications.",

            "abstract": "We present a new and inherently 3D approach to the analysis of fault scarp geometry using high resolution topography. Recent advance in topographic measurement techniques (LiDAR and Structure from Motion) has allowed the extensive measurement of single earthquake scarps and multiple event cumulative scarps to draw conclusions about along-strike slip variation and characteristic slip. Present analysis of the resulting point clouds and digital elevation models is generally achieved by taking vertical or map view profiles of geomorphic markers across the scarp. Profiles are done at numerous locations along strike carefully chosen to avoid regions degraded by erosion/deposition. The resulting slip distributions are almost always extremely variable and “noisy”, both for strike-slip and dip-slip faulting scarps and it is often unclear whether this reflects slip variation, noise/erosion, site effects or geometric variation.\nWhen observing palaeo-earthquake and even modern event scarps, the full geometry, such as the degree of oblique slip or the fault dip, is often poorly constrained. We first present the results of synthetic tests to demonstrate the introduction of significant apparent noise by simply varying terrain, fault and measurement geometry (slope angle, slope azimuth, fault dip and slip obliquity). Considering fully 3-dimensional marker surfaces (e.g. Planar or conical) we use the variation in apparent offset with terrain and measurement geometry, to constrain the slip geometry in 3D. Combining measurements windowed along strike, we show that determining the slip vector is reduced to a simple linear problem. We conclude that for scarps in regions of significant topography or with oblique slip, our method will give enhanced slip resolution while standard methods will give poor slip resolution. We test our method using a Structure from Motion pointcloud and digital elevation model covering a ~25 km stretch of a thrust fault scarp in the Kazakh Tien Shan.",

            "abstract": "The Nazca plate subducts beneath Chile and Argentina between ~26° S and 40° S with a variable slab dip. Between 29° S and 32°S, the Chilean flat slab extends with a near horizontal slab dip for several hundred km before steepening. South of the Chilean flat slab, the slab dips normally beneath an active volcanic arc. This region is characterized by a lack of deep (>200 km depth) seismicity that restricts our knowledge of the subduction zone of the southern Andes. To investigate the geometry of the subducting Nazca slab, we invert teleseismic P-wave arrival times from stations covering a large portion of central Chile and Argentina for a tomographic model of the P-wave velocity structure using a finite-frequency method. We use data from ~350 stations that are part of 9 different temporary seismic networks deployed at various times since 1999 and 4 permanent networks operating as far back as 1994. The use of >30,000 arrival times from these seismic networks provides high-resolution imaging of the subduction zone from ~100 km depth down through the mantle transition zone.\nIn map view, the slab is visible as a high velocity feature with a cuspate shape pointed eastward near 32°S. The slab anomaly is much stronger to the north of the cusp than south. Between about 240 to 365 km depth, the point of the cusp appears to be interrupted by a localized low velocity feature. Further testing is required to determine whether the slab is torn here or merely thinned. Significantly, the high velocity feature south of the cusp continues downward through the transition zone. Despite the lack of seismicity our results clearly show the slab south of 32°S is present to depths of at least ~700 km. In cross-section views where the slab is well imaged, the slab penetrates through the entire transition zone to ~800 km depth, beyond which resolution is poor. Several cross-sections of the slab south of the cusp appear to show flattening of the slab in the uppermost lower mantle. Other strong non-slab velocity anomalies are present but require further testing of their resolution.",

Using stacked waveforms produced by stacking 1-minute windows of data from each array over the slowness with the greatest power [Ghosh et al., 2012], we pick out peaks in tremor activity that are consistent over multiple arrays. These peaks are potential LFE detections. Fifteen-second windows of raw data centered on each peak are scanned through time. If the waveform repeats, the detection is used as a new LFE family. Template waveforms for each family are created by stacking all windows that correlate with the initial detection. During an ETS event, activity at a given point on the plate interface (i.e. the activity of an LFE family) typically lasts for 3.5 (downdip) to 5 days (updip). Activity generally begins with a flurry of LFEs lasting 8 hours (downdip) to 20 hours (updip) followed by many short bursts of activity separated by 5 hours or more. Updip families have more bursts (5-10) than downdip families (2-5 bursts). The later bursts often occur during times of encouraging tidal shear stress, while the initial flurries have no significant correlation with tides. While updip LFE families are more active during ETS events than downdip families, they seldom light up between ETS events, which only occur every 12-14 months. On the other hand, downdip LFE families are active much more frequently during the year; the most down-dip families exhibit activity every week or so. Because updip families are rarely active between ETS events, it is possible that little stress is released updip during inter-ETS time periods. Hence during ETS events more stress needs to be released updip than downdip, consistent with the longer-duration activity of updip LFE families.",

The user can select the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) precipitation or Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) as predictand. They can also upload their own predictand time series. Predictors can be extracted from sea surface temperature, sea level pressure, winds at different pressure levels, air temperature at various pressure levels, and geopotential height at different pressure levels. By default, reanalysis fields are applied as predictors, but the user can also upload their own predictors, including a wide range of compatible satellite-derived datasets. The package generates correlations of the variables selected with the predictand. The user also has the option to generate composites of the variables based on the predictand. Next, the user can extract predictors by drawing polygons over the regions that show strong correlations (composites). Then, the user can select some or all of the statistical prediction models provided. Provided models include Linear Regression models (GLM, SGLM), Tree-based models (bagging, random forest, boosting), Artificial Neural Network, and other non-linear models such as Generalized Additive Model (GAM) and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS).

A version of this dynamic is materialising in the coastal polder areas of Khulna, Bangladesh. Repeated coastal floods increase salinity, wipe out agricultural yields for several years and increase out-migration. \nAs a tool to help inform and target future cycles of investment in improvements to the coastal embankments, in this paper we propose a dynamical model of biophysical processes and human well-being, which downscales our previous research to the Khulna region. State variables in the model include agricultural production, population, life expectancy and child mortality. Possible infrastructure interventions include embankment improvements, groundwater wells and drainage infrastructure. Hazard factors include flooding, salinization and drinking water pollution.\nOur system model can be used to inform adaptation decision making by testing the dynamical response of the system to a range of possible policy interventions, under uncertain future conditions. The analysis is intended to target investment and enable adaptive resource reallocation based on learning about the system response to interventions over the seven years of our research programme.\nThe methodology and paper will demonstrate the complex interplay of factors that determine system vulnerability to climate change. The role of climate change uncertainties (in terms of mean sea level rise and storm surge frequency) will be evaluated alongside multiple other uncertain factors that determine system response. Adaptive management in a ‘learning system’ will be promoted as a mechanism for coping with climate uncertainties.\n",

            "abstract": "Increasing concerns about drought impacts on water resources in California underscores the need to better understand effects of drought on water storage and coping strategies. Here we use a new GRACE mascons solution with high spatial resolution (1 degree) developed at the Univ. of Texas Center for Space Research (CSR) and output from the most recent regional groundwater model developed by the U.S. Geological Survey to evaluate changes in water storage in response to recent droughts. We also extend the analysis of drought impacts on water storage back to the 1980s using modeling and monitoring data. The drought has been intensifying since 2012 with almost 50% of the state and 100% of the Central Valley under exceptional drought in 2015. Total water storage from GRACE data declined sharply during the current drought, similar to the rate of depletion during the previous drought in 2007 – 2009. However, only 45% average recovery between the two droughts results in a much greater cumulative impact of both droughts. The CSR GRACE Mascons data offer unprecedented spatial resolution with no leakage to the oceans and no requirement for signal restoration. Snow and reservoir storage declines contribute to the total water storage depletion estimated by GRACE with the residuals attributed to groundwater storage. Rates of groundwater storage depletion are consistent with the results of regional groundwater modeling in the Central Valley. Traditional approaches to coping with these climate extremes has focused on surface water reservoir storage; however, increasing conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater and storing excess water from wet periods in depleted aquifers is increasing in the Central Valley.",

Such an instrument would also provide the benefit of guiding scientifically based sample selection and prioritization for a sample return mission. We have developed a prototype laser time-of-flight mass spectrometer that is able to detect both inorganic and organic species generated directly from an unprepared powdered sample or rock chip.

A re-evaluation of Tp estimates for Earth, Mars, Moon, and Vesta, reveals an anticipated decrease in maximum Tp as planet size decreases, at least if we apply a 4.3 Ga age to shergottites (e.g., Bouvier et al., 2009; Werner et al., 2014), and use the highest MgO komatiites from Earth’s Archean eon (27-30% MgO, e.g., Green et al., 1975). With these assumptions, Earth and Mars yield time-Tp paths indicative of secular cooling that appears to be largely monotonic following the end of accretion. These two cooling trends further provide intriguing support for Stevenson’s (2003) hypothesis that smaller planets cool at similar rates, but always maintain lower temperatures. One key difference between Earth and the other bodies, though, is that Earth exhibits a clear split in Phanerozoic terrestrial mantle temperatures, into plume- and ambient-Tp, although there is a hint of a parallel process on Mars at 1.3 Ga, if we accept that the high MgO Nakhla D composition is a liquid (Longhi and Pan, 1989; Treiman 1986). The onset of Tp bi-modality may be a harbinger of a transition from a stagnant lid to a plume/plate convective regime; in the former, only hot plumes from the core-mantle boundary contribute to volcanism, whereas in a plume/plate mode, small-scale convection of cooler ambient mantle, mostly at rifts and subduction zones, also contributes to surface volcanism. The contrasts between Earth and the other bodies imply that planetary radii and initial temperatures exert the primary control on whether or not modern terrestrial tectonics is able to develop. Exploration of Mars is still at too early a stage to infer much regarding its internal thermal state at 1.3 Ga, but clearly the study of young volcanic features there are of prime importance, perhaps much more so for understanding planetary and bioligical evolution than our current search for microbiotic life.",

Data acquisition frequently occurs in a variety of challenging environments, which include locations with high Radio Frequency (RF) noise characteristics. Tracking the relatively low powered GNSS carrier signals broadcast from space becomes even more challenging in the presence of adjacent band RF noise. The demand for terrestrial RF spectrum use for a variety of non-GNSS applications is ever increasing, which poses potential challenges for GNSS site operators who would like to acquire the highest quality data possible.\nIn recent years, UNAVCO has observed an increase in the number of GNSS sites which are negatively impacted by RF interference. In previous work, we have shown that telemetry systems utilizing the Iridium satellite constellation can degrade GNSS data quality, as the adjacent-band (1610-1616 Mhz) signals transmitted by Iridium data transmitters are close in proximity to the L1 frequency of GNSS. The impact of RF interference from Iridium data transmitters on GNSS receivers can cause reduced Signal-to-Noise (SNR), increased cycle slips, and in worst case scenarios, prevent the receiver from tracking.\nTo better characterize GNSS receiver susceptibility to RF interference, UNAVCO has performed a variety of tests with Continuous Wave (CW) noise sources in RF bands adjacent to the GNSS spectrum. We simulate a subset of discrete noise frequencies commonly observed in the field using a frequency generator, which supplies a signal with varying power output from a transmitter located within 1 m of the GNSS antenna. Signal power is incremented in small steps until receiver tracking fails. All receivers are simultaneously evaluated using an 8-way splitter. In addition, we investigate receiver tracking performance with a simulated increase in the RF noise floor. To analyze the results we use the number of tracked satellites, signal strength, and cycle slips to characterize GNSS receiver tracking performance while being subjected to adjacent-band RF interference. In this paper, we will present our preliminary findings from these tests for a variety of commonly used modern geodetic GNSS receiver models.",

            "abstract": "Thermokarst lakes form following the subsidence of ice-rich permafrost terrain and concurrent infilling of the depression with water. Areas of unfrozen sediment, called taliks, can form under lakes that have a mean annual bottom temperature greater than 0°C. Taliks are thought to play an important role in permafrost hydrology and carbon cycling. Sub-lake taliks can extend to depths of tens of meters, making them difficult and costly to measure by direct methods such as boreholes. Surface nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) provides an unambiguous measurement of the liquid water content associated with unfrozen taliks; however, limitations of the measurements and the interpretation of the data still remain. Forward models were created to test the effect of varying water column thicknesses on the ability to resolve the depth and water content of taliks with parameters similar to geometries measured in late-winter field studies in the Arctic and Boreal regions of Alaska. The results of the forward modeling show that talik depth resolution decreases with a larger water column thickness, a shallower talik depth, and a lower water content. These results place constraints on our field measurements, with lakes greater than 9 m deep yielding potentially misleading inversion results. Field data was collected at a small, 4.6 m deep thermokarst lake near Fairbanks, Alaska, which had a known subsurface structure including talik depth, and available talik sediments from cores. Known subsurface structure was not used to inform the inversion model to determine how well talik depth could be resolved in lakes with unknown structure. With constraints placed on ice and water thickness, which are easily measured in the field, the blocky inversion model was able to accurately resolve the talik depth and water content for lakes less than 9 m deep.",

We have developed a prototype EEW system for the U.S. West Coast using real-time precise point positioning with ambiguity resolution (PPP-AR). It includes about 200 GPS stations spanning the areas of greatest seismic risk: Cascadia, the San Francisco Bay Area and southern California, using IGS ultra-rapid orbits and a North-America based GPS network well outside the region of expected deformation to estimate satellite clock and fractional cycle biases. We have analyzed, retrospectively in real time, earthquakes from Mw5.1 to Mw9.0; we can detect dynamic displacements with a precision of about one cm, but we’ve encountered several issues that could improve our operational system. Reinitialization of the integer-cycle phase ambiguities is problematic when a (not unusual) data gap of more than about 5 minutes is encountered. Also, ambiguity resolution is less reliable when there are only a limited number (six or less) of GPS satellites available. Nowadays, GNSS is evolving to a true multi-constellation environment with GLONASS having been restored to a 24-satellite constellation in 2012. We present a method for GNSS (GPS+GLONASS) PPP-AR to improve on the performance of GPS PPP-AR in EEW. We find that GNSS-AR has higher reliability in achieving ambiguity-fixed solutions, improves vertical accuracy by 20%, reduces initialization time to less than 7 minutes from about 20 minutes, and reduces outlier rates from 1.2% to below 0.2%. We use three earthquakes to demonstrate GNSS-AR, the M7.8 2014 Iquique, Chile aftershock, and Mw 6.9 2014 North Aegean, Greece and Mw 6.3 2009 L’Aquila, Italy earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU Poster final.pdf\nAnalyzing trapped air bubbles in glacial ice is a well-established and useful method to reconstruct past atmospheric gas concentrations. However, trapped gas composition can be affected by fractionation during the closure of the air bubbles, complicating the reconstruction. Gases such as dioxygen (O2) and dihydrogen (H2) are known to leak out of the bubbles by permeation through the ice lattice at the close-off depth,where firn turns into ice. This process also can cause isotope fractionation, which obscures the past atmospheric isotope ratios in air bubbles in glacial ice. In order to establish the most accurate measurements of past atmospheric content, we need very detailed understanding of the permeation leakage mechanism in order to establish possible corrections. In this study, we propose the use of neon stable isotopes (neon-22 and neon-20) to place constraints on the mechanism of permeation leakage. Neon isotopes are an ideal system to explore because neon has a constant atmospheric isotope ratio, and thus only is affected by close-off fractionation. Neon permeation occurs via velocity-dependent hopping between sites within the ice lattice, because the neon atom is smaller than the critical size (3.6 Å) of the opening in the lattice. Theory predicts that neon isotope fractionation will occur due to the lower velocity of the heavier isotope, but this has never been experimentally verified and the theory is unable to quantitatively predict the magnitude of the fractionation. We will present the first results of high-precision neon isotope (22Ne/20Ne) measurements made in air pumped from the firm-to-ice transition in the Greenland Ice Sheet, where actively closing air bubbles drive permeation leakage. By measuring this natural neon isotope fractionation, we hope to learn about the mass dependence of the leakage mechanism and develop a more quantitative theory that is generalizable to biogeochemically- and climatically-active gases.

However, the number of potential chemical and transport mechanisms that influence drip water composition can complicate speleothem records. A thorough understanding of processes affecting isotopic and geochemical compositions of modern cave waters is essential for interpreting proxies in a climate context. We couple a reactive transport model, CrunchTope, with modern measurements from Blue Spring Cave, Tennessee to understand the factors controlling proxy variability. For 2 years we have monitored surface and soil temperature, precipitation and soil moisture, cave temperature and pCO2, drip rate, and drip water chemistry, δ18O, and δ13C of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). The range of variability in drip water δ18O indicates some drips are fed by fracture flow from the surface, while others are fed by more diffuse flow paths. For both drip types, δ13CDIC is inversely correlated with monthly rainfall. Cave air pCO2 suggests seasonal ventilation driven by surface air temperature change. Drip water Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca indicate prior carbonate precipitation (PCP) occurs in the epikarst, but do not appear to reflect cave ventilation.\nTo improve interpretations of drip water geochemical variation, we parameterize CrunchTope with horizons representing soil, epikarst and karst. We use this model to simulate water chemistry changes due to coupled fluid transport and water-mineral interactions in the soils and bedrock. Initial model runs reproduce mean drip water [Sr] and [Mg]. Accurate simulation of drip water [Ca] requires inclusion of a low pCO2 layer that drives PCP. With the inclusion of isotope systematics, a baseline model calibrated with modern data will be available to simulate the effects of long-term climate change on cave waters, thus enhancing the quantitative interpretation of speleothem proxy records.",

We also aimed to identify the time-lag and annual season of extreme rainfall and flooding in different cities in the water basin. The results using Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Satellite rainfall data show robustness of these estimates against observational stations on-ground. The Pearson coefficient correlation results (highest 0.35) indicate a time-lag, up to 4 days in three of the cities in the water-basin. In addition, a correlation was also tested between monthly accumulated rainfall and the diarrheal incidence during the rainy season (DJF). Correlation results were higher, especially in Acrelândia (0.7) and Brasiléia and Epitaciolândia (0.5). The correlation between water level monthly averages and diarrheal diseases incidence was 0.3 and 0.5 in Brasiléia and Epitaciolândia. The time-lag evidence found in this paper is critical to inform stakeholders, local populations and civil defense authorities about the time available for preventive and adaptation measures between extreme rainfall and flooding events in vulnerable cities. This study was part of a pilot application in the state of Acre of the PULSE-Brazil project (\nhttp://www.pulse-brasil.org/tool/\n), an interface of climate, environmental and health data to support climate adaptation. The next step of this research is to expand the analysis to other climate variables on diarrheal diseases across the whole Brazilian Amazon Basin and estimate the relative risk (RR) of a child getting sick. A statistical model will estimate RR based on the observed values and seasonal forecasts (higher accuracy for the Amazon region) will be used so the government can be prepared for extreme climate events forecasted. It is expected that these results can be helpful during and post extreme events to improve health surveillance preparedness and better allocate available results in adapting vulnerable cities to climate extreme events.",

            "abstract": "The Global Seismographic Network (GSN) is a 151 station, globally distributed permanent network of state-of-the-art seismological and geophysical sensors that is a result of an ongoing successful partnership between IRIS, the USGS, the University of California at San Diego, NSF and numerous host institutions worldwide. In recent years, the GSN has standardized their dataloggers to the Quanterra Q330HR data acquisition system at all but three stations. Current equipment modernization efforts are focused on the development of a new very broadband borehole sensor to replace failing KS-54000 instruments and replacing the aging Streckeisen STS-1 surface instruments at many GSN stations.\nAging of GSN equipment and discoveries of quality problems with GSN data (e.g., the long period response of the STS-1 sensors) have resulted in the GSN placing major emphasis on quantifying, validating and maintaining data quality. This has resulted in the implementation of MUSTANG and DQA systems for analyzing GSN data quality and enables both network operators and data end users to quickly characterize the performance of stations and networks. We will present summary data quality metrics for the GSN as obtained via these quality assurance tools.\nData from the GSN are used not only for research, but on a daily basis are part of the operational missions of the USGS NEIC, NOAA tsunami warning centers, the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban-Treaty Organization as well as other organizations. The primary challenges for the GSN include maintaining these operational capabilities while simultaneously developing and replacing the primary borehole sensors, replacing as needed the primary vault sensors, maintaining high quality data and repairing station infrastructure, all during a period of very tight federal budgets. We will provide an overview of the operational status of the GSN, with a particular emphasis on the status of the primary borehole and vault sensors.",

The ambient noise tomography (ANT) component of this experiment measures shear velocity structure, which is more sensitive than P velocity to the presence of melt and other pore fluids. Seventy passive-source broadband seismometers for iMUSH were deployed in the summer of 2014 in a dense array of 100 Km diameter with a 10 km station spacing. We cross correlated ambient noise in 120 s windows and summed the result over many months for pairs of stations. Then frequency-domain methods on these cross correlations are employed to measure the phase velocities (Ekström et al. Geophys Rev Lett, 2009). Unlike velocities attained by group velocity methods, velocities for path lengths as small as one wavelength can be measured, enabling analysis of higher frequency signals and increasing spatial resolution. The minimum station spacing from which signals can be recovered ranges from 12 km at 0.18 Hz, a frequency that dominantly samples the upper crust to 20 km, to 37 km at 0.04 Hz, a frequency sensitive to structure through the crust and uppermost mantle, with lower spacing at higher frequencies. These phase velocities are tomographically inverted to obtain shear velocity maps for each frequency, assuming ray theory. Initial shear velocity maps for frequencies between 0.04-0.18 Hz reveal low-velocity sediments in the Puget Lowland west of Mount St Helens at 0.16-0.18 Hz, and a low velocity zone near 0.10 Hz between Mt Rainier and Mt Adams, east of Mount St Helens. The latter may reflect large-scale crustal plumbing of the arc between volcanic centers. In subsequent analyses these ANT results will be jointly inverted with receiver functions in order to further resolve crustal and upper mantle structure.",

            "abstract": "Multi-year land cover mapping from remotely sensed data poses challenges. Producing land cover products at spatial and temporal scales required for assessing longer-term trends in land cover change are typically a resource-limited process. A recently developed approach utilizes open source software libraries to automatically generate datasets, decision tree classifications, and data products while requiring minimal user interaction. Users are only required to supply coordinates for an area of interest, land cover from an existing source such as National Land Cover Database and percent slope from a digital terrain model for the same area of interest, two target acquisition year-day windows, and the years of interest between 1984 and present. The algorithm queries the Landsat archive for Landsat data intersecting the area and dates of interest. Cloud-free pixels meeting the user’s criteria are mosaicked to create composite images for training the classifiers and applying the classifiers. Stratification of training data is determined by the user and redefined during an iterative process of reviewing classifiers and resulting predictions. The algorithm outputs include yearly land cover raster format data, graphics, and supporting databases for further analysis. Additional analytical tools are also incorporated into the automated land cover system and enable statistical analysis after data are generated. Applications tested include the impact of land cover change and water permanence. For example, land cover conversions in areas where shrubland and grassland were replaced by shale oil pads during hydrofracking of the Bakken Formation were quantified. Analytical analysis of spatial and temporal changes in surface water included identifying wetlands in the Prairie Pothole Region of North Dakota with potential connectivity to ground water, indicating subsurface permeability and geochemistry.",

            "abstract": "The Eliassen-Palm (EP) flux is an important diagnostic for wave propagation and wave-mean flow interaction in the atmosphere. Here we compare two moist formulations of the EP flux with the traditional dry EP flux and analyze their link to the position and strength of the surface westerlies using reanalysis data and both fully-coupled and idealized climate models. The first moist formulation of the EP flux modifies only the static stability to account for latent heat release by eddies, while the second moist formulation simply replaces all potential temperatures with equivalent potential temperatures. When moisture is taken into account, the latitude of maximum upward EP flux and maximum EP flux convergence shift equatorward and the strengths of both the flux and convergence increase, with larger changes for the second moist formulation.\nIn simulations with a coupled atmosphere-ocean climate model, both the peak surface winds and peak upward EP flux in the lower troposphere tend to be co-located throughout the seasonal cycle (especially in the moist formulations) and shift poleward by similar amounts in response to greenhouse warming. In simulations over a wider range of climates with an idealized atmospheric climate model we find that in cold climates the position of the surface westerlies coincides with the position of the maximum vertical EP flux and shifts poleward with warming, while in warm climates the surface westerlies coincide with an anomalous region of EP flux divergence near the subtropical jet. An isentropic potential enstrophy budget analysis reveals that in this model the anomalous EP flux divergence is balanced by vertical eddy PV fluxes associated with diabatic heating from large-scale condensation and radiation. The anomalous divergence is weaker when using moist EP fluxes, indicating that the moist formulations are partly capturing this effect.",

            "abstract": "Seismic investigations following the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens have led to a detailed model of the magmatic and tectonic structure directly beneath the volcano. These studies suffer from limited resolution below ~10 km, making it difficult to estimate the volume of the shallow magma reservoir beneath the volcano, the regions of magma entry into the lower crust, and the connectivity of this magma system throughout the crust. The latter is particularly interesting as one interpretation of the Southern Washington Cascades Conductor (SWCC) suggests that the Mount St Helens and Mount Adams volcanic systems are connected in the crust (Hill et al., 2009).\nThe multi-disciplinary iMUSH (imaging Magma Under St. Helens) project is designed to investigate these and other fundamental questions associated with Mount St. Helens. Here we present the first high-resolution 2D Vp and Vs models derived from travel-time data from the iMUSH 3D active-source seismic experiment. Significant lateral heterogeneity exists in both the Vp and Vs models. Directly beneath Mount St. Helens we observe a high Vp/Vs body, inferred to be the upper/middle crustal magma reservoir, between 4 and 13 km depth. Southeast of this body is a low Vp column extending from the Moho to approximately 15 km depth. A cluster of low frequency events, typically associated with injection of magma, occurs at the northwestern boundary of this low Vp column. Much of the recorded seismicity between the shallow high Vp/Vs body and deep low Vp column took place in the months preceding and hours following the May 18, 1980 eruption. This may indicate a transient migration of magma between these two reservoirs associated with this eruption.\nOutside of the inferred magma bodies that feed Mount St. Helens, we observe several other interesting velocity anomalies. In the lower crust, high Vp features bound the low Vp column. One explanation for these features is the presence of lower crustal cumulates associated with Tertiary ancestral Cascade volcanism. West of Mount St. Helens, high Vp/Vs regions in the upper and middle crust have eastern boundaries that are close to the eastern boundaries of the accreted Siletzia terrain inferred from magnetic data. Finally, a low Vp channel northeast of Mount St. Helens between 14 and 18 km depth correlates well with the location of the SWCC.",

            "abstract": "The Murray formation in its type section at Pahrump Hills, consists of approximately 14 meters of recessive-weathering mudstone interbedded with decimeter-scale cross-bedded sandstone in the upper portions of the exposed section. Mudstone textures vary from massive, to poorly laminated, to well laminated. Unusual 3-dimensional crystal clusters and dendrites occur in the lowermost part of the section and are erosionally resistant with respect to the host rock. Crystal clusters consist of elongate lathes that occur within individual blocks of the fractured substrate. Individual lathes show tabular morphologies with a pseudo-rectangular cross-section and the three dimensional morphology of the crystal clusters cross-cut host rock lamination with little or no deformation. Dendritic structures are typically larger and show predominantly planar growth aligned with bedding planes. Individual lathes within the dendrites are elongate and pseudo-rectangular in cross-section. Unlike crystal clusters, dendritic morphologies appear to nucleate at bedrock fractures and near mineralized veins.\nHere we show evidence that crystal clusters and dendrites are post-depositional, potentially burial diagenetic features. Association of features with through-going fractures suggests that fractures may have been a primary transport pathway for ions responsible for dendrite growth. Even where dendrites do not occur, enhanced cementation suggests that fluids permeated the rock matrix. We suggest that growth of clusters proceeded as inter-particle crystal growth, wherein mineral growth within inter-particle spaces resulted in cementation and porosity loss, with little further effect on the rock matrix. Crystal clusters and dendrites are most likely to form when mineral saturation states are highest, for instance with initial intrusion of fracture-borne fluids and mixing with ambient pore fluids, and thus emphasize the importance of fractures in ion transport during late diagenesis.",

            "abstract": "To better describe the state of sea ice in the marginal ice zone (MIZ) with floes of varying thicknesses and sizes, both an ice thickness distribution (ITD) and a floe size distribution (FSD) are needed. We have developed a FSD theory [Zhang et al., 2015] that is coupled to the ITD theory of Thorndike et al. [1975] in order to explicitly simulate the evolution of FSD and ITD jointly. The FSD theory includes a FSD function and a FSD conservation equation in parallel with the ITD equation. The FSD equation takes into account changes in FSD due to ice advection, thermodynamic growth, and lateral melting. It also includes changes in FSD because of mechanical redistribution of floe size due to ice opening, ridging and, particularly, ice fragmentation induced by stochastic ocean surface waves. The floe size redistribution due to ice fragmentation is based on the assumption that wave-induced breakup is a random process such that when an ice floe is broken, floes of any smaller sizes have an equal opportunity to form, without being either favored or excluded. It is also based on the assumption that floes of larger sizes are easier to break because they are subject to larger flexure-induced stresses and strains than smaller floes that are easier to ride with waves with little bending; larger floes also have higher areal coverages and therefore higher probabilities to break. These assumptions with corresponding formulations ensure that the simulated FSD follows a power law as observed by satellites and airborne surveys. The FSD theory has been tested in the Pan-arctic Ice/Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS). The existing PIOMAS has 12 categories each for ice thickness, ice enthalpy, and snow depth. With the implementation of the FSD theory, PIOMAS is able to represent 12 categories of floe sizes ranging from 0.1 m to ~3000 m. It is found that the simulated 12-category FSD agrees reasonably well with FSD derived from SAR and MODIS images. In this study, we will examine PIOMAS-estimated variability and changes in Arctic FSD over the period 1979–present.\nThorndike, A. S., D. A. Rothrock, G. A. Maykut, and R.

            "abstract": "Parallel electric fields are a necessary condition for magnetic reconnection with non-zero guide field and are ultimately accountable for topological reconfiguration of a magnetic field. Parallel electric fields also play a strong role in charged particle acceleration and turbulence. The Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission targets these three universal plasma processes. The MMS satellites have an accurate three-dimensional electric field measurement, which can identify parallel electric fields as low as 1 mV/m at four adjacent locations. We present preliminary observations of parallel electric fields from MMS and provide an early interpretation of their impact on magnetic reconnection, in particular, where the topological change occurs. We also examine the role of parallel electric fields in particle acceleration. Direct particle acceleration by parallel electric fields is well established in the auroral region. Observations of double layers in by the Van Allan Probes suggest that acceleration by parallel electric fields may be significant in energizing some populations of the radiation belts. THEMIS observations also indicate that some of the largest parallel electric fields are found in regions of strong field-aligned currents associated with turbulence, suggesting a highly non-linear dissipation mechanism. We discuss how the MMS observations extend our understanding of the role of parallel electric fields in some of the most critical processes in the magnetosphere.",

In this study we resampled organic layer depths, below ground carbon stocks, and site revegetation from 38 burned black spruce sites from the 2004 wildfires.

            "abstract": "During the past several decades, numerous reservoirs have been built across the world for a variety of purposes such as flood control, irrigation, municipal water supplies, and hydropower. Consequently, streamflow timing and magnitude are altered significantly by reservoir operations. In addition, the hydrological cycle can be modified substantially by a changing climate. Therefore, a distributed hydrological model which has an embedded reservoir component is essential for representing these effects in future water management planning strategies. In this study, a multi-purpose reservoir module was integrated into the Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM). The DHSVM model was selected because of its high spatial and temporal resolution and because of its explicit representation of the physical processes. Prescribed operating rules, which are designed to reduce flood risk and enhance water supply reliability, were adopted in this module. The integrated model was tested over a water-limited basin (i.e. the central Brazos River Basin, Texas). Both the calibration and validation results suggest that the model performed robustly at daily, weekly, and monthly levels. Subsequently, the effect of climate sensitivity on reservoir storage and outflow was assessed by perturbing precipitation within a range from -30% to 30% and temperature from -2 °C to 2 °C. Results suggest that both variables are more sensitive to precipitation than temperature. However, there are more uncertainties associated with future precipitation than temperature. It was also found that the sensitivities vary significantly by season. Enabled with the new reservoir component, the DHSVM model provides a platform for projecting future water availability estimations under flow regulation, climate change, and land cover/land use changes. We expect this integrated model to be beneficial for sustainable water resources management.",

Using these datasets, we investigate the three-dimensional morphology of Titan’s lacustrine basins in order to address their interconnectivity and provide observables that will constrain plausible formation mechanism. Using altimetry measurements, we will show that the liquid elevations of Titan’s maria share, to within measurement error, the same equipotential surface. The liquid elevations of several smaller lakes, however, are several hundreds above sea level, suggesting that they exist in isolated or perched basins. However, within a given topographic basin, the floor elevations of empty lake floors are always higher than the local liquid elevation, suggesting local subsurface connectivity. Furthermore, basins with floors closer to the local phreatic surface appear brighter to both nadir and off-nadir microwave observations than those that are more elevated, indicating a potential change in composition.\nThe majority of Titan’s lakes reside in sharp edged depressions whose planform curvature suggests expansion through uniform scarp retreat. Many, but not all, of these basins exhibit flat floors and hundred-meter scale raised rims that present a challenge to proposed formation models. The basins are often topographically closed with no evidence for inflow or outflow channels at the 300 m resolution of Cassini SAR images. The implications of these observations will be discussed in the context of common basin formation models, including karst, organic diapirs, periglacial processes (e.g., pingos, thaw lakes, and kettle holes), cryovolcanic processes (e.g., laccoliths, maars, and calderas), craters, gas pockmarks, and sublimation. We will conclude that dissolution (e.g., karst) or pressurized gas release (e.g., gas pockmarks) mechanisms can best match the observed constraints, but that challenges still exist in the interpretation of formation processes and materials.",

The instrument provides measurements (amongst other variables) of electron density (Ne) and temperature (Te). The overarching scientific goal of MAVEN is to determining how Mars lost its atmosphere and to understand the physical processes governing this escape and the above quantities play a crucial role in understanding this. Ne and Te information is critical for determining the efficiency of the different photochemical reaction rates and thereby in understanding the upper atmospheric composition. Understanding the upper atmosphere allows the MAVEN mission to calculate escape rates. Photochemical reactions and collisions dominate below the exobase region (~150-~180 km). Above the exobase, particles with energies greater than the Mars gravity well can escape. On the dayside solar EUV heats the atmosphere at lower altitudes and produces the ionosphere. It is of great interest to understand the how the electron density and temperature correlate. The presented study therefore shows the correlation between Ne and Te. This study investigates how different solar zenith angles affect these quantities and evaluates if closed magnetic field lines (as expected to occur over crustal magnetic fields) change the correlation between the two. Many previous studies have shown that crustal fields affect the plasma at high altitudes. In this study we present how the magnetic field influences the photochemical and the plasma processes close to the exobase via analyzing Ne and Te.",

Zones of induced seismicity have been defined by reviewing the current scientific literature, and by identifying unusual patterns of seismicity. We focus our calculations on earthquakes that have occurred in Oklahoma, southern Kansas and northern Texas (OK-KSS-TXN). This region has a high activity rate, and has produced a large number of earthquakes for the likelihood tests. We apply likelihood tests to smoothed seismicity models in order to test the ability of seismicity-based rate models to predict the spatial distribution and absolute rate of induced earthquakes.\nSince 2009, the OK-KSS-TXN region has experienced an over 200-fold increase in monthly activity rates. Regional activity rates exhibit monthly variations of up to 50 percent, as well as strong spatio-temporal variations. Models were computed from 6- and 12-month sub-catalogs, dating from 2009-2014 and are tested against earthquakes that occurred in the first six months of 2015; we also test the effect of various smoothing distances (5-50 km). Likelihood results show a strong correlation between information gain and the use of seismicity from the most recent part of the earthquake catalog. Information gains from the smoothed seismicity models developed from 2013 and 2014 are about five times better than the smoothed seismicity models developed from the earthquakes that occurred from 2009-2012. Because we use the rate-normalized formulation for the likelihood calculation, these results also imply that the spatial distribution of recent seismicity is significantly different than the seismicity occurring as recently as three years ago. Our results indicate that the one-year forecast model will have the greatest information gain when it is based on the prior one or two years of seismicity.",

Although microseismic monitoring and analysis have been used for this purpose for several decades, there remain several ambiguities and uncertainties with this approach. We are investigating a novel electromagnetic (EM) technique for detecting and mapping hydraulic fractures in a petroleum reservoir by injecting an electrically conductive contrast agent into an open fracture. The fracture is subsequently illuminated by a strong EM field radiated by a large engineered antenna. Specifically, a grounded electric current source is applied directly to the steel casing of the borehole, either at/near the wellhead or at a deep downhole point. Transient multicomponent EM signals (both electric and magnetic) scattered by the conductivity contrast are then recorded by a surface receiver array. We are presently utilizing advanced 3D numerical modeling algorithms to accurately simulate fracture responses, both before and after insertion of the conductive contrast agent. Model results compare favorably with EM field data recently acquired in a Permian Basin oilfield. However, extraction of the very-low-amplitude fracture signatures from noisy data requires effective noise suppression strategies such as long stacking times, rejection of outliers, and careful treatment of natural magnetotelluric fields. Dealing with the ever-present “episodic EM noise” typical in an active oilfield environment (associated with drilling, pumping, machinery, traffic, etc.) constitutes an ongoing problem.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the US Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.",

            "abstract": "Central Florida's thick carbonate deposits and hydrological conditions have made the area prone to sinkhole development. Sinkhole collapse is a major geologic hazard in central Florida threatening human life and causing substantial damage to property. According to the Florida Senate report in 2010, between 2006-2010 total insurance claims due to sinkhole activity were around $200 million per year. Detecting sinkhole deformation before a collapse is a very difficult task, due to small or sometimes unnoticeable surface changes. Most techniques used to monitor sinkholes provide very localized information and cannot be implemented to study broad areas. This is the case of central Florida, where the active zone spans over hundreds of square-kilometers.\nIn this study we use Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) observations acquired over several locations in central Florida to detect possible pre-collapse deformation. The study areas were selected because they have shown suspicious sinkhole behavior. One of the sites collapsed on March 2013 destroying a property and killing a man. To generate the InSAR results we use six datasets acquired by the TerraSAR-X and Cosmo-SkyMed satellites with various acquisition modes reflecting pixel resolutions between 25cm and 2m. Preliminary InSAR results show good coherence over constructed areas and low coherence in vegetated zones, justifying our analysis that focuses on the man-made structures. After full datasets will be acquired, a Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) time series analysis will be performed for detecting localized deformation at spatial scale of 1-5 meters. The project results will be verified using Ground Penetrating Radar.",

Detangling each individual process is critical to improve the understanding of radiation belt dynamics, but determining any single component is difficult due to sparse measurements of a large observation space. However, in the current era, an unprecedented number of spacecraft are taking measurements, and they are sampling different regions of the inner magnetosphere. With today’s observations, system dynamics can begin to be unraveled. In this work, we focus on in-situ measurements during a single outer belt enhancement event, which occurred on January 13-14, 2013. We use Van Allen Probe measurements of ULF wave activity to determine radial transport rates. We use Colorado Student Space Weather Experiment observations to model electron lifetimes from atmospheric precipitation caused by pitch-angle diffusion. To estimate the source rate, we use a data assimilative model. The Kalman filter method we use estimates the full radial phase space density profile, as well as the amplitude, location, and radial extent of a Guassian-shaped source region. The estimates are made by minimizing the residuals between a simple 1D radial diffusion model and Van Allen Probe phase space density observations for mu=750 MeV/G and K=0.11 G^(1/2)R_E. The model also quantifies electrons lost to the outer boundary, providing direct comparison between losses to the inner and outer boundaries. This work produces simultaneous, quantitative estimates of loss, transport, and acceleration mechanisms and the relative contribution from each.",

A single spacecraft can provide short time scale df/dt measurements, while multiple spacecraft can provide values over periods comparable to the spacecraft separation. Using data from multiple LANL-GEO spacecraft provides a unique view of temporal and spatial variations that allow us to gauge time and length scales for changing particle fluxes at GEO. These scales provide a base ability to predict the plasma environment conditions for spacecraft crossing GEO. Probability distribution functions based on electron df/dt values are used to predict the electron flux at a given magnetic local time at GEO based on prior measurements. The predictions, when compared to new data taken in the same region, provide some measure of how the electron plasma environment at GEO has changed in the interim period. These predictions are compared to data from the Van Allen Probes as their orbits cross GEO to verify the validity of this technique.",

The 1979 flybys of the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft through the Jovian system provided in situ measurements of plasma properties by the Plasma Science (PLS) instruments. Re-analysis of the Voyager 1 and 2 PLS data, combined with constraints from EUV emissions, allow a more detailed description of the distribution of heavier ions throughout the entire Jovian magnetosphere. The PLS instrument on the Voyager spacecraft had a large angle of view, with 4 Faraday cups covering different portions of the sky. This allows for an accurate determination of the properties of the plasma, including density, temperature, and flow speed, assuming a convected Maxwellian distribution. We determine densities of S+, S++, S+++, O+, and O++ ions mapped out to 30 RJ. Because the instrument measures a current as a function of energy/charge, there is an ambiguity in the measurement of the density of the dominant species O+ and S++. To resolve this issue we use a chemistry model to constrain the relative amounts of these two species throughout the magnetosphere.",

Many soils in this region are unsuitable (hence marginal) for row crop agriculture due to seasonal water saturation or near-saturation. Potential carbon (C) sequestration is a key ecosystem service of perennial bioenergy systems.\nThe research site is a 16 acre field (42N28.20', 76W25.94') with predominantly Canaseraga-Dalton-Madalin soils, which was fallow for more than 50 years before establishment in 2011. Quadruplicate treatments have been established on test strips (~1 acre) in which soil moisture conditions vary naturally from moderately well-drained to poorly drained. 16 strip plots consist of the treatments: switchgrass, switchgrass +fertilizer N, reed canarygrass +N, and pre-existing grass as control. The N fertilization rate is 66 lb/ac. 5 permanent sampling subplots were established along the natural moisture gradient of each plot, based on initial water content measurements at the soil surface (0-12 cm) by time-domain reflectometry (TDR). Thus, 80 permanent sampling points have been established, where soil C and health parameters viz soil aggregate stability, permanganate-oxidizable (POX) carbon etc and biomass yields are sampled yearly. Frequent TDR measurements have been normalized to determine relative wetness of all 80 subplots, which have been grouped under five wetness quintiles. The driest subplots are approximately 0.8 times the field mean, whereas the wettest subplots are 1.3 times of that.\nAfter four years of establishment, the yields, % SOC (combustion method) and C/N ratios have been plotted. The decrease in % organic matter (loss on ignition) over this time for control soils, wetness quintiles 1 through 5 ranged from 2.05 ( std dev 1.9) to 1.24 (0.39), for reed canary grass soils, from3.37(1.33) to 1.59 (1.03), for switchgrass soils, from 2.67 (0.43) to 1.28 (0.91) and for switchgrass+N soils, from 2.63(0.47) to 2.07(0.39) respectively. While the wet aggregate stability of soils of all treatments through all wetness quintiles decreased, the change in POX is variable. The statistical analyses are being done.",

We use the GEOS-Chem atmospheric chemistry transport model to interpret the observed variability of SO2 column data collected by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aboard the NASA Aura satellite during the May 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull. We sample the model at the time and location of each observed OMI scene, and convolve the vertical profiles with a scene-specific OMI averaging kernel, which describes the vertical sensitivity of the column data to changes in SO2. To describe the time-dependent injection of volcanic material from the eruption of Eyjafjallajökull we use weather radar observations from nearby Keflavík International Airport. We assume a uniform distribution of SO2 between the top of the volcano and the maximum injection height measured by the radar. We report the magnitude and uncertainty of volcanic SO2 flux estimates inferred from OMI data using a maximum a posteriori approach, taking into account uncertainties associated with the a priori fluxes, the measurements, and the atmospheric transport model. We also present the sensitivity of our results to assumptions about the injection height and the horizontal grid resolution of the atmospheric transport model. Finally, we quantify the impact of the OMI SO2 observations on describing transport of volcanic material into European air space.",

            "abstract": "The North Alabama Lightning Mapping Array (NALMA) was installed in 2001 to observe total lightning (cloud-to-ground and intra-cloud) and study its relationship to convective activity. NALMA has served as ground-truth for the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Lightning Imager (TRMM-LIS) and will again for the GOES-R Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM). Also, NASA’s Short-term Prediction Research and Transition Center (SPoRT) has transitioned these data to National Weather Service Weather Forecast Offices to evaluate the impact in operations since 2003.\nThis study focuses on seasonal and diurnal observations from NALMA’s 14 year history. This is initially intended to improve lightning safety at Marshall Space Flight Center, but has other potential applications. Improvements will be made by creating a dataset to investigate temporal, spatial, and seasonal patterns in total lightning over the Tennessee Valley, compare these observations to background environmental parameters and the TRMM-LIS climatology, and investigate applying these data to specific points of interest. Unique characteristics, such as flash extent density and length of flashes can be investigated, which are unavailable from other lightning networks like the National Lightning Detection Network (NLDN). The NALMA and NLDN data can be combined such that end users can use total lightning to gain lead time on the initial cloud-to-ground flash of a storm and identify if lightning is extending far from the storm’s core. This spatial extent can be analyzed to determine how often intra-cloud activity may impinge on a region of interest and how often a cloud-to-ground strike may occur in the region. The seasonal and diurnal lightning maps can aid with planning of various experiments or tests that often require some knowledge about future weather patterns months in advance.\nThe main goal is to develop a protocol to enhance lightning safety everywhere once the Geostationary Lightning Mapper (GLM) is on orbit in 2016. The goal is that these tools will be developed in coordination with end users’ feedback and will be modular allowing NALMA techniques to be ported to GLM. Therefore, the initial efforts here will be extendable to supporting other users and locations well beyond the NALMA domain Marshall Space Flight Center in the future.",

Both instruments are characterized by vastly different spatial resolutions of 15m (ASTER) and 1000m (MODIS), respectively.\nCloud optical thickness (τ) and effective droplet radius (reff) are derived by means of the Cross-platform HIgh resolution Multi-instrument AtmosphEric Retrieval Algorithms (CHIMAERA) system which yields MODIS-like cloud property retrievals via a shared-core architecture. The retrieval algorithm employs a standard bi-spectral retrieval scheme with two reflectances (ρ) in the visible to near-infrared spectral wavelength range (VNIR, 0.86μm) and shortwave infrared spectral wavelength range (SWIR, 2.1μm), respectively.\nFor an exemplary granule the high-resolution ρ sampled by the ASTER instrument are aggregated from 15m to an increasingly coarse spatial resolution between (30-1000m). Subsequently, retrieved τ and reff from aggregated ρ are compared to the mean of the high-resolution cloud properties within the aggregated pixels. The differences in retrieved τ and reff are related to the sub-pixel covariance of ρ in the VNIR and SWIR band, as well as the inhomogeneity index (i.e., the ratio of standard deviation to mean value of ρ in the VNIR). This analysis highlights the impact of sub-pixel inhomogeneity and plane-parallel assumptions in the cloud property retrieval.\nCHIMAERA also allows for a comparison of ASTER and MODIS retrievals without introducing biases due to individual instrument algorithms. Retrieved τ and reff from the 1000m aggregated ρ sampled by ASTER are compared to the retrieved cloud properties provided by MODIS. The presented results highlight the different sensitivities of the ASTER and MODIS instruments and possible implications on data interpretation.",

            "abstract": "It is the interaction of solar and thermal radiation with the climate system constituents that determines the prevailing climate on Earth. The principal radiative constituents of the climate system are clouds, aerosols, greenhouse gases, and the ground surface. Accurate rendering of their interaction with the incident solar radiation and the outgoing thermal radiation is required if a climate model is to be capable of simulating and predicting the complex changes that take place in the terrestrial climate system. In the GISS climate model, these radiative tasks are accomplished with a GCM radiation model that utilizes the correlated k-distribution treatment that closely matches Line-by-Line accuracy (Lacis and Oinas, 1991) for the gaseous absorbers, and an adaptation of the doubling/adding method (Lacis and Hansen, 1974) to compute multiple scattering by clouds and aerosols. The radiative parameters to model the spectral dependence of solar and longwave radiation (UV to microwave) utilizes Mie scattering and T-matrix calculations covering the broad range of particle sizes and compositions encountered in the climate system. Cloud treatment also incorporates an empirical representation of sub-grid inhomogeneity and space-time variability of cloud optical properties (derived from ISCCP data) that utilizes a Monte Carlo-based re-scaling parameterization of the cloud plane-parallel radiative parameters (Cairns et al, 2001). The longwave calculations compute correlated k-distribution radiances at three quadrature points (without scattering), and include the effects of cloud scattering in parameterized form for the outgoing and downwelling LW fluxes. For hygroscopic aerosols (e.g., sulfates, nitrates, sea salt), the effects of changing relative humidity on particle size and refractive index are explicitly taken into account. In this way, the GISS GCM radiation model calculates the SW and LW radiative fluxes, and the corresponding radiative heating and cooling rates in response to structural changes that occur in the global environment. In addition, the radiation model fulfills a diagnostic and analysis role in providing spectral information for making model performance comparisons to observational data, and for enabling quantitative attribution of radiative forcing and feedback changes.",

While most forested regions in the U.S. are observed to be moderate to strong carbon sinks, models not including human or natural disturbances will tend to be more carbon neutral, which is expected of mature ecosystems. I have developed the Terrestrial Ecosystems Model Hydro version (TEM-Hydro) to include both human and natural disturbances to compare against gridded NEP datasets. Human disturbances are based on the Hurtt et al. land use transition dataset and include transient agricultural (crops and pasture) conversion and abandonment and timber harvest. Natural disturbances include tropical storms and hurricane and fires based on stochastic return intervals.\nModel results indicate that forests are the largest carbon sink, seconded by croplands and pastures, if not accounting for decomposition of agricultural products and animal respiration. Grasslands and shrublands are both small sinks or carbon neutral. The NEP of forests in EC-MOD from 2001-2006 is 240 gCm2yr-1 and for FLUXNET-MTE from 1982-2007 is 375 gCm-2yr-1. With potential vegetation, the respective forest sinks for those two time periods are 54 and 62 gCm-2yr-1, respectively. Including the effects of human disturbance increases the sinks to 154 and 147 gCm-2yr-1. The effect of stochastic fire and storms is to reduce the NEP to 114 and 108 gCm-2yr-1. While the positive carbon sink today is the result of past land use disturbance, net carbon sequestration, including product decomposition, conversion fluxes, and animal respiration, has not yet returned to predisturbance levels as seen in the potential vegetation. Differences in response to disturbance have to do with the type, frequency, and intensity of disturbance. Fire, in particular, is seen to have a net negative effect on carbon storage in forests due to decomposition of coarse woody debris and the fact that some nitrogen is lost during volatilization. Croplands become a carbon source if assuming product decomposition occurs where the crops are grown, and pasturelands become carbon neutral if accounting for animal respiration.",

We show two commonly held assumptions to be inaccurate: (a) A temperature perturbation\nin the atmosphere translates to a roughly uniform equilibrium ocean temperature anomaly.\n(b) Equilibrium global sea level rise due to thermal expansion is proportional to global surface warming.\nWe analyze a vast range forcing levels and equilibration time scales of up to 10 000 years, for one model of\nintermediate complexity and one state-of-the-art global climate model.\nThe response time scales and regions of anomalous ocean heat storage depend non-linearly on the forcing\nlevel and equilibrium surface warming. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is only proportional\nto the forcing in its initial response, but not in its centennial to millennial recovery. In the Southern\nOcean, water mass properties and surface air temperature response do not scale linearly with the forcing\nlevel. Interior and deep oceans warm very little compared to the surface layers for small perturbations, but\ndo so increasingly for higher forcing levels. The deep ocean temperature anomaly does not correspond to\neither high or low latitude atmospheric surface temperature anomaly. Depending on where the excess heat\nis stored in the long term, the global sea level due to thermal expansion varies. We discuss the scalability of\nequilibrium climate sensitivity between these simulations and their relation to different definitions of radiative\nforcing.\nTwo far reaching consequences are: (1) that one cannot deduce long term (centennial to millennial) from\nshort term (decadal to centennial) behavior of ocean circulation and heat uptake.

The algorithm ingests a sounding and outputs the putative posterior mean vector and\ncovariance matrix that, under the assumption of Gaussianity, give a probabilistic description of the\nunderlying state vector. The algorithm also uses a host of other inputs that are treated as fixed and\nknown when at least some of them are not. Thus, some additional uncertainty beyond that captured by the\nposterior covariance is imparted to the algorithm output. The OCO-2 Team is implementing a framework to\nquantify this additional uncertainty by simulating a representative set of synthetic state vectors,\ngenerating corresponding synthetic soundings, performing retrievals on them, and comparing the retrievals\nto the original synthetic truth. A simplified forward model is used both to generate the soundings and in\nthe retrieval in order to generate a large ensemble of results in a short period of time. The empirical\njoint distribution of the synthetic true and retrieved state vectors can be interrogated to provide\nestimates of the impact of uncertain inputs on the retrieval. In this talk, we describe this framework,\nits rationale, and how it will ultimately provide users with adjustments that more fully account for uncertainty.",

            "abstract": "Some of the latest work examining the capability of total lightning to provide advanced notice of severe weather has concentrated on identifying the physical links that associate it with thunderstorm processes. As a result, applications of lightning data have been evaluated in an effort to complement existing meteorological datasets in operations. The total lightning jump algorithm is one such tool, used to objectively-identify rapid increases in total lightning that signify storm intensification. In anticipation of broader coverage of total lightning afforded by the future GOES-R Geostationary Lightning Mapper, applications of lightning data in the context of particular storm environments have also been explored. The work presented here specifically analyzes total lightning trends with respect to radar-inferred mesocyclone development and strengthening in supercell thunderstorms. Supercells have long been identified as the most prolific producers of severe weather because of the dynamic and kinematic processes associated with a robust, rotating updraft. This updraft is the common physical link between lightning, the supercell’s hallmark mesocyclone, and ultimately severe weather. Specifically, the updraft is thought to tilt and stretch horizontal vorticity into the vertical to develop the mesocyclone and also participates in non-inductive charging and electrification processes. To address this conceptual relationship, this study examined total lightning and rotation in 19 diverse supercells. Results indicate that the first lightning jump signals the transition of an ordinary thunderstorm to a supercell in a supportive environment, as well as that lightning jumps often give early indication of mesocyclone strengthening. Further, it is suggested that the observed anti-correlated trend between flash rate and low-level rotation alludes to enhanced downdraft-driven vorticity generation, thought to influence tornadogenesis.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances on the study of rifted margins resulted from the development of new, high-resolution seismic imaging methods and dynamic modelling that enable to image the crustal scale structure of rifted margins and experiment under what conditions they formed. However, both the used parameter space as well as the seismic interpretations and model results need to be ground truth by direct observations and data. In the case of deep-water rifted margins, the problem is that drill hole data is expensive, rare and only available from a handful of examples worldwide. In contrast, remnants preserving kilometre-scale outcrops of former deep-water rifted margins have been described from the Alps and the Pyrenees in Western Europe. These large-scale outcrops provide a direct access to mantle and crustal rocks and the associated sedimentary sequences and magmatic additions. The combination of world-class outcrops, classical, field-based mapping and analytical methods can provide the missing data that is necessary to calibrate and test dynamic models as well as to ground truth seismic interpretations. In my presentation I will use observations and data from key outcrops from the most distal fossil Alpine Tethys margins exposed in SE Switzerland with the aim to describe the deformation processes and conditions during final rifting and to test rift modes (semi-ductile flow vs. brittle poly-phase faulting). I will in particular focus on the way strain is distributed and the bulk rheology evolves during hyper-extension and mantle exhumation and compare the observations with model results and seismic interpretations. Up-and down scaling observations/data and bridging multiple spatial and temporal scales is a key to understand the large-scale extensional processes that are at the origin of the formation of hyper-extend and exhumed mantle domains. The major challenge is to understand how the learnings obtained from the well-documented examples in the Alps and Pyrenees can be used to test and ground truth models and interpretations of yet undrilled deep water rifted margins. Combining outcrop scale observations and modelling results and seismic interpretations will enable to develop more coherent geologically meaningful models and interpretations describing the structural evolution of deep water rifted margins.",

            "abstract": "The Lopu Range, located along the Yarlung-Tsangpo suture ~600 km west of Lhasa city in southern Tibet, exposes a high-pressure metamorphic complex composed of Indian passive margin (Tethyan) rocks. An integrated approach involving geologic mapping, kinematic analysis, phengite geobarometry, Zr-in-rutile geothermometry, garnet-phengite Fe-Mg exchange geothermometry and pseudosection modeling reveals that Lopu Range meta-Tethyan rocks reached peak pressures of 20-25 kbar (2.0-2.5 GPa) at temperatures <550-630 ºC along a clockwise P-T path. These data indicate subduction to mantle depths (~75 km) at eclogite facies conditions followed by exhumation to mid-crustal depths and retrogression at upper greenschist to amphibolite facies conditions. The structural geometry and interpreted P-T-t history of Lopu Kangri rocks is similar to the Tso Morari complex, located ~700 km along-strike to the northwest. Therefore, we interpret that these two localities formed in a similar manner following the onset of Tethyan Himalaya—Eurasia collision ca. 58-52 Ma. A previously published Ar-Ar date from Lopu Kangri suggests that exhumation to mid-crustal levels occurred by ~41 Ma.\nTwo key differences exist between the Lopu Kangri and Tso-Morari complexes. 1) the high-grade nappe in the Lopu Kangri complex is composed entirely of Cambrian-Ordovician metasedimentary rocks whereas the high-grade nappe in the Tso Morari complex is composed of the Tso Morari orthogneiss, eclogite boudins (meta-mafic enclaves) and Cambrian-Ordovician metasediments. We interpret that the lack of eclogite boudins at Lopu Kangri resulted from the absence of a basic protolith. 2) Lopu Kangri is located along the Yarlung-Tsangpo segment of the Indus-Yarlung (India-Asia) suture whereas Tso Morari and nearby Kaghan Valley are located along the Indus suture. Prior to this study, no continental high-pressure metamorphic complexes were known along the Yarlung-Tsangpo suture. Previously formulated tectonic models sought to explain this discrepancy through variations in exhumation and subduction zone dip. Our results indicate that continental margin subduction and rapid, synconvergent exhumation was not restricted to the Indus suture in the northwestern Himalaya.",

            "abstract": "A critical component in the understanding and interpretation of earthquake ground motions is the role that site effects play. In many parts of eastern North America, the soil layers which overlie glaciated bedrock produce strong and highly variable site responses. We use horizontal-to-vertical (H/V) response spectral ratios as the indicator variable by which to characterize the salient characteristics of site response in eastern Canada. We show that site response can be modeled using two descriptive variables that are readily obtainable: (i) peak resonant frequency (fpeak), as determined from H/V or depth-to-bedrock; and (ii) overall soil type (or stiffness). We use these variables to create a model of site amplification that can be used in the development of ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) and in real-time interactive ground-motion (IGM) map applications.\nThe key to the site characterization is the relationship between fpeak and drift thickness (depth-to-bedrock), which we derive using H/V data from earthquakes in the region, combined with a detailed digital drift thickness map available online from the Ontario Geological Survey (OGS). The OGS map also provides information on soil type, which is correlated with peak amplitudes (Apeak) of response. We extend the study area to the city of Montreal using similar information from Chouinard and Rosset (2012). H/V spectral shapes may be associated with four main soil categories, which in decreasing order of stiffness are: bedrock, till, sand/clay, and organic soil/fill. The value of Apeak increases as stiffness decreases. We model site response by defining a generic site amplification curve, which is dependent only on fpeak and soil type. The generic curve enables an estimate of site amplification to be made over the entire frequency band of 0.1 to 50 Hz, knowing just the soil thickness and type. These site amplification curves can be applied in the development of regional GMPEs, and in the construction of robust near-real-time IGMs.",

Without proper mechanisms to account for these factors, it remains difficult to predict plant mortality/survival under changing climate. A plant ecophysiological model, TREES, was extended to incorporate co-occurring species’ belowground interaction for water. We used it to examine the interaction between two commonly co-occurring species during drought experiment, pine (Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniperus monosperma), with contrasting physiological traits (vulnerability to cavitation and leaf water potential regulation). TREES was parameterized and validated using field-measured plant physiological traits. The root architecture (depth, profile, and root area to leaf area ratio) of juniper was adjusted to see how root morphology could affect the survival/mortality of its neighboring pine under both ambient and drought conditions. Drought suppressed plant water and carbon uptake, as well increased the average percentage loss of conductivity (PLC). Pine had 59% reduction in water uptake, 48% reduction in carbon uptake, and 38% increase in PLC, while juniper had 56% reduction in water uptake, 50% reduction in carbon and 29% increase in PLC, suggesting different vulnerability to drought as mediated by plant physiological traits. Variations in juniper root architecture further mediated drought stress on pine, from negative to positive. Different juniper root architecture caused variations in response of pine over drought (water uptake reduction ranged 0% ~63%, carbon uptake reduction ranged 0% ~ 70%, and PLC increase ranged 2% ~ 91%). Deeper or more uniformly distributed roots of juniper could effectively mitigate stress experienced by pine. In addition, the total water and carbon uptake tended to increase as the ratio of root area to leaf area increased while PLC showed non-monotonic response, suggesting the potential trade-off between maximizing resource uptake and susceptibility to cavitation. The results showed that co-occurring species’ morphological traits could alleviate or aggravate stress imposed by drought and should therefore be considered together with plant physiological traits in predicting plant mortality and ecosystem structural shift under future climate conditions.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic inputs of nutrients to the estuaries have rapidly increased during last couple of decades, resulting in deterioration of coastal water quality at regional scales. It is imperative to assess and quantify the ability of coastal systems to utilize, transport, and transform the ‘excess’ dissolved nutrients that enter the coast via land based activities. A LOICZ biogeochemical mass budget model was applied to the largest Indian estuary – the Ganges (Hooghly). Model studies indicate that despite high nutrient concentrations, the estuary remained net heterotrophic throughout the year. However if suspended particulate matter (SPM) was considered while estimating net metabolism, the system was net autotrophic. This model clearly highlights the influence of adsorption and desorption of nutrient and buffering action of SPM on nutrient dynamics under varying environmental conditions. \nCase studies from estuaries (e.g. Godavari and Tapi) and lagoon systems(Chilika and Vembanad) of India with differing levels of discharge and pollution were studied to determine the role of SPM on the trophic shift of these systems. Biogeochemical mass budget for all the systems suggested that in spite of high nutrient availability, high load of SPM (>100 mg L-1) controlled the trophic state and nutrient dynamics of a system. Indian estuaries and lagoons are predominantly heterotrophic, due to increasing anthrpogenic pressures from land based nutrient loading. The lagoon systems such as Chilika and Vembanad were predominantly heterotrophic and are a major source of phosphorus to the coastal waters. Overall, the source/sink characteristics of a system with respect to the adjacent coastal ocean were dependent on the in-situ biogeochemical processes (release, uptake and burial) and the residence time. The results further suggest that Hooghly estuary acts as a conduit of land-derived nutrients to the coastal ocean.",

This research aims to address these gaps by characterizing the spatial variability of supraglacial stream morphology across a range of glacier types and environmental conditions and identifying forcings that control channel form. Topographic data was analyzed from a range of glacier surface types including icesheets, pocket alpine glaciers, and outlet valley glaciers spanning a range of latitudes and elevations, comprising glaciers from Greenland, British Columbia, Alaska, Iceland and Sweden. Channels were extracted from the topographic data using an automated approach based on identifying topographic depressions at different size scales, in which the method was tested relative to manually digitized stream networks. Channel geomorphology was subsequently characterized according to planimetric and drainage network geometries. Resulting morphometric characteristics were analyzed with regards to endo and exogenic environmental forcings such as ice topography and characteristics and climatic forcings to identify the primary controls on supraglacial channel morphology and the response of these channels with respect to these controls.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - poster-ssa-evolution.pdf\nThe specific surface area (SSA) of surface snow evolves in response to meteorological conditions (e.g. temperature and precipitation). It is the main driver of the albedo in the near infrared range where most of the solar energy is absorbed in Antarctica. In turn, albedo change affects snow temperature, which drives SSA evolution rate, and at a larger scale influences the climate of snow-covered regions through snow-albedo feedback loops. Here we present a SSA retrieval method based on in-situ spectral albedo measurements and explore the factors limiting the accuracy of this method. The snowpack model Crocus is also used to simulate SSA evolution, and to investigate the respective role of temperature and precipitation Automatic spectral measurements of the upwelling and downwelling irradiance in the range 800nm – 1050nm are acquired every hour with a spectrophotometer deployed at Dome C since 2012. Spectral albedo is derived from these measurements and is used in conjunction with an asymptotic analytical solution of the radiative transfer equation to retrieve surface SSA estimates representative of the topmost centimeter. The sensitivity analysis of this method shows that the spectro-angular response of the cosine collector used to capture the light, and the uncertainty in the surface roughness are the largest sources of error, and can account for up to 20% uncertainty in SSA retrieval. In contrast, the dark current of the spectrometer, the inter-calibration of the upwelling and downwelling lines are good enough or sufficiently easy to correct not to impact the retrieval. To compare the surface SSA time-series to Crocus simulations, a few adaptations to the Antarctic conditions have been implemented in the model. The results show that the Crocus successfully matches the observations at daily to seasonal time scales, except for a few cases when snowfalls are not present in the meteorological forcing. On the contrary, the inter-annual variability of summer SSA decrease is poorly simulated when compared to 14 years of microwave satellite data sensitive to the near surface SSA. Possible reasons and future improvements are proposed.",

            "abstract": "Fatigue is a process that causes materials to weaken during cyclic loading and experience brittle failure at much lower applied stresses. We perform laboratory experiments to study the fatigue behavior of water ice at conditions relevant to the surfaces of icy satellites, to test the hypothesis that the lithospheres of some icy satellites are weakened by fatigue.\nMany icy moons of the outer solar system, such as Europa and Enceladus, experience cyclic stresses driven by tidal forces from their parent planet. Stresses generated by tides and other physical processes, such as solid-state convection of the ice shell, are weak compared to laboratory derived yield stress values of ice. The surface geology on many icy moons, however, suggests that these processes are capable of deforming the surface, suggesting that their surfaces may have been weakened.\nDuring fatigue, microcracks slowly grow under the action of cyclic loads. Cracks grow until the stress intensity reaches a critical value and the sample fractures. The rate of microcrack growth varies with material, temperature, and loading frequency, but under most conditions the growth rate can be characterized by Paris’ Law. We use a servo-hydraulic loading machine to perform cyclic 4-point bending tests on polycrystalline ice samples to measure the rate of fatigue crack growth. Ice samples are formed using the standard ice method in a sample mold with dimensions of 10x4x2 cm with an average grain size of 1.2 mm. An initial flaw is cut into the sample and loaded such that the flaw experiences the maximum tensile stress in the sample. Our initial experiments were performed at T=223 K, loading frequencies of 0.5 Hz, and stress intensities ranging from 0.3 to 0.8 of the plane-strain fracture toughness. Sample compliance is used to estimate crack length according to analytical solutions [1]. Experiments show an increase in compliance with time, consistent with substantial subcritical crack growth. Future experiments will allow us to determine how subcritical crack growth rates vary as a function of stress intensity, temperature and frequency. We will use our data to extrapolate to conditions present in the near-surface of icy satellites to determine the effect of fatigue on icy satellite resurfacing. \n[1] Hubner H. and Jillik J., (1977) J.

            "abstract": "During the late 19th and into the 20th Centuries, the Tisza and Illinois Rivers were highly altered through the construction of levees and dams to reclaim their floodplain-wetland systems for agriculture and to facilitate navigation. In recent decades, flood levels have continued to rise due to aggradation on the confined floodplains reducing flood-conveyance capacity. As a result, “Room for the River” proposals have gained more prominence. Our overarching hypothesis is that strategically reconnecting these rivers to their floodplains will reduce flood levels and increase ecological habitat while limiting socioeconomic impacts.\nIn this study, we assessed several reconnection scenarios, including levee setbacks and removals, for the Lower Tisza River (LTR; Hungary) and the Lower Illinois River (LIR; Illinois, USA). To model water-surface elevations (WSELs) for the 5- through 500-year flood events, we employed HEC-RAS (1D) and SOBEK (1D/2D) hydraulic models. To determine socioeconomic tradeoffs using these modeled WSELs, we developed a corresponding suite of expected annual damages (EADs) using FEMA’s Hazus-MH flood-loss modeling software for buildings and integrated geospatial and soil productivity indices to estimate agricultural losses. To assess ecosystem benefits of reconnection along the LTR, we used historic wetland extent as a proxy for increasing needed floodplain habitats. For the LIR, we performed habitat screening using Land Capability Potential Index and other assessment tools to estimate potential ecosystem benefits.\nResults indicate that levee removal and/or setbacks may reduce flood heights up to 1.6 m along the LTR and over 1.0 m along the LIR. While urban areas have the highest EADs, several lower-production agricultural areas show potential for reducing flood heights while minimizing damages. Strategic-floodplain reconnection benefits along the LTR and LIR include over half of historically-significant wetlands being reconnected and the creation of new habitat patches for threatened species within existing levee districts. While there are multiple benefits that may outweigh the costs of strategic floodplain reconnection, there are also limits to its effectiveness which are constrained by both the political and physical conditions in each basin.",

A hierarchical Bayesian inversion (HBI) method is used to estimate CH4 and N2O emissions for spatial regions (0.3 degree pixels) by comparing measured mixing ratios with transport model (WRF-STILT) predictions. Using the multi-site measurements across California, the HBI analysis constrains a significant portion of expected emissions for both CH4 and N2O in the Central Valley and southern California. Based on the HBI analysis, we estimate a likely range of the state’s annual CH4 emissions is 2.4 – 2.7 Tg CH4/yr (at 68% confidence), which is 1.4 - 1.6 times the total estimated by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). Similarly, we estimate the state’s annual N2O emissions to be 77 – 95 Gg N2O/yr (at 68% confidence), which are 1.6 – 2.0 times CARB’s state total. These results suggest that the combined total of CH4 and N2O emissions from the HBI analysis would comprise 18 – 21% of state total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, higher than 12% estimated in the current state inventory. Additionally, we expand previous evaluations of possible systematic bias in annual emission estimates due to transport model error by comparing measured and predicted carbon monoxide (CO) for four of the sites. These results highlight the need for multiple independent methods to estimate non-CO2 GHG emissions, and offer insight into opportunities for non-CO2 GHG emission mitigation efforts towards achieving California’s GHG emission goals.",

            "abstract": "Soils in permafrost regions contain large amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC) that is preserved in a relatively undecomposed state due to cold and often wet conditions, yet the potential lability of these SOC stocks is still largely unknown. Traditional methods of assessing SOC lability (e.g., laboratory incubation studies) are labor intensive and time consuming. Fourier-transform mid-infrared spectroscopy (MidIR) provides a means to quickly estimate SOC quantity and quality based on the wealth of spectral information. In this study, we explored the possibility of linking MidIR spectra with SOC lability in Arctic tundra soils. Soils from four sites on the North Slope of Alaska were used in this study: a wet non-acidic tundra site in the coastal plain (CP), two moist acidic tundra sites between the northern foothills and the coastal plain (HC and SH), and another moist acidic tundra site in the northern foothills (HV). Active-layer organic and mineral soils and upper permafrost soils from the four sites were incubated for 60 days at -1, 1, 4, 8 and 16 °C. Thawed soils were allowed to drain to field capacity. Carbon dioxide (CO2) production was measured throughout the study. The chemical composition (e.g., total organic carbon and nitrogen) and MidIR spectra of soil samples were obtained before and after the incubations. CO2 production varied among soils and temperatures. CO2 production was greatest at 16 °C for CP and SH organic layers and for HC and HV permafrost layers. These trends among soil layers and sites remained similar at all temperatures. We found a good correlation between MidIR and cumulative 60-day CO2 production across different soils and temperatures. Characteristic MidIR bands and band ratios previously identified in the literature were also correlated with total CO2 production. For example, several band ratios (such as the ratio of aliphatics to clay or the ratio of lignin or phenolics to minerals) in the mineral active layer were highly correlated with respired CO2, suggesting such ratios might serve as useful lability indicators. Further investigation of characteristic MidIR bands and band ratios for additional soils and for longer term incubations are needed to fully assess their utility as indicators of the relative degradation state and potential decomposability of permafrost-region soils.",

They are important ocean for ocean biogeochemistry, and potentially for climate, as sites of water column denitrification and nitrous oxide production. Denitrification is the dominant loss process for fixed nitrogen in the oceans, and can thus affect the ocean inventory of this key nutrient. Denitrification is less energetically efficient than oxic remineralization. Larger zooplankton, which feed on sinking particles, are not present in the lowest oxygen waters. Both of these factors suggest that the remineralization of sinking particles may be slower within the OMZs than in more oxygenated waters. There is limited field evidence and from some modeling studies that remineralization is slower (remineralization length scales are longer) within OMZ waters. In this talk, I will present results from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) ocean component attempting to test this hypothesis. Comparing model results with observed ocean biogeochemical tracer distributions (i.e., phosphate, oxygen), I will examine whether slower remineralization within low oxygen waters provides a better match between simulated and observed tracer distributions. Longer remineralization length scales under low oxygen conditions would provide a negative feedback under global warming scenarios. The biological pump would transfer organic materials to depth more efficiently as ocean oxygen concentrations decline and the OMZs expand.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU Poster_2015_Temporal Inequality.pdf\nInequality is an emergent property of many complex systems. For a given series of stochastic events, some events generate a disproportionately large contribution to system responses compared to other events. In catchments, such responses cause streamflow and solute loads to exhibit strong temporal inequality, with the vast majority of discharge and solute loads exported during short periods of time during which high-flow events occur. These periods of time are commonly referred to as “hot moments”. Although this temporal inequality is widely recognized, there is currently no uniform metric for assessing it. We used a novel application of Lorenz Inequality, a method commonly used in economics to quantify income inequality, to quantify the spatial and temporal inequality of streamflow and nutrient (nitrogen and phosphorus) loads exported to the Chesapeake Bay. Lorenz Inequality and the corresponding Gini Coefficient provide an analytical tool for quantifying inequality that can be applied at any temporal or spatial scale. The Gini coefficient (G) is a formal measure of inequality that varies from 0 to 1, with a value of 0 indicating perfect equality (i.e., fluxes and loads are constant in time) and 1 indicating perfect inequality (i.e., all of the discharge and solute loads are exported during one instant in time). Therefore, G is a simple yet powerful tool for providing insight into the temporal inequality of nutrient transport. We will present the results of our detailed analysis of streamflow and nutrient time series data collected since the early 1980’s at 30 USGS gauging stations in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The analysis is conducted at an annual time scale, enabling trends and patterns to be assessed both temporally (over time at each station) and spatially (for the same period of time across stations). The results of this analysis have the potential to create a transformative new framework for identifying “hot moments”, improving our ability to temporally and spatially target implementation of best management practices to ultimately improve water quality in the Chesapeake Bay. This method also provides insight into the temporal scales at which hydrologic and biogeochemical variability dominate nutrient export dynamics.",

We integrate field observations, detailed SEM and petrographic observations, geochemical models, (U-Th)/He and Ar/Ar dating, and other data to develop interpretations of the formation of these deposits.\nSEM imaging shows that sandstone matrix cement adjacent to the faults follows two precipitation sequences: Fe-oxide followed by barite and Fe-oxide followed by Mn-oxide. Dense oxide layers also accumulated in cm-scale fractures near faults, and show the following precipitation sequence: Fe-oxide, barite, Ba rich Mn-oxide, and pure Mn-oxide. The latter sequence is observed at larger scale across faults in one site in Flat Iron Mesa. Our new He dates for Mn-oxides are 1.7-2.9 Ma while Fe-oxide dates are 2.7-3.0 Ma. If these dates represent formation ages, they are consistent with the interpreted precipitation sequence but would require protracted mineralization over Ma-timescales. Alternatively, they may represent varying degrees of He retentivity in earlier formed deposits. Previous Ar/Ar dates have been interpreted as a 20-25 Ma formation age. Ongoing Ar/Ar and He diffusion studies will resolve this discordance. Assuming the previous Ar dates do not reflect contamination by detrital K-bearing phases and do reflect oxide formation, potential interpretations for the younger He ages include recent U-Th addition, recrystallization, later oxide growth, or large diffusive He loss at low temperatures.",

More detailed assessments of hydrate distribution, especially involving the occurrence of high-saturation hydrate anomalies have been more difficult to obtain. Spatial variations in sediment properties are of central importance for modifying the phase behavior and promoting focussed fluid flow. However, quantitative predictions of hydrate anomaly development cannot be made rigorously without also addressing the changes in phase behavior and mechanical balances that accompany changes in hydrate saturation level. We demonstrate how pore-scale geometrical controls on hydrate phase stability can be parameterized for incorporation in simulations of hydrate anomaly development along dipping coarse-grained layers embedded in a more fine-grained background that is less amenable to fluid transport. Model simulations demonstrate how hydrate anomaly growth along coarse-layer boundaries is promoted by diffusive gas transport from the adjacent fine-grained matrix, while advective transport favors more distributed growth within the coarse-grained material and so effectively limits the difference between saturation peaks and background levels. Further analysis demonstrates how sediment contacts are unloaded once hydrate saturation reaches sufficient levels to form a load-bearing skeleton that can evolve to produce segregated nodules and lenses. Decomposition of such growth forms poses a significant geohazard that is expected to be particularly sensitive to perturbations induced by gas extraction. The figure illustrates the predicted evolution of hydrate saturation Sh in a coarse-grained dipping layer showing how prominent bounding hydrate anomalies (spikes) supplied by diffusive gas transport at early times are eventually replaced by a broad region of elevated hydrate saturation that is supplied primarily by advective transport (colorbar refers to pore pressure contours in MPa, arrows denote flow magnitude and direction).",

            "abstract": "In low and middle-income countries, many deltaic communities directly depend on the natural environment for income and well-being. Current environmental concerns that threaten deltaic communities, such as increasing salinity, sedimentation, erosion and subsidence are likely to be exacerbated by climate change and variability, for example sea-level rise, increased storminess and rising temperatures. Such changes, along with other social and environmental stressors, mean that communities must adapt. This paper outlines findings of a systematic review of the peer-reviewed and grey literature that examines observed adaptations in three deltas of differing sizes in various geographical contexts: the Ganges-Meghna-Brahmaputra in India and Bangladesh, the Mahanadi in India, and the Volta in Ghana. It compares and contrasts various elements of observed adaptations, including who is driving the adaptation, the beneficiaries, barriers to participation and evidence for maladaptation. The predominant drivers of adaptation vary from government (at state level in India and national level in Bangladesh) and NGOs (in Ghana). Autonomous adaptations are not widely reported in the literature from any of the deltas. In all three deltas there is a focus on supporting adaptation in farming rather than fishing; despite the fact that fisheries contribute to local food security as well as national economies. Lack of access to financial, natural, physical and human capital are common barriers to adaptation in all three deltas. Additionally the Indian literature in particular highlights the lack of coordination between different government departments, coupled with an excessively top-down (state-driven) approach to adaptation. Maladaptation is most commonly reported in the literature from Bangladesh, for example, loss of employment of inland fishermen in embanked areas. The paper concludes by highlighting some of the implications of these findings for adaptation policy in deltas.",

Within this field, source inversion of the W-phase has recently been shown to be an effective technique, which can be efficiently implemented in real-time. An extension to the W-phase source inversion is presented in which two point sources are derived to better characterize complex earthquakes. A single source inversion followed by a double point source inversion with centroid locations fixed at the single source solution location can be efficiently run as part of earthquake monitoring network operational procedures. In order to determine the most appropriate solution, i.e., whether an earthquake is most appropriately described by a single source or a double source, an Akaike information criterion (AIC) test is performed. Analyses of all earthquakes of magnitude 7.5 and greater occurring since January 2000 were performed with extended analyses of the September 29, 2009 magnitude 8.1 Samoa and the April 19, 2014 magnitude 7.5 Papua New Guinea earthquakes. The AIC test is shown to be able to accurately select the most appropriate model and the selected W-phase inversion is shown to yield reliable solutions that match previously published analyses of the same events.",

One of the developmental goals of BESM is to simulate the affects of aerosols in its climate model. The Hamburg Aerosol Model (HAM) is been chosen as the aerosol transport module for BESM. The implementation is categorized in three phases, of which the initialization phase has been completed. The work is underway to include the radiative affect of aerosols. We propose to present the first results of the implementation of the radiative affects of the aerosols that is, radiative forcing over different regions of Brazil with sector specific environmental conditions like forest fires, industrial, domestic etc. The initial simulations will be crucial for the BESM and will also shed light on the performance of the different radiation schemes in BESM and to its response to aerosols.",

These techniques employ two types of mapping of the boundary of the computational domain on itself. One of them is defined at a given time moment via connections of the magnetic field lines to their opposite endpoints. The other mapping, called slip mapping, relates field line endpoints at two different time moments and allows one to identify the slippage of plasma elements due to resistivity across field lines for a given time interval (Titov et al. 2009). The distortion of each of these mappings can be measured by using the so-called squashing factor Q (Titov 2007). The high-Q layers computed for the first and second mappings define, respectively, (quasi-)separatrix surfaces and reconnection fronts in evolving magnetic configurations. Analyzing these structural features, we are able to reveal topologically different domains and reconnected flux systems in the configurations, in particular, open, closed and disconnected magnetic flux tubes, as well as quantify the related magnetic flux transfer. Comparison with observations makes it possible also to relate these features to observed morphological elements such as flare loops and ribbons, and EUV dimmings. We illustrate these general techniques by applying them to particular data-driven MHD simulations.\n*Research supported by NASA's HSR and LWS Programs, and NSF/SHINE and NSF/FESD.",

IPBES was established in 2012 as an independent intergovernmental body dedicated to assessing the state of the planet's biodiversity, its ecosystems, and the essential services they provide to society. IPBES has four functions: 1) identify and prioritize key scientific information needed for policymakers and catalyze efforts to generate new knowledge by engaging relevant scientific, policy and funding organizations; 2) perform regular and timely assessments of knowledge on biodiversity and ecosystem services and their interlinkages; 3) support policy formulation and implementation by identifying policy-relevant tools and methodologies; and 4) prioritize key capacity-building needs to improve the science-policy interface and catalyze related financing. To date, IPBES has brought together representatives of 124 countries at three annual plenary meetings and numerous panel meetings about specific assessments. This presentation will summarize IPBES’ opportunities and achievements to date. These include a conceptual framework for IPBES processes and products, an assessment of the status of pollination and pollinators associated with food production, draft reports on scenario analyses and capacity building, and scoping for assessments of land degradation and restoration and of biodiversity in five regions of the world. IPBES provides natural and social scientists and other experts with important opportunities to support collaborative, science-based environmental decision-making at global to local scales.

            "abstract": "Despite its vast geographic area, the South Pacific gyre has been minimally explored in terms of its changing conditions over glacial cycles, partly due to slow sedimentation and poor preservation of carbonate in its deep sea sediments. We have developed a sensitive and precise method for measuring the nitrogen isotopes (d15N) of organic matter protected within the skeletal aragonite of stony corals (coral skeletal d15N). Analyses of modern corals from 8 global sites suggest that the coral skeletal d15N first and foremost records the d15N of regional ocean nitrate, with a secondary effect of local reef productivity. In this study, we apply this new proxy to fossil corals collected during the Expedition 310 of International Ocean Discovery Program, investigating the nitrogen cycle of the South Pacific since the last deglaciation. We measured skeletal d15N in consecutive growth bands in 4 U-Th dated coral samples (with ages of 14.3 ka, 13.3 ka, 11.8 ka and 8.4 ka) from a single core. Within each coral, over the 3-8 consecutive bands sampled, inter-band d15N variation was 1-2.5‰. However, the band-averaged d15N from each dated sample showed <1‰ change between 14.3 and 8.4 ka (from oldest to youngest, 11.4±0.3‰, 10.8±0.7‰, 10.6±0.3‰, and 11.4±0.7‰), consistent with the high thermocline nitrate d15N in modern subtropical South Pacific. The implications of these results for the regional nitrogen cycle as well as the deglacial change in mean ocean nitrate d15N will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU2015_Poster_Chanita.pdf\nDue to the fast-changing climatic and anthropogenic conditions at coastal regions, many coastal mega-cities are becoming increasingly vulnerable to internal and external risks. The risk is particularly high for low-lying coastal cities in developing nations, with Southeast Asia recognized as a hotspot of vulnerability due to the increasing population density, rapid change of natural landscape associated with urbanization and intensified hydrological and atmospheric conditions at the coastal front in an uncertain climate future. The Bangkok Metropolitan Region is one of the largest coastal megacities in Southeast Asia that are challenged by the potential impacts due to climate change and anthropological variability in the coming decades. Climate-related risks in this region are associated with its relatively low-lying nature of the terrain and adjacency to the coast. Coastal inundation due to high tides from the sea occurs annually in the area close to the seashore. This is set to increase given a projected rising sea level and the sinking landscape due to groundwater extraction and urbanization. The aim of this research is, therefore, to evaluate the vulnerability of the city to sea level rise, land subsidence and storm surge. Distributed land subsidence rate, projected sea level rise and existing structural features such as flood defences are taken into account. The 2011 flood in Thailand is used as a baseline event. Scenarios were designed with projections of land subsidence and sea level rise to 2050s, 2080s, and 2100s. A two-dimensional flood inundation model (FloodMap, Yu and Lane 2006) is used to derive inundation depth and velocity associated with each scenario. The impacts of coastal flood risk on critical infrastructures (e.g. power supply, transportation network, rescue centers, hospitals, schools and key government buildings) are evaluated (e.g. Figure 1). Results suggest progressively increase but non-linear risks of coastal flooding to key coastal infrastructures into 2050s, 2080s and 2100s. The understanding gained through this study may inform decision makers with useful information to undertake appropriate adaptation measures for dealing with the potential flood risks.",

            "abstract": "The frequency, extent, and severity of droughts are expected to increase in the western United States as climate changes occur. The combination of warmer temperature, larger vapor pressure deficit, reduced snowfall and snow pack, earlier snow melt, and extended growing seasons is expected to lead to an intensification of summer droughts, with a direct impact on ecosystem productivity and therefore on the carbon budget of the region. In this scenario, an accurate representation of ecosystem drought response in land models becomes fundamental, but the task is challenging, especially in regards to stomatal response to drought.\nIn this study we used the most recent release of the Community Land Model (CLM 4.5), which now includes photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination and revised photosynthesis and hydrology schemes, among an extensive list of updates. We evaluated the model’s performance at a coniferous forest site in the Pacific northwest (Wind River AmeriFlux Site), characterized by a climate that has a strong winter precipitation component followed by a summer drought. We ran the model in offline mode (i.e., decoupled from an atmospheric model), forced by observed meteorological data, and used site observations (e.g., surface fluxes, biomass values, and carbon isotope data) to assess the model.\nPrevious field observations indicated a significant negative correlation between soil water content and the carbon isotope ratio of ecosystem respiration (δ13CR), suggesting that δ13CR was closely related to the photosynthetic discrimination against 13CO2 as controlled by stomatal conductance. We used these observations and latent-heat flux measurements to assess the modeled stomatal conductance values and their responses to extended summer drought. We first present the model results, followed by a discussion of potential CLM model improvements in stomatal conductance responses and in the representation of soil water stress (parameter βt) that would more precisely incorporate features that would allow the model to correctly simulate field observations.",

            "abstract": "Crustal faults are geometrically complex at a variety of length scales, and are often characterized as fractal surfaces. Recent pioneering dynamic rupture models incorporating fault roughness showed that rupture velocity is strongly affected by geometric complexities with significant high-frequency radiation. These models assumed brittle shear failure off the fault and ignored the presence of fault gouge. Laboratory experiments show that fault gouge deform in a more ductile manner with significant phase of compaction. Using an end-cap yield criterion (similar to Cam-clay model), Hirakawa and Ma (2015) showed that large shear stress ahead of rupture front strongly compacts fault gouge (shear-enhanced compaction), which increases pore pressure and weakens the fault. Strong dilatancy during stress breakdown reduces pore pressure and strengthens the fault, promoting slip pulses. Here, we extend this undrained gouge model to rough faults. At restraining bends, large compressive stresses are expected to cause gouge compaction and thus weaken the fault (by elevated pore pressure), allowing the rupture to propagate past these bends where suppressed ruptures in previous models. On the other hand, accelerations in rupture previously seen in releasing bends may be limited due to dilatancy strengthening of gouge layer. We hypothesize that the presence of fault gouge can cause rough fault rupture to more closely resemble that of a planar fault.",

            "abstract": "In the oligotrophic subtropical gyre of the North Atlantic, summertime surface drawdown of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and build-up of oxygen (O2) in the absence of nutrients to support primary productivity has been an unresolved puzzle for decades. We use 4 years of biogeochemical data from profiling floats in the northwestern subtropical North Atlantic and 24 years of bottle samples from the BATS timeseries to address this puzzle. We show that oxygen-rich, low-nitrate surface waters are subducted into the seasonal thermocline after the spring bloom. These waters are trapped on isopyncals that are progressively displaced downward over the season. Because of this downward displacement, a 50-100m depth-integrated O2 anomaly appears at an average rate of 1.64 ± 0.60 mol/m2 from May to October. Similarly and apparent nitrate loss occurs at an average rate of -0.028 ± 0.022 mol/m2. Organic matter is also subducted to these isopycnals and its remineralization counters the tendencies towards oxygen build-up and nitrate loss in the lower euphotic zone. This compensation, however, is incomplete (70-80%). The result is a positive rate of change in the O2 anomaly from May to October (0.32 ± 0.15 mol/m2) despite net heterotrophy. For Bermuda, 30-50% of positive net community production (NCP) within the mixed layer could be supported by vertical supply of the nutrients remineralized at 50-100m.",

The Global Hawk aircraft are capable of high altitude flights with durations of up to 30 hours, which allow extensive observations over distant storms, not typically possible with manned aircraft. The two NASA Global Hawks were equipped with instrument suites to study the storm environment, and inner core structure and processes, respectively.\nThe Scanning High-resolution Interferometer Sounder (S-HIS), designed and built by the University of Wisconsin (UW) Space Science and Engineering Center (SSEC), measures emitted thermal radiation at high spectral resolution between 3.3 and 18 microns. The radiance measurements are used to obtain temperature and water vapor profiles of the Earth's atmosphere. The S-HIS spatial resolution is 2 km at nadir, across a 40 km ground swath from a nominal altitude of 20 kilometers. Since 1998, the S-HIS has participated in 33 field campaigns and has proven to be extremely dependable, effective, and highly accurate. It has flown on the NASA ER-2, DC-8, Proteus, WB-57, and Global Hawk airborne platforms.\nThe UW S-HIS infrared sounder instrument is equipped with a real-time ground data processing system capable of delivering atmospheric profiles, radiance data, and engineering status to mission support scientists - all within less than one minute from the time of observation. This ground data processing system was assembled by a small team using existing software and proven practical techniques similar to a satellite ground system architecture.

            "abstract": "Forest canopy structure regulates radiation interception through the canopy, affects the canopy microclimate, and consequently influences the energy, water, and carbon fluxes between soil, vegetation and atmosphere through its interaction with leaf physiological functioning. To observe vertical canopy forest structure in finer and more accurate detail, we retrieved vertical profiles of leaf and woody components separately with a terrestrial laser scanner, the Dual-Wavelength Echidna Lidar (DWEL). DWEL scans of a hardwood site at the Harvard Forest, Petersham, Massachusetts, USA, in early May and in late September in 2014, revealed the spatial heterogeneity of the canopy vertical structure of the two vegetation components: leaves and woody materials. The DWEL collects simultaneous scans of forests with two lasers at different wavelengths, 1064 nm (NIR) and 1548 nm (SWIR). Power returned from leaves is much lower than from woody materials such as trunks and branches at the SWIR wavelength due to the liquid water absorption by leaves, whereas returned power at the NIR wavelength is similar from both leaves and woody materials. This spectral contrast between leaves and woody materials, along with spatial context information. discriminates leaves and woody materials accurately in 3-D space, thus allowing the measurement of separate leaf and woody area profiles. We also captured the change in the canopy vertical structure over the seven years by a comparison between the current measurements by the DWEL in 2014 and past measurements in 2007 at the same site by the DWEL’s predecessor, a single-wavelength terrestrial lidar, the Echidna Validation Instrument. The comparison also demonstrates the advantage of dual-wavelength laser scanning by the DWEL for canopy structure measurements.",

Greenberg\nTraditional methods of forest fire modeling focus on the patterns of burning in two-dimensions at relatively coarse resolutions. However, fires spread in complex, three-dimensional patterns related to the horizontal and vertical distributions of woody fuel as well as the prevailing climate conditions, and the micro-scale patterns of fuel distributions over scales of only meters can determine the path that fire can take through a complex landscape. One challenge in understanding the full three-dimensional (3D) path that a fire takes through a landscape is a lack of data at landscape scales of these burns. Remote sensing approaches, while operating at landscape scales, typically focus on two-dimensional analyses using standard image-based change detection techniques. In this research, we develop a 3D voxel-based change detection method applied to multitemporal LiDAR data collected before and after forest fires in California to quantify the full 3D pattern of vegetation loss. By changing the size of the voxel, forest loss at different spatial scales is revealed. The 3D tunnel of fuel loss created by the fire was used to examine ground-to-crown transitions, firebreaks, and other three-dimensional aspects of a forest fire.",

The Seti River collects water from the Mardi Khola (Khola means small river) and the Seti Khola, with headwaters on the southern edge of the Tibetan plateau. The Mardi Khola confluences to the Seti River in northeastern of Pokhara. Two tributaries of the Seti River show widely different condition of sediment evacuation. The Seti Khola is substantially occupied by glacier on its upstream and has thick (up to tens of meters) terrace deposits and wide valley form. Glacial cover of upper stream may have caused multiple high magnitude/low frequency event. On the other hand, the adjacent river, the Mardi Khola shows typical, V-shaped valley form with little fill terrace but a few of narrow, rock-cut strath terraces.\nThis research has double-folds. We would firstly evaluate the role of High-Magnitude Low-Frequency event (e.g. debris flow) on the process of sediment evacuation on the basis of cosmogenic 10Be and 14C concentrations of sediments collected before and after the debris flow in the Seti Khola. Catchment wide denudation rate (CWDR, 103-105 yr) using cosmogenic nuclides in fluvial sediment can help us constrain denudation rate at intermediate time scales between thermochronologic data (>106 yr) and sediment discharge (100-102 yr).  Secondly, we would appraise the relative role of glacier with CWDR and morphologic analysis of the two, tributary valleys formed mainly by glacier and river, respectively. Moreover, most of the present model of catchment-wide erosion rate using single cosmogenic nuclide of 10Be tends to underestimate the effective denudation rate, because single nuclide of 10Be with long half-life (1.36 Ma) is difficult to detect any change caused by burial shorter than the effective time scale of 10Be. Thus, we would provide more effective CWDR considering the occasional storing time of sediments with the use of a pair of in-situ 14C (5.7 ka) and 10Be analysis.",

The shell beds, are dominated by two genera of the family Vesicomyidae: Phreagena s.l. and Isorropodon sp. were 20-30cm thick centered at 250-400cm depth in the cores. The carbon isotope composition of inorganic (δ13C from -13.02‰ to +2.364‰) and organic (δ13C from -29.283‰ to -21.33‰) shell material indicates that these taxa derived their energy primarily from endosymbiotic chemosynthetic bacteria feeding on methane. In addition, negative δ13C values for planktonic foraminifera (-6.7‰ to -3.1‰), micritic concretions identified as methane-derived authigenic carbonates and pyrite encrusted fossil worm tubes at the shell horizons indicate a sustained paleo-methane seep environment. Combining sedimentation rates with 14C ages for bivalve material from the shell horizons, we estimate the horizons persisted for about 1000 years between approximately 17,707 to 16,680 yrs. BP (corrected). The major seepage event over a 1000 -year time interval was most likely triggered by tectonic stress and the subsequent release of over-pressurized fluids.",

            "abstract": "Earthquake swarms are space-time clusters of seismicity that cannot easily be explained by typical aftershock behavior, and are likely triggered by external processes such as fluid migration and/or slow slip. However, swarm properties are not fully understood and how much swarm occurrence is related to the tectonic environment (e.g., heat flow, stressing rate) or source characteristics (e.g., focal mechanism, stress drop) is unclear. Systematic study of large numbers of swarms and their source properties should help to resolve these issues, but is hampered by the challenge of identifying swarms at a range of spatiotemporal scales from a large earthquake catalog. We have developed a new method to search for clusters by comparing the number of neighboring events to the background events in scalable space/time windows, similar to the idea of STA/LTA algorithms, and then discriminating swarms from aftershock clustering. We first apply this method to the San Jacinto Fault Zone (SJFZ) and find ten times more swarms than a previous study using fixed spatiotemporal windows. The most striking spatial pattern of our identified swarm events is a higher fraction of swarms at the northern and southern ends of the SJFZ than its central segment, which correlates with an increased proportion of normal faulting earthquakes. We then apply our method to search the entire southern California catalog of 433,737 events with M ≥ 1 from 1981 to 2014. Preliminary results indicate that swarms are heterogeneously distributed in space and time, but that higher swarm rates are generally found in regions of normal faulting. We will explore other swarm properties, such as event stress drops, spatial migration behavior, distribution of moment release, and relation to foreshock sequences in order to better understand the driving physical mechanisms of swarms and improve earthquake forecasts.",

            "abstract": "Wet-season rainfall in the Sahel varies dramatically among climate model future projections. Its behavior is usefully characterized by the vertically integrated moist static energy (MSE) budget, which stipulates a balance between the net top of atmosphere radiative flux (Rtoa) and the divergence of MSE by convection and by horizontal advection. We analyze this budget in multiple general circulation models in present-day and idealized warming experiments.\nAll models simulate a climatological leading-order budget wherein Rtoa is balanced by horizontal advection of low MSE air from the Sahara, rather than by convection as in classical theories. Convection transitions from net divergence to convergence of MSE moving northward as the convective depth steadily lowers, but its mean height over the Sahel varies appreciably among models. This model variation imprints on the hydrological and energetic responses to global warming, as the resultant stabilization of the tropical upper troposphere inhibits convection more in models with climatologically deeper convection. Meanwhile, the semi-arid nature of the region's land permits a simple approximation of the change in Rtoa solely in terms of climatological radiative and hydrological properties and the change in precipitation. Taken together, these point towards meaningful constraints on future Sahelian rainfall purely in terms of present-day quantities, and we discuss the prospects of using this framework to ultimately falsify model projections.",

Since that time OSIRIS has routinely measured spectrally dispersed limb-scattered sunlight from which vertical ozone profiles have been derived. The length of the OSIRIS ozone data record makes it a valuable resource for the analysis of long term trends. However, on its own it is not of sufficient length to capture all of the relevant signatures required to completely understand important changes in the vertical distribution of ozone. In particular the 1997 turnaround is not captured within the OSIRIS time series. For this reason it is important that the OSIRIS measurements be combined, or merged, with other data records like the SAGE II time series before a full analysis can be performed. This paper is focused on the merged SAGE II – OSIRIS time series and the resulting trends. It has been recently noted that the post 1997 positive trends at around 40 km that have been derived from this time series are higher than those calculated using other merged data sets. In this paper we will detail our efforts to understand why this is so. We will present analyses related to instrument drift, sampling biases and sensitivity to the method used to determine long term trends. Included along with the thorough analysis of the SAGE II – OSIRIS merged time series is an analysis of a SAGE II – MLS time series combined using the exact same method. Similarities and differences in the results derived from the two merged time series will also be discussed.",

In this study I will compare the output of the Iowa Flood Center (IFC) hydrologic model and WRF-Hydro (NFIE configuration) to the observed flows at the USGS stream gauges. During the National Flood Interoperability Experiment I explored the performance of WRF-Hydro over the state of Iowa using different rainfall products and the resulting hydrographs showed a “flashy” behavior of the model output due to lack of calibration and bad initial flows due to short model spin period. I would like to expand this study by including a second well established hydrologic model and include more rain gauge vs. radar rainfall direct comparisons. The IFC model is expected to outperform WRF-Hydro’s out of the box results, however, I will test different calibration options for both the Noah-MP land surface model and RAPID, which is the routing component of the NFIE-Hydro configuration, to see if this will improve the model results. This study will explore the statistical structure of model output uncertainties across scales (as a function of drainage areas and/or stream orders). I will also evaluate the performance of different radar-based Quantitative Precipitation Estimation (QPE) products (e.g. Stage IV, MRMS and IFC’s NEXRAD based radar rainfall product. Different basins will be evaluated in this study and they will be selected based on size, amount of rainfall received over the basin area and location. Basin location will be an important factor in this study due to our prior knowledge of the performance of different NEXRAD radars that cover the region, this will help observe the effect of rainfall biases on stream flows. Another possible addition to this study is to apply controlled spatial error fields to rainfall inputs and observer the propagation of these errors through the stream network.",

            "abstract": "Freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) influence the physical properties, microbial activity, biogeochemistry, nutrient and carbon cycling in soils, and regulate subsurface oxygen (O2) availability, affecting greenhouse gas exchanges between soils and the atmosphere. The ability to monitor changes in O2 levels, which are indicative of aerobic and anaerobic conditions, is key to understanding how changes in the frequency and amplitude of freeze-thaw cycles affect a soil’s geochemical conditions and microbial activity. In this study, a highly instrumented soil column experiment was designed to accurately simulate freeze-thaw dynamics under controlled conditions. This design allowed us to reproduce realistic, time- and depth-dependent temperature gradients in the soil column. Continuous O2 levels throughout the soil column were monitored using high-resolution, luminescence-based, Multi Fiber Optode (MuFO) microsensors. Image-processing techniques were used to convert light intensity of high-resolution digital images of the sensor-emitted light into O2 concentrations. Water samples from various depths in the column were collected to monitor pore water composition changes. Headspace gas measurements were used to derive the effluxes of CO2 and CH4 during the experiment. The results indicate that the pulse of oxygen introduced by thawing caused partial and temporal oxidation of previously reduced sulfur and nitrogen species, leading to concomitant changes in pore water SO42- and NO3- concentrations. Pulsed CO2 emission to the headspace was observed at the onset of thawing, indicating that a physical ice barrier had formed during frozen conditions and prevented gas exchange between the soil and atmosphere. CO2 emission was due to a combination of the physical release of gases dissolved in pore water and entrapped below the frozen zone and changing microbial respiration in response to electron acceptor variability (O2, NO3-, SO42-).",

Traffic-related pollution has been linked to a number of adverse health effects, such as respiratory problems, cancer, heart failure, and a general increase in mortality. Determining the pollutants involved and quantifying their emission rates is paramount in developing high resolution air quality models to predict future developments with some confidence.\nHighway 401, as it passes through Toronto, is the world’s busiest highway with a typical traffic volume of over 450,000 vehicles per day. In July 2015, three weeks of measurements were conducted over the 401 with an open-path FTIR (Fourier Transform infra-red) spectrometer in parallel with a scintillometer, integrating a variety of gas concentrations as well as turbulence parameters over a 310m path length.\nRelationships between traffic volume, micrometeorological conditions and the build-up and venting of pollutants on the highway are analyzed and quantified, demonstrating the role of stratification and turbulence in the accumulation and dispersal of traffic emissions. The feasibility of deriving emission rates by combining the micrometeorological data from the scintillometer with the gas concentrations from the FTIR using an inverse dispersion approach is investigated. The suitability of this novel approach for long-term monitoring of emissions is discussed. The findings will be compared with output from a high-resolution air quality model (GEM-MACH) to aid future improvements in the sub-grid parameterization of pollutant dispersion.",

            "abstract": "Numerical modelling informs risk assessment of tsunami generated by submarine slides; however, for large-scale slides modelling can be complex and computationally challenging. Many previous numerical studies have approximated slides as rigid blocks that moved according to prescribed motion. However, wave characteristics are strongly dependent on the motion of the slide and previous work has recommended that more accurate representation of slide dynamics is needed.\nWe have used the finite-element, adaptive-mesh CFD model Fluidity, to perform multi-material simulations of deformable submarine slide-generated waves at real world scales for a 2D scenario in the Gulf of Mexico. Our high-resolution approach represents slide dynamics with good accuracy, compared to other numerical simulations of this scenario, but precludes tracking of wave propagation over large distances. To enable efficient modelling of further propagation of the waves, we investigate an approach to extract information about the slide evolution from our multi-material simulations in order to drive a single-layer wave propagation model, also using Fluidity, which is much less computationally expensive. The extracted submarine slide geometry and position as a function of time are parameterised using simple polynomial functions. The polynomial functions are used to inform a prescribed velocity boundary condition in a single-layer simulation, mimicking the effect the submarine slide motion has on the water column. The approach is verified by successful comparison of wave generation in the single-layer model with that recorded in the multi-material, multi-layer simulations.\nWe then extend this approach to 3D for further validation of this methodology (using the Gulf of Mexico scenario proposed by Horrillo et al., 2013) and to consider the effect of lateral spreading. This methodology is then used to simulate a series of hypothetical submarine slide events in the Arctic Ocean (based on evidence of historic slides) and examine the hazard posed to the UK coast.",

However, these models can produce hundreds of gigabytes of spatial output for a single model run over decadal time scales when run at regional spatial scales and moderate spatial resolutions (~100-km2+ at 30-m spatial resolution) or when run for small watersheds at high spatial resolutions (~1-km2 at 3-m spatial resolution). Numerical data formats such as HDF5 can store arbitrarily large datasets. However even in HPC environments, there are practical limits on the size of single files that can be stored and reliably backed up. Even when such large datasets can be stored, querying and analyzing these data can suffer from poor performance due to memory limitations and I/O bottlenecks, for example on single workstations where memory and bandwidth are limited, or in HPC environments where data are stored separately from computational nodes. The difficulty of storing and analyzing spatial data from ecohydrology models limits our ability to harness these powerful tools. Big Data tools such as distributed databases have the potential to surmount the data storage and analysis challenges inherent to large spatial datasets. Distributed databases solve these problems by storing data close to computational nodes while enabling horizontal scalability and fault tolerance. Here we present the architecture of and preliminary results from PatchDB, a distributed datastore for managing spatial output from the Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System (RHESSys). The initial version of PatchDB uses message queueing to asynchronously write RHESSys model output to an Apache Cassandra cluster. Once stored in the cluster, these data can be efficiently queried to quickly produce both spatial visualizations for a particular variable (e.g. maps and animations), as well as point time series of arbitrary variables at arbitrary points in space within a watershed or river basin. By treating ecohydrology modeling as a Big Data problem, we hope to provide a platform for answering transformative science and management questions related to water quantity and quality in a world of non-stationary climate.",

            "abstract": "Deforestation and agricultural land uses provide a consistent source of ignitions along the Amazon frontier during the dry season. The risk of understory fires in Amazon forests is amplified by drought conditions, when fires at the forest edge may spread for weeks before rains begin. Fire activity also impacts the regional response of intact forests to drought through diffuse light effects and nutrient redistribution, highlighting the complexity of feedbacks in this coupled human and natural system. This talk will focus on recent advances in our understanding of fire-climate feedbacks in the Amazon, building on research themes initiated under NASA’s Large-scale Biosphere-Atmosphere Experiment in Amazonia (LBA). NASA’s LBA program began in the wake of the 1997-1998 El Niño, a strong event that exposed the vulnerability of Amazon forests to drought and fire under current climate and projections of climate change. With forecasts of another strong El Niño event in 2015-2016, this talk will provide a multi-scale synthesis of Amazon forest responses to drought and fire based on field measurements, airborne lidar data, and satellite observations of fires, rainfall, and terrestrial water storage. These studies offer new insights into the mechanisms governing fire season severity in the southern Amazon and regional variability in carbon losses from understory fires. The contributions from remote sensing to our understanding of drought and fire in Amazon forests reflect the legacy of NASA’s LBA program and the sustained commitment to interdisciplinary research across the Amazon region.",

The reservoir is located in the Bunt/Muschelkalk facies (Triassic in age) just underneath the Keuper evaporites (regional detachment). The expected density contrast between cover/basement/detachment rocks represent a suitable setting to apply gravity modeling.\nTherefore, we designed the location of eight serial and radial cross sections over 1.50000 available geological maps, we also include bedding data (field work) and thickness and depth information from wells and previous stratigraphic profiles. Besides, gravity data were acquired along the sections to build up 2.5D models and thus, to constrain the geometry of the basement and the thickness of the sedimentary cover. Density values used in the modelling come from a database with 1470 sites (compiled and acquired).\nInitially we build the balanced sections using the available geological information and applying standard geometric techniques. Regional knowledge and previous sections were also taken into account. Then, we took these sections into Oasis Montaj to fit the real and expected gravimetric signal. In this work we present the comparison of the location of certain horizons before and after that feedback. In some cases, mislocation of some horizons may reach up to 0.4 km, which represents up to 50% of the expected depth. After fitting the gravity data with balanced cross-sections we carried out a stochastic inversion that allowed reducing the uncertainty to a maximum of 0.15 km, i. e. c. 20% . Further error analysis may be focused on the double-checking with seismic section information from the industry, if and when available.\nAttached figure displays an example of one of the performed sections. There, extrapolation of subsurface structures under the Ebro foreland basin based on lateral information cannot be supported by the measured gravimetric signal. The mislocations of the basement top in A and B zones reach -0.4 and + 0.8 km respectively, with critical implications for any potential CO2 storage.",

            "abstract": "The hydroxyl radical (OH) is the major oxidant in the atmosphere. Reaction with OH is the primary removal process for many non-CO2greenhouse gases (GHGs), ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) and their replacements, e.g. hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Traditionally, the global OH abundance is inferred using the observed atmospheric rate of change for methyl chloroform (MCF). Due to the Montreal Protocol regulation, the atmospheric abundance of MCF has been decreasing rapidly to near-zero values. It is becoming critical to find an alternative reference compound to continue to provide quantitative information for the global OH abundance.\nOur model analysis using the NASA 3-D GEOS-5 Chemistry Climate Model suggests that the inter-hemispheric gradients (IHG) of the HCFCs and HFCs show a strong linear correlation with their global emissions. Therefore it is possible to use (i) the observed IHGs of HCFCs and HFCs to estimate their global emissions, and (ii) use the derived emissions and the observed long-term trend to calculate their lifetimes and to infer the global OH abundance. Preliminary analysis using a simple global two-box model (one box for each hemisphere) and information from the global 3-D model suggests that the quantitative relationship between IHG and global emissions varies slightly among individual compounds depending on their lifetime, their emissions history and emission fractions from the two hemispheres. While each compound shows different sensitivity to the above quantities, the combined suite of the HCFCs and HFCs provides a means to derive global OH abundance and the corresponding atmospheric lifetimes of long-lived gases with respect to OH (tOH). The fact that the OH partial lifetimes of these compounds are highly correlated, with the ratio of tOH equal to the reverse ratio of their OH thermal reaction rates at 272K, provides an additional constraint that can greatly reduce the uncertainty in the OH abundance and tOH estimates. We will use the observed IHGs and long-term trends of three major HCFCs and six major HFCs in the two-box model to derive their global emissions and atmospheric lifetimes as well as the global OH abundance. The derived global OH abundance between 2000 and 2014 will be compared with that derived using MCF for consistency.",

These systems can work in closed and open path (LIght Detection And Ranging or LIDAR) settings where we use Frequency Modulated Spectroscopy (FMS) to measure the harmonics of the primary absorption peak for CO2, CH4, and H2S absorptions. This provides between 100-1000 times sensitivity to allow for small concentrations or low abundance isotopes to be observed at distance. We tested these systems at various locations around Los Alamos National Laboratory and at the ZERT Controlled Release site in Bozeman Montana. Results show pollution signatures, ecologically productive fluxes, and carbon storage signatures depending upon location monitored. We will present these results and share unique features of this novel system. Remote detection of concentration and isotope profiles of greenhouse and toxic gases can provide a new method for stand-off detection and mapping of gas in the environment.

HAARP’s unique features have enabled the conduct of a number of nonlinear plasma experiments in the interaction region of overdense ionospheric plasma including stimulated electromagnetic emissions (SEE), artificial aurora, artificial ionization layers, VLF wave-particle interactions in the magnetosphere, strong Langmuir turbulence (SLT) and suprathermal electron acceleration. Diagnostics include the Modular UHF Ionospheric Radar (MUIR) sited at HAARP, the SuperDARN-Kodiak HF radar, spacecraft radio beacons, HF receivers to record stimulated electromagnetic emissions (SEE) and telescopes and cameras for optical emissions. We report on short timescale ponderomotive overshoot effects, artificial field-aligned irregularities (AFAI), the aspect angle dependence of the intensity of the plasma line, and suprathermal electrons. For a narrow range of HF pointing between Spitze and magnetic zenith, a reduced threshold for AFAI is observed. Applications are made to the study of irregularities relevant to spacecraft communication and navigation systems.",

            "abstract": "Studies conducted in La Fonera (Palamós) submarine canyon (NW Mediterranean) evidence that trawling activities along the canyon flanks cause resuspension and transport of sediments towards the canyon axis. The analysis of a sediment core collected at 1750 m in 2002 showed a doubling of the sediment accumulation rate since the 1970s, coincident with the rapid industrialization of the local trawling fleet. This occurred along with a change from bioturbated texture to well-preserved sedimentary layering, interpreted as depositional pulses of trawling-induced sediment gravity flows. The good preservation of these structures was explained as a temporary hampering of biological mixing, resulting from suffocation of bioturbating fauna. The same canyon area was revisited a decade later (2011) and new data are consistent with the sedimentary regime shift during the 1970s, but also suggest that the accumulation rate during the last decade is even greater than expected, approaching ~2.4 cm/y (compared to ~0.25 cm/y pre-1970s). The X-radiograph image from the 2011 sediment core also indicates that bioturbation, if hampered in the 2002 core, has been reactivated later. Various ichnofabrics observable in the 2011 core testify to a diverse bioturbating fauna, including a scolitia resulting from the burrowing activity of an endobenthic echinoid. Remotely operated vehicle images collected along the canyon axis seafloor evidenced a large presence and densities of the burrowing sea urchin Brissopsis lyrifera. This species has also been found in high densities in the neighbor Blanes canyon axis, while it was absent from the adjacent open slope. However, historical data indicate that B. lyrifera was present in high numbers in the slope region in previous decades, suggesting that trawling activities have modified the distribution of this burrowing species and that the canyon environment is currently functioning as refuge area that offers a suitable environment for their proliferation.",

            "abstract": "Precipitation forecasting is a major challenge in most regions around the world. This study focuses on improving global dynamic model forecasts in the Southwest United States, which is often affected by multi-year droughts. The North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME; Kirtman, 2014), consisting of 99 ensemble members from eight dynamic models, has shown limited skill in predicting winter precipitation in the region. This study proposes a hybrid approach that combines the NMME model simulations with statistical forecast – i.e., a Bayesian-based forecast model that leverages the predictability of atmosphere-ocean teleconnections. Specifically, winter precipitation is predicted given the state of indices including the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), Pacific North American index (PNA), and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). An Expert Advice (EA; DeSantis et al., 1988) algorithm is utilized first to find the most skillful ensemble members from NMME, and then to combine the dynamical and statistical models, leading to improved seasonal climate predictions that can benefit drought prediction. The model showed a significant improvement of NMME precipitation predictions during the 2012-2014 droughts in CA and NV – e.g., the approach forecasted the negative precipitation anomalies in 2012-2014 over most parts of the southwest United States. Overall, the hybrid approach results are encouraging for further exploration and could potentially prove to be useful for operational climate prediction.",

            "abstract": "Soil organic matter constitutes up to 75% of the terrestrial carbon stock. Microorganisms mediate the breakdown of organic compounds and the return of carbon to the atmosphere, predominantly through respiration. Microbial respiration requires an electron acceptor and an electron donor such as small fatty acids, organic acids, alcohols, sugars, and other molecules that differ in oxidation state of carbon. Carbon redox state affects how much energy is required to oxidize a molecule through respiration. Therefore, different organic compounds should offer a spectrum of energies to respiring microorganisms.\nHowever, microbial respiration has traditionally focused on the availability and reduction potential of electron acceptors, ignoring the organic electron donor. We found through incubation experiments that the organic compound serving as electron donor determined how rapidly Shewanella putrefaciens CN32 respires organic substrate and the extent of reduction of the electron acceptor. We simulated a range of energetically favorable to unfavorable electron acceptors using organic chelators bound to Fe(III) with equilibrium stability constants ranging from log(K) of 11.5 to 25.0 for the 1:1 complex, where more stable complexes are less favorable for microbial respiration. Organic substrates varied in nominal oxidation state of carbon from +2 to -2. The most energetically favorable substrate, lactate, promoted up to 30x more rapid increase in percent Fe(II) compared to less favorable substrates such as formate. This increased respiration on lactate was more substantial with less stable Fe(III)-chelate complexes. Intriguingly, this pattern contradicts respiration rate predicted by nominal oxidation state of carbon.\nOur results suggest that organic substrates will be consumed so long as the energetic toll corresponding to the electron donor half reaction is counterbalanced by the energy available from the electron accepting half reaction. We propose using the chemical structure of organic matter, elucidated with techniques such as FT-ICR MS, to improve microbial decomposition and carbon cycling models by incorporating energetic limitations due to carbon oxidation.",

            "abstract": "Among the long-standing questions on how deep earthquakes rupture, the nucleation phase of large deep events is one of the most puzzling parts. Resolving the rupture properties of the initiation phase is difficult to achieve with far-field data because of the need for accurate corrections for structural effects on the waveforms (e.g., attenuation, scattering, and site effects) and alignment errors. Here, taking the 2015 Mw 7.9 Bonin Islands earthquake (depth = 678 km) as an example, we jointly invert its far-field P waves at multiple stations for the average rupture speed during the first second of the event. We use waveforms from a closely located aftershock as empirical Green's functions, and correct for possible differences in focal mechanisms and waveform misalignments with an iterative approach. We find that the average initial rupture speed is over 5 km/s, significantly higher than the average rupture speed of 3 km/s later in the event. This contrast suggests that rupture speeds of deep earthquakes can be highly variable during individual events and may define different stages of rupture, potentially with different mechanisms.",

Variations in cloud patterns and properties are expected to accompany changes in climate. The NASA Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) Project developed an end-to-end analysis system to measure broadband radiances from a radiometer and retrieve cloud properties from collocated high-resolution MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to generate a long-term climate data record of clouds and clear-sky properties and top-of-atmosphere radiation budget. The first MODIS was not launched until 2000, so the current CERES record is only 15 years long at this point. The core of the algorithms used to retrieve the cloud properties from MODIS is based on the spectral complement of the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), which has been aboard a string of satellites since 1978. The CERES cloud algorithms were adapted for application to AVHRR data and have been used to produce an ongoing CERES-like cloud property and surface temperature product that includes an initial narrowband-based radiation budget. This presentation will summarize this new product, which covers nearly 37 years, and its comparability with cloud parameters from CERES, CALIPSO, and other satellites. Examples of some applications of this dataset are given and the potential for generating a long-term radiation budget CDR is also discussed.",

            "abstract": "Solar energetic particles (SEPs) penetrate the lunar regolith to depths of ~1 mm and cause deep dielectric charging. The greatest charging occurs in permanently shadowed regions (PSRs), where temperatures make the electrical conductivity extremely low, which inhibits dissipating the charge buildup. Charging by very large SEP events may create subsurface electric fields that are strong enough to cause dielectric breakdown, or sparking, in the upper ~1 mm. Previous work has shown that, in PSRs, this breakdown weathering may have affected 10-25% of the meteoritically gardened regolith in PSRs and may thus be comparable to meteoritic weathering. But even regolith at lower latitudes can reach temperatures <100 K at night, causing it to dissipate charging in a few days--still enough to allow significant charging during large SEP events. Consequently, regolith at lower latitudes may also be susceptible to breakdown. We show how up to a few percent of gardened regolith at lower latitudes may have experienced breakdown. We also estimate the percentage of regolith that experienced breakdown during the two events detected in January and March 2012 by the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER) aboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). Finally, we discuss what this more global view of breakdown weathering implies about the possibility of Apollo and Luna soil samples containing material that may have experienced breakdown.",

Here we perform such an analysis using the Mars Analysis Correction Data Assimilation (MACDA, Montabone et al., 2013) and the Ensembles Mars Reanalysis System (EMARS, Greybush et al., 2012) reanalyses together with free-running MGCM simulations. Monthly-mean fields from the reanalyses and MGCMs show strong westerly winds in northern mid-high latitudes during NH winter, with near-zero PV at and equatorward of the maximum winds (jet core) and steep meridional PV gradients poleward of the jet core. Furthermore, in the lower atmosphere the maximum PV occurs off the pole and monthly-mean maps show a continuous ring (annulus) of high PV. On shorter (e.g., daily) time scales a different picture emerges, with maps showing multiple small-scale coherent regions of high PV that rotate around the pole, and only when averaged over monthly times does a high PV annulus appear. A PV budget analysis is performed to examine the cause of the annulus of high PV. We also relate the ring of small-scale vortices to the stability of the PV annulus, and discuss the implications on meridional transport between mid and high latitudes.",

            "abstract": "Ethylene (C2H4) is a trace gas commonly associated with boreal fire plumes and the petrochemical industry. It has a short lifetime (~1-2 days) in the troposphere due to its reaction with OH. Chemical destruction of ethylene in the atmosphere leads to the production of ozone precursors such as carbon monoxide (CO) and formaldehyde. The Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) is a Fourier Transform Spectrometer aboard the Aura satellite that measures thermal infrared radiances with high spectral resolution. Trace gas products retrieved routinely from TES spectra include O3, CO, H2O, HDO, CH4, NH3, HCOOH, CH3OH, with OCS and PAN to be included in the next data release. The TES spectra also includes a wealth of untapped information about other trace gasses including ethylene. Ethylene was first observed in TES spectra by Alvarado et al. (2011), though it has yet to be developed into an operational product. Our study focuses on the detection and initial quantitative estimates of ethylene in TES special observations taken in support of the 2008 ARCTAS mission. Initial observations of HCN in the spectra may provide a way to distinguish between fire plume and petrochemical derived ethylene. Results indicate a correlation between ethylene and CO in fresh fire plumes but not in older plumes, consistent with the gas’s short lifetime. The approach adopted here to detect ethylene in the TES 2008 ARCTAS special observations can easily be expanded to larger datasets, including those from other thermal infrared sounders as well as to other trace gases.",

            "abstract": "Biomass burning events are known to produce large emissions of aerosol particles, including light-absorbing black carbon (BC) and brown carbon. Once exported from fire-based source regions to the Arctic via atmospheric transport mechanisms, these particles can change the regional climate through solar absorption while suspended at various heights in the atmosphere or once deposited onto the terrain (through the reduction of surface albedo). Greenland is particularly vulnerable to positive aerosol forcing due to its perennial ice cover and high surface albedo. Surface measurements and remote sensing observations indicate that Greenland is occasionally impacted by smoke from North American and Eurasian wildfires, including during the summer of 2011 when aerosol optical depth (AOD) over central Greenland exceeded 0.20 and aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA) dropped below 0.90. Measurements of impurities in snow pits also indicate that wildfires exerted transient influence on surface albedo during the summers of 2012 and 2013, with average peak BC concentrations of 4 and 15 ng/g, respectively.\nHere, we apply idealized climate simulations to study how Greenland surface temperature and melt are affected by elevated levels of light-absorbing particles above and on the ice sheet. We apply the Community Earth System Model (CESM) in a configuration with prescribed sea surface temperatures and active atmosphere and land model components. In one set of experiments, we prescribe constant values of AOD and SSA in the troposphere over Greenland, informed by measurements from 2011. In a second set of experiments we prescribe constant mass mixing ratios of BC and dust in surface snow based on measurements of snow that fell during 2012-2014. These simulations will inform on the amount of excess snow melt that may occur on Greenland due to biomass burning, and on the relative impacts of atmospheric and snow-deposited smoke.",

            "abstract": "An important challenge for the upcoming InSight mission to Mars, which will\ndeliver a broadband seismic station to Mars along with other geophysical\ninstruments in 2016, is to accurately determine event locations with the use\nof a single station. Locations are critical for the primary objective of the\nmission, determining the internal structure of Mars, as well as a secondary\nobjective of measuring the activity of distribution of seismic events. As part\nof the mission planning process, a variety of techniques have been explored for\nlocation of marsquakes and inversion of structure, and preliminary procedures\nand software are already under development as part of the InSight Mars Quake\nand Mars Structure Services. One proposed method, involving the use of\nrecordings of multiple-orbit surface waves, has already been tested with\nsynthetic data and Earth recordings. This method has the strength of not\nrequiring an a priori velocity model of Mars for quake location, but will only\nbe practical for larger events. For smaller events where only first orbit\nsurface waves and body waves are observable, other methods are required. In\nthis study, we implement a transdimensional Bayesian inversion approach to\nsimultaneously invert for basic velocity structure and location parameters\n(epicentral distance and origin time) using only measurements of body wave\narrival times and dispersion of first orbit surface waves. The method is\ntested with synthetic data with expected Mars noise and Earth data for single\nevents and groups of events and evaluated for errors in both location and\nstructural determination, as well as tradeoffs between resolvable parameters\nand the effect of 3D crustal variations.",

            "abstract": "Mars has been studied extensively at ultraviolet wavelengths starting from Mariner 6 and 7 (Barth et al. JGR, 1971; Stewart, JGR, 1972), Mariner 9 (Barth et al., Icaurs, 1972; Stewart et al. Icarus, 1972), and more recently by SPICAM aboard Mars Express (Leblanc et al., JGR, 2006). The results from these measurements reveal a large variability in the composition and structure of Martian upper atmosphere. However, due to the lack of simultaneous measurements of energy input in the atmosphere, such as solar electromagnetic and particle flux as well as limitations in the observation geometry and data itself, this variability is still not fully understood.\nWe report a comprehensive study of Mars dayglow observations by the Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph (IUVS) aboard the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) satellite, focusing on upper atmospheric structure and seasonal variability. The dayglow emission spectra show features similar to previous UV measurements at Mars. The IUVS detected a second, low-altitude peak in the emission profile of OI 297.2 nm, confirmation of the prediction that the absorption of solar Lyman alpha emission is an important energy source there. We find a significant drop in thermospheric scale height and temperature between Ls = 218° and Ls = 337 - 352°, attributed primarily to the decrease in solar activity and increase in heliocentric distance. The CO2+ UVD peak intensity is well correlated with simultaneous observations of solar 17 - 22 nm irradiance at Mars by Extreme Ultraviolet Monitor (EUVM) aboard MAVEN. I will present and discuss the variability in Martian UV dayglow, its dependence on solar EUV irradiance, and the importance of IUVS observations in our current understanding of Mars’ thermosphere.",

            "abstract": "The Michigan basin is an approximately 5 km deep intracratonic basin that is centered over the southern peninsula of Michigan, USA. The basin overlies Proterozoic basement rock and is filled with dominantly Paleozoic sedimentary units. Evidence from diagenetic mineralization and thermal maturity of organic material indicate that past thermal conditions in the basin were anomalously high relative to expected maximum burial temperatures at the current geothermal gradient of 20° C/km. A number of hypotheses have been advanced to explain the anomalous temperature indicators including burial under now eroded sedimentary cover (Cercone and Pollack, 1991) and hydrothermal fluid flow related to the Mesoproterozoic rift that underlies the basin (Girard and Barnes,1995 and others). Here we present K/Ar ages of authigenic illite separated from the Early Mississippian Marshall Sandstone. K/Ar ages of authigenic illite provide temporal constrains on diagenetic process because illite generally forms at temperatures above 100° C, which is in agreement with the formation temperatures estimated for other authigenic components in the Marshall (Zacharias et al., 1993). Samples are from present burial depths of <500 m. Clay separates were analyzed using XRD and were shown to contain abundant illite, with little other clay mineral content and no K-feldspar. A mean age of 272 Ma was measured for three size fractions from a sample from the central basin. This sample had ages that were indistinguishable across three clay size fractions. A second sample from the southern margin of the basin showed a decrease in age with size fraction with 2-1µm illite giving an age of 313±3 Ma and a <0.5 µm illite sample giving an age of 294±3 Ma. This sample may have a small amount of coarse detrital illite that increases the age of the coarse size fraction. Based on the formation conditions interpreted for authigenic illite in the Marshall Sandstone, these dates may record a mid-Permian hydrothermal fluid flow event in the Michigan basin associated with the Alleghanian orogeny. Similar fluid flow has been recorded across the Alleghanian foreland basin.",

To link climate change to ecological processes, it is desirable to simulate the effects of climate to these belowground variables. We present results of a validation of the SOILWAT ecosystem-scale water balance simulation model, which simulates water interception and infiltration, evaporation and transpiration, snowmelt, hydraulic redistribution and deep drainage for multiple soil layers and vegetation types at the daily time step. SOILWAT can incorporate weather data, soil characteristics, vegetation phenology, and future climate scenarios derived from 2 emissions pathways and 16 general circulation models.

Our validation focused on how SOILWAT simulations compare to USCRN data at upper and lower soil layers, during wet and dry years, and between different ecosystems.\nSOILWAT outputs of θand Ts were most similar to USCRN data at upper soil layers (5 - 20 cm) and were less similar at deeper layers (50, 100 cm). Simulations of Ts at lower soil layers largely captured annual mean values, but often did not fully capture the amplitude of Ts in summer, which was coupled to fluctuations in air temperature even at lower soil layers. Best fit analysis showed that SOILWAT biases were similar between semiarid western US sites and between mesic central US sites, which reflects similarities in soil types and climate within these subregions. This suggests that SOILWAT outputs may be applied at subregional spatial scales with good fit between sites. Based on these preliminary findings, we propose that SOILWAT may be appropriate for studies of water balance and temperature change in the central and western US, and can provide reasonable projections of changes in temperature and moisture in ecosystems across these subregions that are likely to result from 21st century climate change.",

Accordingly, NFIE-derived technologies and workflows offer the ability to forecast flood damage and economic consequence estimates that coincide with the hydrologic and hydraulic estimations these physics-based models generate. A model providing an accurate prediction of damage and economic consequences is a valuable asset when allocating funding for disaster response, recovery, and relief. Damage prediction and economic consequence assessment also offer an adaptation planning mechanism for defending particularly valuable or vulnerable structures.\nThe NFIE, held at the NWC on The University of Alabama (UA) campus led to the development of this large scale flow and inundation forecasting framework. Currently, the system can produce 15-hour lead-time forecasts for the entire coterminous United States (CONUS). A concept which is anticipated to become operational as of May 2016 within the NWC. The processing of such a large-scale, fine resolution model is accomplished in a parallel computing environment using large supercomputing clusters.\nTraditionally, flood damage and economic consequence assessment is calculated in a desktop computing environment with a ménage of meteorology, hydrology, hydraulic, and damage assessment tools. In the United States, there are a range of these flood damage/ economic consequence assessment software’s available to local, state, and federal emergency management agencies. Among the more commonly used and freely accessible models are the Hydrologic Engineering Center’s Flood Damage Reduction Analysis (HEC-FDA), Flood Impact Assessment (HEC-FIA), and Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA’s) United States Multi-Hazard (Hazus-MH). All of which exist only in a desktop environment.\nWith this, authors submit an initial framework for estimating damage and economic consequences to floods using flow and inundation products from the NFIE framework. This adaptive system utilizes existing nationwide datasets describing location and use of structures and can take assimilate a range of data resolutions.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - poster_howland_white.pdf\nAccurate forest biomass estimation over large areas is important for studies of global climate change and the carbon cycle. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is known to be effective for assessing forest biomass. SAR penetrates farther into forest canopies than optical sensors, so SAR data from forested areas can be related to standing woody biomass, especially at longer L and P bands wavelength. The effect of forest structure on radar signature reduces its sensitivity to biomass when the biomass reaches a threshold level (e.g. ~100Mg/ha at L-band). Therefore the ability for forest biomass mapping using only backscattering coefficients is limited. However, including height data in forest biomass mapping using SAR data will improve the sensitivity beyond saturation levels.\nThere are many ways to get information related to forest canopy height including: 1) Lidar, a direct measurement of canopy height; 2) Height of scattering phase center (HSPC) from InSAR; 3) HSPC difference from two bands of InSAR, and 4) Polarimetric Interferometric SAR, which employs the polarization-dependent coherences. Photogrammetry (or stereo imagery) is another technique for quantifying forest vertical structure and is a traditional technique for the extraction of a digital surface model. The launch of spaceborne sensors, the application of digital cameras, the maturation of photogrammetry theory and the development of fully digital and automatic image processing make the application of photogrammetric methods feasible. Our previous studies using ALOS PRISM data have shown that the canopy height derived from PRISM stereo data were highly correlated with LVIS RH50 data.\nIn this study we have integrated this canopy height with L-band SAR imagery data to map forest biomass in our test site in Howland, Maine. The point cloud data from multi-pair stereo imageries of five PRISM scenes were co-registered and used along with the USGS NED data to calculate the mean canopy height at 30m pixels. Multi-polarization L-band SAR backscattering data and LANDSAT NDVI and VCF data were processed into the same pixel size. Field biomass data were then used in both multi-variable regression and random forest models to map forest biomass commonly covered by these imagery data. The results were compared with the biomass map generated using airborne LVIS lidar data.",

            "abstract": "Modern constraints on the timing of the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction and the Chicxulub impact, together with a particularly voluminous and apparently brief eruptive pulse toward the end of the “main-stage” eruptions of the Deccan continental flood basalt province, suggest that these three events may have occurred within less than about a hundred thousand years of each other. Partial melting induced by the Chicxulub event does not provide an energetically plausible explanation for this remarkable coincidence, and both geochronologic and magnetic-polarity data show that Deccan volcanism was underway well before Chicxulub/K-Pg time. However, historical data show that in some cases eruptions from existing volcanic systems are triggered by earthquakes. Seismic modeling of the ground motion due to the Chicxulub impact suggests that the resulting Mw~11 earthquake could have generated seismic energy densities of at least 0.1-1.0 J/m3 throughout the upper ~200 km of the Earth’s mantle, sufficient to trigger volcanic eruptions worldwide based upon comparison with historical examples. Triggering may have been caused by a transient increase in the effective permeability of the existing deep magmatic system beneath the Deccan province, or mantle plume “head.” We suggest that the Chicxulub impact triggered the enormous Poladpur, Ambenali, and Mahabaleshwar (Wai sub-group) lava flows that may account for >70% of the Deccan Traps main-stage eruptions. This hypothesis is consistent with independent stratigraphic, geochronologic, geochemical, and tectonic constraints, which combine to indicate that at approximately Chicxulub/K-Pg time a huge pulse of mantle plume-derived magma passed through the crust with little interaction, and erupted to form the most extensive and voluminous lava flows known on Earth. This impact-induced pulse of volcanism may have enhanced the K-Pg extinction event, and/or suppressed post-extinction biotic recovery. High-precision radioisotopic dating of the main-phase Deccan lavas promise a direct test of this hypothesis.",

These drivers can vary dramatically depending on conditions. Typically, the irradiance is the strongest driver in the thermosphere and ionosphere, but during times of strong driving, the high latitude forcing can become dominant. In global models of the ionosphere and thermosphere, the electric field and particle precipitation are specified separately, and are typically derived from different data sources. If these are not consistent with each other, the location and strength of energy added to the system can be incorrect. Also, varying models of the electrodynamics predict very different patterns of precipitation and electric fields, giving contrasting heating patterns. Further, many models of the aurora do not include features such as polar cap arcs and small-scale intense features within the aurora. In this presentation, a variety of storms will be presented, showing the effects of varying the high-latitude drivers on the thermospheric density, composition and temperatures as well as the ionosphere state.",

While recent studies continue to show the importance of atmospheric moist dynamics and convection as a driving factor in the development and propagation of MJO events, it is also known that the upper ocean mixed layer responds in concert and may itself contribute to the amplification and decay of MJO related variability. Preconditioning of the environment prior to the active phase of the MJO has been noted, but the balance of theorized mechanisms to accomplish this process remains unresolved. Further, not all developing organized convection transitions into a propagating MJO signal. Are there specific mechanisms involving air-sea interaction that are important for propagation?\nThis work will provide analyses of observations from satellite (AIRS/AMSU, MODIS, CERES), reanalyses, and in situ observations (buoys, Argo) to investigate atmospheric and oceanic boundary layer variability during the suppressed phase of the MJO. A particular focus of these analyses will be to characterize the systematic relationship between intraseasonal SST/upper-ocean variability, low-level stability, and observed cloud regimes. Additional emphasis will be placed on scrutinizing the interactions between the atmosphere and ocean boundary layers via surface heat flux exchanges of heat, moisture, and momentum. These relationships will be compared and contrasted between active, propagating MJO events and those organized convective events that fail to propagate.",

A two-dimensional cloud (2DC) probe, two-dimensional precipitation (2DP) probe and Fast 2DC probe were installed on the University of Wyoming King Air aircraft during CAMPS and a Cloud Imaging Probe (CIP) and Precipitation Imaging Probe were operated on the ground at the Storm Peak Laboratory during STORMVEX. A 2DC, CIP and a high volume precipitation spectrometer were installed in the University of North Dakota Citation aircraft during MC3E. The distributions of particle habits, number distribution functions, total number concentrations, ice water contents, precipitation rates, extinction and effective radius from four cases of wintertime frontal clouds sampled during CAMPS/STORMVEX and from four cases of the stratiform region of summer convective systems from MC3E are compared. It is found that there is higher percentage of pristine ice particles, such as dendrites and columns, in the wintertime frontal clouds than in the summertime convective clouds, where the dominant habits are rimed particles. The number distribution functions are generally broader in the summertime clouds than in the wintertime frontal clouds. In addition, the number concentrations and ice water contents are generally lower in the wintertime frontal clouds than in the summertime convective clouds when comparing the same temperature ranges. Implications about the potential microphysical processes that are acting in these two types of ice clouds are discussed. The results in this study are also compared with previous studies using data from other field campaigns.",

            "abstract": "Earth-System Modeling often requires the modeler to address the tradeoff between detail and parsimony. Here we describe two points on the tradeoff curve that have been implemented for description of hillslope hydrology in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) Earth-System Model (ESM). These are (1) parameterized and (2) explicitly resolved descriptions of heterogeneity with respect to topographic position in the land models LM3 and LM3-TiHy (for \"tiled hydrology\"), respectively. The conceptual base for both descriptions is that of a characteristic landscape unit having width and elevation that are functions (only) of horizontal distance from a discharge point (a stream). Horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity decays exponentially from a surface value to a (generally non-zero) value at depth.\nIn the parameterized treatment, the relations among hillslope water storage, seepage-face (i.e., saturated-surface) area fraction, and groundwater discharge are derived by solution of the steady-state form of the relevant hydraulic (i.e., one-dimensional) groundwater flow equation; a dimensionless form of the problem is pre-solved numerically for ranges of relevant parameters and is stored in a lookup table. In the explicitly resolved treatment, non-steady state is allowed, horizontal discretization is introduced, and variation of hydraulic head with vertical position is also considered. The explicitly resolved treatment allows for co-evolution of hydrologic and biogeochemical heterogeneity with respect to hillslope position, while the parameterized treatment is computationally faster. The two treatments yield essentially the same water- and energy- balance partitioning in experiments within the GFDL ESM, but only the explicitly resolved treatment (LM3-TiHy) provides the hydrologic framework for modeling biogeochemical processes that depend strongly on soil wetness (e.g., those associated with soil-carbon dynamics).",

            "abstract": "In this presentation we demonstrate that the two tectonic events in the late Cretaceous-Early Tertiary triggered the two distinct cooling events that followed the Cretaceous Thermal Maximum (CTM).\nDuring much of the Cretaceous time, the northern Neo Tethyan ocean was dominated by two east-west striking subduction system. Subduction underneath Eurasia formed a continental arc on the southern margin of Eurasia and intra oceanic subduction in the equatorial region of the Neo Tethys formed and intra oceanic arc. Beginning at ~85-90 Ma the western part of the TTSS collided southward with the Afro-Arabian continental margin, terminating subduction. This resulted in southward obduction of the peri-Arabian ophiolite belt, which extends for ~4000 km along strike and includes the Cypus, Semail and Zagros ophiolites. At the same time also the eastern part of the TTS collided northwards wit Eurasia. After this collisional event, only the central part of the subduction system remained active until it collided with the northern margin of the Indian continent at ~50-55 Ma. The collision of the arc with the Indian margin, over a length of ~3000 km, also resulted in the obduction of arc material and ophiolitic rocks. Remnants of these rocks are preserved today as the Kohistan-Ladakh arc and ophiolites of the Indus-Tsangpo suture zone of the Himalayas.\nBoth of these collision events occurred in the equatorial region, near or within the ITCZ, where chemical weathering rates are high and are contemporaneous with the onset of the global cooling events that mark the end of the CTM and the EECO. The tectonic collision events resulted in a shut down of subduction zone magmatism, a major CO2 source and emplacement of highly weatherable basaltic rocks within the ITCZ (CO2 sink). In order to explore the effect of the events in the TTSS on atmospheric CO2, we model the potential contribution of subduction zone volcanism (source) and ophiolite obduction (sink) to the global atmospheric CO2 budget. Our results show that the global ocean bottom water temperature are highly correlated with CO2 variation modeled due to the arc-continent collisions along the TTSS. Our results show that global climate in the Late Cretaceous to Early Eocene have likely been strongly changed due to the tectonic evolution of the Neo-Tethys.",

In order to mitigate these interactions, a number of elephant defense systems are under development. These include electric fences, bees and the playback of warning calls recorded from elephants. With the discovery that elephants use seismic signals to communicate (O’Connell-Rodwell et al., 2006, Behav. Ecol. Sociobiol.), it is hoped that seismic signals can also be used to help reduce conflict.\nOur current research project investigates the spectral content of the elephant seismic signal that travels through the ground using a variety of geophones and seismometers. Our experimental setup used a Geometrics Geode 24 channel seismic system with an array of 24 geophones spaced 1 m apart in an area of compact soil overlying weathered granites. Initially we used 14 Hz vertical geophones. The ground and ambient noise conditions were characterized by recording several hammer shots. These were used to identify the air wave, wind noise, and the direct wave, which had a dominant frequency of ~50 Hz.\nSeveral trained elephants that ‘rumble’ on command were then deployed ~5 m perpendicular to a line of 24 (14 Hz) vertical geophones between the 1 and 10 m geophone positions. We recorded a number of different elephants and configurations, and digitally recorded video for comparison. An additional deployment of 20 (14 Hz) horizontal geophones was also used. For all data, the sample interval was 0.25 ms and the recording length was 16 s as the timing of the rumbles could not be precisely controlled.\nWe were able to identify the airwave due to the elephant’s rumble with velocities between 305-310 m/s and the ground seismic signal due to the rumble with frequencies between 20-30 Hz. Our next experiment will include broadband seismometers at a further distance, to more fully characterize the frequency content of the elephant signal.",

In the case of doubling CO2, the forcing values can vary geographically from negative to positive values, with the range being a few times the magnitude of the global mean forcing. The factors that cause the forcing to vary are investigated here. The temperature change across the atmospheric column (temperature lapse rate) is found to be the factor that explains most clear-sky forcing variation (R2>0.9), while cloud radiative forcing is an especially good predictor of the difference between clear-sky and all-sky forcing (R2>0.99). A linear regression model is constructed for estimating CO2 forcing from geophysical variables and is tested using independent data. The inhomogeneity of CO2 forcing has important implications for climate change. The effects of forcing distribution on planetary scale energy transport, circulation (Walker Cell) adjustment, and precipitation will be discussed and compared to the effects of the overall and individual feedbacks.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGUPoster2015_PSaw_final.pdf\nThe Clouds and Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES) Fast Longwave And SHortwave Radiative Fluxes (FLASHFlux) data products were introduced at the NASA Langley Research Center to address the need of the agricultural, renewable energy management, and science communities for global surface and top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes on a near real-time basis. This has been accomplished by enhancing the speed of CERES processing using simplified calibration and averaging techniques and fast radiation parameterizations to produce fluxes within a week of real-time. While the resulting products are not considered to be sufficiently accurate for studying long-term climate trends, they satisfy the needs for many near real-time scientific data analyses and societal applications.\nOne of the uses of FLASHFlux data is for the evaluation of flux variability and extremes relative to climatological means. Normalizing FLASHFlux TOA fluxes with CERES Energy Balance And Filled (EBAF) TOA fluxes on a global scale, we are able to provide one-year flux change and flux anomalies relative to the EBAF TOA climatology for the “State of the Climate” report (published annually as a BAMS supplement). In this presentation, we extend our analysis to assess the seasonal variability and extremes for most of the year 2015 on a 1-degree regional scale. We also highlight the differences between FLASHFlux surface fluxes compared to the Surface EBAF flux products and assess the feasibility of normalizing the FLASHFLux surface fluxes to surface EBAF to provide surface flux anomalies on a regional scale. Using these anomalies for the TOA and possibly surface fluxes, we assess the radiative flux anomalies of the currently evolving 2015 El Nino on global and regional scales.",

            "abstract": "There are many challenges faced by geophysics students and academic staff in Africa that make it difficult to develop effective field and research programs. Challenges to conducting field work that have been identified, and that can be tackled are: lack of training on geophysical equipment and lack of exposure to field program design and implementation. To address these challenges, the AfricaArray/Wits Geophysics field school is designed to expose participants to a wide variety of geophysical instruments and the entire workflow of a geophysical project.\nThe AA field school was initially developed for the geophysics students at the University of the Witwatersrand. However, by increasing the number of participants, we are able to make more effective use of a large pool of equipment, while addressing challenging geophysical problems at a remote field site.\nThese additional participants are selected partially based on the likely hood of being able start a field school at their home institution. A good candidate would have access to geophysical equipment, but may not have knowledge of how to use it or how to effectively design surveys. These are frequently junior staff members or graduate students in leadership roles.\nThe three week program introduces participants to the full geophysical field workflow. The first week is spent designing a geophysical survey, including determining the cost. The second week is spent collecting data to address a real geophysical challenge, such as determining overburden thickness, loss of ground features due to dykes in a mine, or finding water. The third week is spent interpreting and integrating the various data sets culminating in a final presentation.\nParticipants are given all lecture material and much of the software is open access; this is done to encourage using the material at the home institution. One innovation has been to use graduate students as instructors, thus building a pool of talent that has developed the logistic and training skills necessary to implement field programs. Several geophysics field schools are being developed in Madagascar, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania and Cameroon. We hope to enable some of our graduate students to help with these budding programs.",

We examine the range of amplitudes expected for long period forced librations of Europa and the other Galilean satellites, due to variability in the orbits of these bodies, and discuss how measurements of the rotational responses constrain interior structure. The admittance function that converts orbital angle variations into rotation angle variations has a useful frequency dependence, in which low frequency orbit variations are converted nearly unchanged in amplitude and phase, high frequencies are strongly suppressed, and in a relatively narrow resonant frequency regime, the rotational variations are amplified in a manner dependent on the internal structure of the body. In this analysis, we examine the orbital variations, the explicit analytical form of the admittance, and plausible rotation variations for each of the Galilean satellites. The most informative case is that in which a significant line in the orbital spectrum is sufficiently resonantly enhanced to be large enough to measure. In that case, the ratio of rotational and orbital amplitudes can be observationally constrained, and places constraints on the polar moment of inertia of each of the satellites. ",

            "abstract": "Large calving events at Greenland’s outlet glaciers produce teleseismically detectable glacial earthquakes. These events are observed in the seismic record for the past 22 years, but the complete catalog of glacial earthquakes still numbers only ~300. The annual occurrence of these long-period events has increased over time, which makes recent years especially valuable in expanding the global dataset. Glacial earthquakes from 1993- 2010 have been analyzed systematically (Tsai and Ekström, 2007; Veitch and Nettles, 2012). Here, we analyze more recent events using the same centroid—single-force (CSF) approach as previous authors, focusing initially on data from 2013. In addition, we perform a focused study of selected events from 2009-2010 to assess the reliability of the force azimuths obtained from such inversions.\nRecent spatial and temporal patterns of glacial earthquakes in Greenland differ from those in previous years. In 2013, three times as many events occurred on the west coast as on the east, and these events originated predominantly from two glaciers: Jakobshavn Glacier on the west coast and Helheim Glacier on the east. Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier, on the east coast, produced no glacial earthquakes in 2013, though it produced many events in earlier years.\nPrevious CSF results for glacial earthquakes show force azimuths perpendicular to the glacier front during a calving event, with force plunges near horizontal. However, some azimuths indicate forces initially oriented upglacier, while others are oriented downglacier (seaward). We perform a set of experiments on events from 2009 and 2010 and find two acceptable solutions for each glacial earthquake, oriented 180° apart with plunges of opposite sign and centroid times differing by approximately one half of the assumed duration of the earthquake time function. These results suggest the need for a more complex time function to model glacial earthquakes more accurately.",

Due to the extreme nature of its climate, these eco-regions remain poorly understood by most global models. In this study we analyze methane fluxes from Alaska using in situ aircraft observations from the 2012-2014 Carbon in Arctic Reservoir Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE). These observations are coupled with an atmospheric particle transport model which quantitatively links surface emissions to atmospheric observations to make regional methane emission estimates. The results of this study are two-fold. First, the inter-annual variability of the methane emissions was found to be <1 Tg over the area of interest and is largely influenced by the length of time the deep soil remains unfrozen. Second, the resulting methane flux estimates and mean soil parameters were used to develop an empirical emissions model to help spatially and temporally constrain the methane exchange at the Alaskan soil surface. The empirical emissions model will provide a basis for exploring the sensitivity of methane emissions to subsurface soil temperature, soil moisture, organic carbon content, and other parameters commonly used in process-based models.",

            "abstract": "Calving is an important process that accounts for a significant share of the mass loss of Antarctica. Recently, some studies have suggested that calving is caused by the penetration of bottom crevasses rather than surface crevasses. There is also a debate on whether undercutting can change the stress regime significantly to cause calving.\nThwaites Glacier (TG) is one of the largest and broadest ice streams in West Antarctica, and is undergoing rapid thinning and mass loss. Its ice shelf has reduced significantly in size due to calving in 2015. Observations from satellites and airborne radar have revealed dense distribution of surface and bottom crevasses that play a critical role in the current processes of calving of this glacier. The current trend of mass loss will possibly be enhanced if large calving events take place, as TG will become even wider when its ice shelf gets shortened.\nHere, we use the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) and a linear elastic fracture mechanics model to investigate 1) the penetration depth of a bottom crevasse and 2) the influence on glacier stress regime of undercutting. A 2D full Stokes model is applied on a flowline of TG to best capture the stress field near the grounding line and ice front. We show that the bottom crevasse can penetrate the whole ice thickness to cause calving near the grounding line, where the ice is tens of meters below hydrostatic equilibrium. We also show that undercutting can change the stress regime near the ice front and make the ice shelf more prone to calve. We conclude on the importance of undercutting and bottom crevasses on driving changes in speed and mass balance of the Thwaites Glacier, West Antarctica, and how these processes may evolve in a warmer environment and as the glacier retreats farther inland into a deeper bed.\nThis work has been performed at UC Irvine and Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory under a contract with NASA's Cryospheric Science Program.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_2015_poster.pdf\nIt has been recently suggested that the response of Southern Ocean sea-ice extent to stratospheric ozone depletion is time-dependent; that the ocean surface initially cools due to enhanced northward Ekman drift caused by a poleward shift in the eddy-driven jet, and then warms after some time due to upwelling of warm waters from below the mixed layer. It is therefore possible that ozone depletion could act to favor a short-term increase in sea-ice extent. However, many uncertainties remain in understanding this mechanism, with different models showing widely differing time-scales and magnitudes of the response.\nHere, we analyze an ensemble of coupled model simulations with a step-function ozone perturbation. The two-timescale response is present with an approximately 30 year initial cooling period. The response is further shown to be highly dependent upon the background ocean temperature and salinity stratification, which is influenced by both natural internal variability and the isopycnal eddy mixing parameterization. It is suggested that the majority of inter-model differences in the Southern Ocean response to ozone depletion is caused by differences in stratification.",

Inorganic crystal growth experiments have advanced our understanding of mineral precipitation in the context of biological systems, but the structure and chemistry of the mineralizing interface between these two systems has remained elusive.\nWe have used laser-pulsed Atom Probe Tomography to reveal the first atom-scale 3D view of an organic-mineral interface in calcite produced by the planktic foraminifera Orbulina universa. We observe elevated Na and Mg throughout the organic, and a 9-fold increase in Na in the surface 2 nm of the organic layer, relative to the adjacent calcite. The surface-specificity of this Na maximum suggests that Na may play an integral role in conditioning the organic layer for calcite nucleation. Na could accomplish this by modifying surface hydration or structure, to modify organic-fluid and/or organic-calcite interfacial energies. Our data constitute the first evidence of the role of ‘spectator’ ions in facilitating biomineralisation, which could be an overlooked but crucial aspect of the initial steps of skeleton formation in calcifying organisms.",

These include the temporal and spatial variablities of atmospheric temperature and composition at the emission region near 87 km and processes responsible for the observed changes. Much of our previous and current knowledge of dynamical processes (i.e. tides and waves), thermal properties (i.e. inter-annual cycles), and decadal-scale changes (i.e. solar cycle and human-induced) in the mesosphere have been gained from these important observations. Groundbased measurements, however, are constrained to limited locations, cloud-free and dark nights (local time) with very poor vertical resolution. The Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument onboard the TIMED satellite has provided nearly 14 years of continuous observations of OH (5-3, 4-2) 1.6 μm and OH (9-7, 8-6) 2.0 μm Meinel band emissions. Most importantly, it has provided over one solar cycle long of well temporally and spatially sampled OH emissions with excellent vertical resolution. In this paper, we will present the morphological properties of the OH emissions at 1.6 μm and 2.0 μm observed by SABER and discuss the implication for satellite/ground measurement comparisons and the interpretation of past and future groundbased OH observations.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater banking, the intentional recharge of groundwater from surface water for storage and recovery, is an important conjunctive use strategy for water management in California. A largely unexplored approach to groundwater banking, agricultural groundwater banking (ag-GB), utilizes flood flows and agricultural lands for recharging groundwater. Understanding the availability of excess streamflow (e.g., the magnitude, frequency, timing, and duration of winter flood flows) is fundamental to assessing the feasibility of local-scale implementation of ag-GB. In this study, we estimate the current availability and forecast the future availability of winter (Nov to Apr) flood flows based on current and historic daily streamflow records for 200 stream gauges on tributaries to and streams within the Central Valley, California. For each gauge, we consider flows above a stationary 90th percentile as ideal for ag-GB because reservoir operations mitigate flood risk by releasing early winter flood flows. Results based on 70 years of data show that for 25% of the gauges there are significantly decreasing flow volumes above the 90th percentile and a decreasing number of days with flows above the 90th percentile. These flows, on average, make up 20% of the total annual winter flows. The majority of gauges further show, over the past 70 years, a decrease in total annual streamflow magnitude, a decrease in the magnitude of extreme flood events, and an increase in the frequency of flood events. Variations in winter flood flows due to climate change and climate variability are a challenge to water management in California. To aid the long-term forecast of streamflow conditions in California, we present a new water year type index for the Central Valley, which considers the variation in flow percentiles over time. Together, our results suggest that flexible, coordinated efforts for the local diversion of flood flows are needed to better utilize the increasingly rare winter flood events.",

It is a commonly used proxy for\nasteroid composition, since it can be derived from observations\nthat are available for a large number of objects. However, the\ncorrespondence between asteroid taxonomy and asteroid composition\nis not univocal, for two main reasons: 1) not all compositions\nproduce spectra with diagnostic features in the range used to\nderive the taxonomy; and 2) both the spectra and albedos of\nasteroids are also affected by other factors that are not\ndirectly related to composition. The main effect of the first\nreason is that asteroids with very different compositions may end\nup in a same taxonomic class, while the second reason may produce\nsituations where asteroids of a given composition are\nclassified into several different taxonomic groups. The physical\ncauses for this later effect include the properties of the\ntop regolith layer that cover the asteroid surface ( grain size\ndistribution, porosity and rugosity) and processes that operate in\nthis layer (space wethering by solar wind implatation and\nmicro-meteorite bombardment).

The reconnection X-line retreated tailward with a speed of 34 km/s. An ion diffusion region with a weak guide field (~10% of the lobe field) was encountered during the flow reversal. Transient energetic electron beams, which directed away from the X-line, were detected repeatedly around the current sheet boundary layer with periods of about 60s during the tailward flow burst. On the earthward side of X-line, multiple earthward-propagating dipolarization fronts were observed quasi-periodically with time period of 60s-90s. Surprisingly the cross-tail sizes of some observed dipolarization fronts are only 1-2 ion inertial lengths. The X-line expanded across the tail in the electron flow direction with a speed about 0.03VA, here VA is the Alfven speed. Two spacecraft, which were separated in the cross-tail direction by 1 RE, observed distinct structures and different tones of reconnection, which implies that reconnection proceeds drastically different in different segments of X-line.",

            "abstract": "Concern about future sea level rise motivates the study of fast flowing ice. The Whillans Ice Plain (WIP) region of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is notable for decelerating from previously fast motion during the instrumental record. Since most ice flux in Antarctica occurs through ice streams, understanding the conditions that cause ice stream stagnation is of basic importance in understanding the continent's contribution to future sea level rise. Although recent progress has been made in understanding the relationship between basal conditions and ice stream motion, direct observation of the temporal variation in subglacial conditions during ice stream stagnation has remained elusive.\nThe Whillans Ice Plain flows to the sea mostly by way of stick-slip motion. We present numerical simulations of this stick-slip motion that capture the inertial dynamics, seismic waves, and the evolution of sliding with rate- and state-dependent basal friction. Large scale stick-slip behavior is tidally modulated and encompasses the entire WIP. Sliding initiates within one of several locked regions and then propagates outward with low average rupture velocity (~ 200 m/s). Sliding accelerates over a period of 200 s attain values as large as 65 m/d. From Newton’s second law, this acceleration is ~ T / (rho H) for average shear stress drop T, ice thickness H, and ice density rho. This implies a 3 Pa stress drop that must be reconciled with the final stress drop of 300 Pa inferred from the total slip and fault dimensions. A possible explanation of this apparent discrepancy is that deceleration of the ice is associated with a substantial decrease in traction within rate-strengthening regions of the bed.\nDuring these large-scale sliding events, m-scale patches at the bed produce rapid (20 Hz) stick-slip motion. Each small event occurs over ~ 1/100 s, produces ~ 40 microns of slip, and gives rise to a spectacular form of seismic tremor. Variation between successive tremor episodes allows us to make inferences about the processes acting at the bed over a tidal time scale. We cannot rule out the possibility that the entire stress drop during large scale stick-slip is accounted for by a distribution of tremor producing patches. Seismic tremor on the WIP may therefore represent a basic component of the dynamics of large-scale stick-slip motion.",

            "abstract": "Current Earth system models do not adequately project either the magnitude or the sign of carbon fluxes and storage associated with the terrestrial carbon cycle resulting in significant uncertainties in their potential feedbacks on the future climate system. A primary reason for the current uncertainty in these models is the lack of observational constraints of key biomes at relevant spatial and temporal scales. There is an increasingly large and highly resolved amount of remotely sensed observations that can provide the critical model inputs. However, effectively incorporating these data requires the use of radiative transfer models and their associated assumptions. How these parameter assumptions and uncertainties affect model projections for, e.g., leaf physiology, soil temperature or growth has not been examined in depth.\nIn this presentation we discuss the use of high spectral resolution observations at the near surface to landscape scales to inform ecosystem process modeling efforts, particularly the uncertainties related to properties describing the radiation regime within vegetation canopies and the impact on C cycle projections. We illustrate that leaf and wood radiative properties and their associated uncertainties have an important impact on projected forest carbon uptake and storage. We further show the need for a strong data constraint on these properties and discuss sources of this remotely sensed information and methods for data assimilation into models. We present our approach as an efficient means for understanding and correcting implicit assumptions and model structural deficiencies in radiation transfer in vegetation canopies. Ultimately, a better understanding of the radiation balance of ecosystems will improve regional and global scale C and energy balance projections.",

            "abstract": "In high latitude and altitude regions of the world, melting water from snow and glacier is critical for domestic, agricultural and industrial water supply. These water supplies depending on the melting water are particularly vulnerable to changing climate caused by temperature increases and precipitation variation. A better understanding of how water availability change due to climate change impact in these regions is essential for water resources management. To achieve this goal, a recent research trend highlights the need of advancing hydrologic modeling tools with enhanced snow and glacier modeling capability. This study demonstrates a recently developed distributed glacio-hydrologic model that specifically targets the Himalayan region. We describe the model’s development background, underlying concepts, and some typical applications of the model and test it as a tool for assessing climate change risk for snow and glacier-fed river basins. Enhanced snow and glacier modules based on temperature-energy index are the primary feature of the model. We demonstrate the model’s applicability in case studies for the Upper Trishuli River Basin and the Koshi River Basin in Nepal and detailed climate change impact on water resources in these snow and glacier dominated are presented.",

            "abstract": "The 120 Ma Hikurangi Plateau, a large igneous province on the Pacific plate, is subducting below the Australian plate at the Hikurangi margin. Large along-strike variations in apparent interseismic coupling and in the depth range over which slow slip occurs provide the opportunity to better understand which factors affect the slip behavior along the megathrust. Prior to our heat flow survey the thermal regime of the incoming Hikurangi Plateau was largely unknown. In May and June, 2015, we collected 196 seafloor heat flow values in a series of transects consisting of closely-spaced measurements with a 3.5 m “violin-bow” type probe. Heat flow measurements are located around the northern and southern Hikurangi margin and are collocated with seismic reflection lines. The background heat flow on the incoming plate is 49 ± 7, and 52 ± 9, mW/m2 for the northern and southern areas, respectively. These values are consistent with cooling plate models for this age of oceanic crust and suggest no difference in the basal heat flux between these two areas. However, heat flow transects in the northern Hikurangi trough show clear evidence for crustal fluid flow associated with the basement relief, while heat flow transects along the southern Hikurangi trough do not show evidence for crustal fluid flow, which may be due to a lack of basement relief. We are developing a 2D thermal model for each region to understand the thermal and hydrologic regimes and their influence on clay diagenesis and modes of deformation.",

            "abstract": "The Bushveld Large Igneous Province (B-LIP) comprises a diverse array of >30 magma bodies that intruded the Kaapvaal Craton (KC) at ~2.06 Ga. To determine whether the B-LIP formed in response to the arrival of a plume(s) from the deep mantle or from melting of the depleted upper mantle during foundering of an eclogitized residue at the base of the lithosphere, we have measured zircon Hf isotope compositions for many of the bodies in the B-LIP. Most of the intrusions have relatively unradiogenic and internally homogeneous εHf (2.06 Ga) values (intrusion-specific average εHf (2.06 Ga) range from -21.2 ± 5.2 to -2.7 ± 2.8), consistent with published values for the Bushveld and Phalaborwa complexes (two prominent intrusions in the B-LIP with εHf (2.06 Ga) = -8.6 ± 2.6 and -7.5 ± 2.4, respectively). Because the most radiogenic Hf isotope compositions in the B-LIP are within error of εHf (2.06 Ga) = 0, it is likely that the heat source was a plume(s) from the deep mantle, as opposed to delamination-driven decompression melting of the depleted upper mantle. Many of the more unradiogenic values in the B-LIP can be reconciled with melt generation in subduction modified and metasomatically refertilized subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). Support for this model comes from B-LIP aged zircons in a metasomatically altered xenolithic fragment of the SCLM associated with a basement inlier near the geographic center of the B-LIP. Some domains in these zircons grew in the presence of a medium with a highly unradiogenic Hf isotope signature. This signature suggests that ancient (>3.8 Ga) crustal material residing in the KC-SCLM at the time of B-LIP magmatism became mobilized during arrival of the plume at ~2.06 Ga. Pervasive metasomatic alteration leading to weakening of the SCLM beneath parts of the KC is known to have occurred in the Mesozoic, but these results suggest that the KC has also withstood plume related metasomatic weakening during the Paleoproterozoic.",

Here we present an examination of the exobase approximation applied in the DeLaHaye et al. (2007) study used to extract the energy deposition and non-thermal escape rates from Titan’s atmosphere using the INMS data for the TA and T5 Cassini encounters. In that study a Liouville theorem based approach is used to fit the density data for N2 and CH4 assuming an enhanced population of suprathermal molecules (E >> kT) was present at the exobase. The density data was fit in the altitude region of 1450 – 2000 km using a kappa energy distribution to characterize the non-thermal component. Here we again fit the data using the conventional kappa energy distribution function, and then use the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) technique (Bird 1994) to determine the effect of molecular collisions. The results for the fits are used to obtain improved fits compared to the results in DeLaHaye et al. (2007). In addition the collisional and collisionless DSMC results are compared to evaluate the validity of the assumed energy distribution function and the collisionless approximation. We find that differences between fitting procedures to the INMS data carried out within a scale height of the assumed exobase can result in the extraction of very different energy deposition and escape rates. DSMC simulations performed with and without collisions to test the Liouville theorem based approximation show that collisions affect the density and temperature profiles well above the exobase as well as the escape rate.\nThis research was supported by grant NNH12ZDA001N from the NASA ROSES OPR program.

Here we report on the morphodynamic responses of the Elwha River delta to large increases in river sediment loads from the removal of two large dams beginning in 2011. The dam removal project exposed ~30 million tonnes of sediment stored within the former reservoirs to natural erosion by the river, and roughly half of this reservoir sediment was eroded during the first four years of the project. Coastal surveys with GPS-based mapping systems, sonar, and aerial photography have revealed that the Elwha River mouth has expanded seaward by ~500 m with the introduction of new supplies of sediment. Approximately 3.5 million cubic meters (or ~5 million tonnes) of sediment were deposited at the river mouth delta between 2011 and 2015. This newly deposited sediment has been shaped by waves and currents into a series of dynamic bars that have greatly expanded the estuarine habitats of the delta.",

            "abstract": "The ongoing NASA dynamical climate downscaling project runs the NASA Unified WRF (NU-WRF) model to produce high-resolution climate information with prescribed lateral boundary conditions (LBCs) from the agency’s latest global reanalysis product MERRA2. The domain of the project is set over a vast area including the continental US and the adjacent oceans, so that a variety of important meteorological phenomena (e.g., atmospheric river, mesoscale convective system, and the northeastern winter storms) can be simultaneously simulated. The regional modeling experiments include combinations of three spatial-resolution configurations (i.e., 24km, 12km, and 4km) and three spectral-nudging configurations (i.e., “no nudging”, “nudging over 2000km scales”, and “nudging over 600km scales”). In addition to the regional downscaling efforts, MERRA2 data are also being downscaled globally to 12km resolution with the NASA GEOS-5 general circulation model. Outputs from these modeling experiments provide a unique opportunity for the science community to study many important questions in the field of climate downscaling.\nThis study reports initial results regarding the impacts of LBC errors on the model experiments. Because in the regional modeling experiments information flows only one-way from MERRA2 to NUWRF, over time integration of the latter inevitably diverges from the former at the lateral boundaries as well as the interior of the domain. The differences between the un-nudged NUWRF runs and the MERRA2 data become distinguishable within a month or two of integration. Spectral nudging helps constrain the model differences between the downscaled and the original coarse-resolution climate fields. Specifically, nudging with more spatial signals (e.g., “600km”) seems to generate higher fidelity than between the NUWRF outputs and the MERRA2 forcing data. However, stronger nudging does not necessarily enhance the comparison results between the simulated climate fields and other independent observational datasets. No easy criterion is found yet with regard to determining the optimal strength of spectral nudging or, equivalently, the degree of freedom that should be given to the RCM (NUWRF) in the simulations, though more analysis efforts along this line are in progress.",

            "abstract": "Morphological dating of fault scarps has the potential to provide a fast and cost-effective means of determining the spatial and temporal pattern of paleo-seismic events over broad regions. Scarp-morphology dating algorithms are based on diffusion degradation relations but have not been adequately calibrated for sensitivity or repeatability. Using Terrestrial Laser Scanner (TLS) images to characterize geomorphic surfaces at centimeter scale, we characterize fault scarps of known and differing ages ( 20 to 13,500 years) to evaluate the applicability of morphology-degradation models in estimating ages of fault scarps. We acquired TLS images of five Quaternary fault scarp surfaces formed in unconsolidated sediments in different parts of the western Basin and Range in western Nevada and southeastern California. Diffusion models assess the initial and final configuration of a scarp to yield the product of a diffusivity constant (K) and the scarp age (T). With known T we can solve for K and vice versa. Our sensitivity analysis of the diffusion models demonstrate that small variations in the measurable parameters such as maximum slope angle (θ), far field slope angle (α), and surface offset (d) can produce large variations in the calculated age of scarp formation. Even a 0.5° uncertainty in the value of θ or α will cause 10 to 20 percent variability in K, and a 25 cm uncertainty in d will make a 20 percent difference in calculated K. This uncertainty in K value will yield ± 3000 year variation in the estimated scarp age. Using 10 cm resolution digital elevation models of fault scarps acquired with TLS, we best fit profiles and digitally measure the geometric parameters. The ages of the scarps are known via historical records or through age brackets establish in trenching studies. Using the known ages and the modeled morphology, we compute K for the various scarps formed in similarly material and environments. Estimates of K range from 1.57 m2/kyr to 13.74 m2/kyr and clearly are not a constant. Using a constant K for the region of 1.1 m2/kyr estimated in previous studies, the calculated ages deviated from known ages by 40 to 1000 percent. Although the general observation of scarp morphology degradation through time holds, the reliability of dating the fault scarp using diffusion modeling is highly questionable.",

            "abstract": " New remote sensing methods to quantify terrestrial ecosystems have developed rapidly over the past 10 years. New platforms with improved aeronautical capabilities have become known as Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). In addition to the new aircraft, sensors are becoming smaller and some can fit into limited payload bays. The miniaturization process is well underway, but much remains to be done. Rather than using a wide variety of sensors, a limited number of instruments is recommended. At the moment we fly 2-3 instruments (digital SLR camera, 6-band multispectral camera, and single video camera). Our flights are primarily over low population density western U.S. rangeland with objectives to assess rangeland health, active erosion, vegetation change, phenology, livestock movement, and vegetation type consumed by grazing animals. All of our UAS flights are made using a serpentine flight path with overlapping images at an altitude of 700 ft (215 m). This altitude allows hyperspatial imagery with a resolution of 5-15 cm depending upon the sensor being used, and it allows determination of vegetation type based on the plant structure and vegetation geometries, or by multispectral analysis. In addition to advances in aircraft and sensor technology, image processing software has become more sophisticated. Future development is necessary, and we can expect improvement in sensors, aircraft, data collection, and application to terrestrial ecosystems. Of 17 ARS research laboratories across the country four laboratories are interested in future UAS applications and another 13 already have at least one UAS. In 2015 the Federal Aviation Administration proposed a framework of recommendations that would allow routine use of certain small UAS (those weighing less than 55 lb (25 kg)). Although these new regulations will provide increased flexibility in how flights are made, other operations will still require the use of a Certificate of Authorization.\n ",

            "abstract": "The multiple-band shortwave radiation parameterization used in the GFDL general circulation models is being revised to better simulate the disposition of the solar flux in comparison with line-by-line+doubling-adding reference calculations based on the HITRAN 2012 catalog. For clear skies, a notable deficiency in the older formulation is an underestimate of atmospheric absorption. The two main reasons for this is the neglecting of both H2O absorption for wavenumbers < 2500 cm-1 and the O2 continuum. Further contributions to this underestimate are due to neglecting the effects of CH4, N2O and stratospheric H2O absorption. These issues are addressed in the revised formulation and result in globally average shortwave absorption increasing from 74 to 78 Wm-2. The number of spectral bands considered remains the same (18), but the number of pseudomonochromatic intervals (based mainly on the exponential-sum-fit technique) for the determination of H2O absorption is increased from 38 to 74, allowing for more accuracy in its simulation. Also, CO2 absorption is now determined by the exponential-sum-fit technique, replacing an algebraic absorptivity expression in the older parameterization; this improves the simulation of the heating in the stratosphere. Improvements to the treatment of multiple scattering are currently being tested. This involves replacing the current algorithm, which consists of the two stream delta-Eddington, with a four stream algorithm. Initial results show that in most, but not all cases these produce better agreement with the reference doubling-adding results.",

            "abstract": "From first light in early 2013, the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) onboard Landsat 8 exhibited obvious indications that stray light was contaminating the thermal data collected from the instrument. Although traditional techniques were applied to calibrate the data, these efforts did not mitigate the non-uniform banding introduced by the stray light. The development of an operational technique to remove the effects of the stray light became a high priority to enhance the utility of the TIRS data, which in some cases had errors in absolute estimates of temperature in excess of 9 K. A potentially operational world-wide solution was developed that reduces non-uniform banding and absolute errors significantly. Finding “truth” data to train and validate the algorithm, however, was a major challenge. The scarcity of truth data represents a potential limiting factor for fully understanding the utility of the algorithm.\nThis presentation gives an overview of the stray light correction algorithm developed for the Thermal Infrared Sensor onboard Landsat 8. An emphasis is placed on the challenges in identifying truth data used in the training and analysis of the algorithm. Terra MODIS data from March 28th, 2013 – March 30th, 2013 is currently being used as truth data in this work. This time period is significant as Landsat 8 had not yet achieved its final orbit and for a brief few days, flew only minutes ahead of MODIS and through the center of its field-of-view. A presentation of how this data was used to train the algorithm, how it was used to assess the utility of the stray light correction algorithm versus the nominal calibration, and the need for additional truth data sources will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Tran_agu.pdf\nGreat Basin bristlecone pine (Pinus longaeva) is a useful climate proxy because of the species’ long lifespan (up to 5000 years) and the climatic sensitivity of its annually-resolved rings. Past studies have shown that growth of individual trees can be limited by temperature, soil moisture, or a combination of the two depending on biophysical setting at the scale of tens of meters. We extend recent research suggesting that trees vary in their growth response depending on their position on the landscape to analyze how growth patterns vary over time. We used hierarchical cluster analysis to examine the growth of 52 bristlecone pine trees near the treeline of Mount Washington, Nevada, USA. We classified growth of individual trees over the instrumental climate record into one of two possible scenarios: trees belonging to a temperature-sensitive cluster and trees belonging to a precipitation-sensitive cluster. The number of trees in the precipitation-sensitive cluster outnumbered the number of trees in the temperature-sensitive cluster, with trees in colder locations belonging to the temperature-sensitive cluster. When we separated the temporal range into two sections (1895-1949 and 1950-2002) spanning the length of the instrumental climate record, we found that most of the 52 trees remained loyal to their cluster membership (e.g., trees in the temperature-sensitive cluster in 1895-1949 were also in the temperature sensitive cluster in 1950-2002), though not without exception. Of those trees that do not remain consistent in cluster membership, the majority changed from temperature-sensitive to precipitation-sensitive as time progressed. This could signal a switch from temperature limitation to water limitation with warming climate. We speculate that topographic complexity in high mountain environments like Mount Washington might allow for climate refugia where growth response could remain constant over the Holocene.",

While there is observational evidence indicating that ocean materials make their way to the surface, our understanding of the chemical processes that can alter this material under Europan surface conditions is limited. We present experimental data on the chemistry of mixed solutions of NaCl and MgSO4 as they are frozen to 100 K, replicating the conditions that may occur when subsurface ocean fluids are emplaced onto Europa’s surface. Confocal micro-Raman spectroscopy is used to study the formation of salts during the freezing process, and the interaction of ions in the frozen brines. Our data indicate that mixed aqueous solutions of NaCl and MgSO4 form Na2SO4 and MgCl2 preferentially when frozen, rather than making NaCl and MgSO4 precipitates. The detection of epsomite (MgSO4•7H2O) on Europa’s surface may therefore imply an ocean composition relatively low in sodium, unless radiolytic chemistry converts MgCl2 to MgSO4 as suggested by Hand and Brown 2013 (ApJ 145 110).

Here the convergence direction remains continuously orthogonal to the trench notwithstanding its bend.\nMultibeam bathymetric data acquired in the North Fiji Basin reveals active deformation and fragmentation of the upper plate. It shows the southward propagation of a N-S back-arc spreading ridge into the pre-existing volcanic arc, and the connection of the southern end of the spreading axis with an oblique active rift in the active arc. Ultimately the active arc lithosphere is sheared as spreading progressively supersedes rifting.\nConsequently to such incursion of back-arc basin extension into the arc, peeled off and drifted pieces of arc crust are progressively isolated into the back-arc basin.\nAnother consequence is that the New Hebrides arc is split in two distinct microplates, which move independently relative to the lower plate, and thereby define two different subduction systems.\nWe suggest arc fragmentation could be a consequence of the incipient collision of the Loyalty Ridge with the New Hebrides Arc. We further speculate that this kinematic change could have resulted, less than two million year ago, in the initiation of a new subduction orthogonal to the New Hebrides Subduction possibly along the paleo STEP fault.\nIn this geodynamic setting, with an oceanic lithosphere subducting beneath a sheared volcanic arc, a particularly wide range of primitive subduction-related magmas have been produced including adakites, island arc tholeiites, back-arc basin basalts, and medium-K subduction-related lavas.",

In addition to the commonly accepted open-ocean source of SSA, several studies have suggested that SSA can be produced by sublimation of blowing snow or frost flowers in sea-ice covered regions. To estimate and compare the role of blowing snow and open ocean sources, we implement a blowing snow SSA emission scheme for sea-ice covered regions in the GEOS-Chem global 3D chemical transport model. We analyze multi-year observations of sea salt aerosol mass concentrations at three Arctic sites (Barrow, Alaska; Alert, Canada; Zeppelin, Svalbard) and two Antarctic sites (Neumayer and Dumont d'Urville) and compare them to simulations with the GEOS-Chem model for 2001-2008. Simulations including only open-ocean SSA emissions, fails to reproduce the observed winter maximum in SSA mass concentrations at these sites. The underestimate ranges from factors of 3 to 25. Including a blowing snow SSA source leads to improved agreement with observations. Based on the comparison to surface observations, we estimate that the total SSA emissions (submicron and supermicron) from blowing snow are 2.1 Tg/yr over the Arctic and 0.6 Tg/yr over Antarctica, maximizing during winter. In contrast, for the regions poleward of 70° latitude, the open ocean source are 7 Tg/yr (Arctic) and 1 Tg/yr (Antarctic) with a maximum during late summer. We find that in the submicron range, however, SSA emissions from blowing snow play a dominant role (Arctic: 0.4 Tg/yr; Antarctic: 0.15 Tg/yr), being factors of 4-6 larger compared to emissions of submicron SSA from the open ocean (Arctic: 0.1Tg/yr ; Antarctic: 0.015Tg/yr).",

It is the first GLE of the solar cycle 24 (or since December 2006). Because GLEs are considered as the highest energy tail in the solar energetic particle (SEP) spectrum, it is generally believed that GLEs must be generated at very strong shocks. Here, we conduct a simulation study of a number of major (> M5.0) flare events that occurred in the current solar cycle up to 2013, using the H3DMHD simulation code. The H3DMHD (Wu et al. 2007, JGR) combines the kinematic solar wind model (HAF) for regions near the solar surface (2.5–18 Rs) and a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics model (Han et al. 1988), which takes output from HAF at 18 Rs and propagates outward up to 1.7 AU. The H3DMHD code has been fully tested and is suitable for simulating not only the quiet solar wind, but also disturbances propagating in the solar wind. Our preliminary study result suggests that the 12 May 2012 was magnetically well connected, whereas others were not. We will present the detailed result, including the shock structure and intensity driven by the 12 May 2012 CME event, and discuss the result implication.",

Using the probabilistic forecasts from three models hosted at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center (NASA-GSFC) and the NOAA forecasts, we developed an ensemble forecast by linearly combining the flaring probabilities from all four methods. Performance-based combination weights were calculated using a Monte-Carlo-type algorithm that applies a decision threshold\nP\nth\nto the combined probabilities and maximizing the Heidke Skill Score (HSS). Using the data for 13 recent solar active regions between years 2012 - 2014, we found that linear combination methods can improve the overall probabilistic prediction and improve the categorical prediction for certain values of decision thresholds. Combination weights vary with the applied threshold and none of the tested individual forecasting models seem to provide more accurate predictions than the others for all values of\nP\nth\n. According to the maximum values of HSS, a performance-based weights calculated by averaging over the sample, performed similarly to a equally weighted model. The values\nP\nth\nfor which the ensemble forecast performs the best are 25 \\% for M-class flares and 15 \\% for X-class flares. When the human-adjusted probabilities from NOAA are excluded from the ensemble, the ensemble performance in terms of the Heidke score, is reduced.",

            "abstract": "Barchan dunes are crescentic bedforms located in environments with unidirectional flow and limited sediment supply, including deserts, river beds, the continental shelves and the craters of Mars. Barchans are commonly observed in fields rather than in isolation, with the evolution of, and interactions between, bedforms being highly dynamic, involving feedback mechanisms between the fluid flow, morphological change and sediment transport. A series of experiments were undertaken to discretely simulate the collision of a smaller barchan with a larger, downstream one using fixed bedform models, with each experiment representing a successive snapshot in the dune collision process. These experiments thus capture the turbulent flow over fixed-bed morphologies that correlate with rapid morphological change and high rates of sediment transport using time-resolved particle image velocimetry (PIV) in the wall-parallel plane. The use of a Refractive Index Matching (RIM) flow facility allows for the light to pass through the model, capturing areas which are otherwise obscured, such as around the horns of the dune, the sheltered region behind the crest, and areas in which the bedforms are deformed during the collision. This paper will present the results of Dynamic Mode Decomposition that has been used to identify the most dominant modes contributing to flow dynamics in each collision stage.",

They also provide important parameters for land surface, climate and carbon models and vital background data for research into fire, hydrological and ecosystem processes. MODIS Vegetation Continuous Fields (VCF) products provide four complementary layers of fractional cover: tree cover, non-tree vegetation, bare ground, and surface water. MODIS VCF products are currently produced globally and annually at 250m resolution for 2000 to the present. Additionally, annual VCF products at 1/20° resolution derived from AVHRR and MODIS Long-Term Data Records are in development to provide Earth System Data Records of fractional vegetation cover for 1982 to the present. In order to provide continuity of these valuable products, we are extending the VCF algorithms to create Suomi NPP/VIIRS VCF products.\nThis presentation will highlight the first VIIRS fractional cover product: global percent tree cover at 1 km resolution. To create this product, phenological and physiological metrics were derived from each complete year of VIIRS 8-day surface reflectance products. A supervised regression tree method was applied to the metrics, using training derived from Landsat data supplemented by high-resolution data from Ikonos, RapidEye and QuickBird. The regression tree model was then applied globally to produce fractional tree cover.\nIn our presentation we will detail our methods for creating the VIIRS VCF product. We will compare the new VIIRS VCF product to our current MODIS VCF products and demonstrate continuity between instruments. Finally, we will outline future VIIRS VCF development plans.",

We discuss the response of such waves to sinusoidal driving under an ensemble of conditions. Multiple driving mechanisms, ionospheric conductivity profiles, and azimuthal modenumbers are considered. Runs are carried out using a two-and-a-half dimensional model of the inner magnetosphere. The model includes height-resolved conductivity and permittivity profiles for the ionosphere and plasmasphere, as well as a conducting ground and an insulating atmosphere. Results from this model show a novel dichotomy between the poloidal and toroidal Pc4 modes when driving is delivered through modulation of the ring current.The toroidal mode depends only weakly on the azimuthal modenumber. On the other hand, the poloidal mode becomes significantly stronger and more structured as the modenumber increases.",

In cooperation with the Juneau Icefield Research Program, we measured the spectral reflectance and albedo of a range of targets, collecting a spectral catalogue of the Taku glacier system. Using this spectral library, the main foci of this study are linking red algae biomass to spectral reflectance, quantifying the radiative forcing of impurities in suncups, and testing a snow grain size retrieval algorithm. Impurities, algae, and large snow grains all reduce the reflectance of shortwave radiation but with unique spectral signatures. In addition, spectra are used in conjunction with satellite imagery to investigate the spatial variability of albedo and therefore impurities on the Taku Glacier.",

Based on the daily states of the eastern Pacific ITCZ during March-April 1980–2012, composites of the global observed thermodynamical and dynamical fields associated with the daily double and the southern ITCZs are analyzed, with the northern ITCZ as the reference state. It is found that the double ITCZs are related to the central Pacific La Nin ̃a-like states: anomalous positive (negative) SSTs and atmospheric heating (cooling) over the western (central) tropical Pacific. The daily southern ITCZs show similar patterns but with a much greater magnitude and therefore can be seen as the extreme case of the double ITCZs. Air-sea interaction plays an important role in developing the double/southern ITCZ related anomalies as revealed by surface heat fluxes. Further analysis reveals that these patterns can be largely reproduced by the regression of the corresponding monthly mean fields onto the leading mode of the tropical Pacific SSTs during the same season, suggesting that the composites associated with the eastern Pacific ITCZ daily variability during boreal spring can be attributed to the tropical Pacific interannual variability.",

They are prevalent during solar minimum, non-axisymmetric, and are stable. Polar coronal holes are regularly observed capping the northern and southern solar poles in EUV images of the corona and are understood as the primary source of the fast solar wind. We make measurements of these features from 1996 through 2015 using four different NASA imagers: SOHO EIT, STEREO A and B EUVI, and SDO AIA. A measurement of the axial symmetry of the polar holes is seen to have clear solar cycle dependence.

Yet, this region faces considerable uncertainty regarding water resource availability due to its location in the transition zone of the north-south precipitation dipole associated with ENSO. Previous research has demonstrated that this transition zone migrates latitudinally, such that hydroclimatic conditions in northern vs. central Utah may be alternately in- or out-of-phase. We present a synthesis of three independent, millennial-length tree-ring based streamflow reconstructions from watersheds spanning 4 degrees of latitude, developed from a network of Utah juniper and low-elevation bristlecone pine chronologies. The reconstructions demonstrate periods of considerable synchrony and asynchrony, shedding light on the spatially and temporally variable role of teleconnections as drivers of hydroclimate. We also discuss the implications of these findings for our water manager partners throughout northern Utah, and demonstrate the benefit of millennial-length reconstructions in improving established hydroclimate forecast models in the face of climatic change.",

            "abstract": "The abundance of NH3 can influence new particle formation rates, aerosol chemical and optical properties, as well as N-sensitive ecosystems via deposition. Sources and sinks of gas-phase ammonia (NH3) are poorly constrained in the High Arctic due to a lack of field observations. In particular, both the magnitude and direction of sea-air NH3 exchange are highly uncertain, although previous studies suggest the open ocean is likely to act as a net sink at high latitudes.\nIn order to investigate potential NH3 sources, sinks and impacts, hourly gas-phase NH3 and particulate-phase NH4+ and SO42- measurements were taken from 13 July to 7 August 2014 aboard a research cruise throughout Baffin Bay and the eastern Canadian Arctic Archipelago. Simultaneous measurements of total seawater ammonium, pH and sea surface temperature were used to compute the compensation point (χ), which is the ambient NH3 concentration at which sea-air fluxes change direction. Ambient NH3 ranged from 30-650 ng m-3 throughout the cruise and was several orders of magnitude larger than measured χ values (0.4-10 ng m-3). Hence, the summertime Arctic Ocean is a strong net sink of NH3.\nGEOS-Chem (a chemical transport model) was employed to examine the impact of seabird guano (feces) on surface NH3 concentrations. A simulation without guano-derived NH3 emissions yielded highly acidic aerosol and underestimated surface NH3 by several orders of magnitude. Including NH3 emission estimates from seabird guano greatly improved model-measurement comparison. The importance of seabird guano as an NH3 source was also investigated using the FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model driven by WRF meteorology (FLEXPART-WRF). FLEXPART-WRF results confirm that air masses with origins co-located with large seabird colonies were enriched in NH3, whereas those originating over the open ocean were depleted in NH3. The influence of NH3 from wildfires, as well as implications for N-deposition and aerosol neutralization are also discussed.",

As a distributed product, characteristics of basins discharging to every grid-cell of the global earth surface are computed at 1km resolution strictly following their definitions. We introduce in this paper an efficient framework to reduce the algorithm complexity to O(N), which results in efficiency improvement in the order of 50-100 times the traditional way. We find that, spatially, 1) the relief ratio reaches its peak values along both sides of the ridges; 2) the fitness ratio of the main stream value often has a sharp decrease at the joint of large tributaries; statistically, 3) only the basin relief exhibits strong discrepancy of distribution among different continents while all others show unexpected homogeneity of distribution in spite of the size (number of cells) difference of continents; 4) the distributions of the main flow length/down valley length and basin length/basin perimeter resemble each other respectively; and 5) the distributions of the two pairs are quite different thus neither the main flow length nor down valley length should be used as substitutions of the basin length as done by some previous studies.",

The resulting Δ36 values, representing the abundance of 18O18O relative to a random distribution of isotopes, show that stratospheric and tropospheric air masses are easily discernable: Stratospheric air has higher Δ36 values than tropospheric air (i.e., more 18O18O), reflecting colder temperatures and higher ozone concentrations. The lower Δ36 values in tropospheric air reflect warmer temperatures, lower ozone concentrations, and the transport of high-Δ36 air from the stratosphere. These variations in atmospheric Δ36 values agree with predictions derived from a global 3-D chemical-transport model, which indicates that the spatial distribution of ozone and stratosphere-to-troposphere exchange govern observed variations in atmospheric Δ36 values on annual timescales.

Most commonly such applications focus on parameter transfers under a predictions in ungauged basins type scenario, where parameters are transferred spatially. In this study, we focus on utility of hydrologic signatures as predictors of model performance in a calibration-validation testing scenario (i.e., the temporal transfer of model parameters). The Probability Distributed Model, a simple conceptual hydrologic model, was used to test the approach across a number of catchments included in the MOPEX data set. We explored the change in model performance across calibration and validation time periods and contrasted it to the corresponding change in several hydrologic signatures. Results were explored in finer detail by utilizing a moving window approach to calibration and validation time periods, while also considering direct, signature-based parameter estimation. This investigation allowed us to develop a more in-depth understanding of the relationship between hydrologic model predictions and hydrologic signatures and provided insights into the potential added information that signatures can provide.",

            "abstract": "Shoreline deposits surrounding closed-basin lake remnants in the Great Basin of North America have been critical to defining the timing and extent of lake highstands during Marine Isotope Stage 2, recording the wettest climate conditions during the last glacial cycle. We present 14C and U-Th series ages and stable and clumped isotope results from MIS 2 microbialite tufas of pluvial Lake Chewaucan, southern Oregon. At ~42.5°N latitude, the Chewaucan basin is the one of the northernmost lake systems in the Great Basin, a critical location for investigating regional climate. Dating of modern tufa and DIC indicates no 14C reservoir effect. Low lake depth is observed for peak LGM conditions (21.0 ka, +11 m above modern), consistent with regional records and climate model results. In contrast with other Great Basin lake reconstructions for deglacial MIS 2, Lake Chewaucan was deepest during the Bølling/Ållerod (B/A; 14.5-13.0 ka, +50 m) and early Holocene (10.9-9.5 ka +15 m) warm periods, with lowstands during Heinrich Event 1 (+0-1 m) and Younger Dryas cold periods (+0 m). This supports previous evidence for wet interstadials in the Pacific Northwest (PNW) during MIS 2-3, the opposite of the central/southern Great Basin, where stadials correlate with wet conditions. δ18O values of tufas (-0.9 to -4.4‰ PDB) reflect high evaporation relative to inflowing meteoric water (-13.6‰ SMOW), and lake water (-6.7 SMOW). δ13C values (+1.7 to +4.5‰ PDB) are consistent with equilibrium with lake DIC (+1.5‰ PDB) and atmospheric CO2, supporting atmospheric 14C equilibrium. Clumped isotope temperatures for modern tufa (20±7°C) are consistent with summer lake surface temperature for modern lake remnant, Abert Lake (17.7-22.0°C), supporting previous clumped isotope results for tufas as summer temperature indicators. Clumped temperatures for the B/A highstand are 19±4°C, indicating near modern lake temperatures during deepest lake conditions. 13±4°C is indicated for the LGM lowstand (18.3 ka), further supporting cold, dry conditions in the PNW during the time. Our results build upon previous work, highlighting the utility of multiple geochronometers and geochemical measurements of tufas to ensure dating accuracy and derive lake water chemistry and temperatures related to lake highstands of known age and depth.",

However, many aftershocks remain undetected by the global network due to the limitation of the density and distribution of seismic instruments. In this study, we use the back-projection method with multiple global seismic arrays to detect the hidden earthquakes (not recorded by current standard global earthquake catalog) following the 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake. There are 140 aftershocks in the global catalog within 10 days since the mainshock. Using array methods, we are able to detect about twice as many events near the mainshock. According to the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) comprehensive earthquake catalog, the first aftershock happened 4 minutes after the mainshock. We detect aftershocks even before that event. This shows that back-projection can be used to detect early aftershocks in global scale, which usually remain undetected by the arrival of various seismic phases immediately following a large earthquake [Lengline et al., 2012]. Detection of these hidden aftershocks provides a more complete picture of the spatiotemporal distribution of aftershock activity and helps improve the completeness of the global standard aftershock catalog. Our improved aftershock catalog shows east-west aftershocks distribution (Figure 1), similar to the ANSS catalog. In addition, we detect significant number of aftershocks north, south, and within the coseismic rupture area. The improved aftershock catalog using existing global seismic arrays enables us to better study aftershocks dynamics, stress evolution and earthquake characteristics.",

Models of seismic anisotropy in oceanic regions provide important constraints on the geometry of strain in the mantle, the nature of the lithosphere-asthenosphere transition, and the possible presence of partial melt in the asthenosphere. The goal of this work is to produce a three-dimensional model of isotropic and anisotropic velocities in the Pacific, which will improve constraints on olivine fabrics and strain geometries in the oceanic upper mantle. Measurements of fundamental-mode dispersion for Rayleigh and Love waves traversing oceanic paths are drawn from the waveform dataset used to construct the global dispersion model GDM52. We develop anisotropic phase-velocity maps of the Pacific basin for Rayleigh and Love waves between 25 s and 250 s and invert the phase-velocity maps for anisotropic velocity structure at depth. The resulting models are radially anisotropic and include the G parameters that are related to the azimuthal anisotropy of vSV. We compare results of these two-step inversions with direct inversions of fundamental-mode phase anomalies for three-dimensional anisotropic structure. In much of the central and western Pacific, vertical gradients in both vS and anisotropy are consistent with the transition from rigid lithosphere to viscously deforming asthenosphere. In future work we plan to incorporate waveform data providing constraints on higher-mode dispersion in the modeling of the three-dimensional anisotropic structure.",

            "abstract": "We present a noble gas study in glacial meltwater (GMW) from the Athabasca Glacier (AG) in the Columbia Icefield, Canada. It constrains the relative contributions of GMW sources, water residence times, and spatial locations where the GMW originates in the alpine glacier. This is possible due to the conservative nature of noble gases and temperature dependency of their concentrations in water in equilibrium with the atmosphere (ASW) which allows for estimation of the altitude at which GMW originated. In addition, crustal He accumulates in water over time, allowing for estimation of water residence times.\nWater samples were collected in the morning on selected dates in May and July 2011 at two locations about 200 m apart near the terminus area at altitudes between 2000 m and 2100 m. Eight samples were collected in six different days.\nResults show that the major source of subglacial meltwater is ASW rather than old, compressed glacial ice, which has a distinct noble gas signature not seen in our samples. Given that, GMW samples from the AG do deviate to a certain extent from the ASW values corresponding to measured water temperature and altitude at collection points. Two patterns are observed in the concentrations of the AG samples. The first one presents a relative Ar enrichment with respect to Ne, Kr, and Xe, first observed in high-altitude springs in the Galápagos Islands (Warrier et al., 2012). The second one displays a mass-dependent pattern, first observed in Michigan rainwater (Warrier et al., 2013). A preliminary Xe analysis indicates equilibration altitudes between 2500 m and 3400 m, values compatible with local topography. Samples present He excess of 4% to 91%, and suggest an average residence time of ~400 yrs.\n",

Thus, we developed daily BC emissions from fires in this region at a 500 m x 500 m resolution from 2002 to 2013 and modeled the BC transport and deposition in the Arctic. BC emissions were estimated based on MODIS land cover maps and detected burned areas, the Forest Inventory Survey of the Russian Federation, and biomass specific BC emission factors. An average of 250,000 km2 were burned annually in Northern Eurasia. Grassland dominates the total burned area (61%), followed by forest (27%). For grassland fires, about three-quarters of the area burned occurred in Central and Western Asia and about 17% in Russia. More than 90% of the forest burned area was in Russia. Annual BC emissions from Northern Eurasian fires varied enormously with an average of 0.82±0.50 Tg. In contrast to burned area, forest fires dominated BC emissions and accounted for about two-thirds of the emissions, followed by grassland fires (15%). More than 90% of the BC emissions from forest fires occurred in Russia. Overall, Russia contributed 83% of the total BC emissions from fires in Northern Eurasia. The transport and deposition of BC on Arctic ice from all the global sources was estimated using the LMDz-OR-INCA global chemistry-aerosol-climate model. About 7.9% of emitted BC from fires were deposited on the Arctic ice, accounting for 45-78% of the BC deposited from all sources. However, about 20% of the BC emitted from fires were deposited on Arctic in spring which is the most effective period for acceleration of melting of ice. The simulated BC concentrations are consistent with obserations at the Arctic monitoring stations of Albert, Barrow, Nord, Zeppelin, and Tiksi.",

            "abstract": "Arctic and boreal peatlands serve as major reservoirs of terrestrial organic carbon (C) because Net Primary Productivity (NPP) outstrips C loss from decomposition over long periods of time. Peatland productivity varies as a function of water table position and surface moisture content, making C storage in these systems particularly vulnerable to the climate warming and drying predicted for high latitudes. Detailed spatial knowledge of how aboveground vegetation communities respond to changes in hydrology would allow for ecosystem response to environmental change to be measured at the landscape scale. This study leverages remotely sensed data along with field measurements taken at the Alaska Peatland Experiment (APEX) at the Bonanza Creek Long Term Ecological Research site to examine relationships between plant solar reflectance and surface moisture. APEX is a decade-long experiment investigating the effects of hydrologic change on peatland ecosystems using water table manipulation treatments (raised, lowered, and control). Water table levels were manipulated throughout the 2015 growing season, resulting in a maximum separation of 35 cm between raised and lowered treatment plots. Water table position, soil moisture content, depth to seasonal ice, soil temperature, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), CO2 and CH4 fluxes were measured as predictors of C loss through decomposition and NPP. Vegetation was surveyed for percent cover of plant functional types. Remote sensing data was collected during peak growing season, when the separation between treatment plots was at maximum difference. Imagery was acquired via a SenseFly eBee airborne platform equipped with a Canon S110 red-edge camera capable of detecting spectral reflectance from plant tissue at 715 nm band center to within centimeters of spatial resolution. Here, we investigate empirical relationships between spectral reflectance, water table position, and surface moisture in relation to peat carbon balance.",

            "abstract": "We conducted an assessment of changes in permafrost area and carbon storage simulated by 8 process-based models between 2010 and 2300. The models participating in this comparison were those that had joined the model integration team of the Vulnerability of Permafrost Carbon Network (see\nhttp://www.permafrostcarbon.org/\n). Each of the models in this comparison conducted simulations over the permafrost land region in the Northern Hemisphere driven by CCSM4-simulated climate for RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios. Among the models, the area of permafrost (defined as the area for which active layer thickness was less than 3 m) in 2010 ranged between 8 and 19 million km2. Between 2100 and 2300, models indicated the loss of permafrost area between 3 and 5 million km2 for RCP 4.5 and between 6 and 16 million km2 for RCP 8.5. Among the models, the density of soil carbon storage in 2010 ranged between 10 and 45 thousand g C m-2; models that explicitly represented carbon with depth had estimates greater than 32 thousand g C m-2. For the RCP 4.5 scenario, mean cumulative change in soil carbon between 2010 and 2300 was a gain of 10 Pg C (range: loss of 67 to gain of 70 Pg C). For the RCP 8.5 scenario, the mean cumulative change in soil carbon was between 1960 and 2300 was a loss of 256 Pg C (range: losses of 7 to 652 Pg C). Gains in vegetation carbon negated losses in the RCP 4.5 simulations for all but one of the models (mean change in total ecosystem carbon: 60 Pg C, range: loss of 14 Pg C gain of 244 Pg C), but only for two of the RCP 8.5 simulations (mean: 148 Pg C, range: loss of 641 to gain of 167 Pg C). For the RCP simulations that lost carbon between 2010 and 2300, substantial losses of carbon did not occur until after 2100. These results suggest that the permafrost carbon feedback would not have substantial consequences until after 2100, and that effective mitigation efforts during this century have the potential to prevent the negative consequences of the permafrost carbon feedback.",

            "abstract": "Wetlands are important areas for methylmercury (MeHg) production and export to adjacent water bodies, and yet are also critical for wildlife and healthy ecosystem function. Thus, preserving or restoring wetland habitat, while limiting MeHg export, provides a unique challenge to wetland managers. This study examined how wetland design and the use of strategically located deep cells could reduce MeHg export. The study area consisted of eight ~10 hectare leveed fields, annually flooded (4-20 cm) during mid-September thru late April to promote waterfowl habitat. In four ‘treatment’ fields, 20% of the area (~2 hectare) at the outflow end was excavated to a depth of ~1 m, while no elevation adjustments were made in the four remaining ‘control’ fields. We examined 3 potential mechanisms of MeHg removal in the deep cell areas of the treatment fields (particulate flux to the benthos, benthic demethylation, and photo-demethylation), and compared MeHg export between control and treatment fields. Particulate depositional flux was high across all deep cells (3.5-8.9 g particles/m2/d dry wt.; 25-75% quartile, n=211), as assessed with deposition pads deployed prior to and retrieved after flooding. This compared well to three separate short-term (24 hr) deposition experiments (1.6-4.7 g particles/m2/d dry wt.; 25-75% quartile, n=48) used to assess particulate MeHg depositional flux (7.6-25.5 ng MeHg/m2/d dry wt.; 25-75% quartile, n=48). With additional results pending, this presentation will describe the relative contribution of the above three MeHg removal processes, the MeHg export from treatment vs control fields, and the overall effectiveness of this wetland management option using deep water cells for reducing MeHg export from managed wetlands to adjacent water bodies.",

            "abstract": "Many areas in the world are characterized by shallow soils underlain by weathered bedrock, but root-rock interactions and their implications for regolith weathering are poorly understood. To test the role of tree roots in weathering bedrock, we excavated four pits along a catena in a shale-hosted catchment near the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory, USA. We measured a variety of physical and chemical properties including: (1) root density, distribution, and respiration rates, (2) soil gas, and (3) soil, rock, and rock fracture sediment elemental compositions, mineralogy, and morphology. As expected, root density declined rapidly with depth; nevertheless, roots were present in rock fractures even in the deepest, least weathered shale sampled (~ 1.8 m). Root density in the shale fractures was highest at the ridge for all depths and decreased 23-fold downslope as soils thickened and in spite of increasing rock fracture density. Root respiration rates (per gram of root) in fractures were comparable to those in augerable soil, with the highest respiration rates for all depths observed at the ridge. We only observed roots in larger shale fractures (> 50 μm) that were coated with sediment. These sediments were mineralogically and geochemically similar to overlying B and C soil horizons with respect to clay composition, total C and N, and potentially mineralizable C. Such similarities indicate that the sediment coatings are likely the result of translocation of soil particles downward into the fractures. However, concentrations of extractable inorganic N were higher in fracture sediments than in surface soils. Shale in contact with deep roots resembled unweathered parent material geochemically. In the bulk soil, depletion profiles (K, Mg, Si, Fe, and Al) relative to unweathered shale reflected characteristic weathering of illite and chlorite to kaolinite. Approximately 50% of soil K and Mg was lost as eroding particles, supporting the idea that fracture sediments are the result of downward transport of soil particles rather than in situ rock weathering. Overall, our data suggest that roots and sediments present in shale fractures down to ~ 1.8 m are qualitatively similar to those in surface soil horizons, with the main difference being that there are simply fewer roots and less sediment in the bedrock fractures.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGUPoster2015_MUG.pdf\nThere are several attempts to monitor real time seismic activity, using regional scale wired nodes, such as Neptune in Canada and in the U.S, Antares in France or DONET in Japan.\nOn another hand there are also initiatives in deploying repeatedly OBS array like during the amphibious Cascadia Initiative (four 1-year deployments), the Japanese Pacific Array (broadband OBSs “ocean-bottom broadband dispersion survey” with 2-years autonomy), the Obsismer program in the French Lesser Antilles (eight 6-months deployments) and the Osisec program in Ecuador (four 6-months deployments). These OBSs are autonomous, they are self-recovered or recovered using an ROV. These systems are costly including ship time, and require to recover the OBS before to start working on data.\nAmong the most recent alternative we developed a 3-years autonomy OBS equipped with a Nanometrics Trillium 120 s, a triaxial accelerometer, a differential, an absolute pressure gauge, and a hydrophone. MUG-OBS is a free falling instrument rated down to 6000 m. The installation of the sensor is monitored by acoustic commands from the surface and a health bulletin with data checking is recovered by acoustic during the installation. The major innovation is that it is possible to recover the data any time on demand (regularly every 6-months or after a seismic crisis) utilizing one of the 6 data-shuttles released from the surface by acoustic command using a one day fast cruise boat of opportunity. Since sensors stayed at the same location for 3 years (when an OBS is redeployed on the same site, it will not land in the same place), it is a perfect tool to monitor slow seismic events, background seismic activity and aftershock distribution. Clock, drift measurement and GPS localization is automatic when the shuttle reaches the surface. A new version is being developed; for remote areas, shuttles released automatically and a seismic events bulletin is transmitted. Selected data can be recovered by two- way Iridium satellite communication. After a period of 3 years the main station is ­self-recovered by acoustic.",

In order to facilitate these effects, high quality consistent long-term global aerosol data records from satellites are essential. Several EOS-era instruments (e.g., SeaWiFS, MODIS, and MISR) are able to provide such information with a high degree of fidelity. However, with the aging MODIS sensors and the launch of the VIIRS instrument on Suomi NPP in late 2011, the continuation of long-term aerosol data records suitable for climate studies from MODIS to VIIRS is needed urgently.\nVIIRS was designed to have similar capabilities to MODIS, with similar visible/infrared spectral channels, and spatial/ temporal resolution. However, small but significant differences in several key channels used in aerosol retrievals between MODIS and VIIRS mean that significant effort is required to revise aerosol models and surface reflectance determination modules previously developed using MODIS data. In this study, we will show the global (land and ocean) distribution of aerosols from Version 1 of the VIIRS Deep Blue data set. The preliminary validation results of these new VIIRS Deep Blue aerosol products using data from AERONET sunphotometers over land and ocean will be discussed. We will also compare the monthly averaged Deep Blue aerosol optical thickness (AOT) from VIIRS with the MODIS C6 products to investigate if any systematic biases may exist between MODIS C6 and VIIRS AOT.",

In coastal US states, many metropolitan areas such as Baltimore and New York City are located near ports with CMVs. Many studies estimate that ships account for ~15-30% of the global anthropogenic NOx emissions. EPA developed emissions inventories are widely used by states to construct model scenarios for testing air quality attainment strategies. Currently, CMV emissions are generated by simply applying growth factors to aggregated emissions data from much earlier years. Satellite retrievals from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) have been successfully used to improve the veracity of marine emissions by incorporating observational data from the inventory year. In this study we use OMI NO2 observations and Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model outputs to improve the EPA marine emission estimates for the Mid-Atlantic region. Back trajectories from the NOAA Air Resources Laboratory HYSPLIT model are used to identify days with minimal continental influence on OMI tropospheric column NO2 over shipping lanes. We perform sensitivity analyses to quantify the impact of marine emissions on air quality and suggest strategies to better meet the EPA mandated ozone standard.",

However, once the parallel electric fields are produced, they will disappear right away, unless the electric fields can be continuously generated and sustained for a fairly long time. Thus, the crucial question in auroral physics is how to generate such a powerful and self-sustained parallel electric fields which can effectively accelerate charge particles to high energy during a fairly long time. We propose that nonlinear interaction of incident and reflected Alfven wave packets in inhomogeneous auroral acceleration region can produce quasi-stationary non-propagating electromagnetic plasma structures, such as Alfvenic double layers (DLs) and Charge Holes. Such Alfvenic quasi-static structures often constitute powerful high energy particle accelerators. The Alfvenic DL consists of localized self-sustained powerful electrostatic electric fields nested in a low density cavity and surrounded by enhanced magnetic and mechanical stresses. The enhanced magnetic and velocity fields carrying the free energy serve as a local dynamo, which continuously create the electrostatic parallel electric field for a fairly long time. The generated parallel electric fields will deepen the seed low density cavity, which then further quickly boosts the stronger parallel electric fields creating both Alfvenic and quasi-static discrete aurorae. The parallel electrostatic electric field can also cause ion outflow, perpendicular ion acceleration and heating, and may excite Auroral Kilometric Radiation.",

In some cases this behavior is followed by re-advance, thickening and deceleration. The mechanisms that control glacier stability are not fully understood, and hinder ice sheet mass balance projections. Many studies suggest that accelerations are caused exclusively by processes at the terminus, namely by mechanisms that result in increases in iceberg calving rates. In this study we investigate whether comparable accelerations can initiate at different places along the glacier trunk due to changes in subglacial processes or shear margin evolution. We begin our experiments using a prognostic depth integrated (1-D) flowline model applied to Helheim Glacier, and investigate its flow response to perturbations at the terminus and up-flow. Our work shows that large-scale accelerations could have initiated up-flow far from the terminus. The results of this study will contribute to the long-lasting debate about the role of terminus dynamics, and thus ocean conditions, in modulating ice sheet mass balance.",

Much attention has been paid to springtime Arctic aerosol owing to significant anthropogenic influence on this remote environment, but the cleaner, more locally influenced summertime Arctic is not well characterized.\nWe present results of vertically resolved, particle number, aerosol size distributions, submicron aerosol composition from an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS), and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations from the NETCARE 2014 Polar 6 aircraft campaign. The campaign was based in the high Arctic, at Resolute Bay, Nunavut, Canada (74°N, 94°W), allowing measurements from 60 to 2900 meters over ice, open water and near the ice-edge.\nThe focus of this case study is a new particle formation and growth event observed at the eastern end of Lancaster Sound (74°N, 81°W) on July 12, 2014 under clear sky conditions. During this flight Polar 6 travelled to the end of Lancaster Sound at 2900 m and subsequently descended to 60-70 m above the surface heading due west, with winds from the west. At the lowest altitude we observed a significant increase in particles > 4 nm, between 20 – 100 nm, and > 100 nm, indicating the presence of small particles between 4 – 20 nm and growth to larger sizes. In addition, CCN concentrations were enhanced up to ~ 200/cm3 from background levels of ≤ 100/cm3. Concurrently, the AMS indicated enhanced levels of methane sulfonic acid (MSA) and marine-like organic aerosol (OA) correlated in time with the presence of larger particles, as well as an iodide signal which correlated with the presence of small particles. These observations suggest that iodine oxides could be one contributor to particle formation, and that marine-like OA and MSA could contribute to particle growth in the summertime Arctic.",

The deposition of sediment and incorporation of water into the sedimentary pore space reduces sea level by increasing the elevation of the seafloor, which reduces the thickness of sea-water above the bed. In a similar manner, the compaction of sediment and purging of water out of the sedimentary pore space increases sea level by reducing the elevation of the seafloor, which increases the thickness of sea water above the bed. Here we show how one can incorporate the effects of sediment deposition and compaction into the global, gravitationally self-consistent sea-level model of Dalca et al. (2013). Incorporating sediment compaction requires accounting for only one additional quantity that had not been accounted for in Dalca et al. (2013): the mean porosity in the sediment column. We provide a general analytic framework for global sea-level changes including sediment deposition and compaction, and we demonstrate how sea level responds to deposition and compaction under one simple parameterization for compaction. The compaction of sediment generates changes in sea level only by changing the elevation of the seafloor. That is, sediment compaction does not affect the mass load on the crust, and therefore does not generate perturbations in crustal elevation or the gravity field that would further perturb sea level. These results have implications for understanding sedimentary effects on sea-level changes and thus for disentangling the various drivers of sea-level change.\n",

            "abstract": "Commercial bottom trawling causes direct physical disturbance of the marine sedimentary environments by scraping and ploughing the seabed, generating periodic resuspension of surface sediments. However, the quantification of the sediment that is removed by trawling and exported across the continental margin remains largely unaddressed, and the preservation of the signal of such impacts in the geological record have been mostly overlooked. The analysis of sediment cores collected along the Catalan margin (NW Mediterranean) has allowed evaluating the contribution of this anthropogenic activity to the present-day sediment dynamics. Sediment cores at intensively trawled sites are characterized by over-consolidated sediments with lower 210Pb surface concentrations and inventories that indicate widespread erosion of recent sedimentary deposits. In turn, combined 210Pb and 137Cs chronologies indicate a significant increase of sediment accumulation rates within submarine canyon environments since the 1970s, coincidently with a strong impulse in the industrialization of the trawling fleets of this region. Two sampling sites that exhibited high sediment accumulation rates (0.6-0.7 cm/y) were reoccupied 1-2 decades after the first studies and revealed a second and even larger increase of sediment accumulation rates (>2 cm/y) occurring at the beginning of the XXI century. This recent change has been attributed to a preferential displacement of the trawling fleet towards fishing grounds surrounding submarine canyons and, also, to technical improvements in trawling vessels, presumably related to financial subsidies provided to the fishing sector. The alteration of sediment accumulation rates described in this continental margin may occur in many regions of the World’s oceans given the wide geographical distribution of this human activity, and therefore, it could represent a potential marker of the Anthropocene in deep-sea environments.",

            "abstract": "The optical properties of black carbon (BC) particles depend not only on their sizes, but also on their mixing state. It is essential to simulate both the constantly-evolving size and mixing state of BC aerosols for more accurate computations of BC optical properties that also reduce the uncertainties associated with BC impacts on climate.\nA novel and computationally efficient size (Ddry) and mixing state (dry BC mass fraction, wBC) resolved version of the Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry, called MOSAIC-mix, is introduced within a box-model framework. While high-wBC-resolution MOSAIC-mix is verified and presents good performance with reference to an explicit particle-resolved aerosol model, PartMC-MOSAIC, this study aims to systematically develop a low-wBC-resolution MOSAIC-mix that resolves aerosol dry size and BC mass fraction and is computationally efficient. Based on more than 20000 various bin configurations tested for 10 different atmospherically relevant environmental scenarios using low-wBC-resolution MOSAIC-mix, we demonstrate that (1) average errors in absorption coefficient significantly decrease from 21.4% in Ddry resolved-only simulations that use an internal mixing approximation to 4.3% (24 Ddry bins x 2 wBC bins) to 2.8% (24 Ddry bins x 3 wBC bins); (2) the error reduction extent shrinks as wBC bin number increases.\nLow-wBC-resolution MOSAIC-mix contributes to more accurate simulations of optical properties of absorbing aerosol like BC than the internal mixing approximation used by the version of MOSAIC implemented in several three-dimensional atmospheric models. With a relatively small number of Ddry and wBC bins, the novel MOSAIC-mix successfully captures the time-evolving size and mixing state of BC aerosols, provides computationally affordable resolution in size and mixing state, and is suited to regional climate modeling to examine the impacts of absorbing aerosol on aerosol-radiation-cloud feedbacks.",

            "abstract": "Coastal regions around the world are susceptible to a variety of natural disasters causing extreme inundation. It is anticipated that the vulnerability of coastal cities will increase due to the effects of climate change, and in particular sea level rise (SLR). A novel framework was developed to generate a suite of physics-based storm surge models that include projections of coastal floodplain dynamics under climate change scenarios: shoreline erosion/accretion, dune morphology, salt marsh migration, and population dynamics.\nFirst, the storm surge inundation model was extensively validated for present day conditions with respect to astronomic tides and hindcasts of Hurricane Ivan (2004), Dennis (2005), Katrina (2005), and Isaac (2012). The model was then modified to characterize the future outlook of the landscape for four climate change scenarios for the year 2100 (B1, B2, A1B, and A2), and each climate change scenario was linked to a sea level rise of 0.2 m, 0.5 m, 1.2 m, and 2.0 m. The adapted model was then used to simulate hurricane storm surge conditions for each climate scenario using a variety of tropical cyclones as the forcing mechanism. The collection of results shows the intensification of inundation area and the vulnerability of the coast to potential future climate conditions. The methodology developed herein to assess coastal flooding under climate change can be performed across any coastal region worldwide, and results provide awareness of regions vulnerable to extreme flooding in the future.\nNote: The main theme behind this work is to appear in a future Earth’s Future publication.\nBilskie, M.

            "abstract": "It might be expected that in rift zones most earthquakes would show normal faulting mechanisms as extension is accommodated. However, fault plane solutions we have recorded over the past decade in the eastern neovolcanic rift zone of Iceland are almost entirely strike-slip. This is true both of earthquakes accompanying a 2014 dike intrusion along the rift zone and of tectonic events not associated with intrusion or volcanism.\n Our network of 65 seismometers provides excellent locations and coverage of the focal sphere of earthquakes in central Iceland. The northern rift zone is part of the mid-Atlantic Ridge which here is spreading at 19 mm/a, at an angle slightly oblique to the rift-normal direction. Persistent seismicity occurs on a series of sub-parallel zones aligned with two overlapping volcanic rifts, the Askja and Kverkfjöll segments. In the overlap region, extension is transferred from one segment to the next by left-lateral strike-slip faulting. We infer that it is energetically favourable to utilize the strong rift fabric in strike-slip faults rather than break new faults.\nOver 30,000 earthquakes were recorded in August 2014 as a dike intruded 46 km northward from Bárðarbunga volcano before erupting two weeks later at Holuhraun. Although up to 6 metres of dike opening occurred, almost all the seismicity was strike-slip, with fault planes aligned parallel to the dike. We interpret the seismicity as caused by fracturing at the dike tip along pre-existing fabric: the relative orientation of the dike and the spreading direction caused ubiquitous left-lateral faulting. Less common right-lateral faulting, also with fault planes orientated parallel to the dike, occurred behind the dike tip; most likely caused by breakage of solidified magma within the dike as the pressure of magma flow continued. The opening of the dike as magma intruded and filled the space to accommodate plate spreading occurred aseismically.",

            "abstract": "Pronounced Arctic sea ice loss since the beginning of the satellite era has intensified the interest into whether these high latitude changes can significantly influence the weather and climate far from the Arctic. Current attempts to demonstrate statistically significant remote responses to sea ice changes have been hindered by factors such as large high latitude variability, relatively short observational datasets, and model limitations in adequately representing current sea ice changes.\nIn this study, we sample uncertainty in sea ice physics parameters and variability in atmospheric initial conditions to obtain an ensemble of simulations with substantially different states of Arctic and Antarctic sea ice cover. This large ensemble isolates a robust, statistically significant climate change response arising from changes in sea ice cover only.\nOur results show a significant link between Arctic and Antarctic sea ice cover changes and precipitation across the tropical Atlantic and Pacific basins, the Sahel, and the west coast of the United States. For example, large Arctic sea ice decline leads to a northward shift of the tropical convergence zone, increased subsidence over the southwest United States and a geopotential anomaly over the North Pacific; with all of these factors resulting in significant drying over California.\nWe conclude that high-latitude sea ice cover changes are an important driver of low-latitude precipitation. Consequently, reliable predictions of future precipitation changes over areas such as California (and the Sahel) will strongly depend on our ability to adequately simulate both Arctic and Antarctic sea ice changes.\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344 and is released as LLNL-ABS-675694.",

The emptying of an evaporating pore is accompanied by changes in the thermal field forming on the surface around the invaded pore that consequently affects surface temperature and energy partitioning over the drying surface. A novel experimental system was designed to systematically evaluate the coupling between surface temperature and evaporative flux from individual and clusters of pores drilled into rough glass surfaces connected to a liquid reservoir. Details of thermal fields around individual evaporating pores were observed for sparse and dense pore spacings including measurements of evaporating flux dynamics and results were compared with PCEB model [Aminzadeh and Or, 2014] predictions. We observed drying-induced pore emptying sequences of sintered glass bead surfaces by visual and thermal imaging using high resolution infrared imager. The links between pore emptying sequence at a drying surface inferred from pore size distribution, and surface temperature dynamics offer a possibility of predicting energy partitioning over drying terrestrial surfaces.",

The petrography and texture of erupted magmas are largely overprinted by processes in the shallow reservoir and conduit. Direct petrological evidence for lower crustal storage and transport is enigmatic but exists in the form of fine-scale crystal zoning in the cores of olivine phenocrysts, in the geochemical heterogeneity of melt inclusions and in fluid inclusion density. The 2007 Father’s Day intrusion and eruption occurred at the culmination of a surge in magma supply to the summit reservoir and during a period of heightened CO2 outgassing flux. The erupted lavas provide an opportunity to analyze atypically primitive melts, with > 8.5 wt% MgO in the whole rock, which have undergone relatively little shallow crustal processing. We characterise melt inclusions and their host olivine crystals through a detailed study of olivine morphology, diffusion modelling, and melt and fluid inclusion geochemistry. We show that the melt inclusions preserve primitive geochemical heterogeneity, which we use to reconstruct fractionation, mixing and degassing processes through the crust. We infer timescales and pressures of magma ascent, storage, and CO2 degassing through the crustal plumbing system. These observations are interpreted in the context of the exceptionally detailed set of volcano monitoring data at Kīlauea Volcano.",

We solved for the spherical-harmonic coefficients through degree and order 128 and found that Mercury’s mean radius is 2439.36±0.02 km. The offset between the planet’s centers of mass and figure is negligible (40±40 m) along the polar axis and modest (140±50 m) in the equatorial plane.\nMercury’s spherical-harmonic shape spectrum is dominated by degree 2, and the planet’s first-order shape is that of a triaxial ellipsoid with semimajor axes a, b, and c. The polar radius, c, is 1.65 km less than (a+b)/2, and the equatorial difference, a-b, is 1.25 km. The long axis is rotated 15° west of Mercury’s dynamically defined principal axis. Mercury’s geoid is similarly dominated by degree 2 and well described by a triaxial ellipsoid. The degree-2 geoid and shape are highly correlated, but the power spectral density of the geoid at degree 2 is only 1% of its shape counterpart, implying substantial compensation of elevation variations on a global scale and that Mercury is not in hydrostatic equilibrium.",

            "abstract": "Channeling better prepared Earth Science teachers into secondary schools with low achievement rates in STEM subjects is essential to ensuring that the students attending these schools are ultimately afforded the opportunity to take advantage of projected growth in the global geoscience workforce. Here, a museum-based urban teacher residency (UTR) program’s approach to building subject specific content knowledge and research experience in Earth Science teacher candidates is described. In the museum-based program, graduate-level science courses and research experiences are designed and implemented specifically for the UTR by active Earth and Space research scientists that account for almost half of the program’s faculty. Because these courses and research experiences are designed specifically for the teacher candidates, they are different than many science courses and research experiences available to pre-service teachers in a university setting. At the same time, the museum-based program is the only UTR to incorporate such a rigorous science curriculum, and some possible advantages and disadvantages of the program’s approach are also considered here. While the impact of the program’s approach on student achievement rates has yet to be evaluated, there is promise in the well documented links between a teacher’s own experience with the practice of science and that teacher’s ability to leverage effective pedagogical content knowledge in the teaching of science. Because the museum-based program’s science curriculum is balanced against the educational coursework and teaching residencies that necessarily form the program’s backbone, the museum’s approach to strengthening the teacher candidate’s science background may also inform the faculty and administration of other UTRs in cases where one of their program goals is to further expand their teacher candidate’s content knowledge and practical subject matter experience.",

            "abstract": "Calcium sulfate filled fractures are observed in nearly all stratigraphic units encountered by the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity rover. The mm-scale of veins, however, provides little evidence for emplacement style. From sols 924-949, Curiosity observed a vein rich outcrop called Garden City, which shows variation in both thickness and complexity of veins. Extensive Mastcam and MAHLI imaging was conducted across the outcrop to provide textural detail that can be related to emplacement mechanisms. Additionally, Curiosity collected geochemical data on 17 ChemCam targets and 7 APXS targets, shedding light on the composition and variety of potential vein fluids.\nThe Garden City vein system records (1) the presence of distinct dark-toned and light-toned (calcium sulfate) mineralization, and (2) the presence of laminated, epitaxial, and brecciated fabrics that suggest multiple emplacement modes. Dark-toned mineralization is observed as erosionally resistant ridges predominantly along fracture walls. Although erosional resistance may reflect the permeability of host rock to fracture-borne fluids, at Garden City, laminated textures suggest that at least some mineralization may have occurred as fracture-fill. Light-toned mineralization often bisects dark-toned material, indicating re-use of fluid pathways. Light-toned veinlets permeate fracture walls, and the largest veins entrain host rock and dark-toned material within calcium sulfate matrix. Such brecciation indicates high forces associated with fluid expulsion. Elsewhere, linear patterns occur broadly perpendicular to fracture walls, and are interpreted to represent epitaxial crystal growth, suggesting lower flow rates and fluid flow pressures within the fracture system. Together these observations indicate multiple episodes of fluid flow in the Gale Crater system.",

            "abstract": "We present data on small volume eruptions of basalt and basaltic andesite from within the modern main arc of the Andean Central Volcanic Zone (CVZ). Regional faulting has allowed for small batches of relatively un-differentiated magma (olivine and pyroxene phyric) to reach the surface, recording a petrogenetic history normally obscured for magmas in the region due to thick crust (> 65 km) and a mid-crustal magma body which acts as a density filter. In situ crystal chemistry, melt inclusion chemistry, and single-crystal radiogenic isotopes reveal a much richer history than whole rock measurements. Bulk major and trace elements follow regional arc differentiation trends and are clearly modified by crustal magmatic processes. In contrast, olivine-hosted melt inclusions appear to record multiple distinct magmas, including potential primary melts. Single crystal olivine 87Sr/86Sr from Cerro Overo maar (0.7041-0.7071) define a broader range than whole rock 87Sr/86Sr (0.7062-0.7065), indicating preservation of juvenile melt in olivine-hosted melt inclusions which is lost at the whole rock scale. In situ compositional analyses of olivine, pyroxene, spinel, and melt inclusions, along with single crystal radiogenic and stable isotopes provide insight on the composition(s) of mafic magmas being delivered to the lowermost crust and deep crustal processes. Mineral chemistry data collected using EPMA provides critical P-T constraints allowing for the petrogenetic history of potential endmember magmas to be determined and also provides insights into the structure of the central Andean deep crust.",

            "abstract": "Roots play a critical role in controlling water and nutrient uptake, soil biogeochemical processes, as well as the physical anchorage for plants. While important processes, such as root hydraulic redistribution for optimal growth and survival have been recognized, representation of roots in climate models, e.g. its carbon storage, carbon resilience, root biomass, and role in regulating water and carbon fluxes across the rhizosphere and atmosphere interface is still challenging. Such a challenge is exacerbated because of the large variations of root architecture and function across species and locations due to both genetic and environmental controls and the lack of methods for quantifying root mass, distribution, dynamics and interaction with soils at field scales. The scale, complexity and the dynamic nature of plant roots call for minimally invasive methods capable of providing quantitative estimation of root architecture, dynamics over time and interactions with the soils.\nWe present a study on root architecture and root-soil interactions using geophysical methods. Parameters and processes of interests include (1) moisture dynamics around root zone and its interaction with plant transpiration and environmental controls and (2) estimation of root structure and properties based on geophysical signals. Both pot and field scale studies were conducted. The pot scale experiments were conducted under controlled conditions and were monitored with cross-well electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), TDR moisture sensors and temperature probes. Pots with and without a tree were compared and the moisture conditions were controlled via a self regulated pumping system. Geophysical monitoring revealed interactions between roots and soils under dynamic soil moisture conditions and the role of roots in regulating the response of the soil system to changes of environmental conditions, e.g. drought and precipitation events. Field scale studies were conducted on natural trees using both traditional ground based ERT as well as novel methods using the trees as transmitters. While field scale data demonstrated the potential of geophysical methods for mapping root structures, it also revealed the limitation and advances needed for better quantification of root structures.",

            "abstract": "Process-based modeling of CH4 and N2O emissions from rice fields is a practical tool for conducting greenhouse gas inventories and estimating mitigation potentials of alternative practices at the scales of management and policy-making. However, few studies have evaluated site-level model performance in side-by-side field trials of various management practices during both the growing season and fallow periods. We empirically evaluated the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model for estimating CH4 and N2O fluxes in California rice systems under varying management (N fertilizer application rate, type of seeding system, fallow period straw and water management), soil environments, and weather conditions. Five and nine site-year combinations were used for calibration and validation, respectively. The model was parameterized for two cultivars, M206 and Koshihikari, and able to simulate 30% and 78% of the measured variation in yields, respectively. A major strength of DNDC was in estimating general site-level seasonal CH4 emissions (R2 = 0.85). However, a major limitation was in simulating finer resolution of differences in CH4 emissions (or lack thereof) among side-by-side management treatments (range of 0.2-465% relative absolute deviation). Additionally, DNDC did not satisfactorily simulate fallow period CH4 emissions, or seasonal and fallow period N2O emissions across all sites with the exception of a few cases. Specifically, simulated CH4 emissions were oversensitive to fertilizer N rates, but lacked sensitivity to the type of seeding system and prior fallow period straw management. Additionally, N2O emissions were oversensitive to fertilizer N rates and field drainage. Sensitivity analysis showed that CH4 emissions were highly sensitive to changes in the root to total plant biomass ratio. Overall, uncertainty in model predictions was attributed to uncertainty in both the input parameters due to in-field spatiotemporal variability of soil properties, and in the model structure (e.g., genotype by environment interactions, clay effects, and simulation routines for field drainage, and diffusion and ebullition of gasses). These findings have implications for model-directed field research that could improve model uncertainty for application at larger spatial scales.",

EMIC waves can provide a strong source of electron pitch angle diffusion, but the waves are often quite localized – thus the spatial extents of these waves can have a large effect on their overall scattering efficiency. Using measurements from the Van Allen Probes, we characterize the spatial extents of EMIC wave active regions, and how these depend on local time, radial distance, and driver. As the separation between the spacecraft along the orbital track varies in time, with one spacecraft lapping the other every ~70 days, we can determine the correlation between EMIC wave measurements at varying spacecraft separations. During individual events at close approaches (Jan 17 2013, for example - see attached figure), analysis of the detailed wave properties and coherence is performed. These studies provide important information on parameters relevant for determining resonance of EMIC waves with radiation belt electrons.",

Since development in the 1970’s, the Budyko framework has provided a simple, first-order, approach to partitioning total rainfall into runoff and evapotranspiration across climates. However, this classic paradigm provides little insight into the strength of biological mediation (i.e. transpiration flux) of the hydrologic cycle. Through a minimalist stochastic hydrology model we analytically extend the classical Budyko framework to predict the magnitude of transpiration relative to total rainfall as a function of ecosystem aridity. Consistent with a synthesis of experimental partitioning studies across climates, this model suggests a peak in the biological contribution to the hydrologic cycle at intermediate moisture values, with both arid and wet climates seeing decreased transpiration:precipitation ratios. To best match observed transpiration:precipitation ratios requires incorporation of elevated evaporation at lower canopy covers due to greater energy availability at the soil surface and elevated evaporation at higher canopy covers due to greater interception amounts. This new approach provides a connection between current and future climate regimes, hydrologic flux partitioning, and macro-system ecology.",

The current understanding of ozone chemistry in the troposphere indicates that net ozone production P(O3) occurs when peroxy radicals (HO2+RO2) react with NO producing NO2, whose photolysis leads to O3 formation. P(O3) values can be calculated from peroxy radical concentrations, either from ambient measurements or box model outputs. These two estimation methods often disagree for NOx mixing ratios higher than a few ppb, questioning our ability to measure peroxy radicals under high NOx conditions or indicating that there are still unknowns in our understanding of the radical and ozone production chemistry.

Many have concluded that the Voyager 1 measurement of the local electron density (some 08/cm3, which is close to that expected for the local interstellar medium, and which is many times the density of the heliosheath plasma (some .001/cm3) establishes that Voyager 1 is in interstellar space. However, some believe that these facts are also consistent with Voyager still being inside of the heliopause. In order to understand the high electron density, large compression of the heliosheath plasma is invoked. This compression is attributed to the escape of the superthermal particles with their large pressure. Important to this alternate scenario is the distinction between the magnetic induction B, magnetic intensity H and magnetization  M in the heliosheath plasma. I will analyze the physics of this process and compare the results of the analysis with Voyager 1 observations.",

However, the interpretation of δ13CO2 is not straightforward. Using two Earth system models of intermediate complexity we perform a set of sensitivity experiments in which the formation rates of North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), North Pacific Deep Water (NPDW), Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) are varied. We study the impact of these circulation changes on atmospheric δ13CO2 as well as on the oceanic δ13C distribution. In general, we find that the formation rates of AABW, NADW, NPDW and AAIW are negatively correlated with changes in δ13CO2: namely strong oceanic ventilation decreases atmospheric δ13CO2. However, since large scale ocean circulation reorganizations also impact nutrient utilization and the Earth’s climate the relationship between atmospheric δ13CO2 levels and ocean ventilation rate is not unequivocal. In both models atmospheric δ13CO2 is very sensitive to changes in AABW formation rates: increased AABW formation enhances the upwelling of low δ13C waters to the surface and decreases atmospheric δ13CO2. By contrast, the impact of NADW changes on atmospheric δ13CO2 is less robust and might be model dependent.",

With radiative transfer realization, MODIS onboard NASA EOS Terra and Aqua satellites has provided globally continuous LAI/FPAR since 2000 and continuously updated the products with better quality. And NPP VIIRS shows the measurement capability to extend high-quality LAI/FPAR time series data records as a successor of MODIS. The primary objectives of this study are 1) to evaluate and validate newly updated MODIS Collection 6 (C6) LAI/FPAR product which has finer resolution (500m) and improved biome type input, and 2) to examine and adjust VIIRS LAI/FPAR algorithm for continuity with MODIS’. For MODIS C6 investigation, we basically measure the spatial coverage (i.e., main radiative transfer algorithm execution), continuity and consistency with Collection 5 (C5), and accuracy with field measured LAI/FPAR. And we also validate C6 LAI/FPAR via comparing other possible global LAI/FPAR products (e.g., GLASS and CYCLOPES) and capturing co-varying seasonal signatures with climatic variables (e.g., temperature and precipitation). For VIIRS evaluation and adjustment, we first quantify possible difference between C5 and MODIS heritage based VIIRS LAI/FPAR. Then based on the radiative transfer theory of canopy spectral invariants, we find VIIRS- and biome-specific configurable parameters (single scattering albedo and uncertainty). These two practices for MODIS C6 and VIIRS LAI/FPAR products clearly suggest that (a) MODIS C6 has better coverage and accuracy than C5, (b) C6 shows consistent spatiotemporal pattern with C5, (c) VIIRS has the potential for producing MODIS-like global LAI/FPAR Earth System Data Records.",

Although an improved understanding of the island’s hydrology would help mitigate these risks, data scarcity issues make the modeling challenging. To this end, we developed a hydrological representation of Java using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, to simulate the hydrologic processes of several watersheds across the island. We measured the model performance using Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) at monthly time step. Data scarcity and quality issues for precipitation and streamflow warranted the application of a quality control procedure to data ensure consistency among watersheds resulting in 7 watersheds. To optimize the model performance, the calibration parameters were estimated using Borg Multi Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (Borg MOEA), which offers efficient searching of the parameter space, adaptive population sizing and local optima escape facility. The result shows that calibration performance is best (NSE ~ 0.6 – 0.9) in the eastern part of the domain and moderate (NSE ~ 0.3 – 0.5) in the western part of the island. The validation results are lower (NSE ~ 0.1 – 0.5) and (NSE ~ 0.1 – 0.4) in the east and west, respectively. We surmise that the presence of outliers and stark differences in the climate between calibration and validation periods in the western watersheds are responsible for low NSE in this region. In addition, we found that approximately 70% of total errors were contributed by less than 20% of total data. The spatial variability of model performance suggests the influence of both topographical and hydroclimatic controls on the hydrological processes. Most watersheds in eastern part perform better in wet season and vice versa for the western part. This modeling framework is one of the first attempts at comprehensively simulating the hydrology in this maritime, tropical continent and, offers insights for skillful hydrologic projections crucial for natural hazard mitigation.",

            "abstract": "The rapidly changing spatial and temporal distribution of water vapor in the planetary boundary layer influences dynamical and physical processes that drive weather phenomena, general circulation patterns, radiative transfer, and the global water cycle. The ability to measure the water vapor distribution continuously within the lower troposphere has been identified as a high priority measurement capability needed by both the weather forecasting and climate science communities. This presentation provides an update on an economical and compact diode-laser-based differential absorption lidar (DIAL) which has demonstrated the capability of meeting these high priority measurement needs.\nThe DIAL instrument utilizes two continuous wave distributed feedback diode lasers to injection seed a current modulated tapered semiconductor optical amplifier. An improved switching time between the on-line and off-line wavelength, on the order of 16.7 ms, allows the instrument to retrieve water vapor profiles in rapidly changing atmospheric conditions. A shared telescope design based on a 40.64 cm diameter Dobsonian telescope allows the outgoing beam to be eye-safe at the exit of the telescope. The DIAL receiver utilizes the Dobsonian telescope to collect the scattered light and direct it through an optical narrow bandpass filter (NBF) and a Fabry-Perot etalon with a free spectral range of 0.1 nm which is equal to the wavelength difference between the on-line and off-line DIAL wavelengths. A beam splitter directs 90% of the scattered light through a second NBF, and couples it onto a fiber coupled avalanche photodiode (APD), providing a far field measurement. The remaining 10% of the light passing through the beam splitter is incident on a free space coupled APD, providing a wider field of view for water vapor measurements at lower altitudes. The two channel receiver allows water vapor measurement between 500 m and 4 km/6km during daytime/nighttime operation, respectively. The DIAL instrument layout will be described in this presentation along with data sets demonstrating the long term data collection capabilities of this instrument.",

Hyperspectral instruments, deployed on both aircraft and spacecraft, are a growing class of Earth observing sensors designed to meet these challenges. They collect large amounts of spectral data, allowing thorough characterization of both atmospheric and surface properties. The higher accuracy and increased spectral and spatial resolutions of new imagers require new numerical approaches for processing imagery and separating surface and atmospheric signals. One potential approach is source separation, which allows us to determine the underlying physical causes of observed changes. Improved signal separation will allow hyperspectral instruments to better address key science questions relevant to climate change, including land-use changes, trends in clouds and atmospheric water vapor, and aerosol characteristics.\nIn this work, we investigate a Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) method for the separation of atmospheric and land surface signal sources. NMF offers marked benefits over other commonly employed techniques, including non-negativity, which avoids physically impossible results, and adaptability, which allows the method to be tailored to hyperspectral source separation. We adapt our NMF algorithm to distinguish between contributions from different physically distinct sources by introducing constraints on spectral and spatial variability and by using library spectra to inform separation. We evaluate our NMF algorithm with simulated hyperspectral images as well as hyperspectral imagery from several instruments including, the NASA Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS), NASA Hyperspectral Imager for the Coastal Ocean (HICO) and National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) Imaging Spectrometer.",

            "abstract": "Zachariae Isstrom, a major ice stream in northeast Greenland, has lost its entire ice shelf in the past decade. Here, we study the evolution of subaqueous melting of its floating section during the transition. Observations show that the rate of ice shelf melting has doubled during 1999-2010 and is twice higher than that maintaining the ice shelf in a state of mass equilibrium. The ice shelf melt rate depends on the thermal forcing from warm, salty, subsurface ocean water of Atlantic origin (AW), and – in contrast with Antarctic ice shelves – on the mixing of AW with fresh buoyant subglacial discharge. Subglacial discharge has increased as result of enhanced ice sheet runoff driven by warmer air temperature; ocean thermal forcing has increased due enhanced advection of AW. Here, we employ the Massassuchetts Institute of Technology general circulation model (MITgcm) at a high spatial resolution (1 m horizontal and 1 m vertical spacing near the grounding line) to simulate the melting process in 3-D. The model is constrained by ice thickness from mass conservation, oceanic bathymetry from NASA Operation IceBridge gravity data, in-situ ocean temperature/salinity data, ocean tide height and current from the Arctic Ocean Tidal Inverse Model (AOTIM-5) and subglacial discharge from output products of the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO). We compare the results in winter (no runoff) with summer (maximum runoff) at two different stages with (prior to 2012) and without the ice shelf (after 2012) to subaqueous melt rates deduced from remote sensing observations. We show that ice melting by the ocean has increased by one order of magnitude as a result of the transition from ice shelf terminating to near-vertical calving front terminating. We also find that subglacial discharge has a significant impact on the ice shelf melt rates in Greenland. We conclude on the impact of ocean warming and air temperature warming on the melting regime of the ice margin of Zachariae Isstrom, Greenland.

Within this zone, between the latitudes of 400 and 420, 1 – 4 mm/yr of north-south geodetic contraction is observed and for the most part remains geologically unaccounted for. We are investigating the Quaternary expression of transpressional shear localized at the northern end of the Sierra Nevada and Great Valley to evaluate both the recency and rates of deformation across structures that may be accommodating the contractional deformation suggested in geodetic studies.\nThe northeast trending Inks Creek fold belt north of Red Bluff, CA consists of anticline-syncline pairs and dome structures that appear optimally oriented to accommodate northwest crustal shortening. The folds plunge to the southwest where they are incised and deflect the course of the Sacramento River. We will present preliminary geomorphic maps of fluvial terraces and drainage patterns associated with the folds constructed with standard field mapping techniques and aided by airborne LiDAR. It is anticipated that dating of deformed terrace strandlines with radiocarbon and OSL techniques holds the potential to quantify the lateral and vertical propagation rates of fold growth, as well as, constrain rates of regional contractional deformation.",

            "abstract": "Subduction has shaped large regions of the Earth and constitute over 55,000 km of convergent plate margin today. The subducting slabs descend from the surface into the lower mantle and impacts earthquake occurrence, surface uplift, arc volcanism and mantle convection as well as many other processes. The subduction of the Nazca plate beneath the South America plate is one example and constitutes the largest present day ocean-continent convergent margin system and has built the Andes, one of the largest actively growing mountain ranges on Earth. This active margin is characterized by along-strike variations in arc magmatism, upper crustal shortening, crustal thickness, and slab geometry that make it an ideal region to study the relationship between the subducting slab, the mantle wedge, and the overriding plate. After 20 years of portable seismic deployments in the Central Andes seismologists have combined data sets and used multiple techniques to generate seismic images spanning ~3000 km of the South American subduction zone to ~800 km depth with unprecedented resolution. For example, using teleseismic P- waves we have imaged the Nazca slab penetrating through the mantle transition zone (MTZ) and into the uppermost lower mantle. Our tomographic images show that there is significant along-strike variation in the morphology of the Nazca slab in the upper mantle, MTZ, and the lower mantle, including possible tears, folding, and internal deformation. Receiver function studies and surface wave tomography have revealed major changes in lithospheric properties in the Andes. Improved seismic images allow us to more completely evaluate tectonic processes in the formation and uplift of the Andes including: (1) overthickened continental crust driven by crustal shortening, (2) changes in slab dip and coupling with the overlying plate (3) localized lithospheric foundering, and (4) large-scale mantle and crustal melting leading to magmatic addition and/or crustal flow. Although we have made significant progress in understanding subduction there are major processes for which we need improved data of all types (ie. the role of fluids and mantle convection). For a transformative improvement in our understanding of subduction we need an interdisciplinary, community driven integrated Subduction Zone Observatory approach.",

Our water use can alter a city’s energy balance, including how much solar energy is absorbed as heat or reflected back into space. The severity of these effects, and the need to better understand connections between climate, water extraction, water use, and water use impacts, is strongest in areas of climatic aridity and substantial land-use change, such as the rapidly urbanizing areas of Utah. We have gathered and analyzed stable water isotope data from a series of semi-annual hydrological surveys (spring and fall, 2013 and 2014) in urban tap water sampled across the Salt Lake Valley. Our study has led to four major findings thus far: 1) Clear and substantial variation in tap water isotopic composition in space and time that can be linked to different water sources and management practices within the urban area, 2) There is a strong correlation between the range of observed isotope values and the population of water districts, reflecting use of water from multiple local and non-local sources in districts with high water demand, 3) Water isotopes reflect significant and variable loss of water due to evaporation of surface water resources and 4) Overall, tap water contains lower concentrations of the heavy H and O isotopes than does precipitation within the basin, reflecting the connection between city water supplies and mountain water sources. Our results highlight the utility of isotopic data as an indicator of heterogeneities within urban water systems, management practices and their variation across a major metropolitan area, and effects of climate variability on urban water supplies",

The range of iron contents may promote a range of mantle viscosities, with implications for planet thermal history and surface structures. Indeed, experiments at low pressure (i.e. at 300 MPa, Zhao et al., 2009, EPSL, 287,229-240) indicate that Fe dramatically decreases olivine viscosity. Thus, the Martian mantle may be ~10 times less viscous than the Earth’s at the same conditions. However, there is no data available on the effect of iron on olivine plasticity at pressures relevant to planetary interiors.\nIn this study, we deformed polycrystalline olivine specimens with iron ratios of 0%, 10%, 70%, 90% and 100%, at high pressure (P) ranging from 2 to 5 GPa and temperatures (T) in the range 800°-1200°C. Experiments were carried out in the Deformation-DIA apparatus (D-DIA) coupled with x-ray synchrotron radiation - to quantify stress and strain by in-situ diffraction and imaging - at the NSLS (Upton, NY) and the ESRF (Grenoble, France). Stacked cylinders of olivine with different compositions were deformed at steady-state conditions to compare their plastic responses while experiencing identical T, P and differential stresses. Results of these experiments indicate that the weakening effect of Fe on olivine viscosity is not as great at high pressure as the effect observed at low pressure.",

            "abstract": "Tectonic erosion at convergent plate boundaries is invoked to explain the evolution of nearly half the world’s subduction zones. In northeast Japan, basal tectonic erosion is argued to explain regional Miocene forearc subsidence and the lack of a large, young accretionary prism. However, new analysis of upper and lower plate kinematics in northeast Japan suggest that both of can be explained by alternate mechanisms. New analysis of the timing and kinematics of deformation demonstrate that the onset of Miocene forearc tectonic subsidence was coeval with the initiation of upper plate extension and subsidence associated with the opening of the Sea of Japan, and with a rapid acceleration in local plate convergence. The coincidence of tectonic events across the upper and lower plates suggest they are both a response to lithospheric-scale processes, and that forearc tectonic subsidence represents a response to changes in plate boundary geometry, rather than tectonic erosion. New high resolution seismic profiles and 10Be geochronology of the outer wedge at the Japan Trench indicate that much of the incoming Pacific plate sediments are actively accreted, and while subducting horst and graben topography severely deforms the frontal prism, it is not an efficient mechanism for frontal tectonic erosion. The presence of a small, Plio-Quaternary accretionary wedge and the eastward younging of basal slope basin sediments argue that the outer forearc crustal structure could be explained as the result of slow, but relatively continuous frontal accretion throughout the Cenozoic. These data suggest that the northeast Japan margin has not experienced large quantities of tectonic erosion, but instead experienced: 1) forearc subsidence caused by plate velocity driven changes in slab geometry, and 2) slow accretion and frontal wedge growth disrupted by subduction of seafloor topography.",

At the time this was written only a short segment of data at occultation entry (193°E, 17°S) was available for analysis. The REX measurements extend unequivocally to the surface, providing the first direct measure of the surface pressure and the temperature structure in Pluto’s lower atmosphere. Preliminary analysis yields a surface pressure of about 10 microbars, smaller than expected. Data from occultation exit (16°E, 15°N) are scheduled to arrive on the ground in late August 2015. Those observations will yield an improved estimate of the surface pressure, a second temperature profile, and a measure of the diameter of Pluto with a precision of a few hundred meters.",

When dealing with hazards, such as forest fires and volcanic eruptions, there is a need to assess the location of the fire/flow front and where best to assign ground personnel to reduce the risk to local populations and infrastructure. Thermal infrared cameras provide the ideal tool to detect subtle changes in the developing fire/flow front while providing data 24/7. There are limits to the detecting capabilities of these cameras given the wavelengths used and image resolution available. Given the large thermal contrast between the hot flow front and surrounding landscape then the data can be used to map out the location and changes seen as the front of the flow/fire advances. To map the complete hazard then either the UAS has to be flown at an altitude to capture the event in one image or the data has to be mosaiced together. Higher altitudes lead to coarser resolution imagery and therefore we will show how thermal infrared data can be mosaiced to provide the highest spatial resolution map of the hazard. We will present results using different UAS and thermal cameras including adding neutral density filters to detect hotter thermal targets. Timely generation of these mosaiced maps in a real-time environment is critical for those assessing the ongoing event and we will show how these maps can be generated quickly with the necessary spatial and thermal accuracy while discussing the requirements needed to generate thermal infrared maps of the hazardous events that are both useful for quick real-time assessment and also for further investigation in research projects.",

A questionnaire survey targeting farmers with at least 30 years of farming experience in the area was conducted in 6 of the 11 agricultural extension areas (EAs) in the catchment (305 km2). Data on perception about CC, adaptation measures and barriers were captured by the questionnaire. Focus group discussions were also conducted in each of the 6 selected EAs. Additionally, 8 stakeholder institutions were interviewed. Climatic data over a period of 1972 to 2012 from four stations were evaluated. Future climate simulations from 16 Regional Climate Models were used to predict future streamflow with IHACRES runoff model. The WEAP model was used to assess future water availability in two future time slices, 2021-2050 and 2071-2100. About 89.5% of 466 questioned farmers believe that temperature increased over the past 30 years, while over 94% of farmers believe that amount of rainfall; duration, intensity and rainy days decreased. Over 96% of farmers believe that their farms are extremely vulnerable to decreased rainfall, droughts and changed timing of rainfall. While analysis of climatic data shows rising trend in temperature, no long-term trend and no variability changes in both annual and monthly rainfall amounts were evident. High evapotranspiration due to rising temperature may have triggered the farmers’ perception about rainfall trend and droughts in the area. Several measures such as cropping of new varieties, changing farm locations and use of more fertilizer have been employed by farmers to adjust to CC. It was found that CC could cause severe shortfall in water availability for irrigation and domestic supply in the coming decades. Government needs to assist farmers with alternative irrigation schemes and drought resistant crops in order to sustain livelihoods of farmers on the long run.",

            "abstract": "Decades of study has concluded that during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, ~56 Ma), thousands of gigatons of carbon (as CO2 and/or methane) were released into the atmosphere over several thousand years. This offers the opportunity to study the response of biogeochemical cycles to a carbon cycle perturbation of a similar order of magnitude to current anthropogenic CO2 release. Scenarios of the PETM invariably invoke enhanced chemical weathering rates of terrestrial silicate rocks as a long-term carbon sink, thus providing a significant negative feedback that drives the recovery and termination of the event. However, little thought has gone into what effect these proposed elevated silicate weathering rates might have had on the marine biogeochemical cycling of silicon. I use order-of-magnitude calculations and a simple geochemical box model of the marine Si cycle to show that if current estimates for the mass of C released during the PETM as well as the assumption that the majority was neutralized by silicate weathering are both correct, then the supply of dissolved silica to the oceans and subsequently its concentration in seawater must have been significantly elevated during the event and its recovery. Additionally, I describe recently discovered deep-ocean sedimentary sequences from the North Atlantic that (for the first time, to my knowledge) demonstrate elevated silica content across the P-E boundary. I argue that the elevated silica content of these sediments is the result of enhanced production and/or preservation of silica in response to elevated seawater dissolved silica concentrations and speculate as to why elevated silica burial seems to have occurred specifically in the North Atlantic, and not throughout the oceans.",

            "abstract": "The impact of climate warming on permafrost and the potential of climate feedbacks resulting from permafrost thawing have recently received a great deal of attention. Most of the permafrost observatories in the Northern Eurasia show substantial warming of permafrost since the 1980s. The magnitude of warming has varied with location, but was typically from 0.5 to 3°C. The close proximity of the exceptionally ice-rich soil horizons to the ground surface, which is typical for the arctic tundra biome, makes tundra surfaces extremely sensitive to the natural and human-made changes that resulted in development of processes such as thermokarst, thermal erosion, and retrogressive thaw slumps that strongly affect the stability of ecosystems and infrastructure.\nThe main aim of this study is to evaluate the vulnerability of permafrost under climate warming across the Permafrost Region of the Northern and High-altitude Eurasia in respect to ecosystems stability, infrastructure, socioeconomic impact, and to estimate the volume of newly thawed soils, which could be potential source or sink of additional amount of carbon in the Earth System. We applied the process-based permafrost dynamics model GIPL2 (Geophysical Institute Permafrost Lab), using a historical climate forcing CRU3.1 data set for retrospective (1960-2009) and CCSM4 RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 (2009-2300) for analysis of permafrost dynamics in the future. Our projections according to the CCSM4 RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 climate scenario indicate that the maximum unfrozen volume of soil within three upper meters could change between 12.8 and 20.8K cubic km during 2009-2300. If we assume a similar response (as modeled) of soil temperature and near-surface permafrost area shrinkage to warming in Eurasia, an additional 25% of the total volume of thawed soils could become biogeochemically active by the end of the current century and 60% by 2300.",

All glaciers and periglacial landforms which are important as strategic water resource must be properly identified and mapped.\n Here we present a detailed and complete glacier and rock glacier inventory of the Central Andes of Argentina between 31° and 35°S. This semi-arid region contains some of the highest mountains of South America and concentrates the second most glacierized area in Argentina after the Patagonian Andes.\nTo develop the inventory, we used remotely sensed data and related techniques complemented with field surveys. Clean ice and perennial snowfields were identified applying an automatic extraction method on medium spatial-resolution images. Debris-covered and rock glaciers were manually digitized on higher spatial-resolution images. With minor modifications, the present digital inventory is consistent with GLIMS standards. For each glacier, we derived 38 database fields, adding five specific attributes for rock glaciers, which are not included in the original GLIMS database.\nIn total we identified 8069 glaciers covering an area of 1768 km2. Debris-covered ice and rock glaciers represent 57% of the total inventoried area. In this region, rock glaciers are a common feature in the arid landscape and constitute an important water reserve at regional scale. Many glaciers were characterized by gradual transition from debris-covered glaciers, in the upper part, to rock glaciers, in the lower sector. The remaining 43% includes clean ice glaciers and permanent snowfields. These are mostly mountain and valley-type glaciers with medium-to-small sizes.\nThis detailed inventory constitutes a valuable contribution to the ongoing global efforts (e.g. WGI, RGI and GLIMS) to map the world's glaciers. It is also the base for ongoing glaciological, climatological and hydrological studies in this portion of southern Andes.",

            "abstract": "While many shale and unconventional plays are naturally fractured (or contain planes of weakness), these are often cemented and effectively impermeable to flow. Stress shadow behind the tip of a hydraulic fracture stablizes natural fractures. It essentially means that if impermeable natural fractures and weakness planes are not opened when the hydraulic fracture tip passes, they will remain closed and impermeable to flow.\nIn this work a detailed and comprehensive evaluation of tip shear stresses and associated natural fracture or weakness plane shear is presented. From analytical work, the theoretical shear stresses from a fracture tip are first presented. The effect of fracture length, in-situ pore pressure, maximum horizontal remote stress, net pressure, natural fracture friction coefficient and the direction of natural fracture with respect to the hydraulic fracture on shear stimulation at the tip are calculated using the plane strain analytical solution of a 2-D fracture, and assuming simple linear coulomb friction law. Since slippage along natural fractures will locally violate the assumptions used in the analytical solutions and to incorporate the effect of weakness planes on stress-strain and displacement field, 2-D and 3-D finite element model (FEM) simulations are presented that build upon both the analytical and continuum solutions. FEM models are capable of numerically simulating the slippage through weakness planes by using contact elements. This advantage makes FEM tools very appropriate for synthetically generating microseismicity, which can then be evaluated for mode, focal mechanism, and magnitude.\nThe results of the simulations highlight the critical parameters involved in shearing and opening cemented natural fractures in unconventionals - which is a critical component of stimulation and production optimization for these plays. According to the results, the ideal orientation of natural fractures with respect to hydraulic fracture from shear stimulation standpoint during different stage of hydraulic fracture propagation depends on several factors including natural fracture mechanical properties (i.e. angle of friction), operation conditions (net pressure, fracture fluid viscosity), and in-situ stress conditions.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, the USGS Volcano Hazards Program has worked to implement continuous real-time in situ volcanic gas monitoring at volcanoes in the Cascade Range and Alaska. The main goal of this ongoing effort is to better link the compositions of volcanic gases to other real-time monitoring data, such as seismicity and deformation, in order to improve baseline monitoring and early detection of volcanic unrest. Due to the remote and difficult-to-access nature of volcanic-gas monitoring sites in the Cascades and Alaska, we developed Multi-GAS instruments that can operate unattended for long periods of time with minimal direct maintenance from field personnel. Our Multi-GAS stations measure H2O, CO2, SO2, and H2S gas concentrations, are comprised entirely of commercial off-the-shelf components, and are powered by small solar energy systems. One notable feature of our Multi-GAS stations is that they include a unique capability to perform automated CO2, SO2, and H2S sensor verifications using portable gas standards while deployed in the field, thereby allowing for rigorous tracking of sensor performances. In addition, we have developed novel onboard data-processing routines that allow diagnostic and monitoring data - including gas ratios (e.g. CO2/SO2) - to be streamed in real time to internal observatory and public web pages without user input. Here we present over one year of continuous data from a permanent Multi-GAS station installed in August 2014 in the crater of Mount St. Helens, Washington, and several months of data from a station installed near the summit of Augustine Volcano, Alaska in June 2015. Data from the Mount St. Helens Multi-GAS station has been streaming to a public USGS site since early 2015, a first for a permanent Multi-GAS site. Neither station has detected significant changes in gas concentrations or compositions since they were installed, consistent with low levels of seismicity and deformation.",

            "abstract": "Rapid growth of population led to the need of urban expansion into lands with problematic soils. For safe land development, the stability of problematic soils has to be enhanced. Among the many methods utilized, microbial induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) is of particular interest as a low energy, cost efficient and potentially long term ground improvement technique. As with other soil improvement methods though, high resolution temporal and spatial monitoring methods are missing. Geophysical methods can fill that gap, by efficiently complementing and extending current monitoring practices. Geophysical methods can offer low cost, no intrusive, continuous and spatially extensive monitoring of ground improvement techniques.\nWith this work we test two of the most promising methods for monitoring MICP, Spectral Induced Polarization (SIP) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR); additionally, we performed shear wave velocity measurements – the established standard on soil strength characterization – for direct comparison with NMR and SIP. The tests were performed in columns filled with unconsolidated porous media (e.g. Ottawa sand, glass beads) while binding was promoted with the addition of calcite. For the first part of the experiment we used abiotic methods for Calcite formation, while the second part involves microbial induced processes. The objective of this work is to quantify the sensitivity of NMR and SIP on soil strengthening as a result of calcite precipitation. Early results suggest that both methods, SIP and NMR, are sensitive calcite precipitation and dissolution processes.",

            "abstract": "Ancient delta deposits can provide valuable insight into the long-term evolution of the fluvial-tidal zone, but reconstructing the relative amount of tidal influence on an ancient coastline can be challenging. While characteristic sedimentary structures (such as flaser or herringbone bedding) can indicate the presence of tides, it is unclear whether these diagnostic features represent superficial reworking of largely fluvial deposits, or if they indicate that tides exerted a substantive, if not primary, control on the evolution of a given delta. The Ferron and Sego sandstones within the Cretaceous Mancos Shale are two similarly sized delta deposits that have been interpreted as fluvial-dominated and tidally influenced deltas, respectively. In order to evaluate the degree to which tides sculpted Sego deltas, we quantified stratigraphic organization of well-exposed Ferron and Sego sandstone outcrops in eastern and central Utah. Despite an abundance of quintessential tidal-sedimentary structures, the scale and geometry of bars and channels in both systems is similar suggesting that topset deposits of the tidally influenced Sego system were not appreciably different from those of fluvial Ferron deltas. Additionally, both deposits have even (compensational) stratigraphic organization at scales greater than one paleochannel depth and evidence of persistent (clustered) organization below the compensation scale; however, Sego deposits are significantly more persistent at sub-compensation scales. This suggests that, although tides controlled bedform- and bar-scale deposition in the Sego Sandstone, its network was generally similar to that of a fluvial delta. This raises the possibility that even classic tidally influenced delta deposits may be suitably modeled as fluvial deltas, and that truly tide-dominated delta stratigraphy may be difficult to identify.",

Paleoseismologic studies at Bidart Fan (BF), ~5 km southeast of WC, show rupture approximately every 88 yrs between ~A.D. 1350 and 1857 (Akciz et al., 2010). Measurements of slip per event for the last 5 or 6 earthquakes at WC (Liu et al., 2004; Liu-Zeng et al., 2006), when combined with rupture dates from BF, yield slip rates up to 50 mm/yr, well above widely accepted values of ~ 35 mm/yr. The apparent discrepancy between slip rates and slip per event measurements provided motivation to re-measure S&J’s (1984) slip rate, which was based on 8 detrital charcoal samples, by collecting samples for radiocarbon dating with new methods that have improved dramatically since the early 1980s. We re-excavated S&J’s (1984) original trenches WC-2, 7, 9, 10 and 11, and placed a new trench, WC-12. The new trench exposed a rich history of channel cut and fill prior to abandonment of the beheaded channel and incision of the modern channel. The youngest channel fills, which must be slightly younger than the abandonment, indicate that sedimentation occurred between 3675-3285 BP, after which the channel was fully abandoned. Using S&J’s (1984) offset measurement of 130 m since ~3400 BP, we recalculate a late Holocene slip rate of ~38 mm/yr in our preliminary analysis. This rate is slightly higher than the S&J (1984) result of 33.9±2.9 mm/yr and Noriega et al. (2006) result of 32.4±3.1 mm/yr at the Van Matre Ranch in the southern Carrizo. Our results are closer to the higher end of the ~36±2 mm/yr velocity gradient across the SAF from decadal timescale geodetic measurements (Schmalzle, et al., 2006).",

However, Spektor et al., (2011) have shown that ~1.3 wt% can be incorporated into pure Al-free stishovite at 10 GPa and 723 K. Yet, the stability and physical properties of hydrous silica at mantle related pressures and temperatures are unknown.\nWe have synthesized hydrous silica samples in the multi anvil press at 9-20 GPa and 700-900 K, and in the laser-heated diamond anvil cell at 17-70 GPa and 1400-2100 K. Three different sample setups have been used: dry silica gel in an H2O medium, anhydrous stishovite in an H2O medium, and hydrous silica gel in a Ne or Ar medium.\nThe presence of percent level of water was found by Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry, and Raman and Infrared spectroscopy measurements. X-ray diffraction patterns show that the unit-cell volumes of the recovered stishovite samples are greater by 0.2-3.9 % compared with anhydrous stishovite at 1 bar. The unit-cell volumes show strong linear correlation with their c/a ratio suggesting that the same OH substitution mechanism persists for a wide range of water content. Based on unit-cell volumes vs water content calibration by Spektor et al., (2011), our samples contain 0.3-7.9 wt% H2O. We found that pure silica is capable of containing as much as 4.9 wt% of H2O at temperatures close to those of the mantle geotherm (e.g., sample synthesized at ~1997 K and ~67 GPa). The highest water contents were found at the highest pressures, suggesting that the pressure stabilizes OH in dense silica.\nX-ray diffraction patterns have also shown several new diffraction lines upon compression and heating which appear from 45 GPa (1500-2100 K) and are observed up to 100 GPa. The peaks appear to belong to a new hydrous silica phase stable at higher pressures and temperatures. The high solubility of water in SiO2 at the mantle geotherm temperatures at higher pressures will change our understanding of the stability of free silica and of the deep water transport in the Earth’s mantle.",

As the science continually evolves, IRIS helps drive the market for new research tools that enable science by establishing a variety of standards and goals. This has often involved working directly with manufacturers to better define the technology required, co-funding key development work or early production prototypes, and purchasing initial production runs. IRIS activities have helped establish de-facto international standards and impacted the commercial sector in areas such as seismic instrumentation, open-access data management, and professional development.\nKey institutional practices, conducted and refined over IRIS’ thirty-year history of operations, have focused on open-access data availability, full retention of maximum-bandwidth, continuous data, and direct community access to state-of-the-art seismological instrumentation and software. These practices have helped to cultivate and support a thriving commercial ecosystem, and have been a key element in the professional development of multiple generations of seismologists who now work in both industry and academia. Looking toward the future, IRIS is increasing its engagement with industry to better enable bi-directional exchange of techniques and technology, and enhancing the development of tomorrow’s workforce. In this presentation, we will illustrate how IRIS has promoted innovations grown out of the academic community and spurred technological advances in both academia and industry.",

Subsequent research has shown that TC activity frequently clusters in two-to-three week active periods with a substantial percentage of TCs existing simultaneously within the same basin (i.e., multiple TC events). However, previous research on a limited subset of multiple TC events suggests that the prior global climatology of TC activity may not be representative of multiple TC events. Building upon prior work, the present study examines the climatological frequency and location of multiple TC events and the large-scale factors responsible for their occurrence in the North Atlantic (NATL), eastern North Pacific (EPAC), and western North Pacific (WPAC).\nIn the present study, multiple TC events are defined as tropical cyclogenesis events occurring in the presence of at least one preexisting TC, while non-multiple TC events are defined as TC genesis events occurring in the absence of preexisting TCs. The analysis reveals that multiple TC events constitute a substantial fraction of all TC genesis events in the NATL (24%), EPAC (45%), and WPAC (33%). Moreover, a substantial fraction of preexisting TCs in the NATL (30%), EPAC (40%), and WPAC (23%) are clustered ~1000­–3000 km west of the TC genesis event during multiple TC events. With regards to the large-scale factors forcing multiple TC events, non-multiple TC event frequency does not exhibit sensitivity to either ENSO or MJO, while multiple TC events exhibit significant sensitivity to ENSO in the EPAC and NATL and MJO phase in the EPAC and WPAC. Composites of EPAC multiple TC events suggest significantly stronger basin-scale environmental preconditioning associated with the convectively active MJO several weeks prior to multiple TC events creating a more favorable environment for TC genesis compared to non-multiple TC events. In their totality, these results suggest remarkable similarity in the climatological multiple TC event frequency and location among basins, while suggesting that multiple TC events may be predictable weeks ahead of time given the occurrence of basin-scale environmental preconditioning prior to these events.",

On several orbits in this phase MMS observed large amplitude (10s of nT) Pc5 pulsations, typically around 5 to 7 Earth radii, near dawn. Because MMS was in a string-of-pearls configuration we could determine the phase velocity of the waves along the spacecraft separation vector. Preliminary analysis indicates that this was of the order 30-50 km/s, much larger than the spacecraft velocity. Furthermore, the waves are propagating tailwards. Given a nominal wave period of the order 5 minutes, the wavelength of the waves is around 2 Earth radii, assuming azimuthal propagation. This corresponds to an m-number of about 20. The waves used for this initial study were observed on several successive orbits during the recovery phase of the March 17, 2015 geomagnetic storm. We will present additional analysis of the properties of these ULF waves as observed during the MMS commissioning phase, during which time the spacecraft apogee migrated from dawn to dusk through the nightside.",

One of the challenges they face is a lack of site-specific temperature data in the headwaters streams that they are targeting for restoration activities. Previous work has shown that there is a strong relationship between air and stream temperature. In this study, we calculated weekly mean air-stream temperature relationships for Driftless region headwaters streams and used air temperature projections from a set of statistically-downscaled GCM models to model thermal metrics relevant to fish species suitability described by Lyons et al. (2009) for historical (1961-2000) and future (2046-2065) conditions. We then combined the stream temperature projections with a GIS analysis of physiographic and geologic features to attempt to develop a way of predicting ungaged headwaters streams in the region that are likely to be resilient to temperature increases due to climate change.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying the progradation of the Wax Lake Delta (WLD), a sub-delta of the Mississippi River Delta, can lend valuable insight into coastal land-building patterns. Previous studies of WLD progradation have relied on subaerially-exposed land for indicating delta extent, but an inherent problem with this method lies in the high variability of exposed land due to vegetative, hydrologic, and atmospheric fluctuations. By mapping water surface films observed in remote imagery which form streaklines along flow paths in the delta, we show that the shallow delta front flow patterns are relatively unaffected by short term water level changes and can be used to evaluate WLD progradation over time. Remotely sensed imagery from multiple sources (infrared aerial photography, SPOT, UAVSAR) spanning from 1988 to 2015 was used to map streaklines from which we calculate a flow direction divergence field across the delta. Measuring the translation of this field through time, such as areas containing extreme divergence values along the delta front, quantifies the progradation over the time elapsed. Preliminary measurements of WLD progradation were subdivided into the eastern, southern, and western thirds of the delta. The eastern third prograded at 110 ±20m/yr from 1988 – 1997, 100 ±40m/yr from 1997 - 2002, and then remained relatively constant to 2015. The southern third prograded at 130 ±20m/yr from 1988 - 1997, 200 ±40m/yr from 1997 - 2002, and remained relatively constant to 2015. The western third prograded at 130 ±30m/yr from 1988 - 1997, 220 ±60 m from 1997 - 2002, and then remained relatively constant from 2002 - 2015. Also of note is the retrogradation on the average of 700 ±400m observed from January to August, 1992 which we interpret as being caused by the impact of Hurricane Andrew. The streakline methodology of evaluating WLD progradation could provide new methods for analysis of land change in other deltas around the world.",

            "abstract": "More than half of Louisiana’s drinking water is dependent on groundwater, and extraction of these resources along with high oil and gas production has contributed to localized subsidence in many parts of New Orleans. This increases the vulnerability of levee failure during intense storms such as Hurricane Katrina in 2005, before which rapid subsidence had already been identified and contributed to the failing levees and catastrophic flooding. An interferogram containing airborne radar data from NASA’s UAVSAR was combined with local geographic information systems (GIS) data for 2009-12 to help identify the sources of subsidence and mask out unrelated features such as surface water. We have observed the highest vertical velocity rates at the NASA Michoud Assembly Facility (high water use) and Norco (high oil/gas production). Many other notable features such as the: Bonnet-Carre Spillway, MRGO canal, levee lines along the Lower 9th Ward and power plants, are also showing concerning rates of subsidence. Even new housing loads, soil type differences, and buried beach sands seem to have modest correlations with patterns seen in UAVSAR. Current hurricane protection and coastal restoration efforts still have not incorporated late 20th century water level and geodetic data into their projections. Using SAR interferometry and local GIS datasets, areas of subsidence can be identified in a more efficient and economical manner, especially for emergency response.",

            "abstract": "The geometry of a fault zone exerts a major control on earthquake source parameters. Observations previously compiled from multiple faults show that fault surface shape evolves with displacement but the specific processes driving fault evolution within a single fault zone and their influence on fault geometry are not well known. Here, we characterize the deformation history and geometry of an extraordinarily well-exposed fault using maps constructed with the Structure from Motion photogrammetric method. Crosscutting relations between multiple gouge-filled slip zones within the fault core define the evolution of the structures. The last slip zone to form in the fault is smoothest of any surface and is distinct from other surfaces, recording significant smoothing on a single structure. We infer that smoothing occurred abruptly due to localization of slip onto a new slip zone rather than as a result of progressive wear of a fault surface. However, when cross-sectional traces of contacts between different slip zones were partitioned based on the age of the slip event that last directly affected the contact, the evolution is scale dependent. At wavelengths less than 10 centimeters, the oldest layers are the smoothest indicating that re-roughening processes occur at short wavelengths during later slip events. Our observations show that scale-dependent wear is caused by processes such as grain plucking and asperity failure that re-roughened surfaces at scales smaller than the clast dimension and smoothed surfaces at scales larger than the clast dimension. The resulting clast aspect ratios record scale-dependent wear as longer clasts are more elongate. Furthermore, clasts do not exist above one meter in length, suggesting a transition in the rheology or processes affecting the surface. Together, these results demonstrate that net fault wear from immature and mature faults is the result of competing smoothing and re-roughening processes. The evolution of roughness and asperity size we observe can explain differences in the source characteristics of earthquakes as faults mature.",

JunoCam is a wide angle camera (58 deg field of view) with 4 color filters: red, green and blue (RGB) and methane at 889 nm.\nJuno’s elliptical polar orbit will offer unique views of Jupiter’s polar regions with a spatial scale of ~50 km/pixel. The polar vortex, polar cloud morphology, and winds will be investigated. RGB color mages of the aurora will be acquired. Stereo images and images taken with the methane filter will allow us to estimate cloudtop heights. Resolution exceeds that of Cassini about an hour from closest approach and at closest approach images will have a spatial scale of ~3 km/pixel.\nJunoCam is a push-frame imager on a rotating spacecraft. The use of time-delayed integration takes advantage of the spacecraft spin to build up signal. JunoCam will acquire limb-to-limb views of Jupiter during a spacecraft rotation, and has the possibility of acquiring images of the rings from in-between Jupiter and the inner edge of the rings. Galilean satellite views will be fairly distant but some images will be acquired. Small ring moons Metis and Adrastea will also be imaged.\nThe theme of our outreach is “science in a fish bowl”, with an invitation to the science community and the public to participate. Amateur astronomers will supply their ground-based images for planning, so that we can predict when prominent atmospheric features will be visible. With the aid of professional astronomers observing at infrared wavelengths, we’ll predict when hot spots will be visible to JunoCam. Amateur image processing enthusiasts are prepared to create image products.\nBetween the planning and products will be the decision-making on what images to take when and why. We invite our colleagues to propose science questions for JunoCam to address, and to be part of the participatory process of deciding how to use our resources and scientifically analyze the data.",

The database is used extensively for a variety of purposes, from earthquake source imaging, to magnetotelluric modeling.\nGaps in Slab1.0 exist where input data are sparse and/or where slabs are geometrically complex (and difficult to image with an automated approach). Slab1.0 also does not include information on the uncertainty in the modeled geometrical parameters, or the input data used to image them, and provides no means to reproduce the models it described.\nCurrently underway, Slab2 will update and replace Slab1.0 by: (1) extending modeled slab geometries to all global subduction zones; (2) incorporating regional data sets that may describe slab geometry in finer detail than do previously used teleseismic data; (3) providing information on the uncertainties in each modeled slab surface; (4) modifying our modeling approach to a fully-three dimensional data interpolation, rather than following the 2-D to 3-D steps of Slab1.0; (5) migrating the slab modeling code base to a more universally distributable language, Python; and (6) providing the code base and input data we use to create our models, such that the community can both reproduce the slab geometries, and add their own data sets to ours to further improve upon those models in the future.

            "abstract": "CaSiO3-perovskite (CaPv) is believed to be the third most abundant mineral (5 wt%) in the Earth’s lower mantle (LM). Subducted slabs contain 23 wt% CaPv at the LM related pressure (P) and temperature (T), where Al2O3 could be incorporated into the crystal structure of CaPv (AlCaPv). However, there remains important discrepancy between computations and experiments on the crystal structure of CaPv at high P and low T. Some computations have predicted a tetragonal I4/mcm structure with a pseudo-cubic axial ratio (cp/ap) greater than 1, while X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies have suggested a tetragonal P4/mmm structure with cp/ap ~ 0.995. Using Ne as a pressure medium, we conducted in-situ XRD of CaSiO3 and 5 wt% Al-bearing CaSiO3 in the laser heated diamond anvil cell at the GSECARS and HPCAT sectors of the Advanced Photon Source. Rietveld refinements are performed on the diffraction patterns of CaPv at 300 K and 20-60 GPa. Similar to previous studies, we observed splitting of the 200 and 211 peaks after T-quench in pure CaPv. However, unlike previous experiments, diffraction patterns were more consistent with a tetragonal I4/mcm structure with cp/ap ~ 1.005 than P4/mmm. All the previous diffraction patterns have been measured with an Ar or MgO medium, or even without a medium, while we used more hydrostatic Ne medium. Considering the small free energy differences among different perovskite structures, the crystal structure of CaPv may be very sensitive to non-hydrostatic stresses. In runs with AlCaPv, asymmetrical 200 peaks are found up to 60 GPa and 2200 K, showing that non-cubic could be still stable at mantle geotherm temperatures in AlCaPv. The extreme sensitivity of CaPv on deviatoric stresses may have important implications for the elastic properties of the mantle regions with strong deformations, because the elastic anisotropy can change with the crystal structure of CaPv.",

            "abstract": "During the recent solar minimum, a large amount of C/NOFS satellite measurements have revealed an upward drift that occurs during the post-midnight period (~2-3 LT). The upward drift is also frequently shown in radar measurements. The phenomenon has not yet been explained and the physics are still unknown. Our simulations have successfully reproduced the unusual upward drift using the coupled Whole Atmosphere Model and Global Ionosphere Plasmasphere Model (WAM/GIP). Model produces significant day-to-day variability in the nighttime equatorial ionosphere. Simulations also reveal strong seasonal and longitudinal dependence of the upward drift. Our analysis indicates that the upward drifts are driven by thermosphere dynamics associated with the midnight temperature maximum (MTM). The MTM locally reverses the typical large-scale zonal and meridional wind pattern, in turn affecting the nighttime F-layer electrodynamics. The longitudinal variation of the drifts depends on the magnitude and position of the MTM peak relative to the magnetic equator. In this talk, we will present the morphology and characteristics of the post-midnight upward drift shown in the simulations and explain its causal mechanism.",

However, with the ever-increasing length of the time-series, small random-walk noise component is being observed in the GNSS time-series. As Langbein (2012) recently has pointed out, a small random-walk noise component can have a significant effect on the estimated trend error and it is there important to quantify the magnitude of the random-walk noise. Maximum likelihood estimation methods are a popular choice to investigate the stochastic properties of the noise in GNSS time-series but have the disadvantage to be computational intensive and therefore rather slow. Bos et al. (2013) made advantage of symmetries present in the covariance matrices to speed up the analysis. However, this method only handles weakly non-stationary noise. Random walk is highly non-stationary and we have used another approach, based on auto-regressive noise models, to deal with this situation. The new method is also faster in most cases and it can deal with missing data in a convenient way.\nUsing synthetic data, we first demonstrate that random walk can be detected in data that also contains flicker and white noise. Finally, we apply our new method to data of a set of around 300 globally distributed GNSS stations to evaluate the improvement on the estimation of the uncertainties of the computed time-series.",

SMOS data provide the best currently available multi-year global soil moisture observations. The MPI-BGC product provides an observation-based benchmark for global GPP. This is an opportunity for terrestrial ecosystem science to bridge water and carbon cycles. SMOS data is used as a constraint to improve the model performance of soil moisture simulation. After the B parameter and hydraulic conductivity at saturation is modified in SSiB model, although it produces a better simulated soil moisture matching against the SMOS data, it results in a worse GPP match against MPI-BGC GPP product, which shows the changes in soil moisture have big impacts on vegetation processes, especially in semi-arid regions. To overcome the deterioration, we further adjust wilting points to adjust the soil moisture climatology. After the modification of wilting points, the simulated global soil moisture and GPP are both improved in the model. This study confirms the close relationship between soil moisture and terrestrial carbon processes and it is important to adequately include both processes to have a comprehensive understanding of water and carbon cycles. Forthcoming work will integrate SMAP soil moisture and fluorescence from GOSAT and OCO-2 as further constraints and coupling between the water and carbon cycles.",

Previous models of the threshold wind speed required for saltation initiation have assumed that the particle bed is monodisperse and homogeneous in arrangement, thereby ignoring what is in reality a distribution of particle lifting thresholds, influenced by variability in soil particle sizes and bed geometry. To help overcome this problem, we present a numerical model that determines the distribution of threshold wind speeds required for particle lifting for a given soil size distribution. The model results are evaluated against high frequency wind speed and saltation data from a recent field campaign in Oceano Dunes in Southern California. The results give us insight into the range of lifting thresholds present during incipient sediment transport and the simplifications that are often made to characterize the process. In addition, this study provides a framework for moving beyond the ‘fluid threshold’ paradigm, which is known to be inaccurate, especially for near-threshold conditions.",

Although these terms are relatively new to the world of research, Open Science and Data in this context may be described as transparency in the scientific process. This includes the discoverability, public accessibility and reusability of scientific data, as well as accessibility and transparency of scientific communication (\nwww.openscience.org\n). Scientists and the US government alike are realizing the critical need for easy discovery and access to multidisciplinary data to advance research in the geosciences.\nThe NSF-supported EarthCube project was created to meet this need. EarthCube is developing a community-driven common cyberinfrastructure for the purpose of accessing, integrating, analyzing, sharing and visualizing all forms of data and related resources through advanced technological and computational capabilities. Engaging the geoscience community in EarthCube’s development is crucial to its success, and EarthCube is providing several opportunities for geoscience involvement. This presentation will provide an overview of the activities EarthCube is employing to entrain the community in the development process, from governance development and strategic planning, to technical needs gathering. Particular focus will be given to the collection of science-driven use cases as a means of capturing scientific and technical requirements. Such activities inform the development of key technical and computational components that collectively will form a cyberinfrastructure to meet the research needs of the geoscience community.",

It is further marked by the early Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T−OAE), with possibly the largest exogenic carbon cycle perturbation of the Mesozoic and related perturbations in global geochemical cycles, climate and the environment, which are linked to large igneous province emplacement in the Karoo-Ferrar region (Jenkyns, 2010; Burgess et al., 2015). Furthermore, Early Jurassic continental rifting and the break-up of Pangaea and subsequent Early Jurassic opening of the Hispanic Corridor and Viking Strait respectively linked the equatorial Tethys Ocean to Eastern Panthalassa and the high-latitude Arctic Boreal realm. This initiated changes in (global) ocean currents and Earth’s heat distribution and ultimately was followed by the opening of the proto-North Atlantic (Porter et al., 2013; Korte et al., in review).\nHere, we present high-resolution (sub-precession scale) elemental concentration data from the Mochras borehole (UK), which represents ~1300m of possibly the most complete and expanded lower Jurassic hemi-pelagic marine sedimentary archive known. We construct a floating ~9 Myr astronomical time-scale for the complete Early Jurassic Pliensbachian stage and biozones. Combined with radiometric and astrochronological constraints on early Jurassic stage boundaries, we construct a new Early Jurassic Time-Scale. With this we assess the duration and rate of change of early Jurassic global carbon cycle and climatic perturbations and we asses fundamental changes in the nature and expression of Early Jurassic long (100 – 1000 kyr) eccentricity cycles.",

To some extent, the usefulness of these differences may depend upon the retentively of Li in zircon. Cherniak and Watson (2010) measured relatively high diffusivities for Li; here we sought to discover the scenarios under which Li mobility might be inhibited by charge compensating cations. We conducted \"in\" diffusion experiments in synthetic Lu-doped (~5000 ppm), P-doped (~250 ppm), and nearly pure zircon following the procedure in Cherniak and Watson (2010). In separate experiments, Li was ion implanted at depth within polished Mud Tank zircon slabs to form a Gaussian Li concentration profile; the relaxed concentration profile was measured after heating the zircon slabs. In all experiments, which ranged from 920 to 650 oC, calculated diffusivities were in agreement with a previously established Arrhenius relationship calibrated on trace element poor Mud Tank zircon (Cherniak and Watson, 2010). We also conducted complementary LA-ICP-MS mapping on the surfaces of P- and Lu-doped synthetic zircon crystals after the Li diffusion results were obtained. This revealed heterogeneous though patterned correlation between Li+Lu in the near surface of the crystal (no strong patterns emerged for P+Li). And finally, we observed that synthetic sector-zoned zircon exhibits near step function Li concentration profiles - correlating with changes in the rare earth element concentrations across these sectors - which allowed us to examine Li diffusion in yet another manner. Re-heating these grains followed by LA-ICP-MS analysis revealed significant Li migration, with no detectable migration of the rare earth elements. While our experiments cannot be considered exhaustive, we have yet to find a scenario where Li mobility in synthetic zircon depends on charge compensating cations.",

The objective of this research was to analyze the spatial resolution effects of different remote sensing images on soil prediction models in Kothapally, India. We utilized Bayesian kriging (BK) to characterize the spatial pattern of total nitrogen (TN) and exchangeable potassium (Kex) in the topsoil (0-15 cm) at different spatial resolutions by incorporating spectral indices from Landsat 8 (30m), RapidEye (5m) and WorldView-2/GeoEye-1 images (2m). The band ratio of red to green, red to blue and green to blue, Crust Index and Atmospherically Resistant Vegetation Index from multiple images generally had high linear correlations with TN and Kex. The BK model of TN based on WorldView-2 and GeoEye-1 attained the highest model fit (R2=0.41) and lowest prediction error (RMSE=171.35 mg kg-1) compared with the BK models of TN based on Landsat 8 (R2=0.30; RMSE=182.26 mg kg-1) and RapidEye (R2=0.28; RMSE=183.52 mg kg-1). The BK model of Kex based on Landsat 8 had the highest model fit (R2=0.55) and the second lowest prediction error (RMSE=79.57 mg kg-1) compared with the BK models of Kex based on WorldView-2 and GeoEye-1 (R2=0.52; RMSE=79.42 mg kg-1) and RapidEye (R2=0.47; RMSE=83.91 mg kg-1). The lowest prediction fit and highest prediction error of soil TN and Kex models based on RapidEye suggest that the effect of fine spatial remote sensing spectral data inputs do not always lead to an increase of model fit. Soil maps based on WorldView-2 and GeoEye-1 have significant advantages in characterizing the variation of soil TN and Kex spatial pattern in smallholder farm settings compared with coarser maps. This research suggests that Digital Soil Mapping utilizing remote sensing spectral data from WorldView-2 and GeoEye-1 has high potential to be widely applied in smallholder farm settings and help smallholder farmers manage their soils and attain soil security.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the nature of drought on timescales ranging from seasons to millennia is critical for water resource management, particularly in areas such as the southwest U.S. where water is scarce. Previous work in semiarid regions indicates that trace elements in speleothems can record hydrologic changes over time. Here we present a ~3500-year, high-resolution record of drought based on trace elements in a stalagmite from Fort Huachuca Cave, southern Arizona. Trace element concentrations (normalized to Ca) were measured via LA-ICP-MS at 10 μm resolution, with 10 measurements corresponding to approximately one year of stalagmite growth. Annual cycles are apparent in Sr, Ba, P, and Y, verified with 230Th dates taken at ~50-year increments. Ba and Sr covary strongly, and P and Y covary inversely to Ba and Sr. Based on published studies, and the independence of the processes governing these elements, we infer that Ba and Sr increase during dry intervals and P and Y during wet. The combination of these elements allows us to reconstruct past variations in drought and moisture. We compare our record of drought to the instrumental record of local precipitation as well as to tree-ring paleoclimate reconstructions in the Southwest. We propose that multi-elemental analysis of speleothems can be used as a measure of relative aridity that characterizes the multidecadal to multicentury variability of drought and helps to resolve ambiguities in the more commonly used oxygen isotopes. This new indicator for drought will contribute to a deeper understanding of the risk of prolonged and/or severe drought in the southwest U.S.",

            "abstract": "High salinity in the Rio Grande has led to severe reductions in crop productivity and accumulation of salts in soils. These pressing issues exist for other arid rivers worldwide. Salinity contributions to the Rio Grande have not been adequately quantified, especially from agriculture, urban activities, and geological sources. Here, we use major element concentrations and U, S, B, Sr isotopic signatures to fingerprint the salinity sources. Our study area focuses on a 200 km long stretch of the Rio Grande from Elephant Butte Reservoir, NM to El Paso, TX. River samples were collected monthly from 2014 to 2015. Irrigation drains, groundwater wells, city drains and wastewater effluents were sampled as possible anthropogenic salinity end-members.\nMajor element chemistry, U, S and Sr isotope ratios in the Rio Grande waters suggest multiple salinity inputs from geological, agricultural, and urban sources. Natural upwelling of groundwater is significant for the Rio Grande near Elephant Butte, as suggested by high TDS values and high (234U/238U), 87Sr/86Sr, δ34S ratios. Agricultural activities (e.g. flood irrigation, groundwater pumping, fertilizer use) are extensive in the Mesilla Valley. Rio Grande waters from this region have characteristic lower (234U/238U), 87Sr/86Sr, and δ34S ratios, with possible agricultural sources from use of fertilizers and gypsum. Agricultural practices during flood irrigation also intensify evaporation of Rio Grande surface water and considerably increase water salinity. Shallow groundwater signatures were also identified at several river locations, possibly due to the artificial pumping of local groundwater for irrigation. Impacts of urban activities to river chemistry (high NO3 and B concentrations) were evident for locations downstream to Las Cruces and El Paso wastewater treatment plants, supporting the use of the B isotope as an urban salinity tracer. This study improves our understanding of human impacts on water quality and elemental cycles.",

            "abstract": "Planetary differentiation occurred at high temperature and varying oxygen fugacity, on bodies with varying compositions and internal pressures. The specific conditions at which bodies differentiated and the chemical fingerprints left by differentiation can be investigated by measuring stable isotope ratios in natural samples. Much can be learned by combining those data with experiments that systematically investigate the chemical and physical conditions within differentiating bodies. In this talk we focus on one variable in particular that has not been well defined with respect to stable isotope fractionation: pressure. We will present new iron isotope data on how pressure affects isotope fractionation factors for a number of iron compounds relative to silicate.\nThe processes governing iron isotope fractionation in igneous rocks have been debated extensively over the past decade. Analyses of natural samples show that iron isotopes are fractionated at both the whole rock and mineral scales. This fractionation has been interpreted to be a result of several processes including a possible signature of high pressure core formation. We have collected new high pressure synchrotron nuclear resonant inelastic x-ray scattering data from Sector 16-ID-D at the Advanced Photon Source on 57Fe enriched Fe, FeO, FeHx and Fe3C. Our data show clear trends with pressure implying that not only does pressure have an effect on the iron isotope beta factors but also a fractionation amongst the alloys. This suggests that depending on the light element in the core, there will be a different resulting signature in the iron isotope record. We will discuss the likelihood of different light elements in the core based on these results, as well as the theoretical predictions for the same phases. Finally, we will present the fractionation expected between metal and silicate at high pressure and high temperature in order to determine if core formation would indeed leave an isotopic signature in the natural rock record.",

            "abstract": "Soil sodicity is characterized by a high relative amount of sodium cations in the soil, usually measured by the sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) or by the exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP). It negatively affects the soil’s physical properties, causing slaking, swelling, and dispersion of clay, which lead to decreased hydraulic conductivity and infiltration rate. Soil sodicity is especially problematic in arid and semi-arid regions, where low-quality waters, such as treated wastewater or sodic/saline groundwater, are often used to meet agricultural demands.\nThe dynamics of sodicity in the soil is intertwined with that of salinity, i.e., the total concentration of salt in the soil, and the soil water balance. We present a model for the coupled dynamics of relative soil water content s, salinity C, and sodicity ESP and investigate the effects of irrigation with water of good and bad quality on the soil. We explicitly account for the major feedback on the soil moisture dynamics due to decreased saturated hydraulic conductivity at low values of C and for high values of ESP, and show that it leads to a bifurcation of steady-state solutions along a control parameter axis (irrigation rate, SAR of irrigation water, etc).\nWe study theoretically such bifurcations, which are related to a runaway sodification process, and determine the conditions in which there is an irreversible soil degradation and the time scales associated with it. Finally, we discuss different soil remediation strategies based on the optimal control theory applied to the proposed system for the coupled water, salinity and sodicy dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Improving predictive capabilities of solute transport through stream systems requires meaningful comparison of dominant transport controls across different discharge conditions and spatial scales. While in-stream tracer tests are commonly used to assess transport behavior at reach scales (e.g., transient storage and dispersion), a main challenge is to separate the controls from the timescale represented in the recovered tracer response that primarily varies with discharge and reach length. We repeated conservative solute tracer tests along a 1-km study reach during a storm event and its recession to generate a suite of timescales and test how discharge and reach length selection affect the interpretation of transport processes. We set out to examine how physical transport processes change with discharge, how individual segments within the continuous study reach respond differently to discharge, and determine whether combining segments into longer study reaches produces a different interpretation of processes. We found that the temporal metrics of the recovered in-stream tracer responses were mostly insensitive to changing discharge and most segments did not respond differently even though morphologic characteristics between segments were distinct. However, segment length selection did influence the interpretation of transport processes. These results suggest that advection was the primary control reflected in the observations, which muted process change with discharge and the influence of spatial heterogeneity. This study indicates that the influence of advection on the tracer timescale must be considered before such reach scale observations can be used to infer transport controls at larger network scales.",

            "abstract": "Vent 7504 is a complex structure in the SFVF that has 3 unit classes: a central cone with exposed dikes and cinder-covered rheomorphic facies; a SE/NW-trending ridge north of the cone with cinder-covered rheomorphic facies; and three discrete lava flows that emanate to the N from the ridge and to the SW and NW from the cone. Field observations suggest the ridge was the northern crest of an initial, larger cone. The NW portion of this cone was most likely disrupted during a catastrophic breach of lava that had accumulated within the cone; this third of three lava flows carried rafted packages of the rheomorphic cone facies to the NW, forming the linear N ridge. The final phase of pyroclastic activity was concentrated in the SW portion of the original cone, covering the top of the cone with cinders and forming the more traditional conic-shaped construct observed today. This study describes the geochemistry of 9 samples collected from the mapped units (2 from the cone, 1 from the N ridge, 1 from the N lava flow, 2 from the SW lava flow, and 3 from the NW lava flow) to further constrain the formation of Vent 7504.\nGeochemical analyses including back-scatter electron scanning electron microscopy and laboratory X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy were conducted on the 9 collected samples to measure bulk rock and olivine phenocryst compositions. Major element concentrations in the bulk rock and olivine compositions are strongly clustered in all samples, indicating they likely originated from a single magmatic source. Bulk rock SiO2 (~47.5 wt%) and alkali (Na2O + K2O, ~2.7 wt% + 0.71 wt%) concentrations are consistent with a basaltic classification for these samples. Trends in major elements relative to MgO are observed for the olivine phenocrysts: SiO2, Al2O3, Na2O, and TiO2 remain constant relative to MgO, but strong linear trends are observed in MnO, FeO, and NiO relative to MgO. These linear trends are expected given the potential for bivalent cation exchanges in the olivine crystal structure. The linear trends noted for the two SW lava flow samples show evidence for fractionation within the flow: samples with high MgO, NiO and low FeO, MnO contents occur close to the vent, whereas samples with low MgO, NiO and high FeO, MnO contents occur far from the vent. A similar trend is seen for the NW flow. Implications for cone formation will be discussed.",

The DMA components and capabilities are driven by the project science priorities and the development is based on agile development techniques. The goal of the DMA software platform is to enable users to integrate and synthesize diverse and disparate field, laboratory, and simulation datasets, including geological, geochemical, geophysical, microbiological, hydrological, and meteorological data across a range of spatial and temporal scales.\nThe DMA objectives are (a) developing an integrated interface to the datasets, (b) storing field monitoring data, laboratory analytical results of water and sediments samples collected into a database, (c) providing automated QA/QC analysis of data and (d) working with data providers to modify high-priority field and laboratory data collection and reporting procedures as needed. The first three objectives are driven by user needs, while the last objective is driven by data management needs.\nThe project needs and priorities are reassessed regularly with the users. After each user session we identify development priorities to match the identified user priorities. For instance, data QA/QC and collection activities have focused on the data and products needed for on-going scientific analyses (e.g. water level and geochemistry). We have also developed, tested and released a broker and portal that integrates diverse datasets from two different databases used for curation of project data. The development of the user interface was based on a user-centered design process involving several user interviews and constant interaction with data providers. The initial version focuses on the most requested feature – i.e. finding the data needed for analyses through an intuitive interface. Once the data is found, the user can immediately plot and download data through the portal. The resulting product has an interface that is more intuitive and presents the highest priority datasets that are needed by the users.\nOur agile approach has enabled us to build a system that is keeping pace with the science needs while utilizing limited resources.",

We apply the Matched Field Processing (MFP) seismic imaging technique to detect new seismic events using known discrete microearthquake sources. Events identified using MFP typically have smaller magnitudes or occur within the coda of a larger event. Additionally, we apply a Bayesian multiple-event location algorithm, called MicroBayesLoc, to estimate the 95% probability ellipsoids for events with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Such probability ellipsoid information can provide evidence for determining if a seismic lineation is real, or simply within the anticipated error range. At the Newberry EGS site, 235 events were reported in the original catalog. MFP identified 164 additional events (an increase of over 70% more events). For the relocated events in the Newberry catalog, we can distinguish two distinct seismic swarms that fall outside of one another’s 95% probability error ellipsoids.\nThis work performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.",

An important source of this uncertainty derives from the difficulty in predicting BC’s global abundance and vertical distribution. Here we present a multi-year record of black carbon (BC) vertical concentration profiles from both sides of the Atlantic, obtained from airborne Single Particle Soot Photometers (SP2s) flown on the NASA DC-8, and the DLR Falcon research aircraft from the CONCERT, ACCESS, DC3, SEAC4RS, and SALTRACE campaigns. The measurements constrain the relative rates of BC transport/removal from, and zonal mixing in, the upper troposphere, as well as the range of BC loadings in these regions. They also constrain the time-rates of change of BC loads in altitudes at which it is a highly efficient (although sparse) climate forcer, and a relatively long-lived aerosol tracer. We find that concentration of BC in the upper troposphere can vary by a factor 10. Over the Northern mid-latitudes concentrations are however consistent to a fraction of this range over wide longitudinal ranges, over month-long timescales. The data show that BC becomes zonally mixed here starting at 500 hPa and extending to near the tropopause. These results imply broader value than previously associated with measured vertical profiles in constraining global scale BC loadings aloft.",

Here we present details of model design and parameter sensitivity analysis.\nWe prepare model setup by modeling subduction process for several millions of years, with the different assumptions for initial lithospheric structure and temperature of the overriding and subducting plates and kinematic boundary conditions. As a result we obtain the subduction model with appropriate geometry and stress distribution. We then substitute static friction at the plate interface by rate and state friction law and employ adaptive time-step integration procedure that varies time step from 10-6 year at instability (earthquake), and gradually increases it to 5 years during postseismic relaxation.\nWe study sensitivity of model in 2D to the magnitude of static friction, rate and state parameters (a, b and Lc) and viscosity in subduction channel and demonstrate agreement with theoretical expectations and observations. In particular we obtain almost linear relation between the earthquake period and stress drop from one hand and the rate and state parameter (b-a) from another, and realistic values of stress drop of few MPa for the typical great earthquakes. The model also shows classic instable behavior at low Lc (<10-20 cm) and conditionally stable behavior at high Lc (>20-25 cm).\nNext we investigate dependency of seismic moment (and average slip) of model earthquake on rupture area in 3D. We obtain relations close to the theoretical expectation for the average stress drop of earthquake weakly dependent from its magnitude.\nFinally we show consistency of our modelling results with observed surface deformation during Great Tohoku Earthquake of 2011 at day to 1 year time scale.",

The development of operational systems for high resolution soil moisture estimation will create opportunities for improved drought monitoring, flood forecasting, agricultural management, and wildfire preparedness, as well as for calibration and validation of soil moisture satellites. We are working to develop such an estimation system by merging multiple information sources including: a statewide, mesoscale network (the Oklahoma Mesonet), a cosmic-ray neutron rover, high resolution land cover data, and a proven soil water balance model.

The surface radiative fluxes calculated within 2BFLX represent an important advance because unlike top-of-atmosphere (TOA) fluxes, surface radiative fluxes cannot be directly measured by satellite, yet directly impact surface heating, sea ice melt, and ice sheet mass balance. In this presentation, we will highlight the influence of supercooled liquid on polar surface radiation budgets constrained within 2BFLX data.

Initial geostrophic velocities are adjusted to velocities from the LADCP data to estimate an initial velocity at the reference layer. Final reference velocities and consequently circulation is estimated from an inverse box model applied to an ocean divided into 12 neutral density layers. This allows us to evaluate mass fluxes consistent with the thermal wind equation and mass conservation. Ekman transport derived from the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is added to the first layer and adjusted with the inverse model. The Canary Current (CC) transports southward a net mass of 3.8±0.7 Sv (1 Sv=106 m3/s≈109 kg/s) of North Atlantic Central Water (NACW) at the thermocline layers (~0-700 m) and 1.9±0.6 Sv of a mixture of Mediterranean Water (MW) and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) at intermediate layers (~800-1400 m). The CC recirculates northward at a rate of 4.8±0.8 Sv at the thermocline layers between the Lanzarote Island and the African coast (Lanzarote Passage) on this occasion.

Ar-Ar_Redux is a new data reduction protocol and software program for 40Ar/39Ar geochronology which takes into account two previously underappreciated aspects of the method:\n1. 40Ar/39Ar measurements are compositional data\nIn its simplest form, the 40Ar/39Ar age equation can be written as:\nt = log(1+J [40Ar/39Ar-298.5636Ar/39Ar])/λ = log(1 + JR)/λ\nWhere λ is the 40K decay constant and J is the irradiation parameter. The age t does not depend on the absolute abundances of the three argon isotopes but only on their relative ratios. Thus, the 36Ar, 39Ar and 40Ar abundances can be normalised to unity and plotted on a ternary diagram or 'simplex'. Argon isotopic data are therefore subject to the peculiar mathematics of 'compositional data', sensu Aitchison (1986, The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data, Chapman & Hall).\n2. Correlated errors are pervasive throughout the 40Ar/39Ar method\nCurrent data reduction protocols for 40Ar/39Ar geochronology propagate the age uncertainty as follows:\nσ2(t) = [J2 σ2(R) + R2 σ2(J)] / [λ2 (1 + R J)],\nwhich implies zero covariance between R and J. In reality, however, significant error correlations are found in every step of the 40Ar/39Ar data acquisition and processing, in both single and multi collector instruments, during blank, interference and decay corrections, age calculation etc.\nAr-Ar_Redux revisits every aspect of the 40Ar/39Ar method by casting the raw mass spectrometer data into a contingency table of logratios, which automatically keeps track of all covariances in a compositional context. Application of the method to real data reveals strong correlations (r2 of up to 0.9) between age measurements within a single irradiation batch. Propertly taking into account these correlations significantly improves the precision and accuracy of 40Ar/39Ar data, at no financial cost. A prototype version of Ar-Ar_Redux was written in R and is available from http://redux.london-geochron.com. A standalone GUI is under development.",

Low level Arctic clouds have great influence on surface radiation budget that changes the sea ice cover, and are in turn affected by the surface conditions related to sea ice coverage. This study seeks to understand the physical processes that drive the responses of Arctic low cloud properties to different sea ice cover using Large Eddy Simulations. The simulations are conducted for two different environmental conditions derived from the observational data during Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean Experiment (SHEBA) and Mixed-Phase Arctic Cloud Experiment (M-PACE) respectively. M-PACE environment is set above open ocean, in contrast to the sea ice-covered surface of SHEBA, with higher temperature and humidity in the atmosphere boundary layer than SHEBA. For either environmental condition, the simulations are conducted under constant large scale forcing with prescribed sea ice cover from 0 to 100% in 10% interval. The deviations from the reference simulations (100% sea ice for SHEBA and 0% sea ice for M-PACE) reflect the changes in boundary layer and cloud properties due to the variability in local sea ice cover. The cloud response to the increase(decrease) of surface fluxes due to the exposing(covering) of ocean surface and the changes of surface radiation are examined. The separate roles of boundary layer temperature and humidity change in the cloud response to the surface are further investigated.",

One difficulty in linking the propagation of detected radiation between these regions is the presence of stop bands near the heavy ion cyclotron resonance locations. Recent full wave calculations (Kim and Johnson, Full wave modeling of EMIC waves in the Earth’s magnetosphere, 2015 AGU fall meeting) demonstrate how EMIC waves propagate to higher magnetic latitudes in an electron-proton-He+ plasma. However, while the heavy ion concentration can be large during the solar maximum and geomagnetic storms, they adopted a 5% He+ plasma. In this study, we explore the roles of heavy ion (He+ and O+) concentrations on the levels of EMIC wave energy that reach lower altitudes using a two-dimensional, finite element, full wave model. The Poynting flux and polarization of the emissions are used to monitor the propagation and absorption of wave energy, as well as mode coupling between left- and right-hand circularly polarized modes. Due to the increase in heavy ion populations in the magnetosphere, the consequences that geomagnetic storms have on EMIC wave propagation are also discussed.",

Fluids, 2008). The model terms are derived from the Navier-Stokes equations, including a potential term that can be predicted for arbitrary topography of the system. The model has previously described several dynamical modes of a convection roll, such as cessation, meandering, and internal oscillations, in turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection, i.e. a fluid heated from below. Here we test a model prediction for the existence of a new mode where the convection roll stochastically changes direction to align with different diagonals of a cubic container. The model successfully predicts the switching rate of the convection roll under various conditions. The success of the prediction of the switching mode demonstrates that a low-dimensional turbulent model can quantitatively predict the existence and properties of different dynamical states that result from boundary geometry. Since this methodology can in principle be applied to other turbulent flows, it has potential for the development of general, predictive, low-dimensional models for turbulence, and for various geophysical flows in different topography.",

DNB achieves this large dynamic range by having three gain stages: low gain (LGS), mid gain (MGS), and high gain (HGS). HGS is the average of two redundant detector arrays, HGA and HGB. The HGS offset determination is critically important to improve the imagery capability and calibration accuracy and stability at novel low radiances. Currently, the dark offset is determined on a monthly basis by observing new moon data in the dark regions in the Pacific Ocean. The data is mainly comprised of detector dark current, electronic/clock offsets, artificial illumination sources, and nighttime airglow contamination. The first two are instrument phenomena/characterizations and the last two are scene contaminations.\nIn this presentation, we discuss the long-term growth in offset with short-term fluctuations we have captured since the beginning of the mission. We associate the long-term growth with dark current increase. We show that the offset rate of change over time is proportional to the number of Charge Coupled Device (CCD) elements aggregated to comprise a DNB pixel. We compare offset growth rate from new moon data in the dark ocean and that from calibration sector data at the same time; which contain very limited scene contaminations. We associate the short-term variability in offset growth with airglow effects that survive the filtering process used to derive the offsets from dark ocean data. These spurious offset fluctuations are removed from the offset LUTs via long time scale smoothing of the offsets. The remaining persistent time average contribution due to airglow can be estimated by comparison of the pitch maneuver propagated offsets determined from deep space scans early in the mission and the offsets determined from the dark regions in the Pacific Ocean.",

Thus, accurate and timely forecasts of its production are critical for informing agricultural policies and investments, as well as increasing market efficiency and stability. Becker-Reshef et al. (2010) used an empirical generalized model for forecasting winter wheat production using combined BRDF-corrected daily surface reflectance from the Moderate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Climate Modeling Grid (CMG) with detailed official crop statistics and crop type masks. It is based on the relationship between the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at the peak of the growing season, percent wheat within the CMG pixel, and the final yields. This method predicts the yield approximately one month to six weeks prior to harvest. Recently, Franch et al. (2015) included Growing Degree Day (GDD) information extracted from NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data in order to improve the winter wheat production forecast by increasing the timeliness of the forecasts between a month to a month and a half prior to the peak NDVI (i.e. 1-2.5 months prior to harvest), while conserving the accuracy of the original model.\nIn this study, we apply these methods to historical data from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR). We apply both the original and the modified model to United States of America from 1990 to 2014 and inter-compare the AVHRR results to MODIS from 2000 to 2014.",

            "abstract": "Effective radiative forcing (ERF) is calculated as the flux change at the top of the atmosphere, after allowing fast adjustments, due to a forcing agent such as greenhouse gasses or volcanic events. Accurate estimates of the ERF are necessary in order to understand the drivers of climate change. ERF cannot be observed directly and is difficult to estimate from indirect observations due to the complexity of climate responses to individual forcing factors. We present a new method of calculating ERF using a kernel populated from a time series of a model variable (e.g. global mean surface temperature) in a CO2 step change experiment. The top of atmosphere (TOA) radiative imbalance has the best noise tolerance for retrieving the ERF of the model variables we tested. We compare the kernel method with the energy balance method for estimating ERF in the CMIP5 models. The energy balance method uses the regression between the TOA imbalance and temperature change in a CO2 step change experiment to estimate the climate feedback parameter. It then assumes the feedback parameter is constant to calculate the forcing time series. This method is sensitive to the number of years chosen for the regression and the nonlinearity in the regression leads to a bias. We quantify the sensitivities and biases of these methods and compare their estimates of forcing. The kernel method is more accurate for models in which a linear fit is a poor approximation for the relationship between temperature change and TOA imbalance.",

HLs are being used to construct spatially distributed assessments of variability in streamflow and climatic response in Oregon, Alaska, and the Pacific Northwest. HLs are currently being applied across the Western U.S. to assess historic and projected climatic impacts. During the HL classification process, we analyze climate, seasonality, aquifer permeability, terrain, and soil permeability as the primary hydrologic drivers (and precipitation intensity as a secondary driver) associated with large scale hydrologic processes (storage, conveyance, and flow of water into or out of the watershed) in the West. Hypotheses regarding the dominant hydrologic pathways derived from the HL classification system are tested to corroborate or falsify these assumptions. Changes in climate are more likely to affect certain hydrogeologic parameters than others. For instance, changes in climate may result in changes in the magnitude, timing, or type of precipitation (snow vs. rain). Air temperature and the seasonality of dominant hydrologic processes may also be impacted. However, the effect of these changes on streamflow will depend on soil and aquifer permeability. In this analysis, we summarize (1) the HL classification methodology and (2) the use of historic (1900-present) PRISM climate data and climate projections to assess how changes in climate affect hydrologic processes and their associated impacts (e.g. water resource availability, ecological impacts, etc.) in the Western U.S.",

Every year during the post harvest months of April-May and October-November, large scale open burning of wheat straw and paddy straw occurs in the region impairing the regional air quality and resulting in air pollution episodes. Here, using online in-situ measurements from the IISER Mohali Atmospheric Chemistry Facility (Sinha et al., Atmos Chem Phys, 2014), which is located at a regionally representative suburban site in the agricultural state of Punjab, India, we investigated the effects of this activity on gas phase chemistry. The online data pertaining to the pre harvest and post harvest paddy residue fires in 2012, 2013 and 2014 were analyzed to understand the effect of this anthropogenic activity on atmospheric chemistry and regional air quality with respect to health relevant VOCs such as benzenoids and isocyanic acid and trace gases such as ozone and carbon monoxide. These compounds showed marked increases (factor of 2-3 times higher) in their concentrations which correlated with the biomass combustion tracers such as acetonitrile. Emissions from the paddy residue fires did not result in significant enhancement of ambient ozone in 2012 but instead sustained hourly daytime ozone concentrations at ~ 50 ppb during the late post monsoon season, despite decreases in solar radiation and temperature. Results of such massive perturbations to ambient chemical composition, reactivity and formation of secondary pollutants and its implications for human health will be presented in this paper.",

            "abstract": "U60 is a uranyl peroxide nano-cage that adopts a highly symmetric fullerene topology; it is topologically identical to C60. Several studies on the aqueous-phase of U60 clusters, [UO2(O2)(OH)]6060-, have shown its persistence in complex solutions and over lengthy time scales. Peroxide enhances corrosion of nuclear fuel in a reactor accident-uranyl peroxides often form near contaminated sites. U60 (Fm-3) crystallizes with approximate formula: Li68K12(OH)20[UO2(O2)(OH)]60(H2O)310. Here, we have used the diamond anvil cell (DAC) to examine U60 to understand the stability of this cluster at high pressures. We used a symmetric DAC with 300 μm culet diamonds and two different pressure-transmitting media: a mixture of methanol+ethanol and silicone oil. Using a combination of in situ Raman spectroscopy and synchrotron XRD, and electrospray ionization mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS) ex situ, we have determined the pressure-induced evolution of U60. Crystalline U60 undergoes an irreversible phase transition to a tetragonal structure at 4.1 GPa, and irreversibly amorphizes at 13 GPa. The amorphous phase likely consists of clusters of U60. Above 15 GPa, the U60 cluster is irreversibly destroyed. ESI-MS shows that this phase consists of species that likely have between 10-20 uranium atoms. Raman spectroscopy complements the diffraction measurements. U60 shows two dominant vibrational modes: a symmetric stretch of the uranyl U-O triple bond (810 cm-1), and a symmetric stretch of the U-O2-U peroxide bond (820 cm-1). As pressure is increased, these modes shift to higher wavenumbers, and overlap at 4 GPa. At 15 GPa, their intensity decreases below detection. These experiments reveal several novel behaviors including a new phase of U60. Notably, the amorphization of U60 occurs before the collapse of its cluster topology. This is different from the behavior of solvated C60 at high pressure, which maintains a hcp structure up to 30 GPa, while the clusters disorder. These results suggest that uranyl peroxide nano-cage clusters are persistent once formed, regardless of the state of the cluster: crystalline, amorphous, or in solution. These results add to the body of evidence suggesting that uranyl peroxides are important compounds to consider when dealing with environmental impacts of nuclear waste contamination.",

            "abstract": "Precipitation plays a key role in the earth’s climate system, particularly in the aspect of its water and energy balance. Satellite microwave (MW) observations of precipitation provide a viable mean to achieve global measurement of precipitation with sufficient sampling density and accuracy. However, accurate precipitation information over land from satellite MW is a challenging problem.\nThe Goddard Profiling Algorithm (GPROF) algorithm for the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) is built around the Bayesian formulation (Evans et al., 1995; Kummerow et al., 1996). GPROF uses the likelihood function and the prior probability distribution function to calculate the expected value of precipitation rate, given the observed brightness temperatures. It is particularly convenient to draw samples from a prior PDF from a predefined database of observations or models. GPROF algorithm does not search all database entries but only the subset thought to correspond to the actual observation. The GPM GPROF V1 database focuses on stratification by surface emissivity class, land surface temperature and total precipitable water. However, there is much uncertainty as to what is the optimal information needed to subset the database for different conditions. To this end, we conduct a database stratification study of using National Mosaic and Multi-Sensor Quantitative Precipitation Estimation, Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) and Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) and reanalysis data from Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA).\nOur database study (You et al., 2015) shows that environmental factors such as surface elevation, relative humidity, and storm vertical structure and height, and ice thickness can help in stratifying a single large database to smaller and more homogeneous subsets, in which the surface condition and precipitation vertical profiles are similar. It is found that the probability of detection (POD) increases about 8% and 12% by using stratified databases for rainfall and snowfall detection, respectively. In addition, by considering the relative humidity at lower troposphere and the vertical velocity at 700 hPa in the precipitation detection process, the POD for snowfall detection is further increased by 20.4% from 56.0% to 76.4%.",

            "abstract": "Despite recent advances in the use of ‘Structure-from-Motion’ (SfM) photogrammetry to accurately map landforms, its utility for reliably detecting and monitoring geomorphic change from repeat surveys remains underexplored in fluvial environments. It is unclear how the combination of various image acquisition platforms and techniques, survey scales, vegetation cover, and terrain complexities translate into accuracy and precision metrics for SfM-based construction of digital elevation models (DEMs) of fluvial landforms. Although unmanned aerial vehicles offer the potential to rapidly image large areas, they can be relatively costly, require skilled operators, are vulnerable in adverse weather conditions, and often rely on GPS-positioning to improve their stability. This research details image acquisition techniques for an underrepresented SfM platform: the pole-mounted camera. We highlight image acquisition and post-processing limitations of the SfM method for alluvial sandbars (10s to 100s m2) located in Marble and Grand Canyons in a remote, fluvial landscape with limited field access, strong light gradients, highly variable surface texture and limited ground control. We recommend a pole-based SfM protocol and evaluate it by comparing SfM-derived DEMs against concurrent, total station surveys and TLS derived DEMs. Error models of the sandbar surfaces are developed for a variety of surface characteristics (e.g., bare sand, steep slopes, and areas of shadow). The Geomorphic Change Detection (GCD) Software is used to compare SfM DEMs from before and after the 2014 high flow release from Glen Canyon Dam. Complementing existing total-station based sandbar surveys with potentially more efficient and cost-effective SfM methods will contribute to the understanding of morphodynamic responses of sandbars to high flow releases from Glen Canyon Dam. In addition, the development and implementation of a SfM-based operational protocol for monitoring geomorphic change will provide a methodological foundation for extending the approach to other fluvial environments.",

On 22-23 June, an especially active plasma sheet was involved in a major geospace storm that developed a ring current with 200 nT DST. We report on the ion kinetic and flow features of this active plasma sheet, comparing them with familiar observations from earlier missions, as an exercise in validating the MMS observations and assessing their capabilities to provide higher time resolution in multi-point views of thin, fast-moving structures. The observed features include but are not limited to cold lobal wind streams in the lobes, tailward flowing auroral beams and conics, hot earthward field-aligned flows and counter-flows, fast cross-field convection of some flows toward the neutral sheet, and the hot isotropic plasma sheet proper. Relationships between these features, the ionosphere, and the reconnecting magnetotail will be explored and discussed, seeking preliminary conclusions.",

            "abstract": "Fractured sedimentary bedrock aquifers represent an important source of water for many communities around the world. Although the effective porosities of these aquifers are extremely low relative to their unconsolidated counterparts, the existence of dense networks of interconnected fractures, dissolution-enhanced conduits or karst features can result in productive, yet heterogeneous and anisotropic, flow systems. Fluid-filled fractures remain connected to the porous matrix through advective-diffusive processes. This dual porosity concept is routinely applied to groundwater resource and contaminant transport studies; however, they have only recently been examined in shallow hyporheic environments, where groundwater and surface water influence one another through water and solute exchange across a streambed. Needless to say, there remains a gap in our conceptual understanding of hyporheic zones along rivers where water flowing through high-permeability fracture networks variably interacts with porewater residing in the low-permeability matrix. It is hypothesized that bedrock rivers will possess some measure of a hyporheic zone, albeit one that is governed by a vertical/horizontal fracture network but remains connected to the porous matrix. Hydrogeophysical methods provide a non-invasive means of assessing the scale and variability of critical zone dynamics. Here, we focus on the capacity of surface electrical resistivity for the detection and monitoring of a seasonally variable hyporheic zone at a field station located along the Eramosa River near Guelph, Ontario, Canada. Unlike conventional hydrogeological methods which potentially bias conduction in the fractures, surface resistivity is sensitive to the bulk electrical conductivity of the formation, making it more suited for detection of matrix conditions. Electrical resistivity data was collected along two 50 m profiles along a pool-riffle sequence on a daily to weekly interval from July 2014 to July 2015 and included a complete freeze-thaw cycle of the river. Continuous surface water and groundwater temperature, pressure and specific conductance was collected to support geophysical interpretations.",

            "abstract": "Crucial insight into the relationship between oceanic heat transport and deep-water circulation can be gained from paleoceanographic investigations of past warm climates. Sediment sequences recovered by four decades of international scientific ocean drilling provide abundant evidence that the climate during the Paleogene (40-65 Ma) was characterized by greenhouse warmth and atmospheric CO2 in excess of ~1000ppm. Reconstructions of deep-water, or the overturning, circulation during this interval indicates a fundamentally different mode from the modern. During the Paleogene mode of circulation separate deep-water convection in each basin is indicated. This mode persisted at least into the early Neogene, the exact timing of when the mode of circulation transitioned from having very distinct and separate circulations, to having one global overturning circulation is unknown. In order to identify when this shift occurred, the connection between the transition in circulation and climate must be better understood.\nNeodymium (Nd) isotopes are one of the most robust proxies of ancient water mass composition, acquiring their isotopic fingerprint in the region where they sink. The fossil fish teeth and bones record the Nd isotopic signature of the water mass at the sea floor and therefore create a stratigraphic record of fish teeth Nd at a given site, giving a temporal record of the water mass composition at that location. IODP Site U1438 is ideally positioned at a deep-water depth in the Northwest Pacific to capture the record of deep-water sourced from the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean. With the expected loss of bipolar convection in the Pacific as the mode shift occurs there will be a manifestation in εNd values as a divergence between the deep-water sites compared to the shallower sites. Preliminary data shows that there is indeed a shift to more unradiogenic values as time progressed closer to the modern (-4.9 εNd at 13 Ma to -2.6 εNd at 12 Ma). This indicates a divergence of the εNd signature and the influence of a less radiogenic source being introduced, such as Southern Ocean bottom water.",

            "abstract": "Warming of tundra ecosystems due to climate change is predicted to thaw permafrost and increase plant biomass and litter input to soil. Additional input of easily decomposable carbon can alter microbial activity by providing a much needed energy source, thereby accelerating soil organic matter decomposition. This phenomenon, known as the priming effect, can increase CO2 flux from soil to the atmosphere. However, the extent to which this mechanism can decrease soil carbon stocks in the Arctic is unknown. This project assessed priming effects on permafrost soil collected from a moist acidic tundra site in Healy, Alaska. We hypothesized that priming would increase microbial activity by providing microbes with a fresh source of carbon, thereby increasing decomposition of old and slowly decomposing carbon. Soil from surface and deep layers were amended with multiple pulses of uniformly 13C labeled glucose and cellulose, and samples were incubated at 15° C to quantify whether labile substrate addition increased carbon mineralization. We quantified the proportion of old carbon mineralization by measuring 14CO2. Data shows that substrate addition resulted in higher respiration rates in amended soils; however, priming was only observed in deep layers, where 30% more soil-derived carbon was respired compared to control samples. This suggests that microbes in deep layers are limited in energy, and the addition of labile carbon increases native soil organic matter decomposition, especially in soil with greater fractions of slowly decomposing carbon. Priming in permafrost could exacerbate the effects of climate change by increasing mineralization rates of carbon accumulated over the long-term in deep layers. Therefore, quantifying priming effect in permafrost soils is imperative to understanding the dynamics of carbon turnover in a warmer world.",

It is populated with linked or fully coupled models that address nutrient research questions such as, “How might future policy, climate or land cover change in the Mississippi River Basin affect Nitrogen and Phosphorous loadings to the Gulf of Mexico” or, “What are the management implications of regional-scale land management changes for the sustainability of air, land and water quality?” This second question requires explicit consideration of economic (e.g. sector prices) and societal (e.g. land management) factors. Metrics that illustrate biosphere-atmosphere interactions such as atmospheric PM2.5 concentrations, atmospheric N loading to surface water, soil organic N and N percolation to groundwater are calculated. An example application has been completed that is driven by a coupled agricultural and energy sector model scenario. The economic scenario assumes that by 2022 there is: 1) no detectable change in weather patterns relative to 2002; 2) a concentration of stover processing facilities in the Upper Midwest; 3) increasing offshore Pacific and Atlantic marine transportation; and 4) increasing corn, soybean and wheat production that meets future demand for food, feed and energy feedstocks. This production goal is reached without adding or removing agricultural land area whose extent is defined by the National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) 2002v2011 classes 81 and 82. This goal does require, however, crop shifts and agricultural management changes. The multi-media system response over our U.S. 12km rectangular grid resolution analysis suggests that there are regions of potential environmental and health costs, as well as large areas that could experience unanticipated environmental and health benefits. Alternative land management that may reduce multimedia environmental costs and enhance benefits will be discussed.",

Previous precipitation studies have explored changes in extreme precipitation events, intensity, and distribution, but sequencing changes and their effects are still largely not understood. Precipitation sequencing, or the overall temporal pattern of precipitation events, is a vital yet often overlooked part of developing long-term climate predictions; the assumption of long-term stationarity in climate variability, which suggests that past observed temporal patterns are likely to continue and can therefore be projected, weakens the robustness of climate models. Additionally, changes in sequencing could be a driver for fluctuations in the highly interconnected hydrologic cycle, meaning that tipping points and critical changes in the cycle could be better anticipated given a more complete picture of long-term temporal patterns.\nAnalysis was based on precipitation data collected by the National Climatic Data Center for approximately 9000 stations in North America. Temporal patterns recorded at each station – the sequence of consecutive days with or without rain and the lengths of those increments – were reviewed and compared on a decadal and seasonal scale. Comparisons to date indicate that long-term precipitation patterns are non-stationary and therefore cannot be relied upon for long-term climate projections. It remains to be seen how exactly regional temporal patterns have fluctuated over time in North America, and results could provide interesting insight into observed hydrologic changes or serve to reinforce existing theories regarding regional hydrologic studies.",

            "abstract": "The high volumes and salinity associated with shale gas produced water can make finding suitable storage or disposal options a challenge, especially when deep well brine disposal or recycling for additional well completions is not an option. In such cases, recovery of commodity salts from the high total dissolved solids (TDS) of the brine wastewater may be desirable, yet the elevated concentrations of the naturally occurring radionuclides such as Ra-226 and Ra-228 in produced waters (sometimes substantially greater than the EPA limit of 5 pCi/L) may concentrate during these steps and limit salt recovery options. Therefore, assessing the potential presence of these Ra radionuclides in produced water from shale gas reservoir properties is desirable. In this study, we seek to link U and Th content within a given shale reservoir to the expected Ra content of produced brine by accounting for secular equilibrium within the rock and subsequent release to Ra to native brines. Produced brine from a series of Antrim shale wells and flowback from a single Utica-Collingwood shale well in Michigan were sampled and analyzed via ICP-MS to measure Ra content. Gamma spectroscopy was used to verify the robustness of this new Ra analytical method. Ra concentrations were observed to be up to an order of magnitude higher in the Antrim flowback water samples compared to those collected from the Utica-Collingwood well. The higher Ra content in Antrim produced brines correlates well with higher U content in the Antrim (19 ppm) relative to the Utica-Collingwood (3.5 ppm). We also observed an increase in Ra activity with increasing TDS in the Antrim samples. This Ra-TDS relationship demonstrates the influence of competing divalent cations in controlling Ra mobility in these clay-rich reservoirs. In addition, we will present a survey of geochemical data from other shale gas plays in the U.S. correlating shale U, Th content with produced brine Ra content. A goal of this study is to develop a method to predict the expected Ra activity in shale gas produced brines on a regional or play-specific basis in an effort to guide wastewater management practices or optimize regional treatment strategies.",

The age and history of the Monterey Canyon are poorly constrained due to thick sediment cover and sediment disruption from turbidity currents. To address this deficit we analyzed isotopic proxies (Os, Pb, Nd) from hydrogenetic ferromanganese (Fe-Mn) crusts, which grow over millions of years on elevated rock surfaces by precipitation of metals from seawater. Fe-Mn crusts were studied from Davidson Seamount near the base of the Monterey submarine fan, the Taney Seamount Chain, and from Hoss Seamount, which serves as a regional control (Fig.). Fe-Mn crusts were dated using Os isotope ratios compared to those that define the Cenozoic Os isotope seawater curve. Four Fe-Mn crust samples from Davidson and Taney Seamounts deviate from the Os isotopic seawater curve towards radiogenic values after 4.5±1 Ma. Osmium is well mixed in the global ocean and is not subject to significant diffusive reequilibration in Fe-Mn crusts. We therefore attribute deviations from the Os isotope seawater curve to large-scale terrestrial input that ended about 4.5±1 Ma. The two Davidson samples also show more radiogenic Nd isotope values from about 4.5±1 Ma. Lead isotopes in one Davidson Seamount crust, measured by LA-ICPMS, deviate from regional values after 4.5±1 Ma for about 500 ka towards terrestrial sources. The Taney Seamount Fe-Mn crust does not deviate from regional Nd nor Pb isotope values due to its greater distance from Monterey Canyon and the shorter marine residence times of Nd and Pb. Isotope plots of our crust data and compiled data for potential source rocks indicate that the river that carved Monterey Canyon carried sediment with values closer to the Sierra Nevada than to a Colorado Plateau source, with cessation of major riverine input occurring approximately 4.5±1 Ma, an age that we interpret as the end of the Monterey Canyon incision.",

There is a need for new approaches for use of multi-scale and multi-source remote sensing data as well as ground based measurements for mapping and monitoring crop and ecosystem state to support decision making by governmental and non-governmental organizations for sustainable agricultural development. High resolution sub-meter imagery plays an important role in such an integrative framework of landscape monitoring. It helps link the ground based data to more easily available coarser resolution data, facilitating calibration and validation of derived remote sensing products.\nHere we present a hierarchical Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) approach to classify sub-meter imagery. The primary reason for choosing OBIA is to accommodate pixel sizes smaller than the object or class of interest. Especially in non-homogeneous savannah regions of Tanzania, this is an important concern and the traditional pixel based spectral signature approach often fails.\nOrtho-rectified, calibrated, pan sharpened 0.5 meter resolution data acquired from DigitalGlobe's WorldView-2 satellite sensor was used for this purpose. Multi-scale hierarchical segmentation was performed using multi-resolution segmentation approach to facilitate the use of texture, neighborhood context, and the relationship between super and sub objects for training and classification. eCognition, a commonly used OBIA software program, was used for this purpose. Both decision tree and random forest approaches for classification were tested. The Kappa index agreement for both algorithms surpassed the 85%. The results demonstrate that using hierarchical OBIA can effectively and accurately discriminate classes at even LCCS-3 legend.",

Bikoba\nThe Tonga Slab is the most seismically active subduction zone providing a uniquely detailed picture of the internal deformation of the slab, with apparent warping and folding, from the surface through the transition zone. Here, we investigate the dynamical origin of a irregular feature in the seismicity within the transition zone located at 21-28oS, using 3D visualization and analysis of the seismicity and compression/tension (P/T) axis from the moment tensor solutions to characterize the geometry of, and the orientation of forces acting on, the slab. This irregular feature can be described as narrow region of upward deflection of the slab, with a gap in seismicity beyond (down-dip of) the deflected region, and flanked by two narrow V-shaped gaps in seismicity suggestive of tearing of the slab. The P/T axis show a dominate down-dip orientation of the P axis above the deflection point, which rotate to a nearly vertical orientation within the central region of the deflected slab. The adjacent attached regions (down-dip of the two flanking slab gaps) also have rotated and more heterogeneous P/T axis orientations. In contrast, the adjacent section of the slab to the north of 21oS has continuous seismicity throughout the transition zone, with a roughly uniform planar shape, and generally down-dip orientation of the P axis. We explore three possible hypothesis for the observed deformation including: 1) deflection due to a buoyant metastable olivine wedge, 2) a buckling feature in the slab as previously proposed by Myhill (GJI., 2013), and interaction with a small-scale, secondary plume upwelling below the slab. If the newly-observed gaps in seismicity indicate physical gaps or significant thinning of the slab, then these observations are not consistent with the buckling hypothesis. The lack of significant along-strike variation in slab age or subduction rate also suggests that a localized region of metastable olivine is unlikely. Therefore, we test the third hypothesis using a simple 3D geodynamical model of a planar dipping slab overlying a localized buoyant upwelling (radius < 150 km). We present comparisons of the observations to the model predictions for the subsequent deformation of the slab and orientations of principal stress axis within the slab.",

The purposes of this work are 1) what’s the future food requirement and their food security status in each sub-Saharan African countries? What is the distance from current and future food security status, corresponding to the food requirement, to the targeted food security status? 2) To what extent Sub-Saharan countries could meet their present and future food requirement, and whether they have potential to improve their food insecurity status on currently cultivated land? 3) Whether or, if there have, how the pressures on land resources from meeting the food requirements? To figure those questions out, we firstly use socio-economic pathways datasets, and historical food diet pattern classification to forecast the 2010-2050 food commodity and feed calories demand per country. A new food security indicator, which considered the influences of both the food energy and quality intake, was used to evaluate the food insecurity status and the distances to different targeted statuses of the specific country. The latest Global Agro-Ecological Zones (GAEZ) databases were used to estimate the current and future crop yield gap and crop potential production. For current to future scenario analysis, we considered population growth, dietary change, climate change, agricultural input level, and target food security status. Then the balance of food requirement with the current and potential crop production was analyzed for different scenarios. Land requirements were calculated for meeting those food requirements, and the pressures on land resources are evaluated. Our works are hoping to provide scientific-based evidences for policy recommendations for local government to tackle food insecurity problems in Sub-Saharan Africa.",

This discovery has shed light on a broader range of strain release processes that range from aseismic creep at plate convergence rates (cm/yr) to traditional earthquake slip rates (m/s). The largest SSEs along the northern Hikurangi subduction margin occur offshore Gisborne, New Zealand every 18-24 months at depths less than 15 km. We present a systematic investigation of tremor and microseismicity associated with these shallow SSEs from 2010 to the present using land data from the New Zealand National Seismograph Network operated by GeoNet (http://geonet.org.nz) and ocean-bottom data from the Hikurangi Ocean Bottom Investigation of Tremor and Slow Slip (HOBITSS) project. The HOBITSS project deployed an array of ocean-bottom seismometers and absolute pressure gauges between May 2014 and June 2015 above the Gisborne SSE patch. These instruments were in place during a large SSE in September/October 2014. Tremor and seismicity associated with Gisborne SSEs primarily occur along the downdip edge of the slip patch, but the addition of data from ocean-bottom stations located directly above the slip patch will reveal the updip extent of tremor and microseismicity related to these SSEs.",

            "abstract": "Since the start of the green revolution global crop yields have increased linearly for most major cereal crops, so that present day global values are around twice those of the 1960s. The increase in crop yields have allowed for large increases in global agricultural production without correspondingly large increases in cropping area. Future projections under the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP) framework and other assessments result in increases of global crop production of greater than 100% by the year 2050. In order to meet this increased agricultural demand within the available arable land, future production gains need to be understood in terms of the yield changes due to changes in climate, atmospheric CO2, and adaptive management such as irrigation and fertilizer application. In addition to the changes in crop yield, future agricultural demand will need to be met through increasing cropping areas into what are currently marginal lands at the cost of existing forests and other natural ecosystems.\nIn this study we assess the utility of the crop model within the Community Land Model (CLM Crop) to provide both historical and future guidance on changes in crop yields under a range of global idealized crop modeling experiments. The idealized experiments follow the experimental design of the AgMIP Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison (GGCMI) in which CLM Crop is a participating model. The idealized experiments consist of global crop simulations for Cotton, Maize, Rice, Soy, Sugarcane, and Wheat under various climate, atmospheric CO2 levels, irrigation prescription, and nitrogen fertilizer application. The time periods simulated for the experiments are for the Historical period (1901 – 2005), and for the two Representative Concentration Pathways of RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 (2006 – 2100). Each crop is simulated on all land grid cells globally for each time period with atmospheric forcing that is a combination of: 1. transient climate and CO2; 2. transient climate and constant CO2; and 3. constant climate and CO2. To assess the role of management in each of these configurations the crops are simulated as: 1. Rainfed with no N fertilizer; 2. Rainfed with N fertilizer; 3. Irrigated with no N fertilizer; and 4. Irrigated with N fertilizer.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric particles in the polar regions consist mostly of sea salt aerosol (SSA). SSA plays an important role in regional climate change through influencing the surface energy balance either directly or indirectly via cloud formation. SSA irradiated by sunlight also releases very reactive halogen radicals, which control concentrations of ozone, a pollutant and greenhouse gas. However, models under-predict SSA concentrations in the Arctic during winter pointing to a missing source. It has been recently suggested that salty blowing snow above sea ice, which is evaporating, to be that source as it may produce more SSA than equivalent areas of open ocean.\nParticipation in the ‘Norwegian Young Sea Ice Cruise (N-ICE 2015)’ on board the research vessel `Lance’ allowed to test this hypothesis in the Arctic sea ice zone during winter. Measurements were carried out from the ship frozen into the pack ice North of 80º N during February to March 2015. Observations at ground level (0.1-2 m) and from the ship’s crows nest (30 m) included number concentrations and size spectra of SSA (diameter range 0.3-10 μm) as well as snow particles (diameter range 50-500 μm). During and after blowing snow events significant SSA production was observed. In the aerosol and snow phase sulfate is fractionated with respect to sea water, which confirms sea ice surfaces and salty snow, and not the open ocean, to be the dominant source of airborne SSA. Aerosol shows depletion in bromide with respect to sea water, especially after sunrise, indicating photochemically driven release of bromine. We discuss the SSA source strength from blowing snow in light of environmental conditions (wind speed, atmospheric turbulence, temperature and snow salinity) and recommend improved model parameterisations to estimate regional aerosol production. N-ICE 2015 results are then compared to a similar study carried out previously in the Weddell Sea during the Antarctic winter.",

Rapid assessment of drought impacts on agricultural production can aid water managers in assessing mitigation options, and guide decision making with respect to mitigation of drought impacts. Satellite remote sensing offers an efficient way to provide quantitative assessments of drought impacts on agricultural production and increases in fallow acreage associated with reductions in water supply. A key advantage of satellite-based assessments is that they can provide a measure of land fallowing that is consistent across both space and time. We describe an approach for monthly and seasonal mapping of uncultivated agricultural acreage developed as part of a joint effort by USGS, USDA, NASA, and the California Department of Water Resources to provide timely assessments of land fallowing during drought events. This effort has used the Central Valley of California as a pilot region for development and testing of an operational approach.\nTo provide quantitative measures of uncultivated agricultural acreage from satellite data early in the season, we developed a decision tree algorithm and applied it to timeseries of data from Landsat TM, ETM+, OLI, and MODIS. Our effort has been focused on development of indicators of drought impacts in the March - August timeframe based on measures of crop development patterns relative to a reference period with average or above average rainfall. To assess the accuracy of the algorithms, monthly ground validation surveys were conducted across 650 fields from March - September in 2014 and 2015. We present the algorithm along with updated results from the accuracy assessment, and data and maps of land fallowing in the Central Valley in 2015.",

Due to the offset of the magnetic poles from the rotation axis and Earth's rotational and orbital motion, the part of the magnetic polar cap being illuminated and the part being in the dark, will vary throughout the day and the seasons. Therefore the outflowing ion flux from the whole polar cap will vary accordingly. Moreover, the offset in the Northern hemisphere is different from the one in the Southern hemisphere. Thus the flux from both polar caps will also be different. With a very simple model we will explore the effects of this on the outflowing flux, which will affect the atmospheric erosion as well as the supply of ionospheric ions to the plasma sheet. In recent observations with the Cluster satellites, the heavier O⁺ ions have been shown to be affected more strongly by solar illumination than H⁺ ions. So this may lead to an alteration of the mass density in the plasma sheet on a periodic basis.\nThis study will also look for signatures of the effects predicted by this model in data of cold ion outflow. The Cluster extensive data set from André et al. [2015] seems best suited for this. It uses the technique detecting the wake formed behind a charged spacecraft in a low density and low energy plasma environment. This technique will generally only observe ions with an energy too low to overcome the spacecraft potential (i.e. ~< 40 eV). The measurements are made in the magnetospheric lobes, up to altitudes of 20 RE, between 2001 and 2010. This long period of observations creates the possibility to study the seasonal variation of cold ion outflow from the polar ionosphere and look for possible differences between both hemispheres.",

For this purpose we use three dimensionless and dependent quantities: Ψ=E/P, Φ=Ep/P and Ω=E/Ep. We demonstrate analytically that Budyko-type equations are unable to capture the physical limit of the relation between Ω and Φ in humid environments, owing to the unfeasibility of Ep/P→0 at E/Ep=1. Using independent datasets from 146 sub-catchments in the Amazon River basin we overcome this physical inconsistency by proposing a physically consistent power law Ψ=kΦ e with pre-factor k=0.66 and scaling exponent e=0.83 (R2=0.93). The proposed power law is compared with other Budyko-type equations, namely those by Yang et al (2008) and Cheng et al (2011). Taking into account the goodness of fits with confidence bounds set at 95% level and the ability to comply with the physical limits of the 3-D space, our results show that the power law works better to model the long-term water and energy balances within the Amazon River basin. At the interannual time scale, parameters from the three studied equations are estimated for each catchment using 27 years of information and interesting regional patterns emerge, as well as evidence of space-time symmetry. In addition, results show that within individual catchments the parameters from the linear relationship by Cheng et al (2011) and from the power law resemble and are related to the partitioning of energy via evapotranspiration in terms of Ω. Finally, signs of co-evolution of catchments are explored by linking the emerging spatial patterns of the parameters with landscape properties that represent some of the main features of the Amazon River basin, including topography, water in soils and vegetation.",

These techniques for systems for which no model exists are developed using the reconstruction of phase space from time series data. For many natural systems, the complete set of equations governing their evolution are not known and observational data of only a limited number of physical variables are available However, for a dissipative system in which the variables are coupled nonlinearly, the dimensionality of the phase space is greatly reduced, and it is possible to reconstruct the details of the phase space from a single scalar time series of observations. A combination of the phase phase reconstruction with ETKF yields a new technique of forecasting using only time series data. This technique is used to forecast magnetic field variations in th magnetosphere, which exhibits low dimensional behavior on the substorm time scale. The time series data of the magnetic field variations monitored by the network of groundbased magnetometers in the auroral region are used for forecasting at two stages.. In the first stage, the auroral electrojet indices computed from the data from the magnetometers are used for forecasting and yields forecasts that are better than persistence. In the second stage, the multivariate time series from several auroral region magnetometers is used to reconstruct the phase space of the magnetosphere-solar wind system using Multi-channel Singular Spectrum Analysis. The ETKF is applied to ensemble forecasts made using model data constructed from long time series of the data from each magnetometer and observations of the magnetometer measurements. The improved prediction skill, e.g., with respect to persistence, is achieved from the use of the dynamical behavior of nearby trajectories. The near-real time forecasts of space weather based on this approach will use the correlated data of the solar wind at L1 and data of the magnetosphere from the networks of magnetometer stations.",

            "abstract": "Climate is changing in the Colorado Front Range, leading to declines in snowpack below 2500 m and a greater proportion of total annual precipitation falling as rain. Several decades of research in alpine ecosystems have demonstrated the links among climate, hydrologic response, and the fate of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition – another driver of ecosystem change. A greater proportion of precipitation that falls as rain will likely affect the patterns and persistence of soil moisture, as well as the fate, availability, and transport of N. To explore these interactions, we conducted tracer experiments in July using 15N-nitrate (NO3-) and lithium bromide (LiBr) during experimental rainfall events (intensity and storm duration with a recurrence interval of 2-5 years) in a high montane catchment within the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory. For four weeks following the application of rainfall and tracers, we measured soil water concentrations of Br-, 15NO3-, and N species daily, followed by recoveries of 15N species in bulk soils and microbial biomass (collections in August and October). We found that hillslope aspect (north- versus south-facing) and position were significant determinants of soil 15N-NO3- recoveries, while soil depth and time since rain event were significant determinants of 15N recovery in the microbial pool. Dry conditions during the growing season led to little movement of tracers in soil solution. Overall, microbial uptake and hydrologic transport of N was greater on the north- than the south-facing slopes. Our results point to the importance of soil properties (e.g., presence/absence of organic horizon, degree of macroporosity), which differ greatly by hillslope aspect, in controlling ecosystem N retention. These findings present an important piece in the story of atmospheric N’s fate along the elevation gradient from the plains to the alpine, and highlight that soil organic matter is a significant component of ecosystem N storage in high montane forests.",

            "abstract": "The natural system is open and complex and the hydraulic parameters needed for describing flow and transport in the vadose zone are often poorly known, making it prone to multiple interpretations, mathematical descriptions and uncertainty. Quite often a reasonable “handle” on a sites flow characteristics can be gained only through direct observation of the flow processes itself, determination of the spatial- and probability distributions of material properties combined with computationally expensive inversions of the Richards equation. In groundwater systems, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has proven to be an effective alternative to model inversions by assimilating observations directly into an ensemble of groundwater models from which time and/or space-variable variable probabilistic quantities of the flow process can be derived. Application of EnKF to Richards equation-type unsaturated flow problems, however, is more challenging than in groundwater systems because the relation of state and model parameters is strongly nonlinear. In addition, the type of functional dependence of moisture content and hydraulic conductivity on matric potential leads to high-dimensional (in the parameter space) problems even under conditions where closed-form expressions of these models such as van Genuchten-Mualem formulations are used. In this study, we updated soil water retention parameters and hydraulic conductivity together and used Restart EnKF, which rerun the nonlinear model from the initial time to obtain the updated state variables, in synthetic cases to explore the factors that may influence estimation results, including the initial estimate, the ensemble size, the observation error, and the assimilation interval. We embedded the EnKF into the Bayesian model averaging framework to enhance the model reliability and reduce predictive uncertainties. This approach is evaluated from a 15 m deep semi-arid highly heterogeneous and anisotropic vadose zone site at the University of Arizona Maricopa Agricultural Center, Phoenix, Arizona.",

In order to investigate the response of the CBL to multi-scale feature of the surface SHF field over a local area of several tens of kilometers or smaller, an analytic surface SHF map is crated as a function of the chosen feature. The spatial variation in the SHF map is prescribed with a two-dimensional analytical perturbation field, which is generated by using the inverse transform technique of the Fourier series whose coefficients are controlled, of which spectrum to have a particular slope in the chosen range of wavelength. Then, the CBL responses to various SHF heterogeneities are summarized as a function of the spectral slope, in terms of mean structure, turbulence statistics and cross-scale processes. The range of feasible SHF heterogeneities is obtained from the SHF maps produced by a land surface model (LSM) of the WRF system. The LSM-derived SHF maps are a function of geographical data on various resolutions. Based on the numerical experiment results with the surface heterogeneities in the range, we will discuss the uncertainty in the SHF heterogeneity and its impact on the atmosphere in a numerical model. Also we will present the range of spatial scale of the surface SHF heterogeneity that significantly influence on the whole CBL. Lastly, we will report the test result of the hypothesis that the spatial variability of SHF is more representative of surface thermal heterogeneity than is the latent heat flux over the local area of several tens of kilometers or smaller.",

In addition, many of these microbially-catalysed geochemical transformations are highly dependent upon introduction of reactants via advective and diffusive hydrological transport. We have characterized microbial communities from a set of static microcosms to test the effect of ethanol diffusion and sulfate concentration on UVI-contaminated sediment. The spatial distribution, valence states, and speciation of both U and Fe were monitored in situ throughout the experiment by synchrotron x-ray absorption spectroscopy, in parallel with solution measurements of pH and the concentrations of sulfate, ethanol, and organic acids. After reaction initiation, a ~1‑cm thick layer of sediment near the sediment-water (S-W) interface became visibly dark. Fe XANES spectra of the layer were consistent with the formation of FeS. Over the 4 year duration of the experiment, U LIII-edge XANES indicated reduction of U, first in the dark layer and then throughout the sediment. Next, the microcosms were disassembled and samples were taken from the overlying water and different sediment regions. We extracted DNA and characterized the microbial community by sequencing 16S rRNA gene amplicons with the Illumina MiSeq platform and found that the community evolved from its originally homogeneous composition, becoming significantly spatially heterogeneous.\nWe have also developed an x-ray accessible column to probe elemental transformations as they occur along the flow path in a porous medium with the purpose of refining reactive transport models (RTMs) that describe coupled physical and biogeochemical processes in environmental systems. The elemental distribution dynamics and the RTMs of the redox driven processes within them will be presented.",

The statistical fluctuation properties are compared to the typical magnetotail reconnection characteristics such as reconnection flows, and electron to ion temperature and velocity ratios. Global LFM MHD simulations are used for studying how deeply into the plasma sheet the vorticity created by the magnetopause processes such as Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability can penetrate and what are the corresponding amplitudes.

            "abstract": "Erosion worldwide is proposed to have intensified due to oscillating climate, cooling, and glaciation in Pliocene-Recent time. Quantifying the initiation and rates of glacial erosion due primarily to climate forcing over geologic timescales is challenging. Reasons include strong tectonic-climatic feedbacks in actively deforming regions and the bias in surficial deposits toward more recent periods. Pleistocene glaciers repeatedly covered the entirety of southern Alaska including tectonically active and inactive regions. Here we present apatite (U-Th)/He [AHe] ages from a vertical transect in a glaciated, high-relief, but tectonically quiescent study area in the western Alaska Range. Samples between 500 and 1600 m have AHe ages that increase from 3 to 4.2 Ma (n=7) and suggest rapid cooling. In contrast, samples between 1600 and 1900 m have a larger range of AHe ages that increase from 4.2 to 7.5 Ma (n=6) and suggest slower cooling. The age-elevation relationship reveals an order-of-magnitude acceleration in erosion at 3-4 Ma with rates of ~1 mm/yr since that time. In addition to this local vertical transect, we also present regional detrital apatite fission track (AFT) ages from 12 modern catchments that span a 450 km length of the Alaska Range. The detrital AFT ages indicate synchronous Pliocene exhumation (3.7-3.3 Ma) exclusively among high relief (2.5-5.5 km), glaciated (20-55% modern area) catchments. There are no known or hypothesized large-scale tectonic changes affecting the entire Alaska Range at 3-4 Ma. The timing of accelerated exhumation is instead coeval with the ~3.6 Ma onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation. Widespread glaciation in continental Alaska has been suggested at this time based on the onset of loess deposition and boreal pollen. Our results suggest that deep incision into the Alaska Range resulted from accelerated glacial erosion since 3-4 Ma, well after the onset of rock uplift in Oligocene and Miocene time due to tectonics.",

            "abstract": "Large, caldera-forming silicic eruptions require the assembly and storage of a large volume of magma, and are though to result from either (1) rare high magma flux events needed to maintain melt-rich (eruptible) magma for extended timescales, or (2) magma accumulation at lower magma fluxes, storage for extended timescales as low temperature crystal mushes and rapid rejuvenation prior to eruption. The thermal history of these magmas prior to eruption thus provides an important clue into the processes that lead to eruption, but has been difficult to quantify. However in-situ measurement of Sr and other trace elements in plagioclase, coupled with diffusion models, can be used to constrain the time magmas spend at different temperatures.\nProgressive differentiation of plagioclase from a silicic magma produces plagioclase with lower Sr at low An—producing a positive correlation between Sr and An, which is the opposite of what is predicted by equilibrium partitioning. Forward modeling of the temperature-dependent diffusion of Sr from this initial disequilibrium condition toward equilibrium concentrations, based on partitioning relationships of An and Sr, gives an estimate of the time individual crystals spend at specific temperatures.\nPreliminary high spatial resolution LA-ICP-MS analysis of Sr in plagioclase from five caldera-forming eruptions show overall positive correlations of Sr and An, suggesting that little diffusive re-equilibration has occurred. Thus, over the lifetime that these magmas reside in the upper crust (>10 k.y.) they likely spend less than a few thousand years at temperatures above 750 °C (the approximate temperature of rheological lockup). These results suggest that the magmas that feed many large caldera-forming eruptions are kept in cold storage for long timescales, and that rapid rejuvenation of mush occurs without extended thermal conditioning prior to eruption.",

            "abstract": "We studied the structure of the subduction zone system offshore the Pampean flat-slab segment (~29-33°S) using seismic and bathymetric constraints. Bathymetric data reveals three structural domains: (1) NW, NNW and NS oriented ridges and contractional geometries in the frontal prism and below the lower slope, (2) an extensional system controlled by NNW, NS and NE oriented westward dipping faults at the lower and middle slope, and (3) NNW-NS and NE oriented eastward dipping extensional faults at the upper continental slope. Overlying the acoustic top of the continental basement, at least two syn-extensional seismic sequences have been recognized that were correlated with onshore geological units and the Valparaíso Forearc Basin seismic sequences: Pliocene and Pre-Pliocene syn-extensional sequences. These sequences are separated by an erosional unconformity. Seismic reflection data reveal that the eastward dipping extensional system recognized at the upper slope can be extended to the middle slope and controlled the older seismic package. The westward dipping extensional system is essentially restricted to the middle slope. The tectonic boundary between the middle and upper continental slope is a prominent system of trenchward-dipping normal fault scarps (~1 km offset). This abrupt structural change can be readily detected along the Chilean erosive margin as well as the two extensional sets. Otherwise, evidences of positive inversion tectonics and thrusting have been recognized in the slope domain locally restricted to some eastern dipping faults. These contractional features could be related to gravitational deformation, which is favored by the regional inclination of the pre-Pliocene sequences. We propose that the structural configuration of the study area is dominantly controlled by tectonic erosion as well as the uplift of the Coastal Cordillera, and partially controlled by inherited architecture.",

            "abstract": "Shallow dike intrusions may be accompanied by fault slip above the dikes, complicating inverse and forward models of non-unique geodetic data. The diverse volcano-tectonic and low-frequency earthquakes accompanying the 2005 – 2010 Dabbahu-Manda Hararo large-volume dike intrusions, some of which caused 3 m fault displacements at the surface, provide an opportunity to differentiate between brittle failure accompanying lateral dike migration and shallow fault displacements above the dike. We apply the frequency index (FI) method of Buurman and West (2010) to characterize the spectra of swarm earthquakes from 6 of the dikes. These earthquakes often have broad spectra with multiple peaks, making the usual peak frequency classification method unreliable. Our results show a general bi-modal character with high FI earthquakes associated with deeper dike segments (top > 3 km subsurface) and low FI earthquakes with shallow dikes, indicating that shallow dikes result in earthquakes with more low-frequency content and larger amplitude surface waves. The bi-modal character is clearer in FI determined from full waveforms than from P-waves, which implies path effects are partially responsible for the enhanced surface waves. Low FI earthquakes are more common during dike emplacement, suggesting interactions between the dike and faults may lead to lower frequencies and surface waves. Taken together, likely source processes for low FI earthquakes are shallow hypocenters (< 3 km) possibly with surface rupture, slow rupture velocities, and interactions with dike fluids. Source time functions remain elusive due to natural damping of high frequency content and lower than necessary sampling rate. Our results suggest a continuum of spectral responses, implying either that impulsive volcano-tectonic earthquakes and the unusual, emergent earthquakes have similar source processes or that spectral analyses, such as FI, cannot distinguish different source processes.",

It covers the period 01/01/1983 - to date, at 0.25° resolution. In areas without a dense network of rain-gauges, the PERSIANN-CDR dataset could be useful for identifying the reliability of regional climate models (RCMs), in order to build robust RCMs ensemble for reducing the uncertainties in the climate and hydrological projections. However, before using this data set for RCM evaluation, an assessment of performance of PERSIANN-CDR dataset against in-situ observations is necessary. The high-resolution gridded daily rain-gauge dataset, named Spain02, was employed in this study.\nThe variable Dry Spell Lengths (DSL) considering 1 mm and 10 mm as thresholds of daily rainfall, and the time period 1988-2007 was defined for the study. A procedure for improving the consistency and homogeneity between the two datasets was applied. The assessment is based on distributional similarity and the well-known statistical tests (Smirnov-Kolmogorov of two samples and Chi-Square) are used as fitting criteria.\nThe results demonstrate good fit of PERSIANN-CDR over whole Spain, for threshold 10 mm/day. However, for threshold 1 mm/day PERSIANN-CDR compares well with Spain02 dataset for areas with high values of rainfall (North of Spain); while in semiarid areas (South East of Spain) there is strong overestimation of short DSLs. Overall, PERSIANN-CDR demonstrate its robustness in the simulation of DSLs for the highest thresholds.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - agu2015_poster.pdf\nThe mechanics of West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) beds impose fundamental constraints on ice flow and help set the timescale of potential WAIS collapse. Understanding basal mechanics requires a variety of observational and modeling approaches, among them using synoptic-scale observations of surface velocities as constraints on numerical ice flow models. This approach has been developed and employed over the past few decades using available surface velocity data, which often amount to snapshots of ice flow at sporadic times. The next major step in the evolution of geodetic methods for glacier dynamics is capturing synoptic-scale, time-dependent ice-flow characteristics. Here, using spatially and temporally dense synthetic aperture radar (SAR) observations, we extend to the time domain existing methods for inferring velocity fields in three spatial dimensions from SAR and optical data. Our approach yields some of the first-ever truly 4D velocity fields. We briefly outline the underlying methodology before detailing the resulting velocity fields, which consist of a mean velocity vector, a user-defined set of temporal functions, and a DEM correction factor. Rutford Ice Stream (RIS), WAIS, provides an ideal proof-of-concept location because of its strong, well-documented, tidal-timescale ice flow variations. Existing GPS observations of RIS ice flow constrain the dominant periods of sinusoidal ice flow variability, which we use to define a set of sinusoidal functions used in the 4D velocity fields. COSMO-SkyMed, a 4-satellite constellation, collected SAR data for approximately 9 months beginning in late summer 2013 at sampling rates sufficient to distinguish the primary periods of tidally induced ice flow variability. The results, obtained using more than 1000 SAR-derived displacement fields, provide a map-view of tidally induced flow variations and tidal-timescale grounding line migration that indicate greater spatial heterogeneity in the response of the ice stream to tidal forcing than do GPS observations. Features in the 4D velocity fields are attributable to areas with known rigid and deformable beds. We compare the spatial characteristics of ice flow variability with the ice stream geometry and hydraulic potential, and discuss the implications of our results for mechanical models of the RIS bed.",

This so-called Tropical Intra-Seasonal Oscillations (TISO) impacts on global weather and climate, such as El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), extreme weather in northern hemisphere, Asian and Australian monsoon, so on. However, the individual TISO events are unpredictable beyond 20 days. In the Pacific, on the other hand, ENSO occurs on intra-annual (2-7 years) timescales with significant global socio-economic and environmental impact, and has a predictability of 8-10 months prior to its mature stage. Here we use NCAR Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) forecasts and observational estimates to show the roles of ENSO in the TISO. This study shows that mixed layer depth in the southwestern Indian Ocean, which is known to be one of the TISO onset regions, deepens (shoals) during El-Nino (La-Nina) through the low frequency modulation. The deeper (shallower) mixed layer reduces (enhanced) TISO-associated Sea surface temperature (SST) and wind variability, which leads to less (more) favorable conditions for TISO onset over the Indian Ocean.",

Over its length, the trail passes through a corridor with wide variations in climate, bedrock type, soils, and stream water quality. These factors create a diverse range of ecosystems. The health of these ecosystems is a cause for concern because the AT passes through the heavily populated eastern U.S. with its many sources of sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) emissions that produce acidic deposition. To address concerns about the health of the AT, a study was designed to evaluate the condition and sensitivity of the AT corridor with respect to acidic deposition. Collections of stream water (265 sites), soil (60 sites), tree cores (15 sites) and atmospheric deposition samples (4 sites) were made along with understory and overstory vegetation measurements (30 sites) over the full trail length within a 40 km-wide corridor. Existing data on atmospheric deposition, geology, vegetation, stream chemistry, and soil chemistry were also used in the analysis. Mean acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) was lowest in the streams in the North section, intermediate in the Central section and highest the South section, despite the South having the highest acid rain levels. At least 40% of the study streams exhibited pH and/or Ali measurements that indicated potential harm to biota. Approximately 70% of the soil sites had values of base saturation under 20%, the threshold below which acidic deposition can mobilize inorganic aluminum (Ali), the form harmful to terrestrial and aquatic life. Compositional similarity of understory and canopy species was positively correlated with acidic deposition, suggesting that during past decades, species poorly adapted to acidic deposition were replaced with tolerant species. Target loads modeling indicated that exceedance of sulfur target loads to achieve stream ANC = 50 µeq/L by the year 2100occurred throughout the trail corridor.",

            "abstract": "Reactions of the hydroxyl (OH) and peroxy radicals (HO2 and RO2) play a central role in the chemistry of the atmosphere. In addition to controlling the lifetimes of many trace gases important to issues of global climate change, OH radical reactions initiate the oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which can lead to the production of ozone and secondary organic aerosols in the atmosphere. Previous measurements of these radicals in forest environments characterized by high mixing ratios of isoprene and low mixing ratios of NOx have shown serious discrepancies with modeled concentrations. These results bring into question our understanding of the atmospheric chemistry of isoprene and other biogenic VOCs under low NOx conditions.\nIn the summer of 2015, HOx radicals were measured using Laser-Induced Fluorescence Fluorescence Assay by Gas Expansion (LIF-FAGE) technique as part of the Indiana Radical, Reactivity and Ozone Production Intercomparison (IRRONIC). This campaign took place in a forested area at the Indiana Research and Teaching Preserve (IURTP) near the Bloomington campus characterized by high mixing ratios of isoprene and low mixing ratios of NOx. Supporting measurements of photolysis rates, volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides, and other species were used to constrain a zero-dimensional box model based on the Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism (RACM2) and the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM).",

However, recent measurements and modeling studies have found high levels of ozone (O3) there. Based on the state-of-the-science global chemical transport model MOZART-4, we identify the origin, pathway, and mechanism of trans-Eurasian transport of air pollutants to Western China in 2000. MOZART-4 generally simulates well the observed surface O3 over inland areas of China. Simulations find surface ozone concentrations over Western China on average to be about 10 ppbv higher than Eastern China. Using sensitivity studies as well as a fully-tagged approach, we find that anthropogenic emissions from all Eurasian regions except China contribute 10–15 ppbv surface O3 over Western China, superimposed upon a 35–40 ppbv natural background. Transport from European anthropogenic sources to Northwestern China results in 2–6 ppbv O3 enhancements in spring and summer. Indian anthropogenic sources strongly influence O3 over the Tibetan Plateau during the summer monsoon. Transport of O3 originating from emissions in the Middle East occasionally reach Western China and increase surface ozone there by about 1–4 ppbv. These influences are of similar magnitude as trans-Pacific and transatlantic transport of O3 and its precursors, indicating the significance of trans-Eurasian ozone transport in hemispheric transport of air pollution. Our study further indicates that mitigation of anthropogenic emissions from Europe, the Indian subcontinent, and the Middle East could benefit public health and agricultural productivity in Western China.",

            "abstract": "A grand challenge of climate science is to quantify the extent of natural variability on adaptation-relevant timescales (10-100y). Since the instrumental record is too short to adequately estimate the spectra of climate measures, this information must be derived from paleoclimate proxies, which may harbor a many-to-one, non-linear (e.g. thresholded) and non-stationary relationship to climate. In this talk, I will touch upon the estimation of climate scaling behavior from climate proxies. Two case studies will be presented:\nan investigation of scaling behavior in a reconstruction of global surface temperature using state-of- the-art data [PAGES2K Consortium, in prep] and methods [Guillot et al., 2015]. Estimating the scaling exponent β in spectra derived from this reconstruction, we find that 0 < β < 1 in most regions, suggesting long-term memory. Overall, the reconstruction-based spectra are steeper than the ones based on an instrumental dataset [HadCRUT4.2, Morice et al., 2012], and those estimated from PMIP3/CMIP5 models, suggesting the climate system is more energetic at multidecadal to centennial timescales than can be inferred from the short instrumental record or from the models developed to reproduce it [Laepple and Huybers, 2014].\nan investigation of scaling behavior in speleothems records of tropical hydroclimate. We will make use of recent advances in proxy system modeling [Dee et al., 2015] and investigate how various aspects of the speleothem system (karst dynamics, age uncertainties) may conspire to bias the estimate of scaling behavior from speleothem timeseries. The results suggest that ignoring such complications leads to erroneous inferences about hydroclimate scaling.\n",

            "abstract": "In a mediterranean climate where much of the annual precipitation falls during winter, the snow-capped Sierra Nevada serves as the primary source of dry season runoff that supports agriculture, industries, urban, and other ecosystems. Increased warming has led to significant reductions in mountain snowpack accumulation and earlier snowmelt throughout the western United States where most of the snow accumulates at temperatures near the freezing point. As a result, declines in dry season runoff magnitude, earlier runoff timing, and altered flood risk have been reported across the region. An important question in this context is, how to best manage forested catchments for water and other ecosystem services? We depict the differences in hydrologic response of ten catchments in the Kings River Experimental Watersheds (KREW) research project using continuous precipitation, snow, and runoff data during 2004-2014. The size of these catchments ranges from 50 to 475 ha, and they span a 600-m elevation range in the rain snow transitional zone. In terms of soil, Shaver and Gerle-Cagwin dominate the lower elevation Providence catchments, and Cagwin soils dominate the higher elevation Bull catchments. The majority of these catchments have southwest aspect, moderate average slope (i.e. <25%), and a well-developed drainage network with drainage density ranging from 4.6 to 10.1 km/km2. Bull catchments, on average, have higher runoff than the Providence catchments across all hydrologic signatures extracted from daily hydrographs. Mean annual runoff ranges between 281 to 408 mm in Providence and 436 to 656 mm in Bull catchments despite no significant difference in precipitation among KREW’s four meteorological stations. However, high elevation Bull catchments receive significantly more precipitation as snow than the low elevation Providence catchments. The average runoff ratio ranges from 18% to as high as 43% among different catchments, indicating that the catchment evapotranspiration exceeds the catchment runoff. Inter-catchment variability in runoff, runoff ratio, characteristics of runoff ratio-precipitation relationship (i.e. slope and intercept), and precipitation elasticity of runoff can be primarily explained by differences in catchment elevation, recession characteristics, and drainage density.",

The main intent of the atmospheric channel is to characterize the atmosphere to aide in the interpretation and filtering of altimetry data, as clouds, fog and blowing snow can adversely affect the ranging accuracy due to signal attenuation and multiple scattering.

The model has demonstrated remarkable performance in simulating climatology and daily variability of the upper atmosphere and ionosphere driven from below. Coupled to ionosphere-electrodynamics models it not only reproduced dramatic variations of ionospheric plasma drifts and density distribution observed during sudden stratospheric warmings but also demonstrated predictive capability with lead times up to 2 weeks. WAM has reached a level of maturity to be implemented into operations at the National Weather Service (NWS) in the next few years.\nWithin the same timeframe NWS also plans to substantially upgrade GFS to the Next Generation Global Prediction System (NGGPS). Specific capabilities of NGGPS include in particular a nonhydrostatic dynamical core and the ability to directly simulate important processes such as tropospheric convection at very high resolution globally and without the need for parameterization. This opens an opportunity for development of NGWAM. Specific requirements for extension of NGGPS into NGWAM will be discussed and capabilities of the new models in application to the upper atmosphere and ionosphere dynamics, simulation, and prediction presented.",

            "abstract": "Five decades of observations of Ceres’ albedo, surface composition, shape and density suggest that Ceres is comprised of both silicates and tens of percent of ice. Historical suggestions of surficial hydrated silicates and evidence for water emission, coupled with its bulk density of ~2100 kg/m3 and Dawn observations of young craters containing high albedo spots support this conclusion. We report geomorphological evidence from survey data demonstrating that evaporative and fluid-flow processes within silicate-ice mixtures are prevalent on Ceres, and indicate that its surface materials contain significant water ice. Here we highlight three classes of features that possess strong evidence for ground ice. First, ubiquitous scalloped and “breached” craters are characterized by mass wasting and by the recession of crater walls in asymmetric patterns; these appear analogous to scalloped terrain on Mars and protalus lobes formed by mass wasting in terrestrial glaciated regions. The degradation of crater walls appears to be responsible for the nearly complete removal of some craters, particularly at low latitudes. Second, several high latitude, high elevation craters feature lobed flows that emanate from cirque-shaped head walls and bear strikingly similar morphology to terrestrial rock glaciers. These similarities include lobate toes and indications of furrows and ridges consistent with ice-cored or ice-cemented material. Other lobed flows persist at the base of crater walls and mass wasting features. Many flow features evidently terminate at ramparts. Third, there are frequent irregular domes, peaks and mounds within crater floors that depart from traditional crater central peaks or peak complexes. In some cases the irregular domes show evidence for high albedo or activity, and thus given other evidence for ice, these could be due to local melt and extrusion via hydrologic gradients, forming domes similar to pingos. The global distribution of these classes of features, combined with latitudinal variation in their abundance and/or appearance, suggests that ground ice is a key controller of geology on Ceres, and that ice content within the surface and subsurface is spatially varied and/or activated by energetic events. Dawn high altitude mapping orbit (HAMO) data will provide better views.",

            "abstract": "Based upon constructivist principles and the recognition that many students are motivated by hands-on activities and field experiences, we designed a new undergraduate curriculum at Lake Superior State University. One of our major goals was to develop stand-alone field projects in most of the academic year courses. Examples of courses impacted include structural geology, geophysics, and geotectonics, Students learn geophysical concepts in the context of near surface field-based geophysical studies while students in structural geology learn about structural processes through outcrop study of fractures, folds and faults. In geotectonics students learn about collisional and rifting processes through on-site field studies of specific geologic provinces. Another goal was to integrate data and samples collected by students in our sophomore level introductory field course along with stand-alone field projects in our clastic systems and sequence stratigraphy courses.\nOur emphasis on active learning helps students develop a meaningful geoscience knowledge base and complex reasoning skills in authentic contexts. We simulate the activities of practicing geoscientists by engaging students in all aspects of a project, for example: field-oriented project planning and design; acquiring, analyzing, and interpreting data; incorporating supplemental material and background data; and preparing oral and written project reports.\nWe find through anecdotal evidence including student comments and personal observation that the projects stimulate interest, provide motivation for learning new concepts, integrate skill and concept acquisition vertically through the curriculum, apply concepts from multiple geoscience subdisiplines, and develop soft skills such as team work, problem solving, critical thinking and communication skills. Through this projected-centered Lake Superior State University geology curriculum students practice our motto of ”learn geology by doing geology.”",

This field is mainly dominated by Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) and their interactions with the atoms in the atmosphere and soil. This yields a radiation environment consisting of a wide variety of particles and energies which, at high energies, is dominated by charged particles, e.g., ions, and their isotopes, electrons, and others. Over the course of the first Martian year (~2 Earth years) of the MSL mission, the radiation field was mainly modulated by two influences: the seasonal pressure cycle at Gale crater; and the variation of the impeding GCR flux due to changes in the solar activity. Here, we present charged particle fluxes measured over a 1000 days and analyze how the more-abundant ion species vary over that time frame. A second major influence to the radiation field can be the contribution from Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events. In particular, the Martian surface proton flux can be enhanced by orders of magnitude on short time scales during strong events. Here, we present measurements of the proton fluxes during the SEP events MSL/RAD has so far directly measured in Gale crater.",

This indirect impact of boundary layer scheme modulate some part of convection and precipitation. This study investigated the sensitivity impact of boundary layer scheme usage in predicting seasonal precipitation over the Philippines. The study used a 24-km resolution single-year hindcast experiment from June 2005 to May 2006. Ten boundary layer schemes were investigated from WRF version 3.5.1. This study evaluated the seasonal precipitation and 2-meter air temperature using 0.25 degree daily APHRODITE product. Diurnal cycle of surface variables were investigated to evaluate the capability of the boundary layer scheme in simulating surface processes in the simulations. Air temperature and relative humidity profiles were also compared against AIRS satellite data to validate the simulated atmospheric structure. Additionally, heat and moisture budget profile analysis using ERA-Interim as a reference was also done to investigate the coupling impact of default Grell-Freitas scheme with different boundary layer schemes. The evaluation of precipitation, atmospheric structure, and budget profiles allows better understanding of the impact of boundary layer scheme usage impact on the seasonal precipitation. The results of boundary layer scheme sensitivity show that it controls the modulation on the intensity of seasonal precipitation and modulation of heating and drying profiles. Mean precipitation structure and budget profiles are mainly dependent on the cumulus scheme used. Also, local TKE type schemes showed least overestimation in seasonal precipitation while non-local type schemes showed relatively high overestimation. This overestimation tendency seen on seasonal precipitation was also observed to be consistent with overestimation tendencies in the results of heat and moisture budget profile analysis.",

            "abstract": "The incipient motion of sediment grains is of importance to quantifying the fluvial process in natural rivers. Due to its significance, the entrainment problem has been extensively investigated and a number of models have been proposed in an effort to better determine particle threshold conditions. Among various approaches, quadrant analysis is employed to relate grain activity to turbulent flow motions; for instance, entrainment is commonly referred to the turbulence quadrant event “sweep”. Nevertheless, such quadrant description based on the instantaneous velocity cannot fully resolve the mechanism of grain movement, since the velocity fluctuates more violently than the hydrodynamic force does and thus creates the “noise quadrants” that are not as effective in producing hydrodynamic forces upon sediment particles. The focus of the present work is on the development of an improved technique capable of filtering out noise quadrants and thus making the analysis more reliable.\nA synchronous velocity and pressure data set is employed to generate quadrant events and their corresponding flow forces experienced by a test grain. Then, the contribution of forces to grain movement can be determined theoretically on the basis of force balance of the grain. With so obtained mechanical representation, the effectiveness of individual quadrant events is examined on an instantaneous basis and over the duration of full particle dislodgement as well.",

            "abstract": "Glaciation of supercooled clouds through immersion freezing is an important atmospheric process affecting the formation of precipitation and the Earth’s energy budget. Currently, the climatic impact of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) is being reassessed due to increasing evidence of their diversity and abundance in the atmosphere as well as their ability to influence cloud properties. Recently, it has been found that microcrystalline cellulose (MCC; extracted from natural wood pulp) can act as an efficient INP and may add crucial importance to quantify the role of primary biological INP (BINP) in the troposphere. However, it is still unclear if the laboratory results of MCC can be representatively scaled up to the total cellulose content in the atmosphere to assess the overall role of BINPs in clouds and the climate system. Here, we use the AIDA (Aerosol Interaction and Dynamics in the Atmosphere) cloud simulation chamber in Karlsruhe, Germany to demonstrate that several important plant constituents as well as natural plant debris can act as BINPs in simulated super-cooled clouds of the lower and middle troposphere. More specifically, we measured the surface-scaled ice nucleation activity of a total 16 plant structural materials (i.e., celluloses, lignins, lipids and carbohydrates), which were dispersed and immersed in cloud droplets in the chamber, and compared to that of dried leaf powder as a model proxy for atmospheric BINPs. Using these surface-based activities, we developed parameters describing the ice nucleation ability of these particles. Subsequently, we applied them to observed airborne plant debris concentrations and compared to the background INP simulated in a global aerosol model. Our results suggest that cellulose is the most active BINPs amongst the 16 materials and the concentration of ice nucleating cellulose and plant debris to become significant (>0.1 L-1) below about -20 ˚C. Overall, our findings support the view that MCC may be a good proxy for inferring ice nucleating properties of natural plant debris. More atmospheric observations of airborne cellulose-containing particles are necessary to allow better estimates of their effects on clouds and the global climate.\nAcknowledgement: We acknowledge support by German Research Society (DFG) and Ice Nuclei research UnIT (FOR 1525 INUIT).",

New scientific understanding will be achievable with SO2 instrumentation capable of making accurate measurements in the low ppt range in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere.\nWe have developed a new laser-induced fluorescence based instrument for aircraft measurements of SO2 from the surface up to the lower stratosphere. The instrument uses a custom-built tunable fiber laser that produces > 1mW at 216.9 nm. Photons in the range 250-400 nm fluorescing from laser-excited SO2 are counted, yielding a 1-second detection limit (S:N=2) of < 20 ppt. The instrument has been compared on the ground to a commercial pulsed fluorescence instrument (TECO) and has been flown on the NASA WB-57F in the lower stratosphere.

            "abstract": "The 2009 L’Aquila earthquake (Mw 6.1), in central Italy, raised the issue of surface faulting hazard in Italy, since large urban areas were affected by surface displacement along the causative structure, the Paganica fault. Since then, guidelines for microzonation were drew up that take into consideration the problem of surface faulting in Italy, and laying the bases for future regulations about related hazard, similarly to other countries (e.g. USA). More specific guidelines on the management of areas affected by active and capable faults (i.e. able to produce surface faulting) are going to be released by National Department of Civil Protection; these would define zonation of areas affected by active and capable faults, with prescriptions for land use planning. As such, the guidelines arise the problem of the time interval and general operational criteria to asses fault capability for the Italian territory.\nAs for the chronology, the review of the international literature and regulatory allowed Galadini et al. (2012) to propose different time intervals depending on the ongoing tectonic regime – compressive or extensional – which encompass the Quaternary. As for the operational criteria, the detailed analysis of the large amount of works dealing with active faulting in Italy shows that investigations exclusively based on surface morphological features (e.g. fault planes exposition) or on indirect investigations (geophysical data), are not sufficient or even unreliable to define the presence of an active and capable fault; instead, more accurate geological information on the Quaternary space-time evolution of the areas affected by such tectonic structures is needed. A test area for which active and capable faults can be first mapped based on such a classical but still effective methodological approach can be the central Apennines.\n",

            "abstract": "This work examines the clumped isotopes and carbonate associated sulfate (CAS) within a system which is being altered from aragonite to calcite and being subjected to partial dolomitization within the marine realm. Samples were collected from Clino, a ≈670m long core which represents slope carbonates composed of varying percentages of aragonite, low-magnesium calcite (LMC), and dolomite. The concentrations of these endmembers differ dramatically over short distances and are associated with varying degrees of marine diagenesis. In the deeper water portion of the core, previous work has shown no evidence of exposure throughout nor is there any evidence for hydrothermal fluids existing in the Bahamas.\n Bulk samples were collected from the portions of the core in which dolomite was most prominent. Samples were treated and measured for CAS and for their clumped isotope value. They were then subjected to a series of buffered acetic acid leaches to remove the aragonite and LMC portion of the sample. There were up to three treatments per sample with the resulting sediment measured on XRD to determine its % dolomite composition. These treatments were then also measured for clumped isotopes.\nThe δ34S of the sediments yielded values of up to 10‰ more positive than contemporaneous sweater and implicate bacterial sulfate reduction in the formation of these dolomites. Clumped isotope results of the separates allowed for the calculation of end-member formation temperatures for the LMC and dolomite, whilst using a mixing model to account for non-linearity in ∆47 between end-member combinations and varying ∆47-temperature equations. In contrast to other dolomites in the Bahamas proposed to have formed by massive flow of normal seawater, the Clino temperatures values were significantly elevated compared to the presumed equilibrium values. These data suggest that BSR may result in carbonates with clumped isotopic values significant elevated to equilibrium.",

Normalized departure from\nan annual mean is used to quantify spatial and temporal dynamics in both water discharge and sediment flux.\nConsiderable intra-basin variability in both water and sediment discharge is observed for the first time in differ-\nent regions of the world. Continental-scale analysis shows considerable variability in water and sediment dis-\ncharge fluctuations both in time and between continents. A correlation analysis between predicted continental\nsuspended sediment and water discharge shows strong correspondence in Australia and Africa (R2 of 0.93 and 0.87 respectively), moderate correlation in North and South America (R2 of 0.64 and 0.73 respectively) and weak correlation in Asia and Europe (R2 of 0.35 and 0.24 respectively). We propose that yearly changes in\nintra-basin precipitation dynamics explain most of these differences in continental water discharge and\nsuspended sediment correlation. The mechanism proposed and demonstrated here (for the Ganges, Danube\nand Amazon Rivers) is that regions with high relief and soft lithology will amplify the effect of higher than aver-\nage precipitation by producing an increase in sediment yield that greatly exceeds increase in water discharge.",

            "abstract": "Among the challenges facing urban rivers are water stormwater runoff problems and changing water chemistry, not only from air and water pollution sources, but also from altered geology with the development of \"urban karst\". Seventy five percent of the Anacostia River in Washington, D.C. is urban or impervious. The Anacostia River experiences environmental challenges similar to those of other urban industrial rivers (heavy metal, PCB and PAH contamination). It also has Ca/Sr ratios above 200, and Na concentrations higher than Ca, and elevated ionic strength, all associated with extended chemical interaction with concrete. While these chemical characteristics have been documented in the urban areas within DC, they have not been examined in the largely suburban/mixed development tributaries of the Anacostia. Here we examine the base-flow geochemistry of the Anacostia River and its suburban tributaries (6 locations) over a year (November 2014- August 2015), concentrating on the following water chemistry variables: pH, hardness, SAR, alkalinity, Ca, Mg, Na, K, Fe, Mn, Zn, Al, Ba, Ni, total P, S, Sr, NO3-, NH4+, PO43-. NO3- and NH4+ were generally lowest in at all sites in January, but rose to between 0.5 and 2.4 mg/L in June, with highest NO3- concentrations in suburban areas. Na and Cl concentrations were 5x higher in suburban areas than urban areas during the winter months. Ca/Sr concentration ratios, were between 120 and 200 for suburban sites but increased as the sites became more urban (to a high of 240 for the most urban site). These trends have been observed in other urban streams, and correlate with percent impervious area. The data follow patterns expected for \"urban stream syndrome\" and dissolution of concrete. Suburban areas, with their relatively small streams, show greater winter salting effects than more urban areas down stream. Suburban areas also show higher NO3- (and occasionally higher NH4+) than urban areas except in winter. The data presented here demonstrates that the geochemistry of highly urbanized systems may be significantly altered and should be better understood in order to assess urban impacts on water quality.",

            "abstract": "We study the diurnal cycle of rainfall using 15-min data from 15 raingauges located along two neighboring valleys of the Central Andes of Colombia, quantifying its long-term behavior (1998-2008), and its variability at annual and interannual (ENSO) timescales. The long-term mean annual cycle is characterized by the well-known bimodal regime, with two seasons of high rainfall during April-May and September-November, owing to the meridional oscillation of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone, plus other concomitant mechanisms. The long-term mean diurnal cycle of rainfall exhibits a seemingly bimodal behavior, with peak values during the afternoon (15:00 to 17:00 LST), another peak around midnight (23:00 to 02:00 LST), and minimum values from 07:00 to 10:00 LST. But a detailed examination shows that the diurnal cycle is mostly unimodal throughout the year, with a seasonally-dependent shifting phase. From May to September rainfall maximum occurs between 22:00 and 02:00 LST, while from October to April it occurs from 13:00 to 16:00 LST (see Figure 1). During short transition periods, a bimodal diurnal cycle can be observed. Our results evidence the existence of phase-locking between the diurnal and annual cycles of rainfall. At inter-annual (ENSO) timescales, the amplitude of the diurnal cycle is reduced (augmented) during El Niño (La Niña), and the phase of the diurnal cycle remains shifting between the same hours and seasons during normal, El Niño and La Niña years, which in turn evidences phase-locking between the diurnal, annual and interannual cycles of rainfall. We provide a detailed explanation of the physical mechanisms involved in such phase-locking among those three oscillators.\nFigure 1.

            "abstract": "Measurements of the lunar magnetic field have revealed crustal remanent magnetization that is a record of ancient magnetic fields. The source of these magnetic anomalies has been debated. A key question is whether the crustal magnetization is a record of a hypothetical ancient dynamo field (that has since terminated) and/or of external transient fields generated by impact plasmas. This distinction between internal or external sources for the magnetization has broad implications for our understanding of the Moon’s geophysical history and current internal structure. Furthermore, the lunar crustal field serves as a test case for understanding remnant magnetization of other terrestrial bodies, such as Mars, Mercury and asteroids. The identification of strong anomalies at the antipodes of four of the five youngest large impact basins motivated the hypothesis that the crustal magnetization could have been produced by transient external fields created by the impacts. Some studies argued that these transient fields are created by the interaction of the ionized vapor generated by the impact with the surrounding solar wind. Here, we present an examination of this hypothesis, using magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. This constitutes the first direct MHD calculation of the magnetic fields that can be formed by this mechanism. Preliminary results show that the vapor expansion and wind compression lead to only moderate field enhancements, several orders of magnitude below the required value. Based on these results we propose that impacts probably do not produce the magnetic field responsible for the magnetization and that the source of the magnetic field is more likely to be internal. If this is true, it follows that the magnetic anomalies should be a result of local anomalies in the magnetic properties of the crust. Many of the anomalies are found on the north rim of the South-Pole-Aitkin (SPA) basin, whose creation may have produced iron-rich rocks or which may be associated with mafic dykes. Planned sample-return missions to the SPA may help determine whether such iron-rich rocks exist at the anomalies locations.",

The GPS-Acoustic derived motion relative to the interior of North America agrees with the geomagnetically-derived value within their measurement uncertainties. The time series from the early 2000’s was resurrected using two new innovations. The first innovation, a permanent benchmark that has locating channels and mating pins, allows reoccupation of an established benchmark at any later date using an ROV to replace the transponder on the benchmark. The second innovation: an autonomous platform based on a Waveglider that carries a GPS navigated acoustic transponder interrogation system that is wave and solar powered. This enables measurements to be obtained over a GPSA site without requiring a large ship, greatly reducing the cost of a GPSA measurement. Combining data at this site with data from two other GPS-Acoustic seafloor sites on the Juan de Fuca plate, makes it possible to determine a present-day Euler Pole for the Juan de Fuca – North America plates using GPS-Acoustics seafloor geodesy.",

As part of the Remote, In Situ, and Synchrotron Studies for Science and Exploration (RIS4E) investigation, we test the performance of candidate instruments and operational procedures through fieldwork expeditions that simulate lunar and asteroid environments on Earth. Our field site, Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii, is a lava field with landscape and mineralogy that represent a reasonable analog to the Moon and some differentiated asteroids. In this paper, we focus on one of the candidate instruments, the infrared multispectral imager. During field expeditions in 2014 and 2015, we explored the applicability of the multispectral imager in manned surface operations. From these expeditions, our instrument calibration techniques and data collection procedures matured. Current work focuses on assessment of data product usefulness, through comparison with detailed laboratory chemical and spectral measurements, and field descriptions of surface textures. Our field expeditions will continue in other analog locations to obtain improved understanding of the multispectral imager and its role in sampling workflow so that science return can be maximized in future human missions.",

The wide field of view covered a large geographic region above Alaska. This field was divided in software into multiple zones (115 used here), allowing independent spectra to be sampled from many directions simultaneously. As a result, it is capable of recording the wind field’s spatial variations over a wide geographic region with high spatial resolution, and to resolve these variations over time. Although such climatological studies have been performed previously using satellites, models, and narrow field Fabry-Perot interferometers, there are no published climatological studies of thermospheric winds and temperatures using either SDI data or any other technique with comparable geographic coverage and resolution. Wind summary dial plots were produced to depict the climatology of the horizontal winds and temperatures for different geomagnetic conditions and orientation of interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). Results show that horizontal winds and temperatures had a strong dependence on geospace activity and orientation of IMF. The latitudinal shears in horizontal winds were stronger when geomagnetic conditions were active compared to the latitudinal shears for quiet conditions. Also, shears appeared earlier over Poker Flat when geomagnetic conditions were active. The latitudinal shears showed more dependence on IMF when geomagnetic conditions were active than they did during quieter conditions. F-region temperatures were higher under active geomagnetic conditions than during quiet conditions. They were also observed to be higher in pre-magnetic midnight sector (duskside) than they were post-magnetic midnight (dawnside). The dependence of vertical winds on the geomagnetic activity and IMF is still under investigation.",

            "abstract": "Delta 18-O is one of our most powerful and widely used proxies, with, arguably, the fewest likely unknown unknowns. Here I will consider the d18-O evidence for the two best-known floods of mostly liquid water to the ocean, the Younger Dryas (YD) and the 8.2 ka event. The first d18-O signal of a meltwater flood in the ocean was reported 40 years ago by Kennett and Shackleton (1975) and that paper led directly to the meltwater diversion hypothesis for the origin of the YD cooling. It was later suggested by Rooth (1982) that such a flood could interrupt Nordic seas convection and trigger the YD cold episode. It was reported at this meeting last year that a candidate flood has been found in the Mackenzie River region of the western Arctic based on low d18-O and multiple other lines of evidence. The 8.2 ka event was about one-tenth the duration of the YD but with possibly higher transport, and is more difficult to detect in open marine sediments. As with the YD, it has been modeled by hosing and low salinities have been derived by temperature correcting the d18-O. The resulting low salinity was shown not to follow the prediction of the highest resolution modeling, and theory, that the fresh water would be transported mostly equatorward along the continental shelf. However, I report here that the low d18-O signal of the 8.2 ka flooding is present in new cores from near Logan Canyon on the Scotian shelf break, and in Jordan Basin, Gulf of Maine. These results substantially validate the modeling of Condron and Winsor that fresh water transport must have been along the continental shelf.",

            "abstract": "Many landscapes that were previously covered by mature tropical forests in central Panama today comprise of a mosaic of mature forest fragments, pastures and agricultural land, and regrowing secondary forests. An increasing demand for water due to urbanization and the expansion of the Panama Canal, along with a predicted transition into a dryer climatic period necessitate a better understanding regarding the effects of land use and land use history on hydrological processes. Such knowledge, including water storage, residence times, and fluxes is essential to develop effective land management strategies and propose incentives to alter land use practices to enhance hydrological services.\nTo quantify transpiration rates at different stages of secondary forest succession, we measured sap flow in forests growing for 8, ~25, and 80+ years since last known land use in the 15 km2 “Agua Salud” study area, located in central Panama. In each forest, we selected a subset of at least 15 individuals, representing the local tree size distribution, and recorded data from heat-ratio sap flow sensors every 30 minutes starting in February 2015. All instrumented trees were identified to species and compared to local species distributions.\nBasal area in the three forest types was 9.1, 10.8, and 50.2 m2 ha-1 for 8, ~25, and 80+ year old forests, respectively. Average daily transpiration was highly correlated to forest age, with highest rates in the oldest forest (3.0 to 18.2 mm ha-1 day-1), followed by intermediate (1.2 to 6.7 mm ha-1 day-1) and youngest forests (0.2 to 2.7 mm ha-1 day-1), suggesting roughly a doubling in transpiration from 8 to ~25 year old forests, despite similar basal area, and again from ~25 to 80+ year old forests. Flow rates in individual trees generally reflected the dry-to-wet season transition but behaved differently in response to the unprecedentedly dry conditions during the first half of 2015 in central Panama.",

            "abstract": "We identify variations in slow slip moment rate associated with rapid tremor reversals (RTRs) beneath Vancouver Island, in Cascadia. The RTRs were identified by Royer et. al., 2015 with their high-quality tremor catalog based on low frequency earthquakes. In most of them, tremor propagates a few tens of kilometers over a few hours.\nWe use PBO borehole strain data to search for aseismic moment rate variations associated with the reversals. We isolate components of strain that have high signal to noise ratios by avoiding components that have a strong response to atmospheric pressure. In the corrected strain data, the strain rate is systematically higher during the RTRs than during the 4 days surrounding them. On average, the strain rate increases by a factor of 2 during the reversals.\nThis factor of 2 increase in strain rate can be roughly interpreted as a factor of 2 increase in moment rate. The location of slip moves by just a few tens of kilometers during the 4-day periods of interest, so the Green’s functions do not change dramatically. If we scale this moment rate by the moment rate of the slow slip event, and account for the RTR durations, we estimate that each reversal releases a moment similar to that in a M 5 earthquake. If the along-dip width of the reversals is comparable to the width of the whole slow slip event, the estimated moment implies a stress drop of order 1 kPa. This is comparable to the tidal stresses and less than 10% of the slow slip stress drop. If the along-dip width of the RTRs is smaller---say 20 km---the aseismic moment implies a stress drop of order 5 kPa, only a factor of a few smaller than the slow slip stress drop.",

            "abstract": "The uncertainties on the Devonian stage boundaries are currently in the order of several millions of years. When shown to reflect a detrital signal, which is influenced by climatic variations, Magnetic Susceptibility (MS) has been proven as a useful tool for identifying climatic cycles; which can subsequently be used to improve the time scale.\nHere, we focus on two sections from the Prague Synform (Czech Republic) cutting through the Lochkovian, Pragian and the lower part of the Emsian. Sedimentation is rhythmic, dominated by slightly clayey offshore limestones, being mostly calciturbidites and hemipelagites. We provide hysteresis analysis in order to get insight into the nature and the origin of the magnetic minerals driving the variation in the MS signal. The results point to a MS signal mostly carried by clay minerals.\nSubsequently, to improve estimation of the duration of the stages, we apply different spectral analysis techniques on this MS signal. From the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), Evolutive Harmonic Analysis (EHA) and field observations, we subdivide the section into portions with a steady sedimentation rate (a first estimate of this rate is also delivered by these analyzes). Then, we apply Multitaper Method (MTM) and Multitaper harmonic Analysis (F-test) and extract the frequencies reaching 95% Confidence Level. These frequencies are then implemented into the Average Spectral Misfit procedures (ASM) which enables comparison with orbital targets. By combining these different techniques, 405 kyr cyclicty is identifed, a powerful duration paleochronometer. These new results indicate a duration of 7.7 ± 2 Myr for the Lochkovian stage and of 1.7 Myr ± 1.4 for the Pragian stage (compared to respectively 8.4 ± 6 Myr and 3.2 ± 5.4 Myr in the 2012 Geological Time Scale).",

            "abstract": "Erosion, transport and deposition of fine sediment (clay, silt and fine sand) influence the form and function of river systems. Excess suspended sediment degrades stream ecosystems and is implicated as a leading cause of water quality and aquatic life impairment. Consequently, understanding the factors that control fine sediment transport regimes is an interesting topic for basic science and one that has important management and policy implications. Fine sediment is mostly transported in suspension as a non-capacity load; transport rates are dependent on sediment supply in addition to a river’s transport capacity. Many studies have investigated watershed-scale topographic, hydrologic, climatic, and land use influences on fine sediment erosion and transport regimes. Several recent studies in a wide range of landscapes have demonstrated that the majority of suspended sediment may be sourced from the near-channel environment; therefore, near-channel morphological characteristics may provide better predictive power compared to watershed averages.\nThis study analyzes recent total suspended solids (TSS) data from 45 gages on 35 separate rivers. The rivers span the state of Minnesota, draining basins ranging from 33 km2 to 68100 km2 with distinct settings in terms of topography, land cover, hydrology and geologic history. We generate rating curves of the form TSS = aQb, where Q is normalized discharge and a and b are parameters that describe the shape of the relations. Values of a range from 4 to 138 mg/L; b values range from -0.53 to 1.86. We use high resolution lidar topography data to characterize the near-channel environment upstream of gages. In addition to commonly studied metrics describing the topographic, climatic/hydrologic and land use setting of the basin, we extract near-channel morphometrics that we hypothesize to influence fine sediment generation and transport: the difference in height of banks/bluffs (a measure of the amount of material available to be entrained by fluvial erosion) and stream power (a measure of the erosive power of the stream) upstream of gages. We analyze the relationship between the basin and channel features and the rating parameters to identify morphological characteristics that provide the greatest explanatory power regarding controls on the transport regime.",

Heterogeneity of aerosol system over the Bay of Bengal is mainly determined by three distinct source regions, which are east coast of India/central India, China/east Asia and Arabian region. Continental aerosols transported through higher elevations over BoB lead to significant impacts in regional climate by modifying the vertical thermal structure of the atmosphere and associated circulation dynamics. The study aims at a comprehensive understanding on the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of elevated aerosol over the BoB using the observations of Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aboard Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO). Being capable of short wave scattering and long wave absorption, mineral dust aerosols can affects the energetics of the atmosphere over any region.Owing to its influence on Indian monsoon rainfall and regional climate, the study aims to comprehend on the spatial and seasonal variation of mineral dust transport over the Bay of Bengal. vertical distribution of the dust extinction coefficient over the Bay of Bengal for all seasons, is derived, using a dust separation scheme that uses the depolarization measurements, a priori information on lidar ratio of dust, depolarization ratio of dust and that of non-dust aerosols. Being highly non-spherical, mineral dust significantly depolarize the radiation and possess distinct range of depolarization ratio. This property of dust is made use to identify and quantify dust over the study region. Seasonal variation of dust fraction over the Bay of Bengal is estimated seperately from CALIPSO back scattering coefficients , MODIS AOD and fine-mode fraction and GOCART simulations and found that they are agreeing reasonably. Premonsoon time over the Indian region is found to be relatively dust dominated and winter time is more or less devoid of dust transport.",

            "abstract": "Intermittent and ephemeral streams account for over half of the total discharge of the global river network and their extent is expected to increase as a result of forecasted changes in climate and water resource development. Recognizing the importance of stream flow as the master variable driving physical, chemical, and biological processes in fluvial systems there is inherent utility in predicting which regions of the landscape support varying degrees of flow permanence (e.g., perennial, intermittent, and ephemeral flow). Easily derivable landscape characteristics and readily available climate data may be useful for identifying streamflow permanence. We use local precipitation records and GIS-derived geologic and topographic descriptors to identify potential determinants of flow permanence in streams draining the Huachuca Mountains, Arizona, USA. Flow permanence is based on 2- to 4-year time series for 43 electrical resistance sensors installed across 10 canyons in stream reaches that support a range of hydrologic flow conditions. Multivariate NMDS analysis identifie separation between stream reaches of different flow permanence classes based on subbasin-scale, GIS-derived landscape metrics. In particular, separation between perennial and ephemeral reaches is driven by steep surface slopes and small drainage areas that support perennial flow and which correspond to the location of specific geologic units. Ephemeral and intermittent reaches are also highly responsive to precipitation events, specifically, late summer convective thunderstorms with spatial extents limited to individual canyons or portions of a canyon. Further separation of landscape and precipitation characteristics is expected between flow classes that account for refined flow permanence metrics including seasonal timing and duration of flow. Our results demonstrate that for this system, easily derivable metrics and available climate data serve as useful metrics for prediction of flow permanence.",

Consistency of our solutions for widely ranging input parameters indicates how additional heat transfer mechanisms (mantle magmatism and convection) affect thermal evolution of the core. We consider 1) interior starting temperatures (T) of 273-5000 K, which represent variations in primordial heat, 2) different distributions and decay of long-lived radioactive isotopes, 3) additional heat sources in the core (primordial or latent heat), and 4) variable depth-T dependence of D. Our new analytical solution for cooling of a constant D sphere validates our numerical results. The bottom line is that the thermally insulating nature of minerals, combined with constraints of spherical geometry, limits steep thermal gradients to the upper mantle, consistent with the short length scale (x ~700 km) of cooling over t = 4.5 Ga indicated by dimensional analysis [x2 ~ 4Dt], and with plate tectonics. Consequently, interior temperatures vary little so the core has remained hot and is possibly warming.\nFindings include: 1) Constant vs. variable D affects thermal profiles only in detail, with D for the metallic core being inconsequential. 2) The hottest zone in Earth may lie in the uppermost lower mantle; 3) Most radiogenic heat is released in Earth’s outermost 1000 km thereby driving an active outer shell; 4) Earth’s core is essentially isothermal and is thus best described by the liquid-solid phase boundary; 5) Deeply sequestered radioactivity or other heat will melt the core rather than by run the dynamo (note that the heat needed to have melted the outer core is 10% of radiogenic heat generated over Earth’s history); 6) Inefficient cooling of an Earth-sized mass means that heat essentially remains where it is generated, until it is removed by magmatism; 7) Importantly, the observed plate velocities are consistent with a Nusselt number of 1, i.e. the present day cooling is essentially conductive. Conductive cooling plus magmatism largely governs Earth’s thermal structure and dynamics, below a unicellular upper mantle. Core dynamics and magnetism are likely driven by rotational effects.",

Within the sand bodies, there is a prominent negative polarity seismic reflection (opposite phase to the seafloor reflector) that we interpret to record the boundary between gas hydrate above and free gas below. This anomaly is the Bottom Simulating Reflector (BSR) and the base of the Gas Hydrate Stability Zone (BGHSZ). Above the BSR, reflection seismic data record these reservoirs with a positive polarity while below it, they record the reservoirs with a negative polarity event. Within the sand bodies, seismic amplitudes are generally strongest immediately above and below the BSR and weaken in updip and downdip directions. Beneath the BSR, two of the reservoirs have a strong negative amplitude event that parallels structure that we interpret to record a gas-water contact, while the third reservoir does not clearly record this behavior. Much like the seafloor, the BSR is bowl-shaped, occurring at greatest depths in the northwest and rising near salt bodies in the south and east. In the north east area of previous exploration, the BSR is found at a depth of 2868 meters below sealevel, implying a geothermal gradient of 20.1oC/km for type I hydrates. Logging while drilling data reveal that the sands are composed of numerous thin, hydrocarbon-charged, coarse-grained sediments. Hydrate saturation in these sands is greatest near the BGHSZ. Pressure coring is proposed for three wells that will penetrate the reservoirs at different structural elevations in order to further elucidate reservoir conditions of the sands.",

            "abstract": "While overall, deltas account for only 1% of global land area, they are home to more than a half billion people or ca. 7% of the world’s population. In many deltas, livelihoods and food security are strongly dependent on ecosystem services, which in turn are affected by various environmental change factors, including climate variability and change, modifications to upstream river, sediment and nutrient fluxes, evolving nearshore ecosystems, and delta-level change factors such as subsidence, changing land use and management interventions such as polders. Key limits include scarcity of fresh water, saline water intrusion and the impacts of extreme events (e.g. river floods, cyclones and storm surges), which constrain land use choices and livelihood opportunities for the deltaic populations.\nThe ESPA Deltas project takes a systemic perspective of the interaction between the coupled bio-physical environment and the livelihoods of rural delta residents. The methods emphasise poverty reduction and use coastal Bangladesh as an example. This includes a set of consistent biophysical analyses of the delta and the upstream catchments and the downstream Bay of Bengal, as well as governance and policy analysis and socio-demographic analysis, including an innovative household survey on ecosystem utilization. These results are encapsulated in an integrated model that analyses ecosystem services and livelihood implications. This integrated approach is designed to support delta-level policy formulation. It allows the exploration of contrasting development trajectories, including issues such as robustness of different governance options on ecosystem services and livelihoods. The method is strongly participatory including an ongoing series of stakeholder workshops addressing issue identification, scenario development and consideration of policy responses. The methods presented are generic and transferable to other deltas. The paper will consider the overall ESPA Deltas project and its wider lessons for integrated assessment of deltaic environments.",

            "abstract": "Titan, Saturn’s planet-like moon with a thick atmosphere consists mainly of N2 (98.4 %) and CH4 (1.4%). It is debated whether the N2 is primordial, or the NH3, which later converted to N2 by physic-chemical processes and, if NH3 is primordial, what is the source of that material: Saturnian-subnebula or the comets? N2 is enriched in 15N (14N/15N = 160 compared to 272 for Earth) and in geochemical terminology, d15Nair = 700 ‰ (parts per thousand with respect to ambient air). On the same scale the solar wind and Jupiter’s atmosphere are ~ -400 ‰ (depleted in 15N). The comets (NH3 and HCN) and insoluble organic matter in meteorites are also enriched in 15N in the range up to a few thousand ‰. On the contrary, the carbon isotopic ratio in CH4 in Titan is similar to the other solar system bodies (12C/13C~ 89).\nWe have performed extensive low temperature (80 K) photodissociation of N2 and CO (in presence of H2) at VUV wavelengths to measure the isotopic fractionation in the products. The integrated instantaneous fractionation in the product NH3 is about 1000 ‰ over the N2 dissociation regime (80-100 nm), which arise due to quantum mechanical selection rules. CO2 and CH4, the products of CO photodissociation, show contradictory results for two elements. While product O (trapped in CO2) is enriched by few thousand ‰, there is no significant C isotopic enrichment in CH4. These laboratory measurements along with the measurements by Cassini–Huygens spacecraft constrain the origin of volatiles in Titan’s atmosphere and indicate that Titan accreted comet-like NH3 and CH4, which are the 1st generation photolysis products (of the remaining materials after the formation of gas giants) in the solar nebula. Later, NH3 converted to N2 in a bulk fashion (within Titan) and retained mostly identical isotopic composition. 15N enrichment measured in HCN in the present day atmosphere (d15Nair > 1500 ‰), is possibly from the 2nd generation N2 photolysis in Titan’s modern atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Turbulence generated in electrically conductive liquid interiors of planetary bodies may be due, in part, to mechanical forcing through geophysically relevant mechanisms of precession/nutation, librations, tidal forcing, and collisions. Using experimental particle image velocimetry techniques accompanied by selected high-resolution numerical simulations, we show, for the first time, the generation of bulk-filling turbulence driven by high frequency tidal forcing. The transition to sustained turbulence is characterized by a succession of resonances first between the tidally forced ellipsoidal base flow with two primary inertial modes and subsequently between secondary inertial modes and the primary inertial modes. Furthermore, deviations in the amplitude of the time-averaged retrograde zonal flow suggest an as yet unseen secondary flow transition that may promote additional turbulence.\nThe turbulence generated by high frequency, low amplitude tidal forcing is similar to the libration-driven turbulent flows studied by Grannan et al. [2014] and Favier et al. [2015]. These works reveal the universal fluid response to elliptical instability driven by separate models that correspond, in geophysical terms, to two end member types of mechanical forcing. In the first, non-synchronous satellites possess elastically deformable boundaries such that shape of the distortion has a non-zero mean motion. In the second, the core-mantle boundary of a body possesses an inherently rigid or tidally frozen-in ellipsoidal shape in a synchronous orbit such that the mean motion of the elliptically deformed boundary is zero. Although the strength of the mechanical forcing is much weaker at planetary settings, the corresponding viscous dissipation is also weaker and thus may still permit the generation of the same turbulent flow found in both experiments and numerical simulations. The efficacy of such turbulent flows in magnetic field generation and dissipation is currently being pursued using high resolution numerical simulations and may prove to be geophysically relevant in a variety of bodies that experience tide-driven and libration-driven forcing.",

Urban areas have different albedo, heat and hydraulic capacity and conductivity, roughness, emissivity, and transmissivity, when compared to naturally vegetated areas. This set of characteristics may change the surface energy budget, air temperature, humidity, atmospheric chemical composition, wind direction and velocity, and therefore the planetary boundary layer (PBL) development. The effects of urbanization on the PBL have been studied in many mid-latitude areas, however in the tropical or subtropical areas they are scarce. The MCITY Brazil project developed in 2 cities of Brazil, Sao Paulo (23°32' S) and Rio de Janeiro (latitude 22° 55' S), has provided the necessary data to properly investigate the effects of urbanization in these two cities. The project included a campaign of soundings launched every 3 hours for 10 consecutive days in August (Austral winter) from an airport at the north part of the city of Sao Paulo, that allowed the study of the PBL development, and also the measurements of the components of the energy budget equation by micrometeorological towers. Therefore, the goal of this work is to simulate the development of the PBL in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo during winter, comparing its characteristics in urbanized and non urbanized sites, in order to assess the impact of urbanization on the development of the PBL in this area. The model used is the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) with a single layer urban canopy parameterization (SLUCM) and realistic anthropogenic heat diurnal evolution. Preliminary results showed that the model is able to reproduce the PBL development during the campaign, including the passage of a cold-frontal system. The urban PBL reaches greater heights during the day than the PBL in non urban sites, suggesting that the urban sites generate more turbulence. Daytime urban PBL height reaches up to 2000 m and nighttime is usually less than 200 m. The surface turbulent fluxes and the energy budget near the surface will also be compared to observations and discussed.",

            "abstract": "The capacity of the forest canopy to intercept precipitation and partition the remaining water into throughfall and stemflow largely influences the surface water budget in forested ecosystems. These processes are controlled by species-specific traits, canopy seasonality, and meteorological conditions. The complexity of these interacting factors at varying temporal and spatial scales can lead to errors in estimating canopy interception and reduce accuracy of derivative watershed hydrologic modeling efforts. To improve interception estimates, model calibration and validation must be assessed using long-term, fine-scale field measurements that capture the variability of all interacting factors. As such, field measurements of subcanopy hydrologic fluxes and meteorological conditions during discrete storm events were taken from 2007 to 2012 in a deciduous forest dominated by Fagus grandifolia and Liriodendron tulipifera in Fair Hill, Maryland, USA.\nPreliminary results suggest that many of the current interception models (e.g., Gash and Rutter-types) are driven primarily by evaporation terms. However, field measurements indicate that a large degree of variability in both throughfall and stemflow partitioning is derived from biophysical characteristics. For example, even within the small 12-hectare research catchment, differences in species composition induced by slight changes in elevation, coupled with slope orientation, resulted in sufficient canopy variability whereby throughfall fluxes were definitively different across small distances. Additionally, smaller trees were more efficient in generating stemflow, while species with smoother bark generated large quantities of stemflow under a variety of storm conditions—a mechanism that may further confound modeling efforts. To improve canopy interception estimates, model sensitivity analysis was used to determine the influence of current model parameters and how biophysical canopy characteristics may be further integrated into such models.",

            "abstract": "Minnesota has abundant freshwater resources, yet concerns about water-impacts of energy and mining development are increasing. Statewide, total annual water withdrawals have increased, and, in some watersheds, withdrawals make up a large fraction of available water. The energy and mining sectors play a critical role in determining water availability, as water is used to irrigate biofuel feedstock crops, cool thermoelectric plants, and process and transport fuels and iron ore. We evaluated the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Water and Reporting System (MPARS) dataset (1988-2014) to identify regions where energy and mining-related water withdrawals are high or where they are increasing. The energy and mining sectors account for over 65 percent of total water extractions in Minnesota, but this percentage is greater in some regions. In certain southern and northeastern Minnesota watersheds, these extractions account for 90 percent of total water demand. Sensitivity to these demands is not dependent on total water demand alone, and is also not uniform among watersheds. We identified and evaluated factors influencing sensitivity, including population, extraction type (surface water or groundwater), percentage of increased demand, and whether withdrawals are consumptive or not. We determined that southern Minnesota is particularly sensitive to increased water demands, because of growing biofuel and sand extraction industries (the products of which are used in hydraulic fracturing). In the last ten years, ethanol production in Minnesota has increased by 440 percent, and over fifteen refineries (each with a capacity over 1.1 billion gallons), have been built. These users primarily extract from surface water bodies within a few watersheds, compromising local supplies. As these energy-related industries continue to grow, so will the demand for freshwater resources. Determining regional sensitivity to increased demands will allow policy-makers to manage the increased competition for Minnesota’s future water supplies.",

Understanding these consequences for better scientific insights and effective decision-making unarguably requires accurate information on urban extent and its spatial distributions. In this study, we developed a cluster-based method to estimate the optimal thresholds and map urban extents from the nighttime light remote sensing data, extended this method to the global domain by developing a computational method (parameterization) to estimate the key parameters in the cluster-based method, and built a consistent 20-year global urban map series to evaluate the time-reactive nature of global urbanization (e.g. 2000 in Fig. 1). Supported by urban maps derived from nightlights remote sensing data and socio-economic drivers, we developed an integrated modeling framework to project future urban expansion by integrating a top-down macro-scale statistical model with a bottom-up urban growth model. With the models calibrated and validated using historical data, we explored urban growth at the grid level (1-km) over the next two decades under a number of socio-economic scenarios. The derived spatiotemporal information of historical and potential future urbanization will be of great value with practical implications for developing adaptation and risk management measures for urban infrastructure, transportation, energy, and water systems when considered together with other factors such as climate variability and change, and high impact weather events.",

            "abstract": "The clay mineralogy of fault gouges has important implications on frictional properties and stability of fault planes. We studied the specific case of the Galera fault zone where fault gouges containing Mg-rich phyllosilicates appear as hydrothermal deposits related to high salinity fluids enriched in Mg2+. These deposits are dominated by sepiolite and palygorskite, both fibrous clay minerals with similar composition to Mg-smectite. The frictional strengths of sepiolite and palygorskite have not yet been determined, however, as they are part of the clay mineral group, it has been assumed that their frictional behaviour would be in line with platy clay minerals.\nWe performed frictional sliding experiments on powdered pure standards and fault rocks in order to establish the frictional behaviour of sepiolite and palygorskite using a triaxial deformation apparatus with a servo-controlled axial loading system and fluid pressure pump. Friction coefficients for palygorskite and sepiolite as monomineralic samples were found to be 0.65 to 0.7 for dry experiments, and 0.45 to 0.5 for water-saturated experiments. Although these fibrous minerals are part of the phyllosilicates group, they show higher friction coefficients and their mechanical behaviour is less stable than platy clay minerals. This difference is a consequence of their stronger structural framework and the discontinuity of water layers.\nOur results present a contrast in mechanical behaviour between Mg-rich fibrous and platy clay minerals in fault gouges, where smectite is known to considerably reduce friction coefficients and to increase the stability of the fault plane leading to creeping processes. Transformations between saponite and sepiolite have been previously observed and could modify the deformation regime of a fault zone. Constraining the stability conditions and possible mineral reactions or transformations in fault gouges could help us understand the general role of clay minerals in fault stability.",

            "abstract": "Concentrations of fresh shallow valleys (FSVs) on Mars occur between ~30-45° in both hemispheres as well as near the equator (e.g., Gale crater and vicinity). FSVs in the northern hemisphere occur along the dichotomy boundary, with the highest concentration in northern Arabia Terra from 35-40°N between 0-20ºE. In this region, FSVs developed both on and away from ejecta of relatively fresh craters, making the direct association between impact processes and formation less likely. Crater statistics and cross-cutting relationships indicate the formation of FSVs terminated prior to about 1.4 Ga, suggesting they may be contemporaneous with alluvial fan and delta formation in the equatorial and mid-latitudes. Many FSV systems are 150+ km long, and in several cases appear to cross depressions that were likely filled with ice or water during FSV formation. Most FSV systems could have formed from a single episode of erosion but incision of the main channel in some locations may imply episodic formation. One long valley system in N. Arabia Terra with an incised channel (100 m wide, up to 10 m deep) yields formative discharges in the range of 100-200 m3/s assuming sand sized particles and a flow depth of 0.25 m, consistent with formation via snowmelt. The grain size is unknown, therefore discharges could range from 10s m3/s for active transport of fine sand to 1000 m3/s for gravel sized grains. Approximately 25 small craters (diameters ranging from ~2-10 km) have single channels extending outward from their rim, implying overflow of the crater and the possible presence of a deep lake. Widespread occurrence of FSVs, their similar morphology, and modest state of degradation is consistent with most forming during one or more global intervals of favorable climate, likely through snowmelt from surface or sub‐ice flows during the Hesperian.",

            "abstract": "Most of the (sub)tropical oceans within the Hadley circulation experience either moderate subsidence or weak ascent. In these regions shallow trade-wind clouds prevail, whose vertical and spatial distribution have emerged as key factors determining the sensitivity of our climate in global climate models. A large unknown is how large the effect of these clouds should be. For instance, how sensitive is the radiation budget to variations in the distribution of trade-wind cloudiness in nature? How variable is trade-wind cloudiness in the first place? And do we understand the role of the large-scale flow in that variability?\nIn this talk we present how space-borne remote sensing and reanalysis products combined with ground-based remote sensing and high resolution modeling at a representative location start to answer these questions and help validate climate models.\nWe show that across regimes or seasons with moderate subsidence and weak ascent the cloud radiative effect and low-level cloudiness vary remarkably little. A negative feedback mechanism of convection on cloudiness near the lifting condensation level is used to explain this insensitivity. The main difference across regimes is a moderate change in cloudiness in the upper cloud layer, whereby the presence of a trade-wind inversion and strong winds appear a prerequisite for larger cloudiness. However, most variance in cloudiness at that level takes place on shorter time scales, with an important role for the deepening of individual clouds and local patterns in vertical motion induced by convection itself, which can significantly alter the trade-wind layer structure.\nTrade-wind cloudiness in climate models in turn is overly sensitive to changes in the large-scale flow, because relationships that separate cloudiness across regimes in long-term climatologies, which have inspired parameterizations, also act on shorter time scales. We discuss how these findings relate to recent explanations for the spread in modeled climate sensitivity. Furthermore, we hypothesize what the relatively insensitivity of trade-wind cloudiness in nature implies about its role in the Hadley circulation.",

            "abstract": "Co-seismic along-strike slip heterogeneity is widely observed for many surface-rupturing earthquakes as revealed by field and high-resolution geodetic methods. However, this co-seismic slip variability is currently a poorly understood phenomenon. Key unanswered questions include: What are the characteristics and underlying causes of along-strike slip variability? Do the properties of slip variability change from fault-to-fault, along-strike or at different scales? We cross-correlate optical, pre- and post-event air photos using the program COSI-Corr to measure the near-field, surface deformation pattern of the 1992 Mw = 7.3 Landers and 1999 Mw = 7.1 Hector Mine earthquakes in high-resolution. We produce the co-seismic slip profiles of both events from over 1,500 displacement measurements and observe consistent along-strike slip variability. Although the observed slip heterogeneity seems apparently complex and disordered, a spectral analysis reveals that the slip distributions are self-affine fractal and variations of slip are not random. We find a fractal dimension of 1.68 + 0.25 and 1.58 + 0.30 for the Landers and Hector Mine earthquakes, respectively, indicating the slip distribution is rougher for the former. We show deterministically that the wavelength and amplitude of slip fluctuations of both earthquakes can be directly correlated to points of geometrical fault complexities (such as stepovers, kinks or bends) of similar size. We find the correlation of the wavelength of slip fluctuations to the size of geometrical fault complexities at all observable length scales, can explain why the complex surface rupture of the Landers earthquake has a rougher slip distribution than the geometrically simpler surface rupture of the Hector Mine event. Our results address longstanding questions concerning co-seismic slip variability, resulting in a more complete understanding of the relationship between slip distributions and fault structure.",

            "abstract": "Human alteration to forests has had lasting effects on stream channels worldwide. Such land use changes affect how wood enters and is stored in streams as individual pieces and as logjams. Changes in wood recruitment affect the complexity and benefits wood can provide to the stream environment, such as zones of flow separation that store fine sediment and organic matter, increased nutrient processing, and greater habitat potential, which can enhance biota and cascade through stream-riparian ecosystems.\nPrevious research in our study area shows that modern headwater streams flowing through old-growth, unmanaged forests have more wood than streams in young, managed forests, but does not explicitly evaluate how wood affects channel complexity or local ecology. ‘Managed’ refers to forests previously or currently exposed to human alteration. Alteration has long since ceased in some areas, but reduced wood loads in managed streams persist.\nOur primary objective was to quantify stream complexity metrics, with instream wood as a mediator, on streams across a gradient of management and disturbance histories in order to examine legacy effects of human alteration to forests. Data collected in the Southern Rocky Mountains include 24 2nd to 3rd order subalpine streams categorized into: old-growth unmanaged; younger, naturally disturbed unmanaged; and younger managed.\nWe assessed instream wood loads and logjams and evaluated how they relate to channel complexity using a number of metrics, such as standard deviation of bed and banks, volume of pools, ratios of stream to valley lengths and stream to valley area, and diversity of substrate, gradient, and morphology. Preliminary results show that channel complexity is directly related to instream wood loads and is greatest in streams in old-growth. Related research in the field area indicates that streams with greater wood loads also have increased nutrient processing and greater abundance and diversity of aquatic insect predators.",

(2015), we apply these findings to specific CME events for which there are both SOHO and STEREO coronagraph imagery available. Using a list of 75 events established as part of an internal, on-going validation and verification study of WSA-Enlil at SWPC, we categorize the CMEs as falling into one of four classes: (1) slow CME in slow wind, (2) slow CME in fast wind, (3) fast CME in slow wind, and (4) fast CME in fast wind, where we define slow CMEs as having radial ejecta speeds of <500km/s and fast CMEs as having radial ejecta speeds of >800km/s. Events that show significant variation between fits by different individuals are identified, and the variations in the parameters characterizing the CME ejecta are used to generate an ensemble set of CME input parameters. The ensemble members are modeled using the coupled WSA-Enlil solar wind model (WSA V2.6 and Enlil V2.7e) to obtain a range of estimates for the CME arrival time at Earth. These ensemble results are then compared to the findings of the Pizzo et al. (2015) study to determine whether the results from this hypothetical study are consistent with observed events.",

The goal of injecting 1 million tonnes of CO2 over a three year period was reached in November 2014 and the project is now in the post injection site closure (PISC) phase. A number of seismic methods are being utilized in the IBDP PISC plume monitoring program. These include time lapse three-dimensional (3D) vertical seismic profile (VSP) surveys, time-lapse surface seismic surveys, and passive seismic monitoring.\nWhile each seismic monitoring method has inherent spatial resolution and imaging footprint characteristics, all fundamentally rely on variation of reservoir elastic properties in response to injection induced changes in saturation and pressure conditions. These variations in elastic properties, and the resulting time-lapse seismic response, are often subtle and non-unique with respect to saturation and pressure effects. Elastic properties of saturated porous media may be estimated using rock physics theory and fluid substitution methods; however, the complexity of typical reservoir rock and fluid systems under injection conditions, and the subtlety of the resulting changes in elastic properties, dictate the need for representative estimates of the reservoir geologic framework, reservoir rock physics, and the anticipated plume geometry.\nAt IBDP a “simulation-to-seismic” workflow has been used to develop accurate estimates of 3D time-lapse elastic property and seismic signal responses for CO2 plumes generated using a calibrated compositional flow simulation model. The anticipated time-lapse response for the IBDP surface and VSP time-lapse surveys have been estimated using ranges of rock physics parameters derived from geophysical logs. These investigations highlight the importance of geologic controls on plume geometry in monitoring program design as well as during model-based interpretation of time-lapse seismic data.",

            "abstract": "A number of challenges arise as numerical simulations of the atmospheric boundary layer flow move to higher and higher resolution. One is in the representation of the topography: at higher resolutions, more terrain details can be represented, and therefore the maximum resolved slope of the terrain increases to the point where it cannot be accommodated by traditional terrain-following coordinates. An immersed boundary method has been implemented in a mesoscale model for that purpose, so that terrain slopes of any magnitude can be included, such as urban geometries or steep mountains. Another challenge as models move to higher resolution is in the choice of the turbulence closure model. At coarse, mesoscale resolutions (~ 10 km horizontal spacing), a Reynolds-averaged approach is used. At fine resolutions (less than about 100 m), large-eddy simulation closures can be used. The intermediate scales are called the gray zone, and significant problems occur when either LES or RANS closures are used. These challenges are evaluated in the context of multi-scale simulations using grid nesting for atmospheric boundary layer flow studies.",

The most obvious (and in many cases the most significant) aspect of a dune system is the pattern of dune crest lines. Extracting meaningful features such as crest length, orientation, spacing, bifurcations, and merging of crests from image data can reveal important information about the specific dune-field morphological properties, development, and response to changes in boundary conditions, but manual methods are labor-intensive and time-consuming. We are developing the capability to recognize and characterize patterns of sand dunes on planetary surfaces. Our goal is to develop a robust methodology and the necessary algorithms for automated or semi-automated extraction of dune morphometric information from image data.\nOur main approach uses image processing methods to extract gradient information from satellite images of dune fields. Typically, the gradients have a dominant magnitude and orientation. In many cases, the images have two major dominant gradient orientations, for the sunny and shaded side of the dunes. A histogram of the gradient orientations is used to determine the dominant orientation. A threshold is applied to the image based on gradient orientations which agree with the dominant orientation. The contours of the binary image can then be used to determine the dune crest-lines, based on pixel intensity values. Once the crest-lines have been extracted, the morphological properties can be computed. We have tested our approach on a variety of images of linear and crescentic (transverse) dunes and compared dune detection algorithms with manually-digitized dune crest lines, achieving true positive values of 0.57-0.99; and false positives values of 0.30-0.67, indicating that out approach is generally robust.",

            "abstract": "Investigation of oceanic earthquakes can play an important role in constraining the lateral and depth variations of the stress and strain-rate fields in oceanic lithosphere and of the thickness of the seismogenic layer as a function of lithosphere age, thereby providing us with critical insight into thermal and dynamic processes associated with the cooling and evolution of oceanic lithosphere. With the goal of estimating hypocentral depths more accurately, we observe clear water reverberations after the direct P wave on teleseismic records of oceanic earthquakes and develop a technique to estimate earthquake depths by using these reverberations. The Z-H grid search method allows the simultaneous determination of the sea floor depth (H) and earthquake depth (Z) with an uncertainty less than 1 km, which compares favorably with alternative approaches. We apply this method to two closely located earthquakes beneath the eastern Pacific. These earthquakes occur in ≈25 Ma-old lithosphere and were previously estimated to have very similar depths of ≈10–12 km. We find that the two events actually occurred at dissimilar depths of 2.5 km and 16.8 km beneath the seafloor, respectively within the oceanic crust and lithospheric mantle. The shallow and deep events are determined to be a thrust and normal earthquake, respectively, indicating that the stress field within the oceanic lithosphere changes from horizontal compression to horizontal extension as depth increases, which is consistent with the prediction of the lithospheric cooling model. Furthermore, we show that the P-axis of the newly investigated thrust-faulting earthquake is roughly perpendicular to that of the previously studied thrust event, consistent with the predictions of the shrinking-plate hypothesis.",

            "abstract": "The Anthropocene has been suggested as a new interval of geological time in which the influence of human activities on the Earth’s surface and its geological record dominates over natural processes. A major challenge in demarcating such an interval is that the balance between human-influenced and natural processes varies over spatial and temporal scales owing to the inherent variability both of human activities (e.g. as associated with differing cultural norms and modes of development) and natural drivers (e.g. tectonic activity). Against this backdrop, this paper considers how geomorphology might contribute towards the Anthropocene debate. We focus on how human activities impact on the aeolian, fluvial, cryospheric and coastal process domains, and how evidence of this impact is preserved in sedimentary records. We also consider the evidence for an explicitly anthropogenic geomorphology that includes artificial slopes and other human-created landforms. This provides the basis for discussing the theoretical and practical contributions that geomorphology can make to defining an Anthropocene stratigraphy. It is clear that the relevance of the Anthropocene concept varies considerably amongst different branches of geomorphology depending on the history of human actions in different process domains; for example, evidence of human dominance is more widespread in fluvial and coastal records than in aeolian and cryospheric records. Evidence for an Anthropocene based on geomorphological evidence would therefore inevitably comprise a highly diachronous lower boundary. Even to identify this there would be the need for research that focuses on the disambiguation of human effects on geomorphology and geomorphological signatures using a combination of modelling and new techniques rather than an arbitrary ‘war of possible boundaries’. Furthermore geomorphology should be concerned with processes and landform evolution providing the science in this time of critical geological transition.",

Mazama (δD=-149‰, 2.3wt% H2Ot) in isotopically labeled water (+650 ‰ δD, +56 ‰ δ18O) and observed that the H2Ot and δ18O values remained constant, but the δD values of ash increased with the surrounding water at 20, 40 and 70 °C. We expand on this work by conducting a similar experiment with ash from the 640 ka Lava Creek Tuff (LCT, δD of -128 ‰; 2.1 wt.% H2Ot) eruption of Yellowstone to see if significantly older glass (with a hypothesized gel layer on the surface shielding the interior from alteration) produces the same results. We have experiments running at 70, 24, and 5 °C, and periodically remove ~1.5 mg of glass to measure the δD (‰) and H2Ot (wt.%) of water extracted from the glass on a TC/EA MAT 253 continuous flow system. After 600 hours, the δD of the samples left at 5 and 24 °C remains at -128 ‰, but increased 8‰ for the 70 °C run series. However, there is no measurable change in wt.% of H2Ot, indicating that hydrogen exchange is not dictated by the addition of water. We are measuring and will report further progress of isotope exchange. We also plan to analyze the water in the LCT glass for δ18O (‰) to see if, as is the case for the Mt. Mazama glass, the δ18O (‰) remains constant. We also analyzed Mt. Mazama glass from the Nolan and Bindeman (2013) experiments that have now been sitting in isotopically labeled water at room temperature for ~5 years. The water concentration is still unchanged (2.3 wt.% H2Ot), and the δD of the water in the glass is now -111 ‰, causing an increase of 38 ‰. Our preliminary results show that exchange of hydrogen isotopes of hydrated glass is not limited by the age of the glass, and that the testing of hydrogen isotopes of secondarily hydrated glass, regardless of age, may not be a reliable paleoclimate indicator.",

            "abstract": "Lightning strikes have significant impacts on the aviation industry, causing damages and outages to air traffic control equipment and facilities at airports that result in major disruptions in civilian air travel, compounding delays during storm events and leading to losses worth millions of dollars [1] to the air transportation industry. Climate change is projected to increase the occurrence and severity of storms in the future with potential for increases in lightning activity as well. Accurate prediction of the intensity and frequency of lightning strikes is therefore required by the air traffic management and control sector to develop more robust adaptation and mitigation strategies under the threat of global climate change. In this work, we use the geographically weighted regression method to predict lightning strikes over several regions over the contiguous United Sates using two meteorological variables namely, convective available potential energy (CAPE) and total precipitation rate. Specifically, CAPE multiplied by precipitation is used as a proxy for lightning strikes owing to a strong linear relationship between the two. These two meteorological variables are obtained from a subset of models used in phase 5 of the coupled model inter-comparison experiment pertaining to the “high emissions” climate change scenario corresponding to the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5. This scenario indicates a doubling of CAPE and precipitation resulting in significant increases in CAPE×precipitation by the end of the century, and therefore a substantial increase in lightning strike intensity that has profound implications for the aviation industry. Overall, this research highlights the use of global climate models to assess climate change impacts on the aviation sector.",

            "abstract": "In the Minnesota River Basin, sediments originating from failing stream banks and bluffs account for the majority of the riverine load and contribute to water quality impairments in the Minnesota River as well as portions of the Mississippi River upstream of Lake Pepin. One approach for mitigating this problem may be targeted wetland restoration in Minnesota River Basin tributaries in order to reduce the magnitude and duration of peak flow events which contribute to bluff and stream bank failures. In order to determine effective arrangements and properties of wetlands to achieve peak flow reduction, we are employing a genetic algorithm approach coupled with a SWAT model of the Cottonwood River, a tributary of the Minnesota River. The genetic algorithm approach will evaluate combinations of basic wetland features as represented by SWAT: surface area, volume, contributing area, and hydraulic conductivity of the wetland bottom. These wetland parameters will be weighed against economic considerations associated with land use trade-offs in this agriculturally productive landscape. Preliminary results show that the SWAT model is capable of simulating daily hydrology very well and genetic algorithm evaluation of wetland scenarios is ongoing. Anticipated results will include (1) combinations of wetland parameters that are most effective for reducing peak flows, and (2) evaluation of economic trade-offs between wetland restoration, water quality, and agricultural productivity in the Cottonwood River watershed.",

However, the radar provides only the local plasma density along the beam line of sight, and the measurements are of limited value without context to determine the location of the radar beam relative to the larger plasma cloud. We have constructed an empirical model of the cloud locations, shapes, and sizes as a function of time for both MOSC launches using fits to all-sky images recorded from near the launch site. When combined with ALTAIR radar measurements of local plasma density at the sampled point and ionosonde measurements of the peak plasma density, a robust 4-D representation of the plasma density can be derived and used to estimate ionization yields and to study impacts on the background ionosphere and RF propagation. Optical image data was fit to a 2-D Gaussian model to derive peak intensity, background, rotation of the cloud in the horizontal plane, and half-widths in the N-S and E-W directions. The optical images show a closely linear increase in half-width after the first minute or two. Very good agreement between the model and radar integrated total electron content (TEC) measurements are obtained with a simple exponential envelope to the peak TEC within the cloud, indicating that the optical distribution closely tracks the plasma density. Comparison of TEC with peak plasma density and the observed spatial dimensions of the cloud are used to estimate the rate of change in total electron number during the period of observation and to compare with predictions of prior theoretical and numerical models.",

            "abstract": "The Russian boreal forest has experienced significant warming over the past several decades and this trend is expected to continue. This warming has the capacity to alter dominant vegetation and biomass dynamics through shifts in competition dynamics, a change in treeline and an increased fire disturbance regime. Historical fire return interval is calculated for the Russian ecoregions and applied to 31,010 points of a 22 x 22 km2 grid. Using an individual tree based forest gap model, UVAFME, biomass and species dynamics are simulated for multiple scenarios: without fire, with historical fire probabilities, a doubling of probabilities across the region, and the combined effect of fire with an altered climate. Fire disturbance within the model is a randomly occurring event with a variable intensity that alters the seedling bank and kills trees according to unique species fire tolerance parameters. Results from the simulation scenarios are compared to assess changes in biomass, species composition, and age structure 500 years after bare ground initiation. At the end of simulation, results which include fire disturbance show an increase in biomass across the region compared to simulation without fire. This increase in biomass in the simulations with fire disturbance is associated with an overall decrease in the age of the forest to younger more productive stands. The doubling of the fire return interval maintains a higher percentage of the needle leaf deciduous larch across Siberia. With altered climate, the region experiences an overall decrease in biomass and a shift in composition towards early successional deciduous species. These results reinforce the importance of the inclusion of complex competition and age structure in evaluating forest response to disturbance and changing climate.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - 2015_AGU_Poster_NonNewtonian.pdf\nClassic porous media characterization relies on typical infiltration experiments with Newtonian fluids (i.e., water) to estimate hydraulic conductivity. However, such experiments are generally not able to discern important characteristics such as pore size distribution or pore structure. We show that introducing non-Newtonian fluids provides additional unique flow signatures that can be used for improved pore structure characterization while still representing the functional hydraulic behavior of real porous media. We present a new method for experimentally estimating the pore structure of porous media using a combination of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. The proposed method transforms results of N infiltration experiments using water and N-1 non-Newtonian solutions into a system of equations that yields N representative radii (Ri) and their corresponding percent contribution to flow (wi). This method allows for estimating the soil retention curve using only saturated experiments. Experimental and numerical validation comparing the functional flow behavior of different soils to their modeled flow with N representative radii revealed the ability of the proposed method to represent the water retention and infiltration behavior of real soils. The experimental results showed the ability of such fluids to outsmart Newtonian fluids and infer pore size distribution and unsaturated behavior using simple saturated experiments. Specifically, we demonstrate using synthetic porous media that the use of different non-Newtonian fluids enables the definition of the radii and corresponding percent contribution to flow of multiple representative pores, thus improving the ability of pore-scale models to mimic the functional behavior of real porous media in terms of flow and porosity. The results advance the knowledge towards conceptualizing the complexity of porous media and can potentially impact applications in fields like irrigation efficiencies, vadose zone hydrology, soil-root-plant continuum, carbon sequestration into geologic formations, soil remediation, petroleum reservoir engineering, oil exploration and groundwater modeling.",

            "abstract": "The El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) modulates atmospheric circulation across the equatorial Pacific over a periodic time scale of 2-7 years. Despite the importance of this climate mode in forcing storm generation and trade wind variability, its impact on the wave climate incident on central Pacific atolls has not been addressed. We used the NOAA Wavewatch III CFSR reanalysis hindcasts (1979-2007) to examine the influence of ENSO on sediment mobility and transport at Kwajalein Atoll (8.8°N, 167.7°E). We found that during El Nino event years, easterly trade winds incident on the atoll weakened by 4% compared to normal years and 17% relative to La Nina event years. Despite this decrease in wind strength, significant wave heights incident on the atoll were 3-4% greater during El Nino event years. Using machine learning to partition these waves revealed that the greater El Nino wave heights originated mainly from greater storm winds near the atoll. The southeastern shift in tropical cyclone genesis location during El Nino years forced these storm winds and contributed to the 7% and 16% increases in annual wave energy relative to normal and La Nina years, respectively. Using nested SWAN and XBeach models we determined that the additional wave energy during El Nino event years significantly increased potential sediment mobility at Kwajalein Atoll and led to greater net offshore transport on its most populous island. The larger storm waves likely deplete ocean-facing beaches and reef flats of sediment, but increase the supply of sediment to the atoll lagoon across open reef platforms that are not supporting islands. We discuss further explicit modelling of storms passing over the atoll to elucidate the confounding role of storm surge on the net erosional/depositional effects of these waves. Extrapolating our results to recent Wavewatch III forecasts leads us to conclude that climate change-linked increases in wave height and storm wave energy will increase erosion on central Pacific atolls.",

            "abstract": "Stacking seismic reflection data typically involves grouping data from many different source and receivers locations by common mid points and then stacking the data after making moveout corrections. Moveout corrections are differences between the travel times of a phase that travels to a depth point at an offset and a phase reflecting from the same depth at zero offset. After these travel time corrections are made, the data from all offsets are averaged to produce a seismic trace that reflects zero offset travel times and amplitudes of the midpoint location. These corrections are dependent on accurate estimation of the velocity model. Near surface variations in velocity are impossible to estimate from the reflection data, so static corrections (time delays applied to the data to correct for delays at the stations and receivers) are estimated to further align these data before stacking. To stack PdS in three component reflection data, there is the added complication of estimating either Vs or the Vp/Vs ratio. This procedure generally works well, but traditional stacking with moveout and static corrections fail to adequately stack data from some areas within a data set. For these areas, we will use inversion methods to find the zero offset trace that best matches the data in the CMP rather than conventional stacking. Our first step is to use the area where data were stacked correctly to estimate a reference pulse and construct the zero offset trace for the problem regions. Starting with the Vp, Vs, and t0 for the nearest trace that stacked well, we find the Vp, Vs, and t0 that corresponds to the moveout and static correction that best fit the problematic CMP. This simplex will be repeated several times until the same t0 is found to a high certainty. The phase on each trace in the CMP corresponding to that t0 is subtracted from the CMP. The process is repeated until no further horizons are identified.",

Model axial-flow three-bladed turbines (rotor diameters, dT = 0.15m and 0.5m) were installed in open channel flumes with both erodible and non-erodible substrates. In erodible channels, device-induced local scour was monitored over several hydraulic conditions (clear water vs. live bedload transport) and material sizes. Synchronous velocity, bed elevation and turbine performance measurements provide an indication into the effect channel topography has on device performance. A novel data acquisition imaging system provided methods for monitoring the dynamics of bedform transport as they approached and migrated past an operating axial-flow turbine. Experiments were also performed in a realistic meandering outdoor research channel with active sediment transport to investigate MHK turbine interactions with bedform migration and turbulent flow in asymmetric channels, providing new insight into turbine-sediment interactions and turbine wake behavior in curving channels. Results provide the foundation for investigating advanced turbine control strategies for optimal power production in non-stationary environments, while also providing robust data for computational model validation enabling further investigations into the interactions between energy conversion devices and the physical environment.",

Shock heating from this sequence of basin-forming impacts modified the pattern of mantle convection. The heating produced by the eight largest impacts (Acidalia, Amazonis, Ares, Chryse, Daedalia, Hellas, Scopolus, and Utopia) penetrates below the core-mantle boundary (CMB). Here, we extend previous workon coupled thermal evolution into 3D, in order to accurately model the spatial relationship between impact basins. At the time of each impact we introduce a temperature perturbation resulting from shock heating into the core and mantle. Stratification of the core occurs very quickly compared to mantle dynamics, and we horizontally average the temperature in the core.We model mantle convection using the 3D finite element code CitcomS, and the thermal evolution of the core using a 1D parameterization.\nEach impact alters the pattern of mantle dynamics and a significant amount of impact melt is produced in the near surface. However, only the outermost part of the core is affected; the inner core temperature is still adiabatic. Immediately following the impact, the inner core may remain convective. The top of the core will cool by conduction into the deeper core faster than across the CMB, deepening the zone of stable stratification. Further core cooling results in formation of a convecting zone at the top of the core that propagates downwards as the thermal gradient becomes adiabatic at greater depths. Our goal is to obtain a better estimate of the time scale for restoration of post-impact core dynamo activity. Because the disappearance of the magnetic field exposes the early atmosphere to solar wind activity, constraining the history of the dynamo is critical for understanding climate evolution and habitability of the surface.",

Knowledge of the shallow subsurface is thus essential for an accurate seismic hazard estimate for the densely populated Coachella Valley, the region north of the potential M7.8 rupture near the Salton Sea. Using SSIP data, we analyzed first arrivals from nine 65–911 kg explosive shots recorded along a profile in the Coachella Valley in order to evaluate the interpretation of our 2D tomographic results and give added details on the structural complexity of the shallow crust. The line extends 37 km from the Peninsular Ranges to the Little San Bernardino Mountains crossing the major strands of the San Andreas Fault Zone. We fit traveltime curves to our picks with forward modeling ray tracing, and determined 1D P-wave velocity models for traveltime arrivals east and west of each shot, and a 2D model for the line. We also inferred the geometry of near-vertical faults from the pre-stack line migration method of Bauer et al. (2013). In general, the 1D models east of individual shots have deeper basement contacts and lower apparent velocities, ~5 km/s at 4 km depth, whereas the models west of individual shots have shallower basement and velocities up to 6 km/s at 2 km depth. Mismatches in basement depths (assuming 5-6 km/s) between individual 1D models indicate a shallowly dipping basement, deepening eastward towards the Banning Fault and shoaling abruptly farther east. An east-dipping structure in the 2D model also gives a better fit than horizontal layers. Based on high velocity zones derived from traveltimes at 9-20 km from the western end of the line, we included an offset from ~2 km to 4 km depth near the middle of the line, which significantly improved the 2D model fit. If fault-related, this offset could represent the Garnet Hill Fault if it continues southward in the subsurface.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Schnecker_AGU2015_1.pdf\nDecomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) and the amount of CO2 respired from soil largely depends on the amount of substrate available to microbes. Soils with high SOM concentrations will have higher respiration rates than soils with low SOM concentrations given similar environmental conditions. It is widely assumed that microbial activity and respiration rates respond linearly to substrate concentrations. This assumption remains however largely untested.\nIn a lab incubation experiment, we amended a mixture of agricultural soil and sand with increasing amounts of one of three plant residues differing in their C/N ratio (clover 14; rye 23 and wheat straw 110). We used 9 levels of organic carbon (OC) content ranging from 0.25% to 5.7%. The mixtures were then incubated at constant temperature and water contents for 63 days.\nOur results show that across substrates CO2 production increased with increasing OC content following a quadratic function instead of the expected linear one up to 2.2% OC. Above that point CO2 production leveled off and increased linearly. We hypothesize that the probability that a microbe meets a substrate also increases with increasing amounts of plant residues.\nAt all substrate concentrations, samples amended with clover had the highest carbon losses, followed by rye and straw. Differences between the three kinds of plant residue might have been caused by their C/N ratios and thus the amount of available N. High amounts of N might have led to an increase in microbial biomass, which could occupy more space and is thus more likely to meet new substrate. Additional analysis of microbial biomass, enzyme activities and N pools will help to understand the mechanism leading to the observed CO2 patterns.\nA non-linear relation of CO2 production and OC content indicates that spatial separation as an inherent property of SOM content is an important control on decomposition at low OC contents. Knowledge of this controlling effect could be used to enhance N availability in agricultural systems or to improve mitigation strategies for climate change. Finally, implemented in ecosystem models our results will help to improve predictions about microbial limitations and changes in decomposition under a future climate.",

In this study we used Cassini observations of the solar wind upstream of Saturn to drive a massively parallel simulation. Using these solar wind data we simulated the Kronian magnetosphere from 2008-02-12/14:00:31 to 2008-02-13/01:59:31. During this interval the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observed Kronian UV auroral emissions. For these solar wind conditions there are several enhancements of the solar wind dynamic pressure (shocks) and a polarity reversal in the IMF components.\nFrom these simulations we obtained the dynamically changing shape and convection pattern of the Kronian magnetosphere in response to the variations in solar wind dynamic pressure and IMF direction. For instance the magnetopause and bow shock location at the subsolar point changed by 40% during one solar wind pressure increase and 22% during another. After the pressure increases a layered convection pattern formed between the corotation dominated region and the magnetopause. The layers in this convection system interacted with each other, forming large vortices. We calculated the configuration of field aligned currents from the simulation and found layered and patchy distributions in the ionosphere. The pattern of these upward field aligned currents (FACs) in the dawn side ionosphere resembles the configuration of auroral emissions observed by HST well. To confirm the relationship between the layered configuration and upward FACs, we have calculated the footprint of magnetic field lines from the layered convection pattern to the polar region.",

The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test, with appropriate modifications to account for persistence in data, was used to identify the trends whereas the non-parametric Pettitt test was used to identify the shifts. Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) was further applied on a subset of the selected stations (237/600 were selected for DWT) to evaluate the most significant periodicities or recurrence intervals present in the change patterns. The results showed a clear increase in streamflow in the northeast and upper-central regions whereas southeast and northwest regions underwent decrease. The central regions had assorted results while number of stations with decreasing trends was observed to increase from east to west. The shifts were found to be more spatially distributed across the whole study area and followed similar patterns as the trends. The seasons also showed certain patterns in all time-scales under DWT. The presence of persistence was also observed to increase with the increasing time-scales. The results may assist water managers to efficiently plan and manage the water resources under changing climatic conditions across continental United States.",

Due to the many difficulties of working with these solutions, data to date are scarce; previously reported observations of fluid-fluid phase behavior have been limited to pressures lower than 3 kbar. We report measurements of this system, including fluid-fluid and fluid-solid equilibria, to pressures of 70 kbar and temperatures of 400°C. Carbon dioxide-to-water ratios, as loaded into the diamond-anvil cell, are quantified through isotopic exchange.\nAs pressures are raised above 3 kbar, carbon dioxide and water at first become increasingly immiscible, but with further increase of pressure this process reverses to produce a homogeneous fluid. This reversal may be indicative of a significant change in chemical character of the final fluid. A surface of solubility isotherms, deriving from currently available data, is shown in the accompanying figure. The black and white dashed line indicates the critical curve. Data below 3 kbar are from Todheide and Franck [Z. physick Chem. Neue Folge, 37, 387 (1963)].\nAt lower pressures (<3 kbar) addition of salts (e.g., NaCl) is known to stabilize the existence of the two-fluid regime. The effects of salts, such as would be pertinent to metasomatism, are as yet unknown at the higher pressures of the current experiments; the observed miscibility reversal in pure carbon dioxide/water argues that such effects are unlikely to be well estimated on the basis of lower pressure trends.",

Studies of cyanotoxins have traditionally focused on nutrient-rich lakes with conspicuous blooms, however toxigenic cyanobacteria are confined to neither high nutrient environments nor planktonic taxa. We quantified the occurrence of cyanotoxins across 19 arctic lakes of varying size and depth in the Kangerlussuaq region of southwestern Greenland. Whole lake water microcystins (MC) were detected in all lakes and ranged from low (<5 ng/L) to moderate (>100 ng/L) concentrations. Benthic colonial cyanobacteria of the genus Nostoc are a prominent feature of certain lakes in this region, with estimated densities ranging between 500 and >500,000 colonies per lake. MC were present in the tissue of Nostoc colonies (95% CI, 1638.9 – 3237.6 pg MC (g wet weight)-1) and were actively released by colonies into surrounding water in laboratory trials. These results highlight the potential importance of toxic benthic cyanobacteria in lake ecosystems. Further, we investigated the transfer of these cyanotoxins to other organisms in the lake as well as several mechanisms (i.e., emerging insects, aerosols) that may influence the movement of toxins into the terrestrial ecosystem. The presence and movement of cyanotoxins in the coupled terrestrial-aquatic ecosystem demonstrate that high-latitude lakes can support toxigenic cyanobacteria, and that we may be underestimating the potential for these systems to develop high levels of toxicity in the future.",

BrC properties and the resulting radiative effects are highly uncertain, limiting our ability to estimate near-term and regional climate forcing. Since both the source and optical properties of BrC are not well understood, it is challenging to develop a reliable model frameworks for BrC. On the other hand, field and laboratory measurements of BrC are rare and provide limited constraints.\nBrC absorption exhibits strong spectral dependence, which differs from black carbon (BC), the other important fine aerosol absorber. Based on this property, we develop an innovative approach to derive BrC absorption from multi-wavelength absorption measurements. By analyzing the Aerosol Absorption Optical Depth (AAOD) data from global AERONET network, we find that the optical properties of BrC are connected to the BC/OA ratio, as suggested by recent work. In view of this finding, we develop and discuss a series of different methods to simulate BrC absorption in the GEOS-Chem global model and estimate an associated range for global BrC burden and direct radiative forcing (DRF).",

            "abstract": "X-ray jets have been observed for years using data from the X-Ray Telescope (XRT) on the Hinode Satellite. Recently with the launch of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) it has been possible to observe solar jets over a range of EUV of wavelengths using the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). In this study, we investigated the appearance of X-ray jets in AIA images at wavelengths of 304, 171, 193, 211, 131, 94, and 335 Å. We selected 20 random X-ray jets from XRT movies of the polar coronal holes and then examined AIA EUV images from the same locations and times to determine the visibility of the jets at the different EUV wavelengths. We found that the jets were almost always visible in the 193 and 211 Å channel images. In the “hottest” EUV channels (94 Å, 335 Å), usually the spire of the jet was not visible, although sometimes a base brightening could be discerned. At other wavelengths (171, 131, and 335), the results were mixed. Based on the response characteristics of AIA (Lemen et al, 2011) to the temperature of the observed radiating solar plasma, our finding that most jets are visible in the 193 and 211 Å channels is consistent with other recent studies that measured jet temperatures of 1.5~2.0 MK (Pucci et al, 2012 & Paraschiv et al, 2015). This work was supported by the NASA LWS and HGI programs.",

            "abstract": "Martian carbonates have been observed telescopically, from orbit, in situ and in Martian meteorites; however, a long-postulated geologic reservoir that accounts for proposed thinning of a multi-bar early Mars atmosphere by CO2 sequestration has not yet been identified. One striking aspect of the Martian geologic record is the presence of valley networks and open basin lakes last active around the Noachian/Hesperian boundary, at ca. 3.5 Ga. If surface waters were supported by a thicker atmosphere, hundreds of millibars to bars of CO2 would need to be lost to space during the Hesperian/Amazonian, inconsistent with current atmospheric models. Was this late CO2 sequestered in the Martian crust? We consider the role of diffuse and localized CO2 sequestration and constrain the timing and explore implications for late Noachian atmospheric conditions via examination of the age and composition of the largest contiguous exposure of carbonate-bearing rock on Mars, the Nili Fossae carbonate plains (21.5°N, 78.5°E). Morphological, spectral and thermophysical data sets from the Thermal Emission Spectrometer, Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars, Thermal Emission Imaging System, and High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment are considered in the context of past atmospheric drawdown.\nWe find the olivine-enriched (~20%–25%) basalts of the Nili Fossae plains have been altered, by low-temperature, in-situ carbonation processes, to at most ~20% Fe-Mg carbonate, thus limiting carbon sequestration in the Nili Fossae region to ~0.25–12 mbar of CO2 during the late Noachian/early Hesperian, before or concurrent with valley network formation. While large compared to modern-day CO2 reservoirs, the lack of additional, comparable-sized post-Late Noachian carbonate-bearing deposits on Mars indicates ineffective carbon sequestration in rock units over the past ~3.7 Ga. This implies a thin atmosphere (≲500 mbar) during valley network formation, extensive post-Noachian atmospheric loss to space or diffuse, and deep sequestration by a yet-to-be understood process. In stark contrast to Earth’s biologically mediated crust:atmosphere carbon reservoir ratio of ~104–105, Mars’ ratio is a mere 10–103, even if buried pre-Noachian crust holds multiple bars.",

A recently discovered firn aquifer within the ice sheet has the potential to buffer or enhance sea level rise by retaining water or outputting it into the ocean. This study examines englacial hydrology to determine if the subsurface aquifer can discharge its contents into the ocean via hydraulic fracturing of crevasses. Operation Ice Bridge data is utilized to map ice surface elevation profiles and water table return signals. This data is then modeled in SEEP2D, based on Darcy’s law, to determine the aquifer’s potential water discharge. With a known discharge, conservation of mass equations yield crevasse water depth. This water depth is converted into pressure and compared with known fracture thresholds to determine the likelihood of failure at varying crevasse dimensions. These results can be used to better assess the Greenland aquifer’s potential to alter sea level rise.",

            "abstract": "Geological observations indicate that ice streams were a significant contributor to ice flow in the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the Last Glacial Maximum. Conceptual and simple model studies have also argued that the gradual development of ice streams increases the sensitivity of large ice sheets to weak climate forcing. In this study, we use an idealized configuration of the Parallel Ice Sheet Model to explore the role of ice streams in rapid deglaciation. In a growing ice sheet, ice streams develop gradually as the bed warms and the margin expands outward onto the continental shelf. Then, a weak change in equilibrium line altitude commensurate with Milankovitch forcing results in a rapid deglacial response, as ice stream acceleration leads to enhanced calving and surface melting at low elevations. We explain the dynamical mechanism that drives this ice stream acceleration and its broader applicability as a feedback for enhancing ice sheet decay in response to climate forcing. We show how our idealized ice sheet simulations match geomorphological observations of deglacial ice stream variability and previous model-data analyses. We conclude with observations on the potential for interaction between ice streams and other feedback mechanisms within the earth system.",

            "abstract": "Interactions among streambed structure, stream power, and sediment transport in rivers have been widely observed and documented. Perennial gravel-bed streams typically possess a surface bed layer that is coarser than the subsurface material. This coarser surface layer is, however, absent from some ephemeral gravel-bed streams and in some cases the reverse phenomenon occurs. Ephemeral streams also exhibit considerably higher efficiency in transporting sediment. In steep bedrock rivers, the hydraulic-rock interactive mechanism often self-creates step-pool or cascade bed configurations as forms of energy dissipation to control the transport efficiency of sediment. Here we aim to characterize bed structures and sediment transport in gravel-bed rivers and bedrock streams by using the concept of dimensionless stream power. We analyzed existing bed load data collected from field and experimental settings in an attempt to reach a unified outlook for both stream types and various channel bed features. We found that the mechanisms responsible for the features perceived to distinguish surface fining and surface coarsening are interrelated and triggered by different values of dimensionless stream power. The surface fining case has been attributed to fluidization of the entire bed material as demonstrated here in detail. The results also suggest that in bedrock rivers with large bedforms, such as stabled step-pool and immobile rock cascade, relatively medium-large values of stream power (i.e., floods of less than 30-year return period) do not equate with large bed load transport rates due to a portion of flow energy dissipating through local hydraulic jumps, leaving less energy to transport the bed load. Plot of transport efficiency values for each bed type and flood magnitude in bedrock rivers also helps us estimate how much fraction of flow energy is delivered to do bedrock erosive work by saltating bed load; hence, the implication for studies of landscape evolution.",

We estimate a total ice mass loss equal to -217 ± 33 Gt/yr, equivalent to a sea level rise of 0.6±0.09 mm/yr. The global signal is driven by a few regions, contributing to almost of 75% of the total ice mass loss. Among these areas, the main contributor is the Canadian Arctic Archipelago with a total mass loss of -75 ± 9 Gt/yr, followed by Alaska (-51 ± 10 Gt/yr), Patagonia (-26 ± 10 Gt/yr) and the High Mountains of Asia (-25 ± 13 Gt/yr). The mass loss for most of the arctic regions is not constant, but accelerates with time. The Canadian Archipelago, in particular, undergoes a strong acceleration in mass waste (-7±1 Gt/yr2). The signal acceleration is mainly driven by the northern located Queen Elisabeth Islands (-4.5 ± 0.6 Gt/yr2). A similar behavior is observed for Svalbard and the Russian Arctic. In this second case, however, we observe an enhanced mass loss starting from the second decade of the 21st century after a period of nearly stable mass balance. The observed acceleration helps reconcile regional ice mass estimates obtained for different time periods.",

A primary goal of the study was to determine the factors controlling surface ozone in the Front Range. As part of the project, measurements of many trace gases were observed on board the NSF/NCAR C-130 by a suite of instrumentation, including the NCAR Trace Organic Gas Analyzer (TOGA), which made measurements of a set of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). VOCs are crucial for characterizing emissions and photochemical processing in the Front Range, as well as the air transported into the region. During recent years, oil and natural gas (O&NG) activity in the Front Range has been growing rapidly. Ratios of observed aromatic hydrocarbons, butanes and pentanes demonstrate distinct fingerprinting that can be used to distinguish both between different types of O&NG activities and between O&NG extraction regions in the FRAPPE study region and beyond. Using the observed hydrocarbon data along with other trace gas observations, we will compare contributions of O&NG emissions to OH reactivities in different regions in the Front Range, and present box model results demonstrating the impact of O&NG activities on ozone formation.",

The surface mixed layer of the Arctic Ocean is reaching unprecedentedly warm temperatures. This study examines the cooling processes in the summer mixed layer of the upper ocean between the warm late-summer and the onset of ice growth. In situ measurements of upper ocean temperatures from UpTempO buoys and a number of CTD profiles in the Beaufort and Chukchi regions indicate that as expected, most of the heat in the upper ocean is lost to the atmosphere at the surface. Cooling to the atmosphere occurs predominantly through sudden cooling events associated with passing weather systems, with cooling rates greater than 0.2 °C/hour. However, a not-insubstantial amount of heat gets trapped in the summer halocline forming temperature features like the Near Surface Temperature Maximum isolated from the cooling associated with passing storms. These are clearly visible in the included figure. They come and go over the course of the cooling season, but typically persist through freeze-up. Heat stored in this layer will, on erosion of the summer halocline with wintertime ice growth, be mixed into the surface mixed layer and slow the growth of sea ice. This presentation quantifies the relative balance between heat loss to the atmosphere, temporary and seasonal heat storage in the summer halocline, and the relationship to fall season storminess in the region.",

            "abstract": "Motor vehicle emissions are an important source of anthropogenic gases and particles in the atmosphere. To study the gas and particle phase emissions, an HR-TOF-AMS and HR-TOF-CIMS were deployed at the CSU Engines Lab, along with an oxidative flow reactor, to measure emissions from a 4.5 L John Deere engine, which ran either diesel or biodiesel fuel. Concurrent gas-phase and particle-phase measurements allowed determination of the gas-phase and particle-phase oxidation properties as a function of fuel type, fuel load, and photochemical age. The impacts of particulate filers on composition and oxidation state were also assessed. While aerosol composition and associated oxidation properties for the biodiesel and diesel fuel types were similar, differences in photochemical production existed for the amount of load, or efficiency of the engine. The mean particulate oxygen to carbon ratios (O:C) and mean hydrogen to carbon ratios (H:C) moved from an initial 0.1 and 2 to a final 0.55 and 1.6, respectively, upon idle biodiesel and diesel engine exhaust exposure to approximately 7 days of OH exposure. The more efficient higher load biodiesel and diesel engine exhaust experienced less changes in the mean O:C and H:C values (an initial 0.1 and 2 to a final 0.3 and 1.7, respectively) with approximately the same amount of OH exposure. Despite largely scrubbing the majority of particles from the engine exhaust, experiments with engine particulate filters still showed photochemical production of oxidized particle-phase species at high photochemical ages, similar to that of idle engine exhaust without any particulate filters. Bulk gas-phase data was compared to bulk aerosol data in Van Krevelen space in order to understand how particle-phase oxidation traces gas-phase oxidation as a function of fuel type, engine load, and photochemical age.",

            "abstract": "All meteorites contain variable amounts of cosmogenic 38Ar and 36Ar produced during extraterrestrial exposure, and in order to calculate reliable 40Ar/39Ar ages this cosmogenic Ar must be removed from the total Ar budget. The amount of cosmogenic Ar has usually been calculated from the step-wise 38Ar/36Ar, minimum 36Ar/37Ar, or average 38Arcosmogenic/37Ar from the irradiated meteorite fragment. However, if Cl is present in the meteorite, then these values will be disturbed by Ar produced during laboratory neutron irradiation of Cl. Chlorine is likely to be a particular issue for the Nakhlite group of Martian meteorites, which can contain over 1000 ppm Cl [1].\n An alternative method for the cosmogenic Ar correction uses the meteorite’s exposure age as calculated from an un-irradiated fragment and step-wise production rates based on the measured Ca/K [2]. This calculation is independent of the Cl concentration. We applied this correction method to seven Nakhlites, analyzed in duplicate or triplicate. Selected samples were analyzed at both Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and SUERC to ensure inter-laboratory reproducibility. We find that the cosmogenic argon correction of [2] has a significant influence on the ages calculated for individual steps, particularly for those at lower temperatures (i.e., differences of several tens of million years for some steps). The lower-temperature steps are more influenced by the alternate cosmogenic correction method of [2], as these analyses yielded higher concentrations of Cl-derived 38Ar. As a result, the Nakhlite data corrected using [2] yields step-heating spectra that are flat or nearly so across >70% of the release spectra (in contrast to downward-stepping spectra often reported for Nakhlite samples), allowing for the calculation of precise emplacement ages for these meteorites.\n[1] Cartwright J.

            "abstract": "As it orbits around comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (CG), the Rosetta spacecraft acquires more information about its main target. The numerous observations made at various geometries and at different times enable a good spatial and temporal coverage of the evolution of CG’s cometary coma. However, the question regarding the link between the coma measurements and the nucleus activity remains relatively open notably due to gas expansion and strong kinetic effects in the comet’s rarefied atmosphere.\nIn this work, we use coma observations made by the ROSINA-DFMS instrument to constrain the activity at the surface of the nucleus. The distribution of the H2O and CO2 outgassing is described with the use of spherical harmonics. The coordinates in the orthogonal system represented by the spherical harmonics are computed using a least squared method, minimizing the sum of the square residuals between an analytical coma model and the DFMS data.\nThen, the previously deduced activity distributions are used in a Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) model to compute a full description of the H2O and CO2 coma of comet CG from the nucleus’ surface up to several hundreds of kilometers. The DSMC outputs are used to create synthetic images, which can be directly compared with VIRTIS measurements.\nThe good agreement between the VIRTIS observations and the DSMC model, itself constrained with ROSINA data, provides a compelling juxtaposition of the measurements from these two instruments.\nAcknowledgements\nWork at UofM was supported by contracts JPL#1266313, JPL#1266314 and NASA grant NNX09AB59G.

            "abstract": "One of the most prominent features of the Earth's large-scale circulation in low latitudes is the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), where tropical precipitation is concentrated in a relatively narrow latitudinal band that moves seasonally. On Earth, the ITCZ is limited to low latitudes; however on Mars and Titan, it has been argued that analagous convergence zones can migrate significantly off the equator into the summer hemisphere, perhaps even reaching the summer pole in the case of Titan. Previous studies of the ITCZ’s extent have focused primarily on thermodynamics, particularly emphasizing its collocation with maximum moist static energy (MSE) and its response to local surface heat capacity. Here, we focus on the dynamical mechanisms controlling ITCZ migrations, examining the ITCZ’s extent through the perspective of the momentum budget rather than through thermal forces or land-sea changes. We study a wide range of atmospheric circulations with an idealized General Circulation Model (GCM), in which an atmospheric model with idealized physics is coupled to an aquaplanet slab ocean of fixed depth and top-of-atmosphere insolation is varied seasonally as well as held fixed at the pole in “eternal solstice” runs. We explore a range of surface heat capacities and rotation rates, keeping all other parameters Earth-like. We find that for rotation rates ΩE/8 and slower, the seasonal ITCZ reaches the summer pole. Additionally, in contrast to previous thermodynamic arguments, we find that the ITCZ does not follow the maximum MSE, remaining at low latitudes in the eternal solstice case for Earth’s rotation rate. Furthermore, we find that significantly decreasing the surface heat capacity does little to extend the ITCZ’s summer migration off the equator. These results suggest that the ITCZ may be more controlled by dynamical mechanisms than previously thought; however, we also find that baroclinic instability, often invoked as a limiter on the extent of the summer Hadley cell, appears to play only a minor role in limiting the ITCZ’s extent. We develop a theory for constraining the ITCZ’s position based on top-of-atmosphere energetics and boundary layer dynamics, offering a new perspective on the seasonal weather patterns of terrestrial planets.",

Ion mobility mass spectrometry separates ions on the basis of their interactions with buffer gases on millisecond time scales and allows for detailed separation and identification of isomeric and isobaric molecules. Detection of highly oxidized gas phase organics is achieved by coupling the IMS-TOF to a chemical ionization scheme that utilized NO3- as the reagent ion. Oxidized gas phase molecules produced from biogenic precursors were chemically characterized with this technique during the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) field campaign as well as in laboratory experiments utilizing a potential aerosol mass (PAM) reactor. The application of IMS-TOF to aerosol phase organic species is also presented. While molecular composition of fine aerosol is often obtained by combining gas or liquid chromatography (GC or LC) with mass spectrometric detection, these techniques are limited in their ability to transfer, resolve and identify water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) species which account for a significant portion of aerosol mass. Here we demonstrate IMS as a promising alternative approach for obtaining detailed information about organic aerosol (OA) constituent species. We examine aerosol particles collected on filters during ambient and laboratory measurements. The filter extracts are subjected to electrospray ionization (ESI) before detection with the IMS-TOF. The capability of this technique to resolve WSOC species, isomers, and oligomers is highlighted.",

However, from a risk management context, prognostic information of a single variable such as total precipitation or average temperature will be of less utility especially for specific operational purposes. An integrated regional climate-weather forecast system covering precipitation, temperature and humidity etc. over the year will benefit the farmers in the context of a specific decision time table for irrigation scheduling as well as for pre-season crop choices. Hence, contrary to the existing forecasting methods that develop multi time scale information of a single variable at a time, in this paper, we introduce an integrated regional multivariate climate-weather forecasting system that directly relates to agricultural decision making and risk mitigation. These multi-scale risk attributes include mutually dependent, spatially disaggregated statistics such as total rainfall, average temperature, growing degree days, relative humidity, total number of rainfall days/dry spell length, and cumulative water deficits that inform the potential irrigation water requirements for crops. Given that these attributes exhibit mutual dependence across space and time, we propose to explore common ocean-atmospheric conditions from the observations and the state of the art Global Circulation Models (GCMs) that can be utilized as the predictor variables for the forecasting system. Hierarchical Bayesian methods are be used to develop the integrated forecast system. The developed multivariate forecasts will be adapted and disseminated as decision tools for the farmers under the extension projects in Punjab region of India.",

Simplifying the highly heterogeneous fluvio-deltaic Bengal Basin aquifer system into a homogeneous-anisotropic system, basin-scale modeling has shown that the deep groundwater can be utilized safely for millennia over much of the arsenic-affected area if irrigation remains shallow. However, the extent to which physical (variations in hydraulic conductivity, K) and geochemical (variations in sorption, Kd) heterogeneity as well as pumping affect the timescale of downward migration of contaminated shallow groundwater is unknown. Here we imbed detailed heterogeneous representations of physical and chemical aquifer properties and pumping rates within a basin-scale numerical groundwater flow model. Advective particle tracking shows that physical heterogeneity does not significantly affect the mean and median travel time of As transport to 150 m depth. However, it reduces the travel time for the fastest 10% particles by a factor of two, on average. In some cases, heterogeneity causes a shift in recharge locations from As-safe to As-unsafe areas. The distribution of deep pumping does not affect vulnerability as along as the irrigation pumping remains shallow, supporting conclusions from previous studies. Without sorption, >80% of the aquifer area at 150 m depth becomes contaminated after 1000 years. This reduces to <1% when either uniform sorption or sand-only sorption are considered. However, should As sorb only onto the less permeable aquifer materials (i.e. silts and clays), 30% of the area becomes contaminated on average. This suggests that both physical and chemical heterogeneity, as well as their correlation, are critical for managing deep groundwater in the Bengal Basin.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_2015_Ko_F2.pdf\nSoil moisture (θ) exhibits high spatial variability due to the combined effect of natural and anthropogenic factors. Among the latter group, irrigation can introduce significant heterogeneity in the spatial variability of θ, thus modifying the statistical properties typically observed in natural landscapes. This, in turn, can affect the application of downscaling models of coarse satellite θ products based on the hypothesis of spatial homogeneity of θ distribution. In this study, the impact of irrigation on the scale invariance properties of θ and the application of a multifractal downscaling algorithm are analyzed using ground- and aircraft-based θ measurements from the National Airborne Field Experiments 2005 (NAFE05) and 2006 (NAFE06) campaigns conducted in two sites in Australia. After identifying irrigated areas through vegetation indices derived from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper scenes, we investigate the presence of scale invariance from 32 km to 1 km in three scenarios, including (1) the original θ fields and in cases where θ in irrigated pixels was (2) replaced with missing data or (3) interpolated from neighboring pixels. We found that irrigation has a larger impact on the scale invariance properties in a large and compact agricultural district in the NAFE06 region, while it has a negligible influence on the sparser districts of NAFE05. The θ fields of scenario 3 are then used to calibrate a downscaling model based on spatially-homogeneous multifractal cascades as a function of coarse predictors. The model capability to reproduce the θ variability across scales is assessed by comparing ensembles of disaggregated field with the small-scale θ airborne observations and, for the first time, with ground θ measurements. Model performances are adequate in most cases in both experiments, although some deficiencies are found in regions with a larger presence of irrigated fields, suggesting the need to further refine the technique for detection of irrigated croplands. Results of this study provide insights on the spatial variability of θ in anthropogenic settings and are useful to refine satellite downscaling algorithms applied to Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity and Soil Moisture Active and Passive missions.",

            "abstract": "The Method of Anchored Distributions (MAD), first demonstrated by Rubin et al. in 2010, has been particularly useful in hydrological and geophysical applications. MAD provides a new framework for successfully using diverse data for the characterization of heterogeneous subsurface quantities (eg. hydraulic conductivity). Through Bayesian inverse modeling, MAD is able to take a general, assumption-free approach, incorporating both local data, ie. data that pertains directly to the target quantity, as well as other indirectly related non-local data. The latter are used for the inversion and converted into local data, called ‘anchors’, therefore improving the overall characterization of the target variable. However, with the use of more and more data, problems arise with the inversion due to the high dimensionality of said data, eg. when using time series. As a result, MAD becomes increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to use for large data sets.\nThe objective of our study is therefore to investigate and demonstrate effective methods of dimension reduction that reduces large data sets to a small set of relevant parameters while still retaining a strong effect on the inversion procedure. The poster will explain the relevant methods and present examples of their effect on different data types, primarily looking at hydrological data (ie. concentration breakthrough curves, drawdown time series or vertical head profiles) then further theorizing its possible application to geophysical information. Ultimately, the broader goal of this study is to propose ways of applying dimension reduction to the realm of hydrogeophysics, which will not only expand the application of MAD, but also improve our ability to reduce uncertainty in the relevant parameters.",

            "abstract": "Significant renewed interest in the geological development of the NW GOM is exemplified by the acquisition of academic seismic refraction and oil industry seismic reflection data. There is agreement that the GOM formed by Jurassic separation of North America and Yucatan, but disagreements remain on the distribution and timing of extended continental versus oceanic crust. Van Avendonk et al. (Geology, v43, 2015) interpreted seismic refraction data from the 2010 “GUMBO” expedition as rifted continental crust thinned by large-scale extensional faulting and syn-rift magmatism beneath the NW GOM. However, seismic reflection evidence for this extension is non-existent, and diagnostic fault-controlled syn-rift packages are not resolved. A very different interpretation of basement type and basin evolution is possible by applying geological process linked to hyper-extended margin formation to the same data. We note: 1) Base salt and Moho interfaces are well imaged; top basement is not resolved. We interpret a pre-salt sedimentary sequence 5-10 km thick, with velocities up to 6 km/s; high velocities in this sequence likely relate to greenschist-facies metamorphism associated with early high heat flow and deep burial. 2) Velocities of 6-8 km/s characterize crystalline basement but do not uniquely determine crustal type (i.e., velocity does not equate to rock type). Lateral variations (0-8 km) in crustal thickness are consistent with slow/ultra-slow seafloor spreading. 3) The undeformed base salt reflector and pre-salt sediment sequence imply a post-kinematic setting and a substantial delay between breakup and Callovian salt deposition. 4) Liassic Central Atlantic breakup is kinematically linked to the GOM and related SDR magmatism. Inboard SDRs, observed on both conjugate margins of the GOM, imply outboard oceanic crust.\nTogether, these observations are consistent with regional sub-salt basement of early-mid Jurassic slow/ultra-slow spreading oceanic crust, associated with minor normal faulting. This contrasts with a model of stretched continental crust that gradually thins from 14 km at the Texas coast to 6 km with strong lateral heterogeneities associated with magmatic intrusions in the ultradeep GOM.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - TM poster.pdf\nIntermediate-composition titanomagnetites (TM30-TM50) have recently been shown to have Curie temperatures (Tc) that depend not only on composition but also quite strongly on thermal history, with increases of 100°C or more in Tc produced by moderate-temperature (300-400° C) annealing in the lab or in slow natural cooling, and equally large decreases produced by more rapid cooling (“quenching”) from higher temperatures [e.g., Bowles et al 2013, Nature Communications]. The phenomenon is robustly defined and repeatable, but the underlying mechanism remains enigmatic, although it presumably involves some rearrangement of metal cations within the spinel lattice. New high-and low-temperature measurements, including hysteresis, frequency-dependent AC susceptibility (k(f,T)) and Mössbauer spectroscopy, were carried out to help shed light on the nanoscale mechanisms responsible for the observed changes in Tc. Fabian et al [2015, GJI] have shown for ferrimagnetic compositions in the hematite-ilmenite system that high-T hysteresis measurements exhibit a peak in high-field slope at the Curie temperature, and that the magnitude (area) of this peak is a strong function of cation ordering degree. Our data for synthetic titanomagnetites in quenched and annealed states show some indications of this, although the relationship is not perfectly systematic. On the other hand, our new low-T Mössbauer spectra, measured in the quenched and annealed states, are indistinguishable and argue against any change in site occupancy. Church et al [2011, G3] have proposed that the sharp change in low-T magnetic behavior of intermediate titanomagnetites is a “pinning transition” due to redistribution and localization of ferrous ions within the octahedral sites. Our new k(f,T) results show that the pinning transition in some samples is strongly affected by prior annealing or quenching, suggesting that these treatments affect the intrasite cation distributions. Such an idea is consistent with atomistic models of the qandlite-magnesioferrite system [Harrison et al., 2013, Am. Mineralogist], which show temperature-dependent octahedral-site chemical clustering.",

Through the new Elementary GLOBE Aerosols Storybook and Learning Activities, the GLOBE Kids learn that there's a lot more than air in the atmosphere, which can affect the colors we see in the sky.\nThere are four hands-on activities in this unit: 1) Sky Observers - Students make observations of the sky, record their findings and share their observation reports with their peers. The activity promotes active observation and recording skills to help students observe sky color, and recognize that sky color changes; 2) Why (Not) So Blue? - Students make predictions about how drops of milk will affect color and visibility in cups of water representing the atmosphere to help them understand that aerosols in the atmosphere have an effect on sky conditions, including sky color and visibility. The activity also introduces the classification categories for daytime sky color and visibility; 3) See the Light - Students use prisms and glue sticks to explore the properties of light. The activity demonstrates that white light is made up of seven colors that represent different wavelengths, and illustrates why the sky is blue during the day and red at sunset; 4) Up in the Air - Students work in groups to make an aerosol sampler, a simple adhesive tool that allows students to collect data and estimate the extent of aerosols present at their school, understanding that, in fact, there are particles in the air we breathe.\nNGSS Alignment includes: Disciplinary Core Ideas- ESS2.D: Weather and Climate, ESS3.C: Human Impacts on Earth Systems, PS4.B: Electromagnetic Radiation, ESS3.A: Natural Resources; Science and Engineering Practices- Asking Questions and Defining Problems, Planning and Carrying Out an Investigation, Analyzing and Interpreting Data, Engaging in Argument from Evidence, Obtaining, Evaluating, and Communicating Information; Crosscutting Concepts- Patterns and Cause and Effect; and Performance Expectations- K-ESS2-1, K-ESS2-2, 4-ESS3-1.

Images captured by the Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS) onboard Cassini spacecraft showed the feature as a very contrasted dark spot in the MT3 filter, and barely visible in the deep sounding filters CB2 and CB3. On mid-May 2015 ground-based observations obtained by amateur astronomers operating small telescopes started to show a disturbance around this dark spot. Following the onset of this disturbance the drift of the dark spot remained unaltered and equal to the motion it had previously, but the disturbance evolved zonally in a complex manner, giving hints of a kind of large scale phenomena in Saturn’s atmosphere of an unprecedented type. Unfortunately the orbital path of the Cassini spacecraft was not appropriate to see details of the disturbance at that time. Images by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 instrument obtained in director’s time (DDT) allow us to describe the detailed dynamics of the disturbance, while the study of its long-term evolution is possible thanks to the efforts of the community of amateur astronomers. In this work we analyse the dynamics of the region before the start of the disturbance and the dynamics and evolution of the disturbance after its onset.",

            "abstract": "Processes that drive glacial ablation directly impact surrounding ecosystems and communities that are dependent on glacial meltwater as a freshwater reservoir: crucially, freshwater runoff from alpine and Arctic glaciers has large implications for watershed ecosystems and contingent economies. Furthermore, glacial hydrology processes are a complex and fundamental part of understanding high-latitude environments in the modern and predicting how they might change in the future. Specifically, developing better estimates of the origin of freshwater discharge, as well as the duration and amplitude of extreme melting and precipitation events, could provide crucial constraints on these processes and allow for glacial watershed systems to be modeled more effectively.\nIn order to investigate the universality of the temporal and spatial melt relationships that exist in glacial systems, I investigate the isotopic composition of glacial meltwater and proximal seawater including stable isotopes δ18O and δD, which have been measured in glacial water samples I collected from the alpine Athabasca Glacier in the Canadian Rockies.\nThis abstract is focused on extrapolating the relative contributions of meltwater sources – snowmelt, ice melt, and summer precipitation – using a coupled statistical-chemical model (Arendt et al., 2015). I apply δ18O and δD measurements of Athabasca Glacier subglacial water samples to a Bayesian Monte Carlo (BMC) estimation scheme. Importantly, this BMC model also assesses the uncertainties associated with these meltwater fractional contribution estimations, which provides an assessment of how well the system is constrained. By defining the proportion of overall melt that is coming from snow versus ice using stable isotopes, the volume of water generated by ablation can be calculated. This water volume has two important implications. First, communities that depend on glacial water for aquifer recharge can start assessing future water resources, as glacial decline will make snowmelt the dominant water reservoir. Second, the calculated source fraction water volumes are a starting point for additional geochemical models to investigate water storage within the subglacial hydrological network.",

            "abstract": "As part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5), land cover change and wood harvest were prescribed as major climate forcings for historical and future Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) projections. Lawrence et al. (2012) described how land cover change was prescribed in all of these simulations and how the climate system and carbon cycle responded to the land cover change in concert to other transient forcing in the Community Earth System Model (CESM). The attribution of carbon cycle and climate changes directly due to land cover change however, were not possible due to the design of the CMIP5 experiments. Through a series of new CESM simulations we have attributed the land cover change impacts for the historical time series as well as RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 with and without land cover change. These simulations show that the direct land cover change fluxes to the atmosphere found in the CMIP5 simulations did not account for the lost uptake of carbon that would have been possible in the absence of land cover change and wood harvest. Once these losses are taken into account, the historical losses of terrestrial carbon increased from 61.2 PgC to 129.6 PgC, the RCP 4.5 uptake of 62.8 PgC changed to a loss of 5.8 PgC, and the RCP 8.5 loss of 49.0 PgC increased to 168.8 PgC. In order to assess the potential of land management to mitigate carbon and climate consequences we extended the RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 experiments with large scale global afforestation compared to maximum agricultural expansion scenarios. In these experiments we found that afforestation was able to take up 220 PgC over the next 85 years, while large scale crop expansion could release the same amount of carbon from terrestrial ecosystems. Figure 1 shows the time series for global ecosystem carbon along with the spatial distribution of gains and losses under the maximum afforestation and agricultural expansion simulations. In comparison to fossil fuel emissions the land cover change carbon amounts were around 25% of RCP 4.5 and 12% of RCP 8.5. In this talk we present the differences in each of these experiments for both ecosystem carbon and climate.",

Data is considered from the regional Northern California Seismic Network (NCSN) and local Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory Network (LBNLN). Both data sets give good GR data fits for 2009-2014 but NCSN data have b=1.15 and LBNLN data have b=1.36. Comparing 18,000 individual earthquakes we find on average MLBNLN = MNCSN+0.5. Thus care must be taken when both data sets are used. We hypothesize that the strain accumulated due to the plate motions is a balance by the strain released in earthquakes with a maximum upper limit Mmax. We compare the strain associated with seismicity with the tectonic GPS strain being accumulated in the region. Taking the NCSN GR data with an upper magnitude cutoff, we find this cutoff to be Mmax=4.74. This is consistent with an observed upper magnitude limit to The Geysers seismicity at about M=5. We present studies of aftershock statistics of four M = 4.43, 4.16, 4.62, and 4.53 earthquakes. We find both GR and Omori Law statistics to be typical of tectonic earthquakes. We suggest that the four earthquakes release accumulated tectonic stresses but injected fluids reduce the stress required for rupture initiation. We also consider triggered seismicity caused by three remote earthquakes. We obtain excellent data for the 2010 M=7.2 El Mayor-Cucapah and the M=6.0 South Napa earthquakes. In the first case a M=3.37 event was triggered and in the second case a M=4.48 event was triggered. We conclude that the observed seismicity consists primarily of aftershocks of the large triggered earthquakes and that the directly triggered earthquakes do not satisfy GR frequency-magnitude statistics.",

            "abstract": "The soils and foods webs associated with mid to high elevation, forested, headwater streams are potential hotspots for mercury methylation and bioaccumulation but are not well studied. We tested the hypothesis that spatial variation in mercury bioaccumulation in upland taxa associated with headwater streams can be explained by variation in soil conditions promoting Hg methylation such as soil moisture, pH, and sulfur and organic matter content. We sampled at high (c. 700m) and mid elevation (c. 500m) in northern hardwood forest adjacent to and away from (75m) replicate headwater streams in the Hubbard Brook and Jeffers Brook watersheds of the White Mountains region, New Hampshire, USA. These forested watersheds differed primarily in soil calcium content and pH. We measured and assessed spatial variation in total Hg (THg) and methyl Hg (MeHg) concentrations in soils, insects, spiders, salamanders and birds. We also tested whether trophic position, as determined by nitrogen stable isotopes, was a major predictor of Hg bioaccumulation across these riparian and upland forest taxa. We found elevated levels of THg in all measured components of the food web, and conditions for methylation were better in the upland forest sites compared to the riparian sites located adjacent to headwater streams. Both THg and MeHg in biota were positively correlated with trophic position as indicated by 15N enrichment. In fact, trophic position was a better predictor of THg and MeHg content than spatial location, but the spatial patterning of bioaccumulation differed among taxa. Our data show that that significant Hg bioaccumulation and biomagnification can occur in soils and food webs of mid to high elevation temperate deciduous forests of the Northeast. They also suggest that mercury methylation in forested watersheds is a widespread phenomenon and not limited to areas with high soil moisture, such as lotic environments.",

            "abstract": "Tectonic subsidence and basin topography, both determining the accommodation, are fundamental controls on the basin filling processes. Their effects on the fluvial organization and the resultant subsurface patterns remain difficult to predict due to the lack of understanding about interaction between internal dynamics and external controls. Despite the intensive studies on tectonic steering effects on alluvial architecture, how the self-organization of deltaic channels, especially the distributary channel network, respond to tectonics and basin geometry is mostly unknown. Recently physical experiments and field studies have hinted dramatic differences in fluviodeltaic evolution between ones associated with active differential subsidence and existing basin depth. In this work we designed a series of numerical experiments using a reduced-complexity channel-resolving model for delta formation, and tested over a range of localized subsidence rates and topographic depression in basin geometry. We also used a set of robust delta metrics to analyze: i) shoreline planform asymmetry, ii) channel and lobe geometry, iii) channel network pattern, iv) autogenic timescales, and v) subsurface structure. The modeling results show that given a similar final thickness, active subsidence enhances channel branching with smaller channel sand bodies that are both laterally and vertically connected, whereas existing topographic depression causes more large-scale channel avulsions with larger channel sand bodies. In general, both subsidence and existing basin geometry could steer channels and/or lock channels in place but develop distinct channel patterns and thus stratal architecture.",

            "abstract": "The Himalaya-Tibet system remains one of the best places to study continental dynamics, mountain building, and nucleation of great earthquakes. Over the past several decades, numerous research projects have used the Himalaya and Tibet as a natural laboratory to investigate the process of continental collision. Much has been learned about the orogen, including the remarkable along-strike continuity of many features: the orogen’s basic geology and structure, the morphology and drainages of the Himalayan arc, and the apparent symmetry of the syntaxes at either end. At the same time, numerous focused studies have also identified considerable spatial variability in the GPS field, seismicity, crust and mantle structure, magnitude and timing of exhumation, erosion, and strain. While much has been learned and many details revealed, significant questions about the Himalaya and Tibet remain and we lack integrated 4D models that explain observed complexity.\nThe time is right for a community initiative to systematically integrate the breadth of data available to test and refine geodynamic models to illuminate the structure and 4-D evolution of the India-Asia collision at scales that account for both first order observations and lateral heterogeneity, link deep earth and surface processes, and address the geohazards associated with the collisional zone and surrounding areas. Any such effort requires community consensus on science goals, setting priorities regarding what’s needed to make significant progress, and open access data. An effort of this scale needs to address the societal impacts of hazards associated with the India-Asia collisional system and engage international collaborations across the region. The April 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake serves as the most recent reminder that the Himalaya-Tibet system is capable of producing large magnitude events, impacting lives, livelihoods, and the built environment. The 1950 Mw 8.6 Assam and 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan earthquakes provide additional examples of the size and destruction of earthquakes in the region. A broad based community initiative has the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the evolution of continents and complements integrative studies of the earthquake cycle emerging from oceanic subduction systems.",

            "abstract": "For many years, empirical rate-and-state friction laws have been successfully applied to describe the transient frictional behaviour of fault zones, as observed in laboratory experiments and in nature. However, the rate-and-state friction parameters and equations are still poorly understood in terms of the underlying processes that operate at a micro-scale. Due to our lack of understanding, extrapolation of the frictional behaviour from sample-scale to the spatial and temporal scales of natural faults is non-trivial.\nSeveral models have been proposed to explain the rate, temperature and stress dependence of the steady-state frictional strength of faults, based on microphysical processes operating at the grain-scale. These models were then extended to provide an explanation for transient frictional effects that are commonly observed in experiments in response to an instantaneous change in load point velocity. What these analytical models have in common is that they describe the interplay between time-dependent ductile and frictional processes, which provide a basis for extrapolation to natural conditions. At the same time, the models are limited due to oversimplification of the microstructure, e.g. a necessary assumption of the grain packing and the lack of a distributed grain size. By implementing the principles of these models into a Discrete Element formulation, many of the limitations can be circumvented to mimic more realistic fault zone geometries and microstructures.\nWe have developed a Discrete Element Model to study the interaction of pressure solution with local porosity and the effect on the transient and steady-state macroscopic frictional behaviour. It was found that the magnitude of slip events observed during simulations that showed velocity-weakening behaviour, is related to the pressure solution rate and degree of localisation. This has important implications for the expected magnitude of earthquakes generated at conditions favouring unstable sliding.",

By integrating geoscience and climate project data, we have developed a series of community-scale hazard risk maps. The maps depict hazard risk in stoplight colours for easy interpretation, and support community-based, future-focused adaptation planning. Communities, First Nations, consultants and local regulatory agencies have used the hazard risk maps to site small-scale infrastructure projects, guide land planning processes, and assess suitability of land development applications.\nHowever, we know that assessing risk is only one step in integrating the implications of permafrost degradation in societal responses to environmental change. To build on our permafrost hazard risk maps, we are integrating economic principles and traditional land use elements. To assess economic implications of adaptation to permafrost change, we are working with geotechnical engineers to identify adaptation options (e.g., modified building techniques, permafrost thaw mitigation approaches) that suit the risks captured by our existing hazard risk maps. We layer this with an economic analysis of the costs associated with identified adaptation options, providing end-users with a more comprehensive basis upon which to make decisions related to infrastructure. NCE researchers have also integrated traditional land use activities in assessments of permafrost thaw risk, in a project led by Jean Marie River First Nation in the Northwest Territories. Here, the implications of permafrost degradation on food security and land use priorities were assessed by layering key game and gathering areas on permafrost thaw vulnerability maps. Results indicated that close to one quarter of big and small game habitats, and close to twenty percent of key furbearer and gathering areas within the First Nation’s traditional territory, are situated on highly thaw sensitive permafrost.\nThese projects demonstrate how physical and socio-economic factors can be integrated in assessments of permafrost vulnerability to thaw, thus providing tangible, useable results that reflect community priorities and support local decision making.",

It refers to the discipline of attaching software code and data to scientific publications, which enables the reader to reproduce, verify, and extend published computational experiments. The Madagascar open-source software package provides an example of implementing the reproducible research discipline in geophysical publications. The package contains not only software tools for making geophysical computations but also research papers complete with links to data and reproducible data-analysis workflows. When researchers discover a research paper published on the Madagascar website and install Madagascar, they are able to follow the links and replicate all computations to verify the published computational results. Of course, reproducibility is not the goal in itself. The goal is to be able to extend previously published research by, for example, trying new computations on previously used data or previously used computations on new data. The Madagscar collection currently contains about 150 research papers and book chapters and about 900 reproducible scripts. More than 80 people from different organizations around the world have contributed to the development. This experience shows that, instead of being the responsibility of an individual author, computational reproducibility can become the responsibility of open-source scientific-software communities. Our experience shows how a dedicated community effort can keep a body of computational research alive by actively maintaining its reproducibility.",

It contains the more narrow, near-edge marginal ice zone (MIZ). Seasonal Ice Zone Reconnaissance Surveys (SIZRS) measure hydrography along two meridional sections using Air eXpendable CTDs (AXCTDs) and Air eXpendable Current Profilers (AXCPs). These surveys take place aboard U.S. Coast Guard Arctic Domain Awareness flights of opportunity during each melt season (June-October) starting in 2012.\nThe Marginal Ice Zone Modeling and Assimilation System (MIZMAS) is a high-resolution regional ice-ocean model with daily, three-dimensional output encompassing the SIZRS survey area. Direct comparison of the SIZRS data with MIZMAS output as well as with several regional climatologies can constrain the ice-ocean model and help to explain recent changes in subsurface heat content and salinity. For example, observed freshening relative to climatology has been used as a reference to which MIZMAS surface salinity values can be relaxed. MIZMAS may in turn shed light on the physical mechanisms driving the observed freshening.\nIn addition, use of MIZMAS surface fluxes to drive a one-dimensional mixed layer model gives results close to observations when the model is initialized with SIZRS profiles. Because SIZRS observations range in time from the onset of melt to the onset of Fall freeze-up, the comparison of the one-dimensional model with MIZMAS illustrates the relative roles of local and regional processes in forming near-surface temperature maxima and salinity minima. The SIZRS observations and one-dimensional model are used to constrain MIZMAS estimations of stored subsurface heat while establishing the physical drivers of these temperature and salinity changes.",

This experiment will provide the quantitative data needed to cross-reference current models with theory regarding the widely debated topic of solar coronal heating. The unique optical layout of MaGIXS utilizes a nanoprinted-silicon grating with varied line spacing placed in a converging cone of rays. Highly chirped line spacing makes it possible to achieve high imaging quality (spatial and spectral) with a planar grating at shallow graze angles. The line spacing of the diffraction grating is defined by a third order polynomial and every 372nd line is removed from the line profile, effectively producing a sub-grating optimized for diffraction of the HeNe central wavelength (632.8 nm). This novel design permits the grating to be aligned on an optical bench without the need for X-ray facilities. The sub-grating’s performance is assessed by measuring the far-field diffraction pattern resulting from the illumination of the grating with a collimated HeNe incident beam. We will present the results of this diagnostic experiment, which determine if the grating is suitable for alignment using the current integration and alignment plan for MaGIXS.",

However, fully established soil ecosystem may not be in place until after the Devonian (ca. 400 Ma) or even later. Dearth of fossil record on possible fungi- and/or bacteria-dominated early land biota renders it difficult to establish the early history of land colonization on Earth. Here we present a proxy for soil biological P- cycling.\nIgneous rock contains typically 0.005-0.4% (wt) phosphate (PO4-3). In a biologically active soil weathering profile, phosphorus (P) is cycled by land biota including by those of the most primitive kingdoms. During, for example, pyrophosphate hydrolysis, the P-O bonds in PO4-3 breaks and exchange oxygen with ambient water. The biologically processed PO4-3 will have typically much higher δ18Ovalues (15-24‰ VSMOW) than the ones inherited from igneous sources (ca. 6‰). Therefore, an increase in the δ18OPO4 from pristine igneous rocks to the upper more weathered ones should be expected if there was an active soil biological P-cycling. An igneous-PO4 δ18O value in the more weathered rocks would otherwise indicate a lack of biologically-mediated P-cycling, thus a lack of or very limited land colonization. We examined a weathering profile in the Elk Point Formation (520-503Ma), South Dakota, a paleosol developed on a metagabbro in a subtropical climate of the Mid-Cambrian. Phosphate was extracted from a drill core of this profile and was analyzed for δ18OPO4. The δ18OPO4 for the weathered and un-weathered igneous rocks are all within a narrow range of 4.8-8.2‰, suggesting that biological P-cycling was insignificant during the weathering of Elk Point metagabbro at ca. 500 Ma. Subaerial, biologically mediated weathering probably did not play a role in geochemical cycling on Earth until much later in Earth history. More paleo-weathering profiles will need to be examined before a full history and impact of the greatest invasion of life on Earth can be constructed.",

            "abstract": "The clear and pressing need to reliably identify and predict shifts in plant phenology at landscape scales requires a critical link between mechanistic understanding of climate drivers and broad scale forecasts of plant responses to climate change. A multi-scale phenology study co-located with two eddy covariance towers was initiated on the Jornada Basin LTER in New Mexico in 2010 to bridge phenology patterns at the plant level with those representing aggregated signals at the landscape level. The study integrates phenology observations collected in the field along with those collected via remotely using imagery from phenocams, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellite sensors along with estimates of carbon flux. We applied the Breaks for Additive Seasonal and Trend (BFAST) time series algorithm to MODIS 250-m NDVI greenness index values to partition the NDVI signal into components representing the long-term trend, seasonal periodicity, and residuals and identified significant shifts in the NDVI signal (i.e., “breaks”). Previous work verified breaks representing significant deviations from the BFAST seasonal and trend models using field-estimated plant biomass collected between 2000 and 2014. We subsequently examine estimates of fractional cover by functional group derived from UAV images acquired 2010 through 2015. At a mixed grassland site, the BFAST algorithm detected four breaks in the trend model denoting significant increases in NDVI in May 2004, July 2006, and March 2010 and a significant decrease in May 2012. The 2004 and 2006 breaks corresponded to herbaceous vegetation responses to rainfall following prolonged periods of drought. The 2012 decrease in NDVI corresponded to the marked reduction of herbaceous biomass following an exceptionally dry period in late 2010-2011. Seasonal breaks representing changes in the timing and magnitude of NDVI identified in July 2006 and September 2008 coincide with rapid increases in production of annual species in 2006 and perennial grasses in 2008. Combining extensive spatially-explicit UAV depictions of land surface characteristics and geographically constrained long-term plot data yielded compelling evidence to support ecologically meaningful interpretations of BFAST break points from MODIS NDVI in this water-limited grassland ecosystem.",

            "abstract": "We conducted pulse-decay permeability measurements on four horizontally oriented Utica Shale samples to examine the effects of rock mineralogy on transport mechanisms using both a non-adsorbing gas (Argon) and an adsorbing gas (CO2). The mineralogy of the shale samples varied from clay-rich to calcite-rich. We conducted the experiments at a temperature of 38.5°C, confining pressures ranging from 4.83 to 22.75 MPa, and pore fluid pressures ranging from 1.38 to 8.96 MPa. We measured the permeability at a range of confining pressures and pore pressures in order to independently test the effects of effective stress, confining pressure and pore pressure on permeability.\nOur results show that shale mineralogy did not have an impact on permeability. The permeability of clay-rich samples varied between 0.26 and 1.10 microdarcy. The permeability of calcite-rich samples varied between 0.18 and 2.05 microdarcy. Additionally, we found that the shale mineralogy affected the stress-dependent permeability. The magnitude of permeability reduction as a function of effective stress was dependent on the overall rock mineralogy. When the effective stress increased from 3.45 MPa to 13.79 MPa, the permeability of the clay-rich and calcite-rich samples decreased by 85% and 48%, respectively. Based on Klinkenberg analysis, we found that the mean effective pore radius for the clay-rich sample decreased from 27 nm at 3.45 MPa effective stress to 15 nm at 13.79 MPa effective stress (44% reduction). The mean effective pore radius for the calcite-rich sample decreased from 49 nm to 38 nm (22% reduction). These findings suggest that variations in rock mineralogy lead to different responses in mechanical deformation as the effective stress increases with depletion. Finally, our CO2 permeability measurements show that the CO2 permeability for the clay-rich sample decreased by 40% compared to Argon permeability. The CO2 permeability for the calcite-rich sample did not shift and was equivalent to the prior Argon permeability. As the measurements with both gases were performed at the same mean free path to achieve the same impact of slippage flow on permeability, the observed difference in permeability was due to the adsorption of CO2. These findings suggest that rock mineralogy affects how CO2-shale interactions lead to permeability change.",

            "abstract": "The La Nina between 2011-2012 led to significant droughts in the US and Northeastern Brazil while the historic drought in Amazon in 2010 was caused in part by the historic central Pacific El Nino. In order to investigate the role of drought on the atmospheric CO2 growth rate, we use satellite observations of CO2 and CO to infer spatially resolved carbon fluxes and attribute those fluxes to combustion sources correlated with drought conditions. Solar induced fluorescence in turn is used to estimate the impact of drought on productivity and its relationship to total flux. Preliminary results indicate that carbon losses in Mexico are comparable to the total fossil fuel production for that region. These in turn played an important role in the acceleration of the atmospheric growth rate from 2011-2012. These results were enabled using the NASA Carbon Monitoring System Project (CMS-Flux), which is based upon a 4D-variational assimilation system that incorporates observationally-constrained “bottom-up” estimates from the Fossil Fuel Data Assimilation System (FFDAS), the ECCO2-­Darwin physical and biogeochemical adjoint ocean state estimation system, and CASA-GFED3 land-surface biogeochemical model.",

            "abstract": "Numerous extrasolar giant planets have been discovered. Yet many questions remain unanswered regarding their structure, formation and evolution. Their relatively low mean density indicates that they must be primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, probably in a cosmological proportion. The mass-radius measurements also showed that these planets must contain some heavier elements, which is expected assuming they were formed by core accretion. From the observations it is unclear however how the different materials are distributed in the interiors of these planets.\nWhile ab initio simulations and shock experiments have helped to constrain the properties of hydrogen-helium mixtures at high pressures, little is known about the role of heavy elements, Z, in these mixtures. To model the interiors of giant planets, it is important to understand how ternary hydrogen-helium-Z mixtures behave at high pressure and to what extend their properties can be described with an ideal mixing approximation that is based on additive volume rule Here we present our results of ab initio simulations and describe the influence of heavy elements on the thermodynamic, and chemical properties of H-He-Z mixtures. We compare different mixing approximations and conclude by discussing the consequences for the modeling of giant planets.",

Although the effect of these earthquakes have been limited to relatively small areas have caused general alarm within the population and even in some cases true catastrophes (e.g. San Cristobal 1875). These groups of earthquakes that have lasted for weeks and even months have greater importance because they affect the most populous state area including the capital city of Guadalajara. An extraordinary example of these series of earthquakes occurred on 8 may 1912 that lasted until September. In the first 18 days 64 events were felt by residents of Guadalajara. Since then, there has been a relative seismic activity calm in the region.\nThis paper analyzes the earthquake of May 18, 2012 (03:07 UT) occurred at the West edge of Lake Chapala. While it's an event of low magnitude (4.5 Ms) it has the importance of having occurred just 60 km to the South of Guadalajara and for which instrumental data of first quality is available. The focus of the earthquake was located at 20.30 ° N and 103.49 ° W at a depth of 0 km using arrivals of P and S waves at 16 regional seismic stations. However, by the errors of localization inherent in the method focus could be in a range of 0 to 5 km deep. The mechanism of failure using the polarities of the first arrivals favors a clear faulting of dip slip type along a plane with strike = 227 °, Dip = 80 °, and Rake = 93 °. Waveforms analysis is being used to corroborate these results.",

            "abstract": "The impacts of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events on shortwave and longwave cloud radiative effects (CRESW and CRELW) and the related changes in cloud fraction and aerosol emissions, wet scavenging and transport are quantified using three 150-year simulations for the preindustrial condition from the CESM model. Compared to recent observations from Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES), the model simulation successfully reproduced larger variations of CRESW over the tropical western and central Pacific, Indonesian regions, and the eastern Pacific, as well as large variations of CRELW located mainly within the tropics. The ENSO cycle is found to dominate interannual variations of cloud radiative effects, especially over the tropics. Relative to those during La Niña events, simulated cooling (warming) effects from CRESW (CRELW) during El Niño events are stronger over tropical western and central Pacific, with the largest difference exceeding 40 Wm-2 (30 Wm-2), and weaker effects of 10-30 Wm-2 over Indonesian regions and the subtropical Pacific. Sensitivity tests show that variations of cloud radiative effects are mainly driven by ENSO-induced changes in cloud fraction. However, changes in natural aerosol concentrations, primarily due to changes in wet scavenging and transport processes, also play an important role in modulating the variations of cloud radiative effects. Because of increased (decreased) precipitation in El Niño (La Niña) events, increased (decreased) wet scavenging and transport of natural aerosols offset about 10% of variations of cloud radiative effects averaged over the tropics, whereas the emission changes enhance the variations by 4-6%. Moreover, the variation in medium and high cloud fraction accounts for about 20-50% of the interannual variations of CRESW over the tropics and almost all of the variations of CRELW between 60°S and 60°N. The variation of low cloud fraction plays a dominant role in contributing interannual variations of CRESW over midlatitude oceans. Variations in natural aerosols with all processes explained 10-30% of the interannual variations of both CRESW and CRELW over tropical central pacific, Indonesian regions and tropical Indian Ocean, as well as 10-40% of the interannual variations of CRESW over the west coast of major continents.",

At its peak, agriculture in Syria accounted for 25 percent of the country's GDP. In 2014, Syrian agriculture accounted for less than 5 percent of the GDP. This decline in agricultural productivity is the cause of a 3-year long drought that started in 2007, followed by a still-ongoing conflict that started in mid-2011. Using remote sensing tools, this paper focuses on the impact that the 2007-2010 drought had on agricultural production, as well as the impact that the ongoing conflict had on the agricultural production in northern Syria. Remote sensing is a powerful and great solution to study regions of the world that are hard-to-reach due to conflict and/or other limitations. It is particularly useful when studying a region that inaccessible due to an ongoing conflict, such as in northern Syria. Using multi-temporal Landsat 5 and Landsat 8 images from August 2006, 2010 and 2014 and utilizing the neural networks algorithm, we assessed for agricultural output change in northern Syria. We conclude that the ongoing Syrian conflict has had a bigger impact on the agricultural output in northern Syria than the 3-year long drought.",

Seventy-five percent of the population of Rwanda earns a living from farming, mostly subsistence. Loss of farmland, housing, or life, to landslides is a very real hazard. Landslides in Rwanda have an impact at the economic, social, and environmental level. In a developing nation that faces challenges in tracking, cataloging, and predicting the numerous landslides that occur each year, satellite imagery and spatial analysis allow for remote study. We have focused on the development of a landslide inventory and a statistical methodology for assessing landslide hazards. Using logistic regression on approximately 30 test variables (i.e. slope, soil type, land cover, etc.) and a sample of over 200 landslides, we determine which variables are statistically most relevant to landslide occurrence in Rwanda. A preliminary predictive hazard map for Rwanda has been produced, using the variables selected from the logistic regression analysis.",

            "abstract": "Multiple seismic observables are increasingly often combined to image the Earth’s deep interior due to their complementary sensitivities to subsurface structure. We use a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (rjMcMC) algorithm to incorporate different seismic observables including surface wave dispersion, particle motion Ellipticity (ZH ratio), and receiver functions into a transdimensional, hierarchical Bayesian (THB) inversion for the profiles of shear velocity (Vsh and Vsv), compressional velocity (Vp), and density beneath a seismic station. In addition, we apply a Parallel Tempering sampling method to improve the sampling efficiency of rjMcMC for the joint inversion. Compared to traditional inversion approaches, Bayesian approaches yield an ensemble of models instead of a single best-fit model, enabling us to fully quantify uncertainty and trade-offs between model parameters.\nWe perform tests on idealized data in which all three data types are analyzed individually and together. We demonstrate that by treating the number of model parameters as an unknown to be estimated from the data, we can both eliminate the need for a fixed parameterization based on prior information, and obtain better model estimates with reduced trade-offs. By analyzing the inversion results obtained using different combinations of data types, we show that while an individual data type is able to retrieve certain features of the profiles of Vp, Vs, and density, a joint inversion can leverage their complementary sensitivities to recover more accurate profiles. We then apply the THB approach to analyze the ability of surface wave dispersion constraining the 1D radial anisotropy. The ensemble results of Vp, Vsv and Vsh allow us to estimate not only the radial anisotropy, but also the trade-off between the radial anisotropy and Vp. We also use the actual phase velocity measurement from USArray ambient tomography to invert for 1D velocity structure and radial anisotropy. We analyze the distributions of the retrieved velocity profiles with depth, and compare our inferred results with those from other studies.",

In this work, the local finite-amplitude wave activity (LWA) of Huang and Nakamura (2015) is introduced as a diagnostic of the 500-hPa geopotential height (Z500) for characterizing midlatitude weather events. It is found that the LWA climatology and its variability associated with the Arctic Oscillation (AO) agree broadly with the previously reported blocking frequency in literature. There is a strong seasonal and spatial dependence in the trends of LWA in recent decades. While there is no observational evidence for a hemispheric-scale increase in wave amplitude, robust trends in wave activity can be identified at the regional scales, with important implications for regional climate change.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Selvadurai_2015_AGU.pdf\nUsing a direct shear friction apparatus, we characterize factors controlling rheological differences along a PMMA-PMMA fault in the laboratory. Rheological differences on natural faults are believed to be a controlling factor to aseismic transients (slow slip) in nature. Asperity sizes and locations were measured using a pressure sensitive film at high (σn = 0.8 MPa) and low (σn = 0.4 MPa) nominal normal stress levels. Faults confined to low and high normal stress experienced lower and higher ‘effective heterogeneity,’ quantified using a characteristic elastic correlation length λc [Braun and Peyrard, 2012]. The fault was sheared at a constant far-field velocity VLP under constant normal stress σn. Non-uniform premonitory slip accumulated along the fault prior to rapid sliding. Slow events (SE), which were characterized as local increases in slip rate, were observed when the effective heterogeneity was increased. These events nucleated from the weaker central section of the fault propagating outwards at speeds between 0.84 mm/s to 26.5 mm/s over times 406 s and 11 s. The rupture growth rates were dependent on the load-point velocity VLP driving the system to failure.\nSlip rates, which increased within the SE, were also dependent on the load-point velocity. The evolution of slip rates versus time was similar to the 2013-2014 Boso slow slip event [Fukuda et al., 2014]. The slow event culminated with rapid slip rate deceleration sufficient to generate seismicity measured by an array of acoustic emission sensors. Deceleration of the SE (left panel of figure) shows a lower-frequency event (~ 60 – 350 Hz). In Detail A, we show the smaller, high-frequency events (~ 300 – 500 kHz) were superimposed on the larger, low-frequency signal. These events only occurred at higher levels of effective heterogeneity and demonstrate interactions between larger/slow and localized/fast slip.\n",

            "abstract": "The right-lateral Hosgri-San Gregorio fault system extends mainly offshore for about 400 km along the central California coast and is a major structure in the distributed transform margin of western North America. We recently mapped a poorly known 64-km-long section of the Hosgri fault offshore Big Sur between Ragged Point and Pfieffer Point using high-resolution bathymetry, tightly spaced single-channel seismic-reflection and coincident marine magnetic profiles, and reprocessed industry multichannel seismic-reflection data. Regionally, this part of the Hosgri-San Gregorio fault system has a markedly more westerly trend (by 10° to 15°) than parts farther north and south, and thus represents a transpressional “big bend.” Through this “big bend,” the fault zone is never more than 6 km from the shoreline and is a primary control on the dramatic coastal geomorphology that includes high coastal cliffs, a narrow (2- to 8-km-wide) continental shelf, a sharp shelfbreak, and a steep (as much as 17°) continental slope incised by submarine canyons and gullies. Depth-converted industry seismic data suggest that the Hosgri fault dips steeply to the northeast and forms the eastern boundary of the asymmetric (deeper to the east) Sur Basin. Structural relief on Franciscan basement across the Hosgri fault is about 2.8 km. Locally, we recognize five discrete “sections” of the Hosgri fault based on fault trend, shallow structure (e.g., disruption of young sediments), seafloor geomorphology, and coincidence with high-amplitude magnetic anomalies sourced by ultramafic rocks in the Franciscan Complex. From south to north, section lengths and trends are as follows: (1) 17 km, 312°; (2) 10 km, 322°; (3)13 km, 317°; (4) 3 km, 329°; (5) 21 km, 318°. Through these sections, the Hosgri surface trace includes several right steps that vary from a few hundred meters to about 1 km wide, none wide enough to provide a barrier to continuous earthquake rupture.",

Our objective is to derive the general features of the FAEs, to identify their driving mechanisms and to evaluate the importance of the different mechanisms. More than two years of measurements by the Helium Oxygen Proton Electron mass spectrometer and the Electric Field and Waves experiment are analyzed to identify low-energy (100eV-50keV) FAEs and to quantify the concurrent electric and magnetic wave components. We also peek at the observable waveforms with bursts of high-time resolution measurements. From statistical analysis and case studies, we suggest in particular that TDS cause field-alignment of ~300eV electrons in the pre-midnight sector while chorus waves cause field-alignment of electrons of ~10keV in the morning sector of the outer belt.",

            "abstract": "High SiO2 rhyolites emplaced during ‘super-eruptions’ demonstrate that large volumes of eruptible magma can exist in the upper crust. However, the timescale over which the magma reservoirs that source these eruptions are built remains controversial. Thermal models suggest that magma emplacement rates need to be > 0.005-0.01 km3/yr in order to accumulate enough eruptible magma to source a ‘super-eruption’. Yet, these rates are higher than the time-averaged rates (< 0.001 km3/yr) for nearly all well-studied granitoid plutonic complexes. This disparity contradicts geologic evidence suggesting that the high SiO2 rhyolites emplaced during ‘super-eruptions’ are extracted from crystal rich magma chambers that should be preserved in the geologic record as granodioritic and granitic plutons.\nWe quantify time-averaged magma emplacement rates for the upper crustal Golden Horn batholith, WA based on new geologic mapping and U-Pb zircon CA-IDTIMS geochronology. The batholith is exposed over 310 km3 and can be separated in the field into five intrusive units. High topography allows the 3D geometry of each phase to be constrained and their volumes range from < 100 km3 to > 400 km3. U-Pb zircon geochronology reveals that four of the five phases were assembled incrementally and distinct zircon populations from samples within these phases suggest that individual magmatic pulses had fully crystallized before the next arrived. However, six nearly identical U-Pb zircon dates from a > 400 km3 rapakivi granite show that this phase was built in ca. 50 kyr and that large portions may have been emplaced nearly simultaneously. The implied emplacement rate for this phase (≥ 0.008 km3/yr) is in agreement with those predicted for assembly of the upper crustal magma chambers that source ‘super-eruptions’, and it may provide a rare and unprecedented opportunity to study the processes that occur in such chambers.",

Released in fall 2015, Living With Our Changing Climate takes a more narrow approach and investigates human and ecosystem vulnerabilities to climate change, the role of energy choices in affecting climate, actions humans can take through adaption, mitigation, and policy to lessen vulnerabilities, and psychological and financial reasons behind climate change denial.\nWhile Living With Our Changing Climate is intended for programs looking to add a climate element into their curriculum, Our Changing Climate is part of the AMS Climate Studies course.

            "abstract": "Storage of CO2 as supercritical liquid in oil reservoirs has been proposed for enhanced oil recovery and a way to lower atmospheric CO2 levels. The fate of CO2 after injection requires an understanding of mineral dissolution/precipitation reactions occurring between the formation minerals and the existing formation brines at formation temperatures and pressures in the presence of supercritical CO2. In this study, core samples from three potential storage formations, the Vedder Fm. (Rio Bravo oil field), Stevens Fm. (Elk Hills oil field) and Temblor Fm. (McKittrick oil field) were reacted with a synthetic brine and CO2(sc) at reservoir temperature (110°C) and pressure (245-250 bar). A combination of petrographic, SEM-EDS and XRD analyses, brine chemistry, and PHREEQ-C modelling were used to identify geochemical reactions altering aquifer mineralogy. XRD and petrographic analyses identified potentially reactive minerals including calcite and dolomite (~2%), pyrite (~1%), and feldspars (~25-60%). Despite the low abundance, calcite dissolution and pyrite oxidation were dominant geochemical reactions. Feldspar weathering produced release rates ~1-2 orders of magnitude slower than calcite dissolution. Calcite dissolution increased the aqueous concentrations of Ca, HCO3, Mg, Mn and Sr. Silicate weathering increased the aqueous concentrations of Si and K. Plagioclase weathering likely increased aqueous Ca concentrations. Pyrite oxidation, despite attempts to remove O2 from the experiment, increased the aqueous concentration of Fe and SO4. SEM-EDS analysis of post-reaction samples identified mixed-layered illite-smectites associated with feldspar grains suggesting clay mineral precipitation in addition to calcite, pyrite and feldspar dissolution. The Vedder Fm. sample underwent complete disaggregation during the reaction due to cement dissolution. This may adversely affect Vedder Formation CCS projects by impacting injection well integrity.",

            "abstract": "The Himalaya enhances and redistributes large-scale precipitation systems associated with winter storms, the Indian monsoon, and other relevant weather systems through the year. The resulting runoff across the Himalaya is depended on by over a billion people in south Asia for energy, agriculture, industry, and human consumption. However, the observation and understanding of regional precipitation patterns are limited on account of sparse in-situ meteorological data and complex topography. Additionally, the region’s extreme elevations pose significant challenges for remotely sensed observation and global reanalyses in accurately representing precipitation. Mesoscale simulations are therefore the best available option to determine precipitation patterns and evaluate water resources in the Himalaya. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model has been used to simulate the spatiotemporal distribution of precipitation over High Asia for a single, continuous hydrological year at high resolution (6.7 km). The output is compared to available high-elevation rain gauges along the Himalaya, as well as gridded precipitation estimates from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and satellite cloud-mask data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), to gauge the performance of the model in simulating the full annual range of precipitation systems over the Himalaya.\nWRF and TRMM show a similar inter-seasonal cycle of precipitation that appropriately represents climatic influences ranging from extratropical cyclones to the monsoon. Good agreement is also observed in the locations of precipitation maxima in transition months between the two regimes. WRF also compares well to daily in-situ precipitation throughout the year, with correlation coefficients generally at 0.5 and above, but decreasing for stations at increasingly high elevations. Diurnal cycles of precipitation during the monsoon are also similar between WRF and TRMM, with WRF capturing individual mountain/valley circulations not shown by TRMM, but validated by surface stations and MODIS cloud cover. This study demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of the model in simulating Himalaya precipitation over the course of a year, and improves our understanding of Asia’s water resources.",

Multi-disciplinary methods have been applied to test the various hypotheses for its genesis. These include study of the vertical crustal motions precursory to flood volcanism, the spatial distribution and time-history of volcanism, the synchronous deformation and volcanism in the adjacent African and South American plates, the fabric of the sea floor, the seismic structure of the mantle, and the geochemical composition of the lavas. Models inspired by the huge array of observational data available have been further explored using numerical modeling of mantle convection.

This high resolution dataset will optimize estimates of SST in critical parts of the world’s oceans, such as coastal upwelling regions. We use Spatial Statistical Data Fusion (SSDF), a statistical methodology for predicting global spatial fields by exploiting spatial correlations in the data. The main advantages of SSDF over spatial smoothing methodologies include the provision of probabilistic uncertainties, the ability to incorporate multiple datasets with varying footprints, measurement errors and biases, and estimation at any desired resolution. In order to accommodate massive input and output datasets, we introduce two modifications of the existing SSDF algorithm. First, we compute statistical model parameters based on coarse resolution aggregated data. Second, we use an adaptive spatial grid that allows us to perform estimation in a specified region of interest, but incorporate spatial dependence between locations in that region and all locations globally. Finally, we demonstrate with a case study involving estimations on the full globe at coarse resolution grid (30 km) and a high resolution (1 km) inset for the Gulf Stream region. ",

Laboratory observations by an optical breadboard of the GOLD imager show performance that matches the expected performance of the flight instrument and that exceeds the requirements. Excellent agreement is seen between these laboratory observations and model calculations of the N2 LBH spectrum. Such laboratory data, as well as model simulations of the expected observations, will be used in the development and testing of the data processing to be used during flight. Simulated observations of increasing realism are being developed. These simulations are a valuable tool for developing and understanding GOLD’s observations of the neutral temperatures on the disk and limb, neutral composition (O/N2 density) on the disk, molecular oxygen density profile and the nighttime ionosphere at low latitudes. Simulations will also be used test observing plans and software for data reduction. The contract for accommodation of the GOLD instrument on the SES-14 satellite was signed in April 2015. That made GOLD the first NASA mission of opportunity to establish a contract for commercial launch into geostationary orbit. The host satellite, a Eurostar 3000 built by Airbus Defence & Space for SES, will use electric propulsion for transfer to geostationary orbit. Securing a contract for hosting has allowed the interfaces to the spacecraft to be defined and the instrument design to be completed. This presentation describes the current status of the GOLD instrument, the future development of the mission, and the simulations of the GOLD measurements.",

            "abstract": "Readily understandable and consistent language for describing confidence in detection and attribution statements can be developed based on the approach used by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). IARC was founded in 1965 to provide government authorities with expert, independent, scientific opinion on the causes of human cancer. IARC developed four standard terms for evaluations of the strength of evidence for carcinogenicity arising from human and experimental animal data, and for the strength of mechanistic evidence. Evidence is categorized as sufficient, limited, inadequate, and lack of carcinogenicity. The IARC process then combines theory, evidence, and degree of agreement into a summary evaluation that includes concise statements of the principal line(s) of argument that emerged, the conclusions of the working group on the strength of the evidence for each group of studies, citations to indicate which studies were pivotal to these conclusions, and the reasons for any differential weighting of data. The summary IARC categories are: Group 1 for agents carcinogenic to humans; Group 2 includes Group 2A (probably carcinogenic to humans) or Group 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans) on the basis of epidemiological and experimental evidence of carcinogenicity and mechanistic and other relevant data; Group 3 for agents is not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans; and Group 4 for agents probably not carcinogenic to humans. There are obvious parallels with describing confidence in key findings on detection and attribution of a trend to anthropogenic climate change with the confidence statements used by the IARC. Developing and consistent application of similar categories along with accompanying explanations of the principal lines of evidence, would be a helpful step in clearing communicating the degree and sources of certainty in the findings of detection and attribution.",

            "abstract": "Ecological studies are increasingly recognizing the importance of atmospheric vapor-pressure deficit (VPD) as a driver of forest drought stress and disturbance processes such as wildfire. Because of the nonlinear Clausius-Clapeyron relationship between temperature and saturation vapor pressure, small variations in temperature can have large impacts on VPD, and therefore drought, particularly in warm, dry areas and particularly during the warm season. It is also clear that VPD and drought affect forest fire nonlinearly, as incremental drying leads to increasingly large burned areas. Forest fire is also affected by fuel amount and connectivity, which are promoted by vegetation growth in previous years, which is in turn promoted by lack of drought, highlighting the importance of nuances in the sequencing of natural interannual climate variations in modulating the impacts of drought on wildfire. The many factors affecting forest fire, and the nonlinearities embedded within the climate and wildfire systems, cause interannual variability in forest-fire area and frequency to be wildly variable and strongly affected by internal climate variability. In addition, warming over the past century has produced a background increase in forest fire frequency and area in many regions. In this talk I focus on the western United States and will explore whether the relationships between internal climate variability on forest fire area have been amplified by the effects of warming as a result of the compounding nonlinearities described above. I will then explore what this means for future burned area in the western United States and make the case that uncertainties in the future global greenhouse gas emissions trajectory, model projections of mean temperatures, model projections of precipitation, and model projections of natural climate variability translate to very large uncertainties in the effects of future climate variability on forest fire area in the United States and globally.",

Observations of the conditions on the Sun are crucial for determining when and if a warning is needed. The Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) operated by the National Solar Observatory (NSO) consists of six ground stations, allowing continuous observations of the Sun. Of particular interest for space weather purposes are the H-alpha images and magnetograms. The H-alpha data are used to identify filaments and their eruptions, to assess active region evolution and plage extent, and to help localize flare locations. The magnetograms are used to identify neutral lines, to examine potential shearing areas and to characterize the magnetic structure of active regions. GONG magnetograms also provide the initial condition for models of solar wind expansion through the heliosphere such as the WSA-Enlil model. Although beyond the scope of current space weather applications, GONG helioseismology products can be used to assess active region emergence on the far side of the Sun and to indicate the flaring potential of a front-side active region. These products are being examined as future tools in flare prediction.\nNSO has operated GONG as a science facility since 1995 and has provided processed space weather data products to NOAA via public internet connections for the past several years. In 2014 the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requested that NOAA transition the GONG network to an operational space weather asset in order to ensure the continued flow of critical magnetogram data for solar wind models. NSO will continue to operate and manage the instruments and sites, but the H-alpha images and 10 minute averaged magnetogram data will be sent directly to SWPC for processing and use in space weather modeling. SWPC will make these data available to NSO and the public via the new NOAA Integrated Dissemination Program (IDP) network. We discuss the progress and details of this change.",

While rare, these events have recently increased in frequency in Alaska and may continue to increase under the projected warming climate. Dynamically downscaled data are now available for Alaska based on historical reanalysis for 1979-2013, while CMIP5 historical and future scenario downscaling are in progress. These new data offer a detailed, gridded product of rain and snowfall not previously possible in the spatially and temporally coarser reanalysis and GCM output currently available. Preliminary analysis shows that the dynamical downscaled data can identify extreme ROS events in Interior Alaska. The ROS events in the dynamically downscaled data are analyzed against observations and the ERA-Interim reanalysis data used to force the historical downscaling simulations. Additionally, the synoptic atmospheric circulations conditions that correspond to major ROS events in various regions of Alaska are identified with Self-Organizing Map (SOM) analysis. Such analysis is beneficial for operational forecasters with the National Weather Service and for diagnosing the mechanisms of change in future climate projections.",

The Google Earth Engine (GEE) is a platform provided by Google Inc. to support scientific research and analysis of environmental data in their cloud environment. The intent is to allow scientists and independent researchers to mine massive collections of environmental data and leverage Google's vast computational resources to detect changes and monitor the Earth’s surface and climate. GEE hosts an enormous amount of satellite imagery and climate archives, one of which is the Climate Hazards Group Infrared Precipitation with Stations dataset (CHIRPS). The CHIRPS dataset is land based, quasi-global (latitude 50N-50S), 0.05 degree resolution, and has a relatively long term period of record (1981-present). CHIRPS is on a continuous monthly feed into the GEE as new data fields are generated each month. This precipitation dataset is a key input for FEWS NET monitoring and forecasting efforts.\nFEWS NET intends to leverage the GEE in order to provide analysts and scientists with flexible, interactive tools to aid in their monitoring and research efforts. These scientists often work in bandwidth limited regions, so lightweight Internet tools and services that bypass the need for downloading massive datasets to analyze them, are preferred for their work. The GEE provides just this type of service. We present a tool designed specifically for FEWS NET scientists to be utilized interactively for investigating and monitoring for agro-climatological issues. We are able to utilize the enormous GEE computing power to generate on-the-fly statistics to calculate precipitation anomalies, z-scores, percentiles and band ratios, and allow the user to interactively select custom areas for statistical time series comparisons and predictions.",

            "abstract": "Droughts and floods are part of the Amazon weather pattern, but in face of climate change, it has been expected an increase in their intensity and duration. Forests are important regulators of climate. However, it is still unknown how they respond to an increase in frequency and intensity of extreme droughts. Additionally, there are great uncertainties related with the forest behavior in an enriched CO2 environment. For the Amazon rainforest, some authors report forest growth in a drier climate, while others report forest mortality in these same conditions. The crucial factor in this process seem the linkage between atmospheric demand from water and its provision by soil moisture, intermediated by the plants. In theory, in regions where soil moisture is high, even in the absence of rainfall conditions, water exists in enough quantity to meet the atmospheric demand, and majority of plants behave as an evergreen forest. This is the case, for example, for some research sites of equatorial regions of the Amazon forest, which tend to increase evapotranspiration rates in dry season, when the atmospheric demand is higher. However, the extent to which soil moisture decreases, the plant is no longer able to meet the atmospheric demand, limiting evapotranspiration and possibly, entering in a dormant state. To understand the forest response to droughts, in terms of its potential to maintain or reduce evapotranspiration rates, it is necessary to know water dynamics in soil and soil layers where plants are able to extract water. It's a challenge, considering the great variability of soils and plants that forms the huge biodiversity of the Amazon forest. Here, we present an experiment design based on isotopic analyzes in a small watershed in Amazon basin. In order to understand the dynamics of the water used by the plant during the evaporation process, isotope analysis were carried out in soil water collected from shallow and deep groundwater, in the water collected on the bark of plants and rainfall water, intercepted or not by the canopy. These results were analyzed in conjunction with the soil properties, its moisture retention capacity and groundwater level variations. This study presents some insights about the capability of this methodology to answer questions related to the soil moisture sources and forest response to droughts.",

            "abstract": "One method to constrain photosynthesis and respiration independently at the ecosystem scale is to measure the fluxes of CO2­ isotopologues. Instrumentation is currently available to makes these measurements but they are generally costly, large, bench-top instruments. Here, we present progress toward developing a laser-based sensor that can be deployed directly to a canopy to passively measure CO2 isotopologue fluxes. In this study, we perform initial proof-of-concept and sensor characterization tests in the laboratory and in the field to demonstrate performance of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) tunable diode laser flux sensor. The results shown herein demonstrate measurement of bulk CO2 as a first step toward achieving flux measurements of CO2 isotopologues. The sensor uses a Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL) in the 2012 nm range. The laser is mounted in a multi-pass White Cell. In order to amplify the absorption signal of CO2 in this range we employ wave modulation spectroscopy, introducing an alternating current (AC) bias component where f is the frequency of modulation on the laser drive current in addition to the direct current (DC) emission scanning component. We observed a strong linear relationship (r2 = 0.998 and r2 = 0.978 at all and low CO2 concentrations, respectively) between the 2f signal and the CO2 concentration in the cell across the range of CO2 concentrations relevant for flux measurements. We use this calibration to interpret CO2 concentration of a gas flowing through the White cell in the laboratory and deployed over a grassy field. We will discuss sensor performance in the lab and in situ as well as address steps toward achieving canopy-deployed, passive measurements of CO2 isotopologue fluxes.

During the early snow melting season surface air temperature is significantly increased by 3-6K due to early snow melting and enhanced solar radiation.

            "abstract": "Vast networks of eddy covariance flux measurements have been made across the globe in the recent decades. The global network – FLUXNET, which contains 700+ historical and active flux measurement sites, provides a comprehensive framework in studying the terrestrial carbon and water cycles. Today, the latest synthesis database contains 2200+ years of data from 400+ sites. While decadal records are becoming available in a subset of the FLUXNET sites (~15%), the majority (>50%) still possess less than five years of data. Thus, it has always been a dilemma for data users to choose between spatial and temporal coverage, or to simply assume exchangeable between space and time. Here, we examine the spatial and temporal representativeness of the FLUXNET sites and the newest synthesis database. Briefly, the general site information is compiled from all available FLUXNET database. The long-term (1981-2013) and global gridded data of climate, land use, and plant phenology are obtained from the CRU, SYNMAP, and GIMMS database. The spatial and temporal representativeness of the site location and operation duration is then examined against the global and long-term database. Potentially, FLUXNET sites have covered the major environmental gradients in most of the biomes. Yet, the data availability is highly imbalanced among ecoregions in terms of the sites existed or the data provided by the existing sites. Arguably, as least five years of records are required to adequately capture the long-term interannual variability of climatic and phenological conditions at most site locations. That means, extra caution is needed to make inference beyond the spatial or temporal extents of current database. At last, a simple Bayesian hierarchical model is developed and fitted against a subset of flux data from multiple sites with similar plant function types and long-term records. The diagnostic model intends to test the hypothesis of exchangeability between space and time in modeling fluxes.",

            "abstract": "We post-processed 141,080 pairs of high quality radial and transverse receiver functions from the Earthscope Automated Receiver Survey using a variant of what we have called generalized iterative deconvolution method and reshaped the spiking output into different scales of Ricker wavelets. We then used these data as input to our 3D plane wave migration method to produce an image volume of P to S scattering surfaces under all of the lower 48 states. The result is arguably the highest resolution image ever produce of the mantle transition zone. Due to the effect of migration impulse response, different scales of Ricker wavelets provide another important means of controlling the resolution of the image produced by 3D plane wave migration method. Model simulation shows that comparing to the widely used CCP stacking method with receiver functions shaped by Gaussian wavelet, the application of our methods is capable of resolving not only dipping discontinuities but also more subtle details of the discontinuities. Application to the latest USArray data reveals several previously unobserved features of the 410 and 660 discontinuities. Both discontinuities are resolved to a precision approaching 1 km under the stable interior, but degrading to the order of 10 km in the western US due to a probably combination of higher attenuation and velocity heterogeneity not resolved by current generation tomography models. Topography with many 10s of km is resolved at a range of scales. In addition, we observe large variation of relative amplitude on the radial component and large variations in the radial to transverse amplitude ratio that correlate with inferred variations in discontinuity topography. We argue this combination of observations can be explained by roughness at a range of scales. Roughness is consistent with the phase-change model for these discontinuities given there is little reason to think the mantle is homogeneous at these distance scales. Continental scale isopach of the transition zones shows the average thickness of the transition is approximately 15 km greater in the eastern US compared to the western US. This change occurs on a well define boundary roughly under the Mississippi River. The standard phase change model would thus predict higher transition zone temperatures on the western side of this boundary.",

Variables related to the water cycle are routinely computed from satellite remote sensing from several space agencies, and the products are used at NOAA in operational or experimental modes. This study seeks to investigate to what extent there is consistency among the diverse products, and how they represent the water cycle at different scales.\nRemote sensing of land surface temperature and radiation is used to estimate surface energy fluxes by means of the Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse (ALEXI) model. An Evaporative Stress Index representing anomalies in the ratio of actual-to-potential is a reliable indicator of drought also obtained from the ALEXI model. Observations from all currently available microwave satellite sensors are processed and merged to obtain the best possible estimates of soil moisture. The Global Soil Moisture Operational Product System (SMOPS) may also ingest brightness temperature observations applying a single channel algorithm to retrieve soil moisture. All satellite retrievals in SMOPS are merged into a soil moisture product that includes proxies of the errors. The Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) monthly precipitation data set (a current NOAA CDR project) uses satellite precipitation data sets over ocean and satellite plus gauge-based analyses over land. For operational needs, NESDIS’s Hydro-Estimator (H-E) uses infrared data from GOES to estimate higher temporal resolution (sub-daily) rainfall rates. Streamflow at all the river mouths is estimated by the Dominant river tracing-Routing Integrated with VIC Environment model using precipitation input and other forcing data. Evapotranspiration, soil moisture, precipitation, streamflow and groundwater are derived at different resolutions, time scales and different periods. The challenge of including them into a common framework (the water cycle) will require an evaluation of each product, the assessment of their associated errors, and finding optimal ways of transferring such information into a common grid",

Antimony(V) and (III) are the two most environmentally-relevant oxidation states, but little is known about the redox transitions between the two in natural systems. To better understand the behavior of antimony in anoxic environments, we examined the transformations of Sb(V) under Fe(III)- and sulfate-reducing conditions in aqueous suspensions that contained 2 mM KSb(OH)6, 50 mM Fe(III) (as ferrihydrite), 10 mM sulfate, and 10 mM lactate, and were inoculated with sediment from a wetland on the campus of Argonne National Laboratory in Argonne, Illinois. Samples were collected over time to track changes in the concentrations of Sb, Fe(II), sulfate, and lactate, as well as the composition of the microbial community as determined by 16S rRNA gene inventories. We also examined the interaction of Sb(V) with pure Fe(II) mineral phases in aqueous suspensions containing 2 mM KSb(OH)6 and 50 mM Fe(II) as either magnetite, sideritre, vivianite, green rust, or mackinawite. X-ray absorption fine-structure spectroscopy was used to determine the valence state of Sb and its chemical speciation. Lactate was rapidly fermented to acetate and propionate concomittant with a bloom of Veillonellaceae. Utilization of propionate for dissimilatory sulfate reduction (DSR) was accompanied by an increase in Desulfobulbaceae. Sb K-edge X-Ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analysis showed reduction of Sb(V) to Sb(III) within 4 weeks, concurrent with DSR and the formation of FeS. We observed variable responses in the ability of specific Fe(II) minerals to reduce Sb(V). No reduction was observed with magnetite, siderite, vivianite, or green rust. In the presence of mackinawite (FeS), however, Sb(V) was reduced to Sb(III) sulfide. These results suggest that the reduction of Sb(V) to Sb(III) is not likely under solely Fe(III)-reducing conditions, but is expected in sulfidogenic environments.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Ko-AGU2015x.pdf\nRecurrence of extensive hypoxia on the Louisiana shelf during the summer has strong impacts to the marine life and ecosystems. The formation of hypoxia depends on nutrient enhanced primary production and subsequent respiration in the water and sediment. It also depends on the physical processes of vertical stratification, transport, mixing and air-sea exchanges. All these processes are spatially and temporally variable. A high resolution coastal circulation model that covers the Louisiana shelf, therefore, has been developed for realistic simulation to better understand the processes of hypoxia formation in the region. Multi-year model simulation has been conducted driven by NOGAPS/COAMPS surface fluxes. The result shows that the stratification predicted by the model is too weak to produce realistic bottom hypoxia applying a Simple Dissolved Oxygen scheme. The weak stratification is partly due to overheating in shallow water resulting from excessive solar penetration by applying a constant water type. It is also partly due to unrealistic surface salinity flux based on seasonal climatology. To improve upon these known biases, the light attenuation estimated from SeaWiFS/MODIS and rainfall estimated from TRMM have been used. The predicted temperature and in particular the salinity using the satellite data were improved in comparison to observations and the stratification over the shelf is substantially improved resulting in realistic simulation of bottom-water hypoxia.",

            "abstract": "Supereruptions – which catastrophically eject 100s-1000s of km3 of magma to the surface in a matter of days to a few months – have been described as the ultimate geologic hazard; yet, we lack direct knowledge of the processes and signals leading to them. We use zoning in quartz to assess the timescales over which the transition from quiescent pre-eruptive crystallization to syn-eruptive decompression and crystallization takes place, focusing on the Bishop Tuff (CA). Quartz crystals in the Bishop Tuff have distinctive rims (<200 μm thick), which are Ti-rich and bright in cathodoluminescence (CL). We use high-resolution CL imaging to obtain estimates of these timescales with unprecedented precision.\nWe performed CL imaging using an SEM, employing a 5 kV electron beam, which yields much improved spatial resolution but reduced CL contrast. We imaged rim-interior contacts using a pixel size of ~0.2 μm, with dwell times per pixel of 1-3.2 ms. Contacts were placed vertically to maximize their sharpness. Maximum timescales of crystallization were determined using a 1D model, assuming initial step functions. Minimum quartz growth rates were calculated using measured rim thicknesses.\nMaximum rim growth times span from ~1 min to 35 years, with a median of ~4 days. More than 70% of rim growth times are less than 1 year, showing that quartz rims have mostly grown in the days to months prior to eruption. Minimum growth rates show distinct modes between 10-8 and 10-10 m/s (depending on sample), revealing very fast crystal growth rates (100s of nm to 10s of μm per day).\nCrystallization times for quartz crystal interiors based on diffusion chronometry, melt inclusion faceting, and crystal size distributions show that establishment of a melt-rich magma body (or bodies) took place within a few millennia of eruption. Gas-saturated crystallization led to accumulation of bubbles, which eventually drove destabilization and eruption. The onset of decompression is recorded as a microlite population observed in crystal size distributions. Concomitant rim growth reveals that decompression initiated within a year of eruption, with most of the growth happening in the weeks or days preceding eruption. These are the timescales over which signs of an impending eruption can be felt at the surface, providing much needed warning for hazard mitigation.",

            "abstract": "At subduction megathrusts, propagation of large ruptures may be confined between the up-dip and down-dip limits of the seismogenic zone. This opens a primary role for lateral rupture dimensions to control the magnitude and severity of megathrust earthquakes. The goal of this study is to improve our understanding of the ways in which the inherent variability of the subduction interface may influence the degree of interseismic locking, and the propensity of a rupture to propagate over regions of variable slip potential. We focus in particular on the roughness of the incoming seafloor, which we expect to be of primary importance.\nThe global absence of a historic record sufficiently long to base risk assessment on, makes us rely on numerical modelling as a way to extend our understanding of the spatio-temporal occurrence of earthquakes. However, the complex interaction of the subduction stress environment, the variability of the subduction interface, and the structure and deformation of the crustal wedge has made it very difficult to construct comprehensive numerical models of megathrust segmentation. We intend to develop and exploit the power of a plastic 3D continuum representation of the subduction megathrust, as well as off-megathrust faulting to model the long-term tectonic build-up of stresses, and their sudden seismic release.\nThe sheer size of the 3D problem, and the time scales covering those of tectonics as well as seismology, force us to explore efficient and accurate physical and numerical techniques. So far, we have focused our efforts on developing a staggered grid finite difference code that makes use of the PETSc library for massively parallel computing. The code incorporates a newly developed automatic discretization algorithm, which enables it to handle a wide variety of equations with relative ease. What remains now is combining the physics that act on the different spatial and temporal scales. To this end we explore new constitutive models that enable adaptive time stepping, artificial damping of waves, and allow us to make a stable transition from implicit to explicit solution methods. We will present preliminary 2D modelling results of rough seafloor subduction indicating that seamounts may cause down-dip segmentation of the megathrust, and outline our strategy for building a comprehensive 3D setup.",

Here we report the average Ceres spectrum, including the spectral range previously precluded from telescopic measurements due to telluric atmospheric absorptions. The data indicate that the surface is very dark: average albedo of 0.090 ±0.006 at 0.55 µm, consistent with HST data (Li et al., 2006). Ceres’ average spectrum is characterized by a prominent absorption band at 2.7 micron. Weaker absorption bands are observed between 3.05-3.1, 3.3-3.4 and 3.9-4 micron; the visible and near-IR ranges lack prominent bands. We modelled the spectra of Ceres using Hapke theory. Results of the spectral modelling indicate that extensive water ice is not present in surface spectra acquired so far. The best fit is obtained with a mixture of ammoniated phyllosilicates mixed with other clays, Mg-carbonates, and dark material, like magnetite (De Sanctis et al. 2015, submitted). The presence of ammonia bearing materials across the surface has implications for the origin of Ceres and its internal structure and evolution. Higher spatial resolution spectra are being acquired to address the small scale mineralogy across this dwarf planet.\n",

The ionospheric perturbations may be described as enhancements and depletions compared to the quiet time variations, known as positive and negative phases of the ionospheric storms, respectively. In spite of a significant volume of studies on the ionospheric responses to the geomagnetic storms, understanding of ionospheric storm has not reached a level where it is possible to predict it. Geomagnetic activity may be divided into three categories: substorms, storms of different intensity, and high-intensity long-duration continuous AE activity (HILDCAA) events. This work presents specifically the latitudinal responses of the noontime F region peak parameters (hmF2 and foF2) to HILDCAA events. For this, digisonde data from 51 stations around the world was selected from the Digital Ionogram Data Base (DIDbase) from 2004 to 2012. For the same period 19 HILDCAA events were detected. Preliminary results show a positive effect in the peak parameters of the southern hemisphere and a negative effect in those of the northern hemisphere, suggesting that there is a predominantly northward component of the meridional winds. Additionally, it seems that the events occurring around the summer solstice have meridional wind components that are exclusively northward, while two of the six winter time events have southward components. Wintertime events are also the only ones with a very prominent eastward component of the zonal winds.",

            "abstract": "High-resolution point clouds and digital terrain models (DTMs) are used to investigate lava textures on the Big Island of Hawaii. Lava texture (e.g., ʻaʻā and pāhoehoe) depends significantly on eruption conditions, and it is therefore instructive, if accurately determined. In places where field investigations are prohibitive (e.g., on other planets and remote regions of Earth) lava texture must be assessed from remote sensing data. A reliable method for doing so remains elusive.\nThe December 1974 flow from Kilauea, in the Kau desert, presents an excellent field site to develop techniques for identifying lava texture. The eruption is young and the textures are well preserved. We present results comparing properties of lava textures observed in Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) data. The authors collected the TLS data during May 2014 and June 2015 field seasons. Scans are a quantitative representation of what a geologist, or robotic system, sees “on the ground” and provides “ground truth” for airborne or orbital remote sensing analysis by enabling key parameters of lava morphology to be quantified. While individual scans have a heterogeneous point density, multiple scans are merged such that sub-cm lava textures can be quantified.\nResults indicate that TLS-derived surface roughness (i.e., de-trended RMS roughness) is useful for differentiating lava textures and assists volcanologic interpretations. As many lava types are quite rough, it is not simply roughness that is the most advantageous parameter for differentiating lava textures; rather co-occurrence patterns in surface roughness are used. Gradually forming textures (e.g., pāhoehoe) are elevated in statistics that measure smoothness (e.g., homogeneity) while lava with disrupted crusts (e.g., slabby and platy flow) have more random distributions of roughness (i.e., high entropy). A similar technique will be used to analyze high-resolution DTMs of martian lava flows using High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment DTMs. This work will lead to faster and more reliable volcanic mapping efforts for planetary exploration as well as terrestrial geohazards.",

Early mylonites are cut by younger brittle faults,\nincluding locally abundant, shallowly dipping, pseudotachylyte-lined slip surfaces. These\nfrictional melt generation veins can be grouped based on mesoscopic character of both\npseudotachylyte and host granodiorite mylonite. All vein types are subparallel to biotite-lined,\nhost rock C-surfaces. Thin (<2mm), foliated type 1 veins define networks either confined to,\nor located at margins of C-surface dominated ultramylonite. Type 2 veins are thicker (2-4mm)\nwith abundant host rock survivor clasts. Though largely parallel C-surfaces, these veins\npossess S-surface-parallel segments up to several cms long, and cut host rock with a strong\nS-C fabric. Type 3 veins lack mesoscopic foliation and cut host rock ranging from\nprotomylonite to ultramylonite. They are similar in thickness to type 2 veins, but include fewer\nsurvivor clasts.\nPrevious 40Ar/39Ar dates on pseudotachylyte veins (16.24 ± 0.23 Ma and 17.44 ± 0.20\nMa) show pseudotachylyte-producing seismicity occurred over at least 1 million years. Multi-\ndiffusion-domain analysis of host rock K-feldspar demonstrates cooling below 150°C by 21.8\nMa. Assuming a geothermal gradient between 25°C and 50°C/km, pseudotachylyte veins were\ngenerated at a maximum depth of 2.5-5 km. Fabric intensity of anisotropy of magnetic\nsusceptibility (AMS) corresponds to vein types. Paleomagnetic analyses yield 3 clusters of\ncharacteristic remanent magnetizations (ChRMs) that correlate to AMS/vein types. ChRMs of\nnonfoliated type 3 veins are close to the Miocene pole. By contrast, ChRMs for type 1 and 2\nveins are deflected close to the foliation due to strong anisotropy of their magnetic mineral\nassemblages.\nNormal faults dipping <30° are poorly oriented for slip according to Andersonian fault\nmechanics. Previous workers therefore have suggested they failed at steeper dips, then\nrotated to current orientations. The uniformity of South Mountains generation vein orientations\nrecords no rotation between formation of the oldest and youngest veins. The proximity of the\nChRMs of type 3 veins to the Miocene pole similarly indicates no rotation. Slip may have been\nfacilitated by low friction of biotite-lined C-surfaces.",

            "abstract": "Climate extremes, such as heat waves and heavy precipitation, are more likely to occur with increased warming and simultaneously have profound influences on ecosystem fluxes. Existing studies have already investigated how a single extreme event affects ecosystem dynamics. However, how ecosystems respond to consecutive climate extremes is rarely examined. More heat waves are expected to cause more droughts, while more heavy precipitation could cause more floods. Both may have a negative effect on vegetation growth, although wetter conditions may alternatively stimulate growth. In the southern Great Plains the hydrological year of 2006 was the second-driest year on record, with only 61% of long-term annual precipitation. In contrast, the summer of 2007 was the second-wettest summer, with 121% of the normal annual precipitation. This “pair” provides a unique example to study alternatively contrasting climate extremes and their impacts on ecosystem dynamics. In this study, we aim to assess whether or not this consecutive drought and flood has altered the sensitivity of ecosystem carbon fluxes and water use efficiency. To investigate this question, we parameterized a newly developed process-based terrestrial ecosystem model (TEM-Hydro daily version) and applied the Maurer’s 1/8 degree daily climate datasets. The modeled results are compared against the MODIS datasets and Ameriflux Eddy Covariance observations to determine the mechanism responsible for understanding how extremes in precipitation affect ecosystem functions. The significance of the consecutive climate extremes on ecosystem structures and processes in the southern Great Plains will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Layered materials play an important role in nuclear waste management and environmental cleanup. Better understanding of radionuclide interactions with those materials is critical for engineering high-performance materials for various applications. This presentation will provide an overview on radionuclide interactions with two general categories of layered materials – cationic clays and anionic clays – from a perspective of nanopore confinement. Nanopores are widely present in layered materials, either as the interlayers or as inter-particle space. Nanopore confinement can significantly modify chemical reactions in those materials. This effect may cause the preferential enrichment of radionuclides in nanopores and therefore directly impact the mobility of the radionuclides. This effect also implies that conventional sorption measurements using disaggregated samples may not represent chemical conditions in actual systems. The control of material structures on ion exchange, surface complexation, and diffusion in layered materials will be systematically examined, and the related modeling approaches will be discussed.\nThis work was performed at Sandia National Laboratories, which is a multiprogram laboratory operated by Sandia Corporation, a Lockheed-Martin Company, for the DOE under contract DE-AC04-94AL8500.",

            "abstract": "Agricultural watersheds in the Midwestern U.S. are major contributors of nutrients to the Mississippi River Basin and the Gulf of Mexico. Many states within the Upper Mississippi River Basin, including Iowa, are developing nutrient reduction strategies to reduce non-point and point source loads of nitrogen and phosphorous in an effort to reverse degradation of streams and lakes.\nQuantifying nutrient loads in Iowa and assessing loads transported within Iowa rivers are important components of Iowa's strategy. Nutrient loads estimated with data collected using traditional methods of grab sampling are expensive and have met with limited usefulness to the agricultural community when assessing the effectiveness of implemented conservation practices.\nNew sensor technology is allowing for real-time measurement of nutrient loads in many Iowa rivers. IIHR Hydroscience and Engineering has deployed 22 nitrate-nitrogen sensors in several Iowa rivers to provide accurate measure of nutrient loads. Combined with 17 sensors operated by the USGS, the sensor network captures nutrient transport and loading patterns in rivers across the state. A new Iowa Water Quality Information System (IWQIS) is being developed to display and share the continuous, real-time data.\nThe data reported here will compare and contrast load calculations obtained using continuous monitors with those from a more traditional grab samples. We also will demonstrate how continuous nitrate monitoring informs watershed hydrology and the assessment of conservation practices designed to reduce nutrient loss from farmed fields. Finally, we will establish that the costs of real time continuous monitoring are modest when compared to grab sampling strategies and the costs of implementing conservation on productive lands in the Western Corn Belt of Iowa.",

Beginning as one of the first Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) archive centers, GES DISC has evolved to offer a wide range of science-enabling services. With a growing understanding of needs and goals of its science users, GES DISC continues to improve and expand on its broad set of data discovery and access tools, subsetting services, and visualization tools. Nonetheless, the multitude of the available tools, a partial overlap of functionality, and independent and uncoupled interfaces employed by these tools often leave the end users confused as of what tools or services are the most appropriate for a task at hand. As a result, some the services remain underutilized or largely unknown to the users, significantly reducing the availability of the data and leading to a great loss of scientific productivity.\nIn order to improve the accessibility of GES DISC tools and services, we have designed and implemented UUI, the Unified User Interface. UUI seeks to provide a simple, unified, and intuitive one-stop shop experience for the key services available at GES DISC, including subsetting (Simple Subset Wizard), granule file search (Mirador), plotting (Giovanni), and other services. In this poster, we will discuss the main lessons, obstacles, and insights encountered while designing the UUI experience. We will also present the architecture and technology behind UUI, including NodeJS, Angular, and Mongo DB, as well as speculate on the future of the tool at GES DISC as well as in a broader context of the Space Science Informatics.",

            "abstract": "The contribution to sea level change from the Antarctic ice sheet depends on the balance between ice loss along the margin and snowfall in the interior. Studies of accumulation trends for the past few decades show large interannual variability, and present inconsistent relationships with site temperature. Here we investigate the relationship between accumulation and temperature on centennial to multi-millennial timescales for the past 31 ka using records from the WAIS Divide ice core (WDC) in central West Antarctica. WDC is unique in Antarctica because (1) the accumulation history is well-constrained by measured annual layer thicknesses and (2) the temperature history is derived from the stable isotope record that has been calibrated by the internal ice-sheet (borehole) temperature.\nConsidering the full 31ka record, the accumulation and temperature vary coherently on timescales longer than 2ka and we find that a 1˚C warming corresponds to a 5% increase in accumulation, in agreement with GCM simulations. However, the relationship is not temporally consistent. For the past 8 ka, accumulation and temperature are coherent to timescales as short as 300 years and the accumulation/temperature scaling is much larger, 17% per ˚C; in contrast, from 8ka to 15 ka, a period which includes three abrupt climate change events, there is no coherent relationship and the accumulation-temperature relationship is slightly anti-correlated.\nA transient GCM simulation for the past 22 ka (TraCE) shows coherence at all timescales in central West Antarctica and a consistent ~5% increase per ˚C. Whether the data and model differences extend beyond central West Antarctica cannot be assessed. The varying relationship between temperature and accumulation at WAIS Divide indicate that atmospheric circulations patterns are critical to predicting future Antarctic accumulation and that climate models may not be fully capturing the dynamics, at least in central West Antarctica. Therefore, considerable uncertainty exists in the projected accumulation increase on the Antarctic ice sheet in a warming climate.",

In the summer of 2011, we collected E-change data with wideband flat-plate antennas (0.16 Hz – 2.5 MHz) at ten stations covering an area of nearly 70 km x 100 km in and around Kennedy Space Center, Florida, USA. On one thunderstorm day, 14 August 2011, we detected 226 positive NBPs, and some observations of these pulses were published in Karunarathne et al. [2015, JGR-atmospheres]. Of these 226 NBPs, 50 (22.1 %) occurred within 10 km horizontally of at least one sensor. All of these closer sensors show electrostatic changes associated with corresponding NBPs, with a net electrostatic change in the main bipolar pulse and with a slower electrostatic change after the bipolar pulse that seems similar to short continuing current immediately after some cloud-to-ground return strokes. Although NBPs have been considered as short duration pulses (10 – 20 microseconds), the electrostatic changes after the main bipolar pulse ranged from 0.7 ms to 34 ms and associated charge moments were calculated. The total duration of the electrostatic E-change was strongly dependent on the distance to the sensors. In this presentation, we will present data for these electrostatic changes, some statistics, and physical background and reasoning for the electrostatic changes.",

            "abstract": "Dacite lavas from Chaos Crags, Lassen Volcanic Center, CA contain inclusions of more mafic magmas, suggesting that mixing or mingling of magmas occurred just prior to lava dome extrusion, and perhaps triggered the eruption. The timescales between the mixing event and eruption are unknown, but reaction rims on biotite grains hosted in the Chaos Crags dacite may provide a record of the timescale (i.e., chronometer) between mixing and eruption. To quantify the effect of pre-eruptive heating on the formation of reaction rims on biotite, we conducted isobaric (150 MPa), H2O-saturated, heating experiments on the dacite end-member. In heating experiments, we held the natural dacite at 800°C and 150MPa for 96 hours and then isobarically heated the experiments to 825 and 850°C (temperatures above the biotite liquidus, <815°C at 150MPa) for durations ≤96 hours. We analyzed run products using high-resolution SEM imaging and synchrotron-based X-ray tomography, which provides a 3-dimensional rendering of biotite breakdown reaction products and textures. X-ray tomography images of experimental run products reveal that in all heating experiments, biotite breakdown occurs and reaction products include orthopyroxenes, Fe-Ti oxides, and vapor (inferred from presence of bubbles). Experiments heated to 850°C for 96 h show extensive breakdown, consisting of large orthopyroxene crystals, Fe-Ti oxide laths (<100μm), and bubbles. When the process of biotite breakdown goes to completion, the resulting H2O bubble comprises roughly the equivalent volume of the original biotite crystal. This observation suggests that biotite breakdown can add significant water to the melt and lead to extensive bubble formation. Although bubble expansion and magma flow may disrupt the reaction products in some magmas, our experiments suggest that biotite breakdown textures in natural samples can be used as a chronometer for pre-eruptive magma mixing.",

Two years of high frequency sensor measurements of nitrate (NO3-) concentrations in the Upper Potomac River at the Little Falls gage were analyzed to quantify seasonal variation in the magnitude and timing of the apparent loss of NO3- from the water column that results from diel-driven processes. In addition to broad seasonal and flow-driven variation in NO3- concentrations, clear diel patterns were evident in the river, especially during low flow conditions that follow stormflow by several days. Diel variation was about 0.01 mg N/L in winter and 0.02 to 0.03 mg N/L in summer with intermediate values during spring and fall. This variation was equivalent to <1% of the mean daily NO3- concentration in winter and about 4% in summer; however, variation >10% occurred during some summer days. Maximum diel concentrations occurred during mid- to late-morning in most seasons, with the most repeatable patterns in summer and wider variation in timing during fall and winter. Diel NO3- loss diminished loads by about 0.6% in winter and 1.3% in summer, and diel-driven processes were minor compared to estimates of total in-stream NO3- loss that averaged about one-third of the inferred groundwater NO3- contribution to the river network. The magnitude of diel NO3- variation was more strongly related to metrics based on water temperature and discharge than to metrics based on photosynthetically active radiation. Despite the fairly low diminishment of NO3- loads attributable to diel variation, estimates of diel NO3- uptake were fairly high compared to published values from smaller streams and rivers. The diel NO3- patterns observed in the Potomac River are consistent with photosynthesis of periphyton as a principal driver which may be linked to denitrification through the release of labile carbon. The extent to which these diel patterns are related to measures of aquatic metabolism are unknown as is the role of dispersion in obscuring diel patterns. Improvements to these diel estimates will require additional measures such as dissolved oxygen and ammonium, and the use of a second upstream measurement station to better constrain NO3- uptake values.",

We incorporate a modified canopy scheme into the Community Land Model with snow interception as a prognostic variable to alleviate the source of some biases. Maximum interception limits and snow unloading are adjusted to in-situ canopy measurements. The canopy radiation scheme has been updated from a direct temperature dependence of optical parameters to a dependence on the prognostic snow storage. With these improvements, boreal forest zones show large, significant albedo error reductions relative to MODIS observations. Model gridcell error reduction during spring results from a more gradual seasonal transition in albedo, while error reduction in winter is from a lower albedo. Error is also reduced overall for North Hemisphere land area.\nWe assess the impacts of the snow canopy vegetation treatment in coupled model warming scenarios. Little change in global albedo feedback or climate sensitivity were shown, but significant regional and temporal variations resulted, partly from changing circulation patterns",

Such changes are often considered to bring a variety of “frontline” local impacts to Arctic coastal communities such as increased rates of coastal erosion. However, direct consequences of these changes to local food security (e.g. through impacts on subsistence activities and marine transport of goods) may be outweighed at least in the short term by the effects of large scale Arctic sea ice change coupled with global oil markets. For example, a later freeze-up might delay local hunters’ transition from boats to snow-machines, but whether this trend will affect hunting success, especially in the next few years, is uncertain. Likewise, the magnitude of change in open water season length is unlikely to be sufficient to increase the frequency with which communities are served by barges. However, an expanding open water season throughout the Arctic has implications for the global economy, which can have indirect effects on local communities. In the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas, where rapid sea ice change has been accompanied by increased interest in oil and gas development, the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management currently requires drilling operations to cease 38 days prior to freeze up. Taking this into account, the lengthening open water season has effectively extended the drilling season for oil companies by 184% since the 1950s. If oil development goes ahead, local communities will likely experience a range of indirect impacts on food security due to increased vessel traffic and demand on infrastructure coupled with changes in local economies and employment opportunities. Increased likelihood of an oil spill in coastal waters also poses a significant threat to local food security. Thus, while Arctic coastal communities are already experiencing direct impacts of reduced sea ice extent, these may be over-shadowed by the indirect effects of global impacts.",

            "abstract": "Ambient aerosols are important air pollutants with direct impacts on human health and on the Earth’s weather and climate systems through their interactions with radiation and clouds. Their role is dependent on their distributions of size, number, phase and composition, which vary significantly in space and time. There remain large uncertainties in simulated aerosol distributions due to uncertainties in emission estimates and in chemical and physical processes associated with their formation and removal. These uncertainties lead to large uncertainties in weather and air quality predictions and in estimates of health and climate change impacts. Despite these uncertainties and challenges regional-scale coupled chemistry-meteorological models such as WRF-Chem have significant capabilities in predicting aerosol distributions and explaining aerosol-weather interactions. In this talk we explore the hypothesis that new advances in on-line, coupled atmospheric chemistry/meteorological models, and new emission inversion and data assimilation techniques applicable to such coupled models, can be applied in innovative ways using current and evolving observation systems to predictions of aerosol distributions at regional scales. Broader applications to atmospheric composition are also discussed.",

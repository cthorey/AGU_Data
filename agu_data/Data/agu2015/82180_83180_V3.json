            "abstract": "ePoster - 2015 AGU Wilson et al maritime poster_fn.pdf\nThe 2010 Chile and 2011 Japan tsunamis both struck the California coast offering valuable experience and raised a number of significant issues for harbor masters, port captains, and other maritime entities. There was a general call for more planning products to help guide maritime communities in their tsunami response, mitigation, and recovery activities. The State of California is working with the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the U.S. National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP), and other tsunami experts to provide communities with new tsunami planning tools to address these issues:\nResponse Playbooks and plans have been developed for ports and harbors identifying potential tsunami current hazards and related damage for various size events. Maps have been generated showing minor, moderate, and severe damage levels that have been linked to current velocity thresholds of 3, 6, and 9 knots, respectively. Knowing this information allows harbor personnel to move ships or strengthen infrastructure prior to the arrival of distant source tsunamis.\nDamage probability tools and mitigation plans have been created to help reduce tsunami damage by evaluating the survivability of small and large vessels in harbors and ports. These results were compared to the actual damage assessments performed in California and Japan following the 2011 Japanese tsunami. Fragility curves were developed based on current velocity and direction to help harbor and port officials upgrade docks, piles, and related structures.\nGuidance documents are being generated to help in the development of both local and statewide recovery plans. Additional tools, like post-tsunami sediment and debris movement models, will allow harbors and ports to better understand if and where recovery issues are most likely to occur. Streamlining the regulatory and environmental review process is also a goal of the guidance.\nThese maritime products and procedures are being integrated into guidance through the NTHMP to help other U.S. states/territories/commonwealths develop their own tsunami planning tools. This will lead to more accurate, consistent, and cost-effective tsunami planning strategies within the U.S.",

            "abstract": "Flux transfer events (FTEs) are considered as a result of transient magnetic reconnection and are often observed in the vicinity of the Earth’s magnetopause. The FTEs are responsible for transfer of mass, energy and momentum between solar wind and magnetosphere. According to FTE generation models and in situ observations, FTEs are formed in the subsolar region when the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) is southward while for northward IMF they should be formed in the polar cap regions. In the present study it is analyzed 58 FTE events observed by the THEMIS spacecraft. First of all, the deHoffmann-Teller technique is employed to determine the local FTE velocity and direction. Then, these parameters (velocity and direction) are compared with those predicted by the Cooling model which has largely been employed to estimate the motion of reconnected flux tubes over a modeled magnetopause under specific solar wind conditions. The calculated deHoffmann-Teller velocity and direction indicate that FTEs observed at the flanks of magnetosphere (|YGSM|≥10 Re) move antisunward and dawn/duskward. For intermediate longitudes (|YGSM|<10 Re) a combination of dusk/dawnward and southward motions is found for the present study. The comparison between the calculated FTEs' velocity/direction and those predicted by the Cooling model presents a good agreement. It is also found that 12 FTE events were observed in the equatorial region during northward IMF.",

We find that the multi-model ensemble only offers skill for the latest summer submission in August, and that throughout the forecasting period skill is lower than that found in hindcasts of sea-ice extent performed during earlier periods of the modern satellite record. The model-mean ensemble offers slightly higher skill, but does not beat a damped persistence forecast. We also find that the models are equally unsuccessful at predicting each other, indicating a large divergence in model physics and/or initial conditions. We explore whether the recent SIO years have been inherently more unpredictable than past decades with the help of an idealized GCM experiment. We find that in an unforced control run there are several periods of high/low persistence in the Arctic sea-ice system, but these do not translate into high/low predictability. It is thus likely that changing predictability arises from changing boundary conditions.",

Motivated by this, we have performed two sets of experiments with SIO models that include both fully coupled global models, and global/regional ice-ocean models. One is an initial condition perturbation experiment, whereby we apply a fixed -1m perturbation to the sea-ice thickness initial conditions of a past SIO, and find that the response varies significantly across models. In the second experiment, we perform two sets of simulations. The control set is initialized with a climatological May 1 sea ice thickness in the central Arctic, while the experiment set is initialized with May 1 2015 sea ice thickness. This allows us to investigate both model uncertainty, and the forecast signal provided by initialized ice thickness. While the models show agreement in certain aspects of the forecast, we find significant differences in forecast uncertainty between fully coupled and ice-ocean models, that the 2015 sea ice thickness information provides a weak but consistent positive thickness response, and that model uncertainty has a strong regional signal. The results from both experiments suggest that different model physics across the Sea Ice Outlook make a significant contribution to model uncertainty and forecast skill degradation, yet provide a guide on how to interpret and improve such forecasts.",

Despite this potentially far-reaching impact of seafloor weathering on habitable planet evolution, existing modeling frameworks do not include the full scope of alteration reactions or recent findings of convective flow dynamics. We present a coupled fluid dynamic and geochemical numerical model of low-temperature, off-axis hydrothermal activity. This model is designed to explore the the seafloor weathering flux of carbon to the oceanic crust and its responsiveness to climate fluctuations. The model’s ability to reproduce the seafloor weathering environment is evaluated by constructing numerical simulations for comparison with two low-temperature hydrothermal systems: A transect east of the Juan de Fuca Ridge and the southern Costa Rica Rift flank. We explore the sensitivity of carbon uptake by seafloor weathering on climate and geology by varying deep ocean temperature, seawater dissolved inorganic carbon, continental weathering inputs, and basaltic host rock in a suite of numerical experiments.",

The CDF file and contents can be uploaded to a website or simply shared as a normal document maintaining all interactive features of the model and data.

            "abstract": "Landscapes disturbed by intensive land uses are susceptible to sediment erosion that may degrade river water quality. In February 2004, the southern portion of New Zealand’s North Island, which is covered by livestock grazing, experienced an extreme precipitation event which resulted in extensive landsliding in the Oroua and Pohangina subcatchments of the Manawatu River catchment. In this study, we (1) assess whether land use influences landslide occurrence; (2) identify landslides that are active sediment sources to river channels; and (3) determine if land use can switch subcatchments from supply-limited (river sediment loads are limited by available sediment in the landscape) to transport-limited (river sediment loads are limited by flow capacity). Results revealed that landslides caused by this extreme precipitation event occurred disproportionately in areas identified as pasture, suggesting that these areas are more susceptible to landsliding than forested areas. The observed sediment load response to flood events for the period of 1999-2014 in the Pohangina subcatchment was variable in relation to flood magnitude, indicating a supply-limited landscape, while in the Oroua subcatchment the observed sediment response was relatively proportional to flood magnitude, indicating a transport-limited landscape. Further analysis of sediment storage and delivery processes within the two subcatchments is necessary to explain the observed sediment load responses. Channel connectivity analysis revealed that approximately 65% of landslide scars were unconnected to river channels, so there will likely be a response lag in sediment loads. As livestock grazing intensity increases in New Zealand, an understanding of the short-term and long-term impacts of land use on soil erosion and water quality is necessary to develop effective management practices.",

Research has shown GHG fluxes from hydrologically active landscapes such as floodplains and wetlands vary spatially and temporally in response to primary controls including soil moisture, soil temperature, and available nutrients. In this ongoing study, we are measuring GHG fluxes at six locations 24 times over a year within an Appalachian floodplain. Site locations are based on dominant landscape positions and hydrologic activity along a topographic gradient including the stream margin, an active slough, and the upland area. GHG fluxes are measured using a Picarro G2508 Cavity Ring Down Spectrometry GHG Analyzer employing the static chamber method. We are also conducting large synoptic sampling of GHG fluxes across the floodplain surface during the wet and dry seasons to explore spatial heterogeneity trends between extreme soil moisture conditions. Data collected thus far has shown correlations between CO2 and soil temperature and soil moisture. CH4 and N2O fluxes have shown to largely depend on degree of saturation in the soil. By the conclusion of our project, we predict temporal patterns in GHG fluxes and soil nutrient content that reflect an increase in microbial function and the release of CO2, CH4, and N2O during warmer and wetter seasons. Spatially, we hypothesize differences in GHG fluxes based on the frequency and duration of the floodpulse at the various locations similar to patterns we have seen thus far of increased production in CH4 and N2O at the intermittently flooded versus dry locations.",

Emissions are estimated with an empirical model which established the relationship between solid fuel-use pattern and meteorological, geographic, and income factors for rural residential households in China using the ~17,000 samples collected by questionnaire survey in 2010. At the same time, an improved emission factors database is also compiled in this work by collecting most recent local measurements. Driven by the increase of income, household residents prefer to choose fossil fuel than biofuel. The estimated aggregated consumptions of coal and crop residues for rural residential are higher by 58% and lower by 47% compare to the official energy statistics, respectively. Emissions from China’s rural residential sector in 2010 are estimated to be 2.2 Tg SO2, 0.4 Tg NOx, 40.0 Tg CO, 2.1 Tg NMVOC, 3.1 Tg PM2.5, 0.5 Tg BC and 1.2 Tg OC respectively. The developed inventory improves the fuel consumption data availability for rural residential and represent the differences in fuel use patterns among provinces. This work is important to understand the characteristics of rural residential fuel activities and emissions by providing the valuable first-hand solid fuel-use pattern data for rural residential in China and will be helpful to improve the accuracy of bottom-up emission inventory over China.",

This paper will present an overview of an abstract notion of data layers of this types, what we are referring to as reference data layers for Earth and environmental science, highlight some historical examples, and delve into new approaches. The concept of reference data layers in this context combines data availability, cyberinfrastructure and data science, as well as domain science drivers. We argue that current advances in cyberinfrastructure such as iPython notebooks and integrated science processing environments such as iPlant’s Discovery Environment coupled with vast arrays of new data sources warrant another look at the how to create, maintain, and provide reference data layers. The goal is to provide a context for understanding science needs for reference data layers to conduct their research. In addition, to the topics described above this presentation will also outline some of the challenges to and present some ideas for new approaches to addressing these needs. Promoting the idea of reference data layers is relevant to a number of existing related activities such as EarthCube, RDA, ESIP, the nascent NSF Regional Big Data Innovation Hubs and others.",

This study focused on characterizing and understanding summertime air quality in the Northern Front Range Metropolitan Area (NFRMA), with an emphasis on ozone and its precursors. Exceedances of the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for ozone occur regularly in the NFRMA during the summertime and impact air quality in Rocky Mountain National Park (ROMO). As part of FRAPPÉ, the National Park Service supplemented its long-term monitoring at its Longs Peak site (~9000 ft.) with enhanced trace gas and aerosol measurements; ozone and meteorological measurements were also deployed at a high altitude site off of Trail Ridge Road (~11,600 ft.). At Longs Peak, a suite of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), including nonmethane hydrocarbons, halocarbons, alkyl nitrates and oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs), were measured using a cryogen-free gas chromatographic system and a proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometer. Additionally, whole air samples were collected along a route from Fort Collins, CO up to Trail Ridge Road several times per week. The transect samples were typically collected during upslope events and aircraft deployment days to characterize air mass composition and to aid in linking the surface and airborne measurements. Ozone distributions from Trail Ridge Road and Longs Peak generally tracked well temporally, with the highest ozone levels measured at the high elevation site; maximum hourly values during FRAPPÉ were 82 ppb and 79 ppb, respectively. A mixed signature containing both urban and oil and gas emissions was regularly observed in air masses encountered in the park, with elevated ozone and VOC levels measured during upslope events. However, the highest levels of alkanes measured at Longs Peak were associated with oil and gas operations, based on the isopentane to n-pentane ratio. Transect samples and aircraft data collected during an upslope event will be used to assess air mass transport to ROMO and will be compared to species concentrations as modeled by the Comprehensive Air quality Model with Extensions (CAMx). CAMx meteorological inputs will be developed using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, with special attention paid to accurately capturing upslope flow.",

            "abstract": "The source of magmatism and mechanisms responsible for the observed geochemical signatures in Miocene to Recent Colorado Plateau (CP) basalts has been a renewed focus of investigation in light of Earthscope results. We report new Os and Nd isotopic data for magnesian basalts (Mg#=62-72) and interpret them in light of previously reported Hf isotope data to help constrain contributions from olivine-poor source lithologies and subduction-derived metasomatism in the genesis of recent CP volcanism. The basalts studied span a large range in Hf isotope compositions and represent melts last equilibrated at a variety of depths beneath the Colorado Plateau and its transition zones.\nWe distinguished at least three mantle domains on the basis of paired Hf-Nd isotope, other isotopic, and geochemical characteristics of CP lavas. Domain 1 likely represents a depleted, variably metasomatized, lithospheric source, with relatively radiogenic εHf (+5.2 to +11.8) and highly variable εNd (-6.2 to +6.2). Domain 2 could represent either ancient or Farallon subduction-modified mantle and is displaced above the Hf-Nd mantle array (εHf=+1.0 to +7.3; εNd=-6.1 to -3.5). Domain 3 may be melts of pyroxenite/mica-rich veins or layers within lithospheric mantle and is characterized by unradiogenic Hf and Nd (εHf=-12.9 to +0.6; εNd=-10.0 to -2.9). The isotopic variability in CP-related lavas can largely be attributed to contributions from these mantle domains.\nPreliminary Os isotope data show no correlation with proxies for differentiation or crustal contamination. Osmium and Hf isotope compositions are negatively correlated between domains 1 and 2 (187Os/188Os=0.31 to 0.59), whereas the Os isotope ratios in two domain 3 basalts have both lower and higher values (187Os/188Os=0.25 and 0.68). Significantly, Os isotope signatures are highly radiogenic (vs. values of <0.12 for SW US peridotite xenoliths [1]), overlapping and extending the range for inferred melts of pyroxene- and mica-rich veins and/or layers [2]. Thus mafic magmatism associated with the CP appears to ubiquitously tap sources at least locally modified by processes such as recycling of ancient oceanic crust, introduction of terrigenous sediments, or subduction-related metasomatism.\n[1] Lee et al., Nature, 2001.\n[2] Carlson and Nowell, G-Cubed, 2001.",

            "abstract": "Man-made dams influence more than just the flow of water in a river. The build up of sediments and organic matter, increased residence times, and elevated nutrient inputs from upstream can result in increased algal growth and blooms, altered DO patterns, and can also influence the flux of nutrients from watersheds. Many of the effects of dams vary in intensity based on the geomorphology of their resulting reservoirs. In this study, we examined eight reservoirs located in four different coastal watersheds in New England, USA, to analyze the role that characteristics such as depth, width, volume, and residence time play in regards to metabolism (GPP and Respiration) and nutrient retention. At the inflows and outflow of each reservoir, we measured conductivity, dissolved oxygen, total suspended solids, nitrate, phosphate, chlorophyll, and dissolved organic carbon. Using conductivity, which is conservative, and watershed area, we created a mass balance for each watershed. In most cases the conductivity mass balance indicated that water inputs and outputs were at equilibrium during sampling, allowing us to assess the alteration of non-conservative material fluxes. Dissolved oxygen and TSS were not balanced, indicating that the reservoirs acted as both a source and a sink for DO and sediments depending upon the time of day and amount of algal activity. Similar analyses will be conducted for nutrients. The net change of each variable across the reservoirs will be related to geomorphological characteristics of the reservoirs. With nutrient loading from anthropogenic sources, and increased push for small dam removal, this study provides useful information regarding the consequences of dam removal to downstream aquatic ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Formation water is the naturally-occurring water which is contained within the geological formation itself. The quantity and quality of the formation water can both be problematic. Over time, the water volume should decrease as the gas volumes increase. Formation water has been found to contain high levels of Cl, As, Fe, Ba, Mn, PAHs and may even contain naturally occurring radioactive materials. Chlorides in some cases have been found to be in excess of four-five times the level of concentrations found in the ocean. Within the management of well operation, there is sulfate between the analytes of greatest importance due to the potential for hydrogen sulphide formation and consequent corrosion of pipelines. As the concentration of sulfate in these waters can be less than n times that of chloride, a quantitative determination, using the technique of ion chromatography, constitutes an analytical challenge.\nThis work aimed to develop and validate a method for the determination of sulphate ions in hyper-saline waters coming from the oil wells of the pre-salt, using 2D IC. In 2D IC the first column can be understood as a separating column, in which the species with retention times outside a preset range are discarded, while those belonging to this range are retained in a pre-concentrator column to further injecting a second column, the second dimension in which occurs the separation and quantification of the analytes of interest.\nAs the chloride ions have a retention time lower than that of sulfate, a method was developed a for determining sulfate in very low range (mg L-1) by 2D IC, applicable to hypersaline waters, wherein the first dimension is used to the elimination of the matrix, ie, chloride ions, and the second dimension utilized in determining sulfate. For sulphate in a concentration range from 1.00 mg L-1 was obtained an accuracy of 1.0%. The accuracy of the method was tested by the standard addition method different samples of formation water in the pre-salt region, having been a relative error less than 1.0% at a concentration of 5.0 mg L-1.This work allowed the expected achievement of sulfate results for hyper-saline samples such as those found in the pre-salt exploration. Studies are being developed in order to validate the determination of bromide in the pre-salt water, using the 2D liquid chromatography.",

            "abstract": "Multiple methods of fingerprinting tephra deposits enable distinction of separate magma batches beneath the island of Dominica. Previous studies have invoked a single large batholith but apatite REE chemistry is inconsistent with generation of multiple ignimbrites by fractional crystallization. The crystal-rich, andesite-dacite (58-66 wt% SiO2) ignimbrites comprise the largest explosive eruption in the Caribbean in the last 200 kyr, erupting a magma volume >58 km3 (Carey and Sigurdsson, 1980). Although the ignimbrites appear to emanate from several vents, their broad similarity in bulk chemistry, phase assemblage (pl + opx + cpx + hbl + ilm + mag + zrn + ap), and mineral composition, has led previous workers to suggest that Dominica is underlain by a single large batholith eruptions younging from north to south. However, bulk REE chemistry, solution ICP-MS chemistry of individual apatite grains, and ion microprobe U-Th dating of zircon rims from pumice clasts suggest a more complex plumbing system. More than 150 pumice clasts from northernmost (Morne aux Diables), northern (Wesley, Pointe Ronde, Grand Savanne), central (Layou, Roseau, Rosalie), and southern (Grand Bay, Grand Fonde) ignimbrites were analyzed for bulk chemistry. Geographically controlled differences exist in the concavity of the middle-heavy REE (Dy*). In central Dominica, apatites from the more evolved Layou Ignimbrite are depleted in middle REE compared to the nearby Roseau Ignimbrite, belying a genetic relationship via fractional crystallization. U-Th zircon rim ages in the northernmost and northern deposits were in secular equilibrium (>350 ka), whereas the central and southern ignimbrites yielded several populations of crystallization ages: Layou (99±12 ka), Roseau (139±12 ka; 65±17 ka), and Grand Bay (107±15 ka; 211±61 ka). Collectively, these observations are consistent with partial melting of magma batches prior to eruption rather than fractional crystallization of a single magma chamber.",

            "abstract": "Deep marine sediments harbor abundant microbial cells that, if active, are likely to exert a strong influence on element biogeochemical cycling. However, our understanding of the fraction of cells that are active in situ and the metabolic processes that sustain them remain underexplored. Here we describe recent results of our studies aimed at unraveling the links between geochemical heterogeneity, cellular viability and synthesis, and metabolism along a vertical depth profile in sediment from four deep sites (>5 km beneath ocean surface) cored by R/V KNORR Expedition KN-223 in the North Atlantic (2014). These sediment columns exhibit varying levels of organic carbon and different vertical extents of oxygen (O2) penetration, which we hypothesize is due to variation in the extent of heterotrophic metabolism. We prepared most probable number (MPN) assays with acetate or peptone as electron donor and carbon source, and five different terminal electron acceptors (O2, NO3, SO4, MnO2, and ferrihydrite) with sediments from 4 to 5 depths in each of the four cores MPNs were similar for acetate- and peptone-amended cultures, regardless of electron acceptor, and generally decreased with depth in the sediment column. MPNs amended with O2 as electron acceptor were greater than MPNs amended with NO3, SO4, MnO2, and ferrihydrite in samples from all depths. Moreover, MPNs were higher for assays amended with O2 from cores where the depth of O2 penetration was shallow when compared to cores where O2 is predicted to penetrate to basement rock. These results are consistent with aerobic heterotrophs limiting the penetration of O2 in deep marine sediments, and thereby provide a mechanism to explain the relationship between low O2 penetrations in sediment cores with elevated organic carbon contents. We will also present results of our ongoing isotopic labeling experiments aimed at determining rates of DNA and protein synthesis as proxies for cell replication and productivity, respectively. Collectively, this research improves our understanding of the microbial activities present in subseafloor sediment of the deep North Atlantic Ocean and provides new insight into the interplay among O2 and organic carbon and microbial activity, viability, and productivity in deep marine sediments.",

Studies in mineral ecology exploit mineralogical databases to document diversity-distribution relationships of minerals, which reveal that all carbon-bearing minerals, as well as subsets containing C with O, H, Ca, or Na, conform to Large Number of Rare Events (LNRE) distributions. LNRE models facilitate prediction of total mineral diversity, and thus point to minerals that exist on Earth but have not yet been discovered and described. Our model predicts that at least 548 C minerals exist on Earth today, indicating that at least 145 carbon-bearing mineral species have yet to be discovered. Furthermore, by analyzing subsets of the most common additional elements in carbon-bearing minerals (i.e., 378 C + O species; 282 C + H species; 133 C + Ca species; and 100 C + Na species), we predict that 129 of these missing carbon minerals contain oxygen, 118 contain hydrogen, 52 contain calcium, and more than 60 contain sodium. The majority of these as yet undescribed minerals are predicted to be hydrous carbonates, many of which may have been overlooked because they are colorless, poorly crystalized, and/or water-soluble.\nWe propose the identities of plausible as yet undescribed carbon minerals, as well as search strategies for their discovery. Some of these minerals will be natural examples of known synthetic compounds, including carbides such as calcium carbide (CaC2), crystalline hydrocarbons such as pyrene (C16H10), and numerous oxalates, anhydrous carbonates, and hydrous carbonates. Many other missing carbon minerals will be isomorphs of known carbon minerals, notably of the more than 100 different hydrous carbonate structures. An understanding of Earth’s “missing” minerals provides a more complete picture of geochemical processes that influence crustal evolution.",

Modeling the hydrologic regime of the Arkansas River is a challenge due to the large number of diversions and regulations that might impact the natural streamflow. Since the Arkansas River headwaters are snow-melt dominated, a snow cover dataset can provide additional information during the model calibration process. Remote sensing snow data have been successfully used in previous studies coupled with hydrologic modeling to improve calibration results. Using the daily snow data acquired from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite, and this study tests different calibration schemes to determine the most suitable calibration target(s) for the Colorado Springs. First, the VIC model is calibrated to streamflow and snow alone, and then a mutli-objective optimization is utilized to calibrate the model to streamflow and snow simultaneously. A well calibrated hydrologic model can be employed particularly for climate change assessments to inform decision makers about water availability and water supply under different climate conditions. This study will provide such information to Colorado Springs in which development in terms of water supply is expected to grow considerably; increases in demands are projected to be 28% higher than the present demands (approximately 102 billion gallons) by the year 2050.",

Data from multiple stations were used to model environmental lapse rates by fitting linear regressions of mean daily Tmax and Tmin on altitude; piecewise regressions were also used to model the discontinuity introduced by the trade wind inversion near 2150m. Resulting time series of both model coefficients and lapse rates indicate increasing air temperatures near sea level (Tmax: 0.09°C·decade-1 and Tmin: 0.23°C·decade-1 over the most recent 65 years). Evaluation of lapse rates during this period suggest Tmax lapse rates (~0.6°C·100m-1) are decreasing by 0.006°C·100m-1decade-1 due to rapid high elevation warming while Tmin lapse rates (~0.8°C·100m-1) are increasing by 0.002°C·100m-1decade-1 due to the stronger increase in Tmin at sea level versus at high elevation. Over the 110 year period, temperatures tend to vary coherently with the PDO index. Our analysis verifies warming trends and temperature variability identified earlier by analysis of selected index stations. This method also provides temperature time series we propose are more robust to station inhomogeneities.",

However, the processes controlling the formation, maintenance, and fill of these sediment pathways are complex. This study presents an investigation of these systems at the New Jersey continental margin using a grid of high-resolution, 48-channel seismic reflection data collected in 1995 on the R/V Oceanus cruise Oc270 as a part of the STRATAFORM initiative. The aim is to shed new light on the origin and role of submarine canyons in Pleistocene sedimentation beneath the outer shelf and upper continental slope.\nPreliminary investigation of the Pleistocene interval reveals prominent unconformities tied to and dated with published studies at 7 sites drilled by ODP Legs 150 and 174A. The profiles of the continental slope unveil a series of abandoned and now buried submarine canyons that have influenced the development of modern canyons. Mapping these systems has revealed a range of canyon geometries, including U, V-shaped and flat-bottomed cross sections, each suggesting different histories. At least three types of seismic facies constitute the canyon fills: parallel onlap, interpreted as infilling by alternating coarser turbidites and finer hemipelagic sediments, chaotic infill, signifying structureless, massive debris flow deposition, and lateral accretion infill by both turbidity and bottom currents. Canyon formation and development appear to be strongly influenced by variations in sediment supply, grain size, and currents on the continental slope. One goal of our research is to establish if the canyons were initiated by failures at the base of the slope followed by upslope erosion, or by erosion at the shelf slope transition, and then downslope extension by erosive events. No single model accounts for all canyons. The history of these canyons may elucidate the extent to which the shelf was exposed during sea-level fall, or sea-level change might prove to have been a subordinate factor in these systems.",

Texas state agencies were activated for the May-June floods and severe weather event that ensued for six weeks from May 8 until June 19 following Tropical Storm Bill. This poster depicts a case study where modeling flood potential informed decision making authorities for user-driven high resolution satellite acquisitions over the most critical areas and how experimental flood mapping techniques provided the capability for daily on-going monitoring of these events through the use of increased automation. Recent improvements in flood models resulting from higher frequency updates, better spatial resolution, and increased accuracy of now cast and forecast precipitation products coupled with advanced technology to improve situational awareness for decision makers. These advances enabled satellites to be tasked, data products to be developed and distributed, and feedback loops between the emergency authorities, satellite operators, and mapping researchers to deliver a daily stream of relevant products that informed deployment of emergency resources and improved management of the large-scale event across the local, state, and national levels. This collaboration was made possible through inter-agency cooperation on an international scale through the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites Flood Pilot activity that is supported in the USA by NASA, NOAA, and USGS and includes numerous civilian space agency assets from the European Space Agency along with national agencies from Italy, France, Germany, Japan, and others.

Nemeth et al., (2011) found that the CAPS ion observations could also be separated into the same plasma regions as defined by Rymer et al. Additionally the T-96 encounter found Titan in the solar wind adding a sixth classification. Understanding the effects of the variable upstream plasma conditions on Titan's plasma interaction and the evolution of Titan's ionosphere/atmosphere is one of the main objectives of the Cassini mission. To compliment the mission we perform hybrid simulations of Titan's plasma interaction to examine the effects of the incident plasma distribution function and the flow velocity.

We used Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopies to distinguish the reaction of a model protein with a redox active mineral surface (Birnessite, MnO2) from its response to a common phyllosilicate (Kaolinite). Our data demonstrate that birnessite fragments the model protein while kaolinite does not. The reaction of birnessite with protein produced soluble peptides that were released from the birnessite surface where they would be available to soil biota. Soluble Mn(II) production during fragmentation of the protein by birnessite was measured by EPR spectrscopy. NMR and EPR spectroscopies are shown to be valuable tools to observe these reactions and capture the extent of protein transformation together with the extent of mineral response. Our data reveal an abiotic pathway for the formation of organic nitrogen compounds for direct uptake by plants and microorganisms as well as lay the foundation to identify soil environments with a particular propensity to act in this way.

Sulfate-rich salts have been identified as important component of Mars sedimentary deposits, illustrating the importance of near-surface hydrological processes during the planet’s history. The presence of Noachian/early Hesperian sulfate-rich deposits have been identified by the MER’s Opportunity at Meridiani Planum and by MRO mission in sedimentary sequences within Gale crater, the Mars Science Laboratory landing site.\nWhite Sands National Monument, which we are using as a terrestrial analog in our study, holds active playas that may contain different sizes of water bodies during the year. Alkali Flat contains also preserved deposits of Pleistocene Lake Otero. The presence of a range of modern playas and equivalent Pleistocene deposits allows for an excellent comparison of these different extreme transitional habitats and potential of preservation of organics in an evaporitic playa setting.\nWe have performed shallow drilling (1m) of the Lake Lucero deposits and of Lake Otero evaporitic sequence. The XRD analysis revealed that samples are mainly composed of gypsum and minor mineral phases as brushite, halite and quartz. SEM/EDS revealed the presence of amorphous phases such as halite, glauberite, magnesium chlorite salt, and diatom shells and biofilm. Biofilm is found in near surface samples, which may be attributed to microbial adaptation to desert environment and considered as one of the characteristics of modern and not fossil microbial communities. The compositional difference of salt precipitates associated with potentially geologically old biofilm and the modern counterpart are still ongoing and our findings will be presented at the conference. Further, comparison of environmental physicochemical conditions and molecular biology will be used to determine the characteristics of modern microbial habitats/deposits and to attempt to distinguish them from the fossil ones. Bioturbation and re-precipitation is a potential issue for any fossil finding, and especially for evaporitic settings. White Sands playas represent an excellent model system to evaluate preservation potential of evaporitic playa deposits and their potential value in a context of a sample return mission.",

By harvesting the archives for images, both terrestrial and airborne, we are able to expand the record of glacier observation by several decades, thus supplying crucial knowledge on glacier behavior to important climatic transitions such as the end of the Little Ice Age and the early 20th Century warming.\nHere we show how a large collection of historical aerial images portray the glacial response to the Little Ice Age deglaciation in Greenland and document frontal change throughout the 20th Century. A detailed story of the LIA-deglaciation is told by supplementing with terrestrial photos that capture the onset of retreat and high resolution aerial images that portray geomorphological evidence of the Little Ice Age maximum extent.\nThis work is the result of several generations of Greenland researches and their efforts to portray and document the state of the glaciers, and highlights that while interpretations and conclusions may be challenged and changed through time, the raw observations remain extremely valuable. Finally, we also show how archival data besides photos may play an important role in future glacier research in Greenland.",

            "abstract": "Long-term persistence of uranium (U) in groundwater at legacy ore-processing sites in the upper Colorado River Basin (CRB) is a major concern for DOE, stakeholders, and local property owners. In the past year, we have investigated U distributions in contaminated floodplains at Grand Junction, Naturita, and Rifle (CO), Riverton (WY), and Shiprock (NM). We find that U is retained at all locations in fine-grained, organic-rich sulfidic sediments, referred to as naturally reduced zones (NRZs). The retention mechanisms (e.g., complexation, precipitation or adsorption) and the processes responsible for U accumulation in NRZs will directly determine the capacity of the sediments to prevent U mobilization. However, these processes remain poorly understood at local and regional scales yet they are critical to management and remediation of these sites.\nWe have used U LIII/II-edge XANES to systematically characterize U oxidation states, and EXAFS and bicarbonate extractions to characterize U local structure and reactivity in order to distinguish the forms of U. We are measuring U isotopic signatures (δ238/235U) to better understand uranium sources and processes of accumulation in NRZs. We have found that high U concentrations correspond to reduced and relatively insoluble U forms, mainly non-crystalline U(IV), and co-occur with ferrous iron and sulfides. This suggests that reduction processes, fueled by the high organic matter content and constrained to the diffusion-limited environment in the fine-grained NRZs, are important for the retention of U in these sediments. We also observe a strong correlation between the U concentrations in the NRZs and the extent of isotopic fractionation, with up to +1.8 ‰ difference between uranium-enriched and low concentration zones. In some locations the δ238/235U values are within the range of values typical of the mine tailings, whereas at other sites the more positive δ238/235U values suggest that redox cycling and/or partial reduction of uranium are occurring. These results suggest that organic-rich reduced sediments play important roles governing uranium mobility in contaminated floodplains regionally within the upper CRB and other locations where organic sediments occur",

Traditionally, the uncertainty of renewable generation has been represented through scenarios generated by autoregressive parametric models (ARMA, PAR(p), SARIMA, etc.), that have been widely used for simulating the uncertainty of inflows and electrical demand. These methods have 3 disadvantages: (i) it is assumed that the random variables can be modelled through a known probability distribution, usually Weibull, log-normal, or normal, which are not always adequate; (ii) the temporal and spatial coupling of the represented variables are generally constructed from the Pearson Correlation, strictly requiring the hypothesis of data normality, that in the case of wind and solar generation is not met; (iii) there is an exponential increase in the model complexity due to its dimensionality. This work proposes the use of a stochastic model built from the combination of a non-parametric approach of a probability density function (the kernel density estimation method) with a dynamic Bayesian network framework. The kernel density estimation method is used to obtain the probability density function of the random variables directly from historical records, eliminating the need of choosing prior distributions. The Bayesian network allows the representation of nonlinearities in the temporal coupling of the time series, since they allow reproducing a compact probability distribution of a variable, subject to preceding stages. The proposed model was used to the generate wind power scenarios in long-term operation studies of the Brazilian Electric System, in which inflows of major rivers were also represented. The results show a considerable quality gain when compared to scenarios generated by traditional approaches.",

In February and March of 2014, the NASA Global Hawk was deployed to Guam and flew six long duration science flights. The aircraft was outfitted with a suite of instruments to study the composition of the TTL. Measurements included: water vapor amount, cloud particle size and shape, various gaseous species (e.g. CO, CH4, CO2, O3), and radiation measurements. The radiation measurements were comprised of the Solar Spectral Flux Radiometer (SSFR) that made spectrally resolved measurements of upwelling and downwelling solar irradiance from 350 to 2200 nm and thermal broadband (4μm to 42 μm) upwelling and downwelling irradiance. Once airborne, the Global Hawk made numerous vertical profiles (14 – 18 km) through the TTL. In this work we present results of combined solar spectral irradiance and broadband thermal irradiance measurements. Solar spectral measurements are correlated, wavelength-by-wavelength, with broadband thermal measurements. The radiative impact in the TTL of water vapor and cirrus clouds are examined both in the solar and thermal wavelengths from both upwelling and downwelling irradiances. The spectral measurements are used in an attempt to attribute physical mechanisms to the thermal (spectrally integrated) measurements. Measurements of heating rates are also presented, highlighting the difficultly in obtaining reliable results from aircraft measurements.",

Developed through three partner organizations, the course aims to develop teachers' skills for integrating climate change content into their classrooms.\nThis presentation aims to share tangible best practices for linking researchers and teachers in the field, through four years of experience in program delivery and reported through a published external evaluation. This presentation will examine the key aspects of a successful connection between teachers, researchers, science, and classrooms: (1) Inclusion of teacher leaders, (2) dedicated program staff, (3) workshop community culture, and will expose barriers to this type of collaboration including (1) differences in learning style, (2) prior teaching experience, (3) existing/scaffolding understanding of climate change science, and (4) accessibility of enrollment and accommodations for the extended learning experience.\nPresentation Content Examples:\nParticipants overwhelmingly value the deep commitment this course has to linking their field experience to the classroom attributing to the role of a teacher-leader; an expert science teacher with first-hand field research experience in the polar regions. The goal of including a teacher-leader is to enhance translatability between fieldwork and the classroom.\nAdditionally, qualitative aspects of the report touches on the intangible successes of the workshop such as: (1) the creation of a non-judgmental learning atmosphere, (2) addressing accessibility to science learning tools in rural and under-served communities, (3) defining successful collaboration as making meaning together through exploratory questioning while in the field (4) discussed the social and cultural implications of climate change, and the difficulty of navigating these topics in educational and/or multicultural spaces.\nNext Steps?

Okal and Synolakis list observations from 2011 Japan tsunami, which reached to Papeete, Tahiti with a fourth wave being largest and 72 min later after the first wave; 1960 Chilean tsunami reached Hilo, Hawaii with a maximum wave arriving 1 hour later with a height of 5m, first wave being only 1.2m. Largest later waves is a problem not only for local authorities both in terms of warning to the public and rescue efforts but also mislead the public thinking that it is safe to return shoreline or evacuated site after arrival of the first wave. Okal and Synolakis considered Hammack’s (1972, Ph.D. Dissertation, Calif. Inst. Tech., 261 pp., Pasadena) linear dispersive analytical solution with a tsunami generation through an uplifting of a circular plug on the ocean floor. They performed parametric study for the radius of the plug and the depth of the ocean since these are the independent scaling lengths in the problem. They identified transition distance, as the second wave being larger, regarding the parameters of the problem. Here, we extend their analysis to an initial wave field with a finite crest length and, in addition, to a most common tsunami initial wave form of N-wave as presented by Tadepalli and Synolakis (1994, Proc. R. Soc. A: Math. Phys. Eng. Sci., 445, 99-112). We compare our results with non-dispersive linear shallow water wave results as presented by Kanoglu et al. (2013, Proc. R. Soc. A: Math. Phys. Eng. Sci., 469, 20130015), investigating focusing feature. We discuss the results both in terms of leading wave amplitude and tsunami focusing.\nAcknowledgment: The research leading to these results has received funding from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement no 603839 (Project ASTARTE - Assessment, Strategy and Risk Reduction for Tsunamis in Europe)",

It is the first ocean OSSE system to employ all rigorous validation and calibration methods developed for atmospheric OSSE systems. It is based on two different configurations of the Hybrid Coordinate Ocean Model (HYCOM). Model configurations used for the unconstrained Nature Run (NR) and data-assimilative Forecast Model (FM), including lower horizontal and vertical resolution for the FM, produce the substantially different physics and truncation errors required of a credible OSSE system. Evaluation of the NR demonstrates sufficient realism in terms of mean climatology and of statistical properties of eddy and current variability to represent the “true” ocean. System evaluation is performed by comparing OSSE’s to Observing System Experiments (OSEs) that are identical except for assimilating actual observations. Based on RMS error increases, the OSSE system tends to overestimate impacts by <10% on average and thus requires only small calibration. The system is then applied to evaluate ocean observing strategies during the 2014 hurricane season. Example results are presented that evaluate different strategies for conducting airborne ocean profile surveys prior to Hurricane Edouard. The impact of the actual pre-storm survey performed prior to Edouard is evaluated against alternate survey strategies. Results demonstrate the importance of surveying as large a region as possible with ocean profiles separated by < 100 km. Modest additional advantages are achieved by profiling both temperature and salinity with CTDs compared to temperature profiles alone from XBTs. The HYCOM-HWRF coupled hurricane prediction model can now be initialized with analyses produced by the OSSE system. The impact of airborne survey design on actual hurricane forecasts will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The thermal state and the degree of hydration of the incoming oceanic plate influences many of the processes occurring in subduction zone settings. A range of geophysical evidence suggests extensional faults can be generated due to the bending of the down-going plate prior to subduction. Such faults can penetrate into the upper part of the oceanic lithospheric mantle, therefore providing downward pathways for fluids. If the P-T conditions in the upper oceanic mantle are right, olivine will react with water to form serpentinite. As serpentinite can contain up to 13 wt.% water it could be an important carrier of water beneath the volcanic arc and ultimately into deeper parts of the mantle.\nThe influx of fluids due to bend faulting may account for deficits in observed heat flow in the trench outer rise. This has been identified as an important process in the Cocos plate being subducted beneath Nicaragua, which exhibits an average heat flow anomaly of -83 mW/m2. Here, we investigate the degree of hydration of the incoming mantle by bend faulting using a 1D model of water influx based on heat flow deficit. Assuming that all the water brought down into the upper mantle results in serpentinization, our modelling suggest 20 – 50 % of the upper 6 km of oceanic lithospheric mantle is serpentinised prior to subduction, in good agreement with evidence from seismology (~30%). The slab geotherm suggests that serpentinite present in the oceanic mantle starts dehydrating at subarc depths (~120 km). Our estimates suggest that the serpentinized oceanic mantle contributes a significant amount of water to Nicaraguan arc magmas. Therefore, the results indicate that the incoming mantle serpentinized by bend faulting is a key reservoir of subducted water.",

Delivery of permafrost-derived DOC to stream and river networks is controlled by combinations of the amount of carbon stored in permafrost soils; hydrologic connectivity; subsurface physical conditions, including the potential for rapid thaw; and the chemical composition and degradability of the DOC released from permafrost. We examine these conditions in the discontinuous permafrost region of Yukon Flats, Alaska. Results indicate variable coupling among the factors controlling carbon release from permafrost, with greatest aged DOC source and biodegradability in regions that have low potential for immediate thaw or development of well-connected hydrologic networks. Conversely, regions having high potential for impending thaw and enhanced hydrologic connectivity tend to have smaller aged DOC sources and/or are dominated by modern DOC sources. This emphasizes the importance of the water-surface to atmosphere emission of permafrost carbon, with a majority of thawed permafrost organic carbon mineralizing to carbon gases in isolated thaw depressions, wetlands, and upland lakes and limited downstream delivery to river networks.",

The dust source of the GOCART model in the current community WRF-chem model is in 0.25° resolution and static. In the present study we have developed a high-resolution dust source function in 1 km resolution with the surface vegetation information from the MODIS satellite. The distribution pattern and magnitude of the new dust source function are compared to the static source over South Western United States. In order to examine the impact of the new data, a case study was conducted with an extreme dust storm that occurred in Phoenix Arizona in July 2011. The NU-WRF model with the new high-resolution dynamic dust source is able to successfully capture the dust storm, which was not possible in the old static sources. However, there are still many challenges in reproducing the large spatial and temporal variations of surface concentrations for this event. Series of sensitivity runs were made to optimize the model performance, and we will discuss the challenges in simulating the extreme dust storm events.",

            "abstract": "Autotrophic Acidimicrobiaceae-bacterium named A6 (A6), part of the Actinobacteria phylum have been linked to anaerobic ammonium (NH4+) oxidation under iron reducing conditions. These organisms obtain their energy by oxidizing NH4+ and transferring the electrons to a terminal electron acceptor (TEA). Under environmental conditions, the TEAs are iron oxides [Fe(III)], which are reduced to Fe(II), this process is known as Feammox. Our studies indicate that alternative forms of TEAs can be used by A6, e.g. iron rich clays (i.e. nontronite) and electrodes in bioelectrochemical systems such as Microbial Electrolysis Cells (MECs), which can sustain NH4+removal and A6 biomass production.\nOur results show that nontronite can support Feammox and promote bacterial cell production. A6 biomass increased from 4.7 x 104 to 3.9 x 105 cells/ml in 10 days. Incubations of A6 in nontronite resulted in up to 10 times more NH4+ removal and 3 times more biomass production than when ferrihydrite is used as the Fe(III) source. Additionally, Fe in nontronite can be reoxidized by aeration and A6 can reutilize it; however, Fe is still finite in the clay. In contrast, in MECs, A6 harvest electrons from NH4+ and use an anode as an unlimited TEA, as a result current is produced. We operated multiple MECs in parallel using a single external power source, as described by Call & Logan (2011). MECs were run with an applied voltage of 0.7V and different growing mediums always containing initial 5mM NH4+. Results show that current production is favored when anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS), an electron shuttled, is present in the medium as it facilitates the transfer of electrons from the bacterial cell to the anode. Additionally, A6 biomass increased from 1 x 104 to 9.77 x 105cells/ml in 14 days of operation.\nDue to Acidimicrobiaceae-bacterium A6’s ability to use various TEAs, MECs represent an alternative, iron-free form, for optimized biomass production of A6 and its application in NH4+ oxidation, an essential process in water quality control. Future work seeks to scale up MECs in order to achieve rates of microbial NH4+ oxidation comparable to existing technologies.",

            "abstract": "Representing trans-Atlantic dust transport is one of the challenges in climate modeling and of key importance, because of its large impact on the Earth's radiation budget. Desert dust, emitted from the Sahara, is regularly transported westwards across the Atlantic Ocean towards the Caribbean. The balance between emissions and removal processes, as well as the manifold chemical reactions control the impact of dust on the atmospheric composition and the interaction of dust with climate change. During trans-Atlantic transport, dust undergoes chemical aging, which involves various heterogeneous reactions that strongly depend on the mineral composition of dust (alkalinity), the surface chemistry and the associated aerosol water uptake.\nIn this study, different parameters affecting the long-range dust transport are studied with the atmospheric chemistry-climate model EMAC. We consider chemical speciation of primary sea salt and dust particles and account for major cations (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2) and anions (Cl-, SO42-, HSO4-), calculated online with meteorology, i.e., feeding back onto precipitation and changing surface wind speed and roughness. We resolve the chemical aging of primary particles through explicit neutralization reactions of the cations and anions with major oxidation products (H2SO4, HNO3, HCl, NH3) from natural and anthropogenic air pollution sources, which can condense on the particles surface during long-range transport and undergo gas-liquid-solid aerosol partitioning, depending on the concentration level of emissions and the transport processes of the primary and secondary aerosols and their precursor gases. Comprehensive analysis of the different parameters affecting the long-range transport, which include the emission flux and particle size distributions, aging mechanism, convection scheme, wet and dry scavenging, show a strong dependence of the dust concentration and optical properties over the Caribbean mainly on the chemical aging of dust during long-range transport. The comparison of the EMAC results with ground-based observations (AERONET, CASTNET, EMEP), as well as various satellite data (MODIS, MISR and CALIPSO) shows that uncertainties associated with the calculation of the dust transport into the Caribbean reduces by considering the dust aging processes.",

Extracting knowledge from these heterogeneous and complex datasets is particularly complicated and requires both interdisciplinary and domain expertise to accomplish true curation, with an overall goal of facilitating reproducible science through discoverability and persistence. A group of researchers and professional staff at the University of Arizona held several meetings during the spring of 2015 about astronomy data and the role of the university in curation of that data. The group decided that it was critical to obtain a broader consensus on the needs of the community. With assistance from a Start for Success grant provided by the University of Arizona Office of Research and Discovery and funding from the American Astronomical Society (AAS), a workshop was held in early July 2015, with 28 participants plus 4 organizers in attendance. Representing University researchers as well as astronomical facilities and a scholarly society, the group verified that indeed there is a problem with the long-term curation of some astronomical data not associated with major facilities, and that a repository or “data hub” with the correct functionality could facilitate research and the preservation and use of astronomy data. The workshop members also identified a set of next steps, including the identification of possible data and metadata to be included in the Hub. The participants further helped to identify additional information that must be gathered before construction of the AADH could begin, including identifying significant datasets that do not currently have sufficient preservation and dissemination infrastructure, as well as some data associated with journal publications and the broader context of the data beyond that directly published in the journals. Workshop participants recommended that a set of grant proposal should be developed that ensures community buy-in and participation. The project should be developed in an agile, incremental manner that will allow consistent community growth from the early stages of the project, building on existing iPlant infrastructure (www.iplantcollaborative.org) initially developed for the biology community.",

While this polarimetric capability promises the potential for the enhanced accuracy in quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE), recent studies show that the polarimetric estimates are still affected by uncertainties arising from the radar beam geometry/sampling space associated with the vertical variability of precipitation. The authors, first of all, focus on evaluating the NEXRAD hydrometeor classification product using ground reference data (e.g., ASOS) that provide simple categories of the observed precipitation types (e.g., rain, snow, and freezing rain). They also investigate classification uncertainty features caused by the variability of precipitation between the ground and the altitudes where radar samples. Since this variability is closely related to the atmospheric conditions (e.g., temperature) at near surface, useful information (e.g., critical thickness and temperature profile) that is not available in radar observations is retrieved from the numerical weather prediction (NWP) model data such as Rapid Refresh (RAP)/High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR). The NWP retrieved information and polarimetric radar data are used together to improve the accuracy of precipitation type identification at near surface. The authors highlight major improvements and discuss limitations in the real-time application.",

Whitebark pine is a major component of subalpine forests in western North America. It is often the dominant tree species at treeline, where it readily forms krummholz, a stunted, shrub-like growth form. Whitebark pine appears to be relatively naïve to beetle attack; it has poor physical defense compared to that of lodgepole pine. However, anecdotal accounts suggest that whitebark krummholz may be resistant to beetle attack. I investigate the potential for treeline habitats to serve as a refuge from mountain pine beetle attack. I sampled recent beetle-caused whitebark pine mortality across treeline ecotones at 10 sites. I compared treeline mortality gradients with other forest edges to determine if mortality patterns are unique to treeline edges. Preliminary results from this study indicate that treeline habitats evaded mountain pine beetle attack during recent outbreaks. If treeline individuals are long-lived or can reproduce, treeline habitats may be viable refugia for whitebark pine populations.",

            "abstract": "The Nevada Seismological Laboratory (NSL) at UNR has recently embarked on a bold technical initiative, installing a high-speed (up to 190 Mb/sec) mountaintop-based Internet Protocol (IP) microwave network, enabling a myriad of sensor systems for Multi-Hazard Early Warning detection and response. In the Tahoe Basin, this system is known as AlertTahoe; a similar network has been deployed in north-central Nevada as part of a 5-year-long grant with BLM. The UNR network mirrors the successful HPWREN multi-hazard network run through UCSD; the UNR “Alert” program (Access to Leverage Emergency information in Real Time) has expanded on the original concept by providing a framework for early fire detection and discovery. Both systems do not rely on open-access public Internet services such as those provided by cellular service providers. Instead, they utilize private wireless communication networks to collect data 24/7 in real-time from multiple sensors throughout the system. Utilizing this restricted-access private communication platform enhances system reliability, capability, capacity and versatility for staff and its community of certified users. Both UNR and UCSD fire camera systems are presently being confederated under a common framework to provide end users (e.g., BLM, USFS, CalFire) a unified interface.\nEarthquake response has been both organizations’ primary mission for decades; high-speed IP microwave fundamentally changes the playing field allowing for rapid early detection of wildfires, earthquakes and other natural disasters, greatly improving local and regional disaster response/recovery. For example, networked cameras can be optimally placed for wildfire detection and are significantly less vulnerable due infrastructure hardening and the ability to avoid extreme demands by the public on cellular and other public networks during a crisis. These systems also provide a backup for emergency responders to use when public access communications become overwhelmed or fail during an event. The crowd-sourced fire cameras can be viewed year round through AlertTahoe and AlertSoCal websites with on-demand time-lapse, an integrated real time lightning map, and other useful features.",

Whereas there is ubiquitous evidence for CIEs across sites, differences in magnitude and duration of these shifts among records highlight an incomplete characterization of initial carbon injections and of ecosystem feedbacks in response to such perturbations. Numerical modeling of global carbon cycling has thus been utilized to reconcile differences between isotope records, and to also check for agreement with other constraints like carbon release scenarios and oceanic acid-base chemistry. Here, we present a carbon cycle box model that addresses oversimplification in previous quantification of terrestrial carbon cycling by introducing a soil organic and inorganic soil carbon reservoirs. The new model calculates the carbon isotope compositions of both soil organic carbon and pedogenic carbonate and considers the seasonality of calcium carbonate formation, productivity/respiration rates. Coupling this more resolved terrestrial carbon model to a global carbon flux model with established oceanic-atmospheric interaction (LOSCAR) provides a compatibility check given recent paleosol CIE records in the Bighorn Basin (Wyoming, USA). Moreover, the more highly resolved model is used in an effort to address previously irreconcilable differences between organic carbon, surface oceanic, and pedogenic CIE records. Changes in ocean and atmospheric chemistry from such rapid carbon perturbations provided in the model output ultimately serves as an important analog for modern climate change.",

            "abstract": "We present results from a gas tracer injection experiment in the ocean crust on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge, in an area of hydrothermal circulation. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer was injected in Hole 1362B in 2010, during IODP Expedition 327. Fluid samples were subsequently collected from a borehole observatory (CORK) installed in this hole and similar CORKs in three additional holes (1026B, 1362A, and 1301A), located 300 to 500 m away. This array of holes is located on 3.5 My old seafloor, as an array oriented subparallel to the Endeavor Segment of Juan de Fuca Ridge.\nBorehole fluid samples were collected in copper coils using osmotic pumps. In addition to pumps at seafloor wellheads, downhole sampling pumps were installed in the perforated casing in the upper ocean crust. These downhole samplers were intended to produce a high-resolution continuous record of tracer concentrations, including records from the first year after tracer injection in Holes 1362A and 1362B. In contrast, wellhead samplers were not installed on these CORKs holes until 2011, and wellhead records from all CORKs have a record gap of up to one year, because of a delayed expedition in 2012.\nThe downhole samples were recovered with the submersible Alvin in August 2014. SF6 concentrations in downhole samples recovered in 2014 are generally consistent with data obtained from wellhead samples. Of particular interest are the results from Hole 1362B, where a seafloor valve was opened and closed during various recovery expeditions. High resolution tracer curves produced from the 1362B downhole samples confirm that these operations produced an SF6 breakthrough curve corresponding to a classic push-pull test used to evaluate contaminant field locations in terrestrial setting. Complete analyses of downhole samples from these CORKs are expected to produce high-resolution breakthrough curves that will allow more precise analysis and modeling of hydrothermal flow in the study area.",

Lijiang river basin is selected as our study region. Interdisciplinary field and laboratory experiments with various technologies are conducted to characterize the karst aquifers in detail. Key processes in the karst water cycle and carbon cycle are determined. Based on the MODFLOW-CFP model, new watershed flow and carbon cycle models are developed coupled subsurface and surface water flow models, flow and chemical/biological models. Our study is focused on the karst springshed in Mao village. The mechanisms coupling carbon cycle and water cycle are explored. Parallel computing technology is used to construct the numerical model for the carbon cycle and water cycle in the small scale watershed, which are calibrated and verified by field observations. The developed coupling model for the small scale watershed is extended to a large scale watershed considering the scale effect of model parameters and proper model structure simplification. The large scale watershed model is used to study water cycle and carbon cycle in Lijiang rivershed, and to calculate the carbon flux and carbon sinks in the Lijiang river basin. The study results provide scientific methods for water resources management and environmental protection in southwest karst region corresponding to global climate change. This study could provide basic theory and simulation method for geological carbon sequestration in China karst region.",

Paleofire records based on charcoal in sediments allow us to situate modern fires in their long-term context. Paleofire records also provide insights into the causes and impacts of past wildfires when analyzed in conjunction with other paleoenvironmental data and fire models. Time series and globally gridded reconstructions of biomass burning over the past 21,000, 2000, and 200 years are presented from a new version of the Global Charcoal Database. Analyses of the new data show that global biomass burning generally increased with increasing global temperatures over the past 21,000 years. Anthropogenic activities caused a sharp increase in fire, peaking in the 19th and early 20th centuries, followed by a rapid decline in the mid- to late 20th century. Charcoal data from the past two decades show a sharp increase in biomass burning, particularly in North America.",

            "abstract": "In low cloud regimes, precipitation is coupled to cloud radiative effects through its relationship with cloud fraction and cloud liquid water content. For example, precipitation is thought to play an important role in the development of open cells, which significantly reduces cloud fraction, and thus the shortwave (SW) cloud radiative effect (CRE). Here we explore a set of parameters that characterize the degree to which a precipitating cloud cools the surface or heats the atmosphere, respectively, over multiple spatial scales. The surface radiative cooling efficiency, rc, represents the ratio of the SW CRE to LH release from precipitation. The atmospheric heating efficiency, rh, describes the cloud’s ability to heat the atmosphere per unit LH. At the native resolution of satellite datasets, the LH term is larger, leading to smaller radiative efficiencies, but as scales approach the sizes of global climate models (GCM) resolutions, cloud fraction effects can dominate. Estimates of precipitation and radiative fluxes from CloudSat/CALIPSO observations are used to examine the scale dependence of light precipitation impacts on cloud fraction, rc, and rh in low clouds. Results show that cloud fractions in areas of predominantly stratocumulus are less sensitive to the presence of precipitation, while cloud fraction in areas dominated by shallow cumulus actually increases when precipitation is present. The area of transition from stratocumulus to shallow cumulus is especially sensitive to the presence of precipitation, with large reductions in surrounding cloud fraction when precipitation is present. The impact of these changes on the radiative efficiencies, especially rc, will be quantified from pixel-level to GCM grid scales, and the sensitivity of the link between precipitation and radiative effects to cloud characteristics will be explored. Understanding this scale dependence should provide insights into the time and space variability of precipitation impacts on CREs and could potentially be used to assess global models’ ability to capture sub-grid variability associated with cloud and precipitation processes in low cloud regimes.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing consists of injecting fluid at high pressure and high flowrate to the wellbore for the purpose of enhancing production by generating a complex fracture network. Both tensile failure and shear failure occur during the hydraulic fracturing treatment. The shear event can be caused by slip on existing weak planes such as faults or natural fractures. From core observation, partially cemented and fully cemented opening mode natural fractures, often with considerable thickness are widely present. Hydraulic fractures can propagate either within the natural fracture (tensile failure) or along the interface between the natural fracture and the rock matrix (tensile/shear failure), depending on the relative strength of cement and rock matrix materials, the bonding strength of interface, as well as the presence of any heterogeneities.\nIn this study, we evaluate the fracture propagation both experimentally and numerically. We embed one or multiple inclusions of different mechanical properties within synthetic hydrostone samples in order to mimic cemented natural fractures and rock. A semi-circular bending test is performed for each set of properties. A finite element model built with ABAQUS is used to mimic the semi-circular bending test and study the fracture propagation path, as well as the matrix-inclusion bonding interface status. Mechanical properties required for the numerical model are measured experimentally. The results indicate that the match between experiment and modeling fracture path are extremely sensitive to the chosen interface (bonding) model and related parameters.\nThe semi-circular bending test is dry and easily conducted, providing a good platform for validating numerical approaches. A validated numerical model will enable us to add pressurized fluid within the crack and simulate hydraulic fracture-natural fracture interaction in the reservoir conditions, ultimately providing insights into the extent of the fracture network.",

            "abstract": "Many studies have shown that tropical precipitation is projected to increase in a warming world. Predicting the response of tropical extreme precipitation to global warming, however, remains a challenge. The response of tropical extreme precipitation involves a complex interplay of changes in tropical circulations (dynamic) and changes in atmospheric moisture content due to changes in sea surface temperature (thermodynamic). While a process-based understanding requires high resolution cloud-resolving simulations, GCMs, reanalyses and observations may be used to estimate the contributions of the dynamic and thermodynamic components to extreme precipitation changes.\nIn this study we derive metrics for extreme precipitation from daily rainfall data from GCMs, reanalyses and observations using indices defined by ETCCDI. To understand how extreme precipitation in the tropics depends on temperature and dynamical regimes, we construct PDFs of these precipitation indices conditioned on SST and vertical velocity (omega at 500 hPa) for present day and climate change scenarios. We find that, besides an overall increase in extreme precipitation in the tropics, the contrast in extreme precipitation between high and low SST regions is amplified in a warmed world.\nFurther, we use an approach introduced by Bony et al. (Clim. Dyn., 2004) and modified by Emori and Brown (GRL, 2005) to decompose the changes in these precipitation indices due to SST changes into thermodynamic, dynamic and covariation terms. We find that extreme precipitation changes due to SST changes arise due to a combination of thermodynamic and dynamical factors, but their relative contributions depend strongly on SST. Work is ongoing to understand the significance of the SSTs at which such changes occur.",

Today, the mine has been abandoned with one of the largest tailings pits in Morocco without supervision and concern of environmental impacts. Several studies have shown the existence of high levels of heavy metals (Pb, Zn, Cu, Cr, Co, Cd and Ni) in samples (water and soil) taken from and around the tailings (Laghlimi et al, 2014, Benyassine et al, 2013, Iavarzzo, 2012, Makhoukh et al, 2011, Baghdad et al, 2008, Bouabdli et al, 2005). In this study, several electrical and seismic tomography profiles were taken to explore the thickness of the tailings and the potential pathways of contaminants to the aquifer. Because heavy metals were found in the surrounding areas of the tailings, there are concerns about their seepage into the groundwater aquifer. A total of 6 electric resistivity profiles together with another 16 seismic refraction profiles were completed over the 3 major mining waste piles to study this contamination. Analysis of both electric and seismic tomography profiles showed: 1) the thickness of tailings range from few cm to above 20m depending on where the survey was performed, 2) the contamination pathways of heavy metal pollutants occur predominantly right above the thickest areas of sandstone formation, and 3) water ponds at the surface of the tailing piles forms directly above the thickest part of the sandstone layer",

We produced the velocity models from Love and horizontal component Rayleigh wave group and phase velocity measurements on the IDaho/ORegon (IDOR) Passive seismic network, 86 broadband seismic stations, dataset using ambient noise tomography and the methods of Gallego et. al (2010) and Lin et. al (2008). We calculated inter-station group/phase velocities in narrow frequency bands from travel-time measurements of the rotated stacked horizontal component cross-correlations (bandpass filtered between 2 and 30 seconds), which we used to invert for velocity structure beneath the network. We derived group and phase velocity maps for each frequency band using the damped least-squares inversion method of Tarantola (2005), and then jointly inverted for velocity with depth. Moho depths are prescribed in the joint inversions based on receiver functions, also from the IDOR seismic data, and provides a starting crustal velocity model. Goals of our work include refining models of crustal structure in the accreted Blue Mountain terranes in the western study area; determining the depth extent of the Salmon River Suture/West Idaho Shear Zone (WISZ), which crosses north-south through the middle of the network; determining the architecture of the Idaho batholith, an extensive largely crustal-derived pluton; and examining the nature of the autochthonous (?)

            "abstract": "Launched in March 2015, the Fast Plasma Investigation (FPI) instrument suite on the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS) is producing the highest time and spatial resolution 3D electron and ion particle distribution function measurements to date. During FPI science operations, the four spacecraft maintain a tetrahedral formation such that 3D measurements of the plasma and field gradients are enabled. This allows the spacecraft to better investigate reconnection and to distinguish between spatial and temporal structures. In the first three months, we expect to observe magnetic phenomena such as dipolarization fronts, the plasma sheet boundary layer, magnetopause crossings, ion dispersive signatures of from remote reconnection sites, and magnetic holes. This poster is intended to supplement the invited talk on FPI results by Pollock et al. by providing further detail of the instrumentation and calibration, as well as a sampling of early magnetospheric plasma observations in the evening-side magnetotail, dusk flank, and afternoon magnetopause.",

To illustrate the advantages of a common inversion approach we have compared the modeling results using two different travel-time inversion strategies:\nFirst, we have produced seismic velocity and inter-plate boundary geometry using the WAS data, recorded on 19 OBH (Ocean Bottom Hydrophones) and 6 land stations following a typical joint refraction and reflection travel-time tomography strategy. In particular, the WAS model is obtained using tomo2d tomographic inversion code (Korenaga et al, 2000) and applying layer-stripping method.\nSecond, to compare structure, physical properties and rupture characteristics we jointly invert two types of seismic data sets, integrating multichannel seismic (MCS) data collected with a 3 km long streamer with the OBS wide-angle seismic (WAS) data described above into a common inversion scheme. To do so, we have adapted tomo2d to deal with streamer data. The scheme results in a joint travel time tomographic inversion based on integrated travel time information from refracted and reflected from WAS data and reflected phases from the top of the basement and the inter-plate boundaries identified in the MCS shot gathers. Our first results of the joint inversion indicate a 5 – 10 times smaller ray travel-time misfit in the deeper parts of the model around the interplate boundary, compared to models obtained inverting with just wide-angle seismic data.\nInterpretation of the joint WAS-MCS velocity model, and MCS images provide improved models of physical properties of the upper plate and around inter-plate boundary. In turn this will help to better understand characteristics of the earthquake rupture propagation in the seismogenic zone based on the variations of the inter-plate geometry and upper plate physical properties.",

            "abstract": "Hydrothermal microbial communities contain some of the most deeply branching members of the tree of life, and hydrothermal environments have been present on the Earth’s surface since the condensation of the ocean over four billion years ago. Hydrothermal microbial communities are a potential source for biosignatures across nearly all of Earth’s history, and the most likely mode of life (past and/or present) if it had developed on other bodies in the solar system. While there are general patterns of element enrichment for hydrothermal water, the elemental composition of bulk hydrothermal microbial communities (here termed biocumulus, encompassing biomass and non-biomass material) are largely unexplored. In order to elucidate the elemental composition of hot spring biocumulus and explore the sources of those elements, we sampled 87 hot spring biocumulus in 19 hot springs along with dozens of associated soil, rock, sinter, and autochthonous biomass samples and analyzed them for 41 elements, in conjunction with a larger sampling campaign (> 1000 hot spring water samples from 11 hydrothermal areas within Yellowstone National Park). While biocumulus are of obvious biological origin, they have surprising elemental compositions. Organic carbon makes up a minor percentage of the total mass of thermophilic chemotrophic and phototrophic biocumulus. We have found that the majority of hot spring biocumulus is inorganic material, largely silica, with measurable quantities of dozens of other elements, and that the distribution of major elements mimics that of surrounding rock and soil far more closely than the hot spring fluids. Analyses indicate a consistent pattern of elemental composition for biocumulus across varying hydrothermal geochemical compositions, and a systematic loss of biologically-associated elements during diagenetic transformation of biocumulus to siliceous sinter.",

            "abstract": "Hydrothermal plume data and other observations were used to parameterize the Piccard (PHF) and Von Damm (VDHF) hydrothermal fields on the Mid-Cayman Spreading Center. The PHF is hosted in basalt at a seafloor depth of nearly 5000 m where a number of active sites vent with temperatures as high as 400°C from an area of approximately 105 m2. A neutrally buoyant hydrothermal plume occurs at a height of approximately 500 m above the PHF. Buoyant plume theory yields a buoyancy flux of ~4 x10-2 m4/s3 and a heat flux of ~160 MW. Using a single-pass model, this heat output and maximum vent temperature yields a mass flow rate of ~80 kg/s and a crustal permeability of ~2 x 10-14 m2. A neutrally buoyant plume noted in 2010 at a height of approximately 1000 m above the seafloor corresponds to a buoyancy flux of ~ 0.64, yielding a heat output ~ 2.6 GW and a mass flow rate of ~1280 kg/s, which is much larger than any known system to date. We suspect that the plume observed at 1000 m was an event plume rather than a chronic plume. The PHF is likely driven by a subsurface magma source that exhibited a magmatic event in 2010.\nThe VDHF, hosted in ultramafic rocks near the top of an OCC approximately 13 km west of the neovolcanic zone, lies at a depth of approximately 2300 m. Venting occurs from a conical mound approximately 100 m in diameter. A plume signal at a height of ~300 m above the VDHF yields a buoyancy flux of ~ 5 x 10-3 m4/s3 and a heat output of ~20 MW. Assuming a vent temperature of 150°C based on the presence of anhydrite near the vents, the single-pass model yields a mass flow rate of ~ 30 kg/s and a permeability of 10-11 m2. The low estimated heat output for the VDHF suggests that is likely driven by circulation through a deep-seated fault or fracture system rather than by subsurface magma. The vent temperature, heat output, and permeability estimates, provide useful parameters for constructing mathematical and numerical models of the PHF and the VDHF.",

            "abstract": "Climate in the Northwestern United States depends sensitively on processes at multiple scales. These include global patterns of variability like the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the planetary-synoptic scale that controls the strength and position of the jet, the mesoscale dynamics of fronts and influence of topography, and the scale of individual catchments where fine-scale topography controls snow accumulation. The last requires integration with high-resolution hydrologic models, but much of the rest of the global to regional-scale sources of uncertainty can be assessed in a global climate context. The Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS, Skamarock et al., 2012) is particularly suited to this challenge, because higher resolution at the region of interest is possible in a variable resolution modeling framework. This framework also enables seamless analysis of regional climate, global-scale climate variability, and the connection between the two.\nWe present the initial results of global simulations with the finer, 30km resolution, part of the mesh centered over the Northwest. We use non-hydrostatic dynamics and physics parameterizations from the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5) with prescribed observed sea surface temperature (SST) for the historical control simulations. A 21st century experiment uses SST changes based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) model mean projections for the RCP8.5 scenario, with associated greenhouse gas forcing. From an ensemble of simulations started with different initial conditions, we analyze climatic features important for the Northwest and evaluate their projected changes and uncertainty due to internal variability.",

The multi-resolutional elevation components of GMRT are delivered to the user through a variety of interfaces as both images and grids. The GMRT provides quantitative access to gridded data and images to the full native resolution of the sonar as well as attribution information and access to source data files. To construct the GMRT, multibeam sonar data are evaluated, cleaned and gridded by the MGDS Team and are then merged with gridded global and regional elevation data that are available at a variety of scales from 1km resolution to sub-meter resolution. As of June 2015, GMRT included processed swath data from nearly 850 research cruises with over 2.7 million ship-track miles of coverage.\nSeveral new services were developed over the past year to improve access to the GMRT Synthesis. In addition to our long-standing Web Map Services, we now offer RESTful services to provide programmatic access to gridded data in standard formats including ArcASCII, GeoTIFF, COARDS/CF-compliant NetCDF, and GMT NetCDF, as well as access to custom images of the GMRT in JPEG format. An attribution metadata XML service was also developed to return all relevant information about component data in an area, including cruise names, multibeam file names, and gridded data components. These new services are compliant with the EarthCube GeoWS Building Blocks specifications. Supplemental services include the release of data processing reports for each cruise included in the GMRT and data querying services that return elevation values at a point and great circle arc profiles using the highest available resolution data. Our new and improved map-based web application, GMRT MapTool, provides user access to the GMRT synthesis and makes direct use of GMRT's web services. This interface integrates the suite of GMRT web services, enabling users to efficiently create custom grids and images, query the GMRT for an elevation point or profile, access full attribution metadata, view data processing reports, and download source data files.",

Combining with field geological surveys, we believe these uplifts are mega yardangs. We have measured their length (l), width (w), and calculated the aspect ratio (R). The variation ranges of l, w and R are 14.18-67km, 5.5-16.5km and 2.32:1-6.09:1, with mean values are 31.3km, 8.86km and 3.56:1. In terms of R, 42.9% yardangs are 2:1 - 3:1, 23.8% yardangs are 3:1 - 4:1, 23.8% yardangs are 4:1 - 5:1, and the last are greater than 5:1. Their mean value is 3.59:1.

Over the mega yardangs, there develops lots of small yardangs with various shapes. Their trends are similar with mega yardangs.\nWe have collected some details data of morphology and samples, in order to find their relationship, and discuss the origin of yardangs and palaeoenvironment.

            "abstract": "As installed wind energy capacity continues to steadily increase, the need for comprehensive measurements of wind plant complex flows to further reduce the cost of wind energy has been well advertised by the industry as a whole. Such measurements serve diverse perspectives including resource assessment, turbine inflow and power curve validation, wake and wind plant layout model verification, operations and maintenance, and the development of future advanced wind plant control schemes. While various measurement devices have been matured for wind energy applications (e.g. meteorological towers, LIDAR, SODAR), this presentation will focus on the use of advanced Doppler radar systems to observe the complex wind flows within and surrounding wind plants. Advanced Doppler radars can provide the combined advantage of a large analysis footprint (tens of square kilometers) with rapid data analysis updates (a few seconds to one minute) using both single- and dual-Doppler data collection methods. This presentation demonstrates the utility of measurements collected by the Texas Tech University Ka-band (TTUKa) radars to identify complex wind flows occurring within and nearby operational wind plants, and provide reliable forecasts of wind speeds and directions at given locations (i.e. turbine or instrumented tower sites) 45+ seconds in advance. Radar-derived wind maps reveal commonly observed features such as turbine wakes and turbine-to-turbine interaction, high momentum wind speed channels between turbine wakes, turbine array edge effects, transient boundary layer flow structures (such as wind streaks, frontal boundaries, etc.), and the impact of local terrain. Operational turbine or instrumented tower data are merged with the radar analysis to link the observed complex flow features to turbine and wind plant performance.",

            "abstract": "Weak turbulence plays a significant role in space plasma dynamics. Induced nonlinear scattering dominates the evolution in the low-beta isothermal radiation belt plasmas and affects the propagation characteristics of waves. As whistler waves propagate away from the earth they are scattered in the magnetosphere such that their trajectories are turned earthward where they are reflected back towards the magnetosphere. Repeated scattering and reflection of the whistlers establishes a cavity in which the wave energy can be maintained for a long duration with, on average, a smaller wave-normal angle. Consequently, the cyclotron resonance time for the trapped energetic electrons increases, leading to an enhanced pitch-angle scattering rate. Enhanced pitch-angle scattering lowers the lifetime of the energetic electron population. Also, pitch-angle scattering of the trapped population in the cavity with a loss cone distribution amplifies the whistler waves, which in turn promotes a more rapid precipitation through a positive feedback mechanism. Typical storm-pumped radiation belt parameters and laboratory experiments will be used to elucidate this phenomenon.",

Here we present preliminary results of crustal structure beneath WVSZ based on teleseismic receiver functions and ambient noise tomography. We combined waveform data of the temporary stations in 2014 with those of permanent seismic stations and the transportable array stations in our study area since 2011. We found 656 teleseismic events with clear P-wave signals and obtained 2657 good-quality receiver functions of 84 stations using a time-domain iterative deconvolution method. We estimated crustal thickness and Vp/Vs ratio beneath each station using the H-κ stacking method. A high-resolution crustal structural image along the linear profile was obtained using the Common-Conversion-Point (CCP) stacking method. We also measured Rayleigh-wave phase and group velocities from 5 to 50 s by cross-correlating ambient noises between stations and did joint-inversion of receiver functions and surface wave dispersions for S-velocity structures beneath selected stations. The results show that the average crustal thickness in the region is 47 km with a gentle increase of crustal thickness from southeast to northwest. A mid-crustal interface is identified in the CCP image that also deepens from 15 km in the southeastern end to >20 km in the northwest. The CCP image shows that the low-velocity sedimentary layer along the profile is broad and is thickest (~10 km) near the center of the Wabash Valley. Beneath the center of the Valley there is a 40-km-wide positive velocity discontinuity at a depth of 40 km in the lower crust that might be the top of a rift pillow in this failed continental rift. Further results using 3D joint inversion and CCP migration will be presented at the meeting.",

            "abstract": "In the solar atmosphere, the jets are ubiquitous and found to be at various spatia-temporal scales. They are signiﬁcant to understand energy and mass transport in the solar atmosphere. Recently, the high-speed transition region jets are reported from the observation. Here we conduct a numerical simulation to investigate the mechanism in their formation, as well as their mass and energy contributions to the solar wind.\nDriven by the supergranular convection motion, the magnetic reconnection between the magnetic loop and the background open ﬂux occurring in the transition region is simulated with a two-dimensional MHD model. The simulation results show that not only a fast hot jet, much resemble the found transition region jets, but also a adjacent slow cool jet, mostly like classical spicules, is launched. The force analysis shows that the fast hot jet is continually driven by the Lorentz force around the reconnection region, while the slow cool jet is induced by an initial kick through the Lorentz force associated with the emerging magnetic ﬂux. Also, the features of the driven jets change with the amount of the emerging magnetic ﬂux, giving the varieties of both jets.\nWith the developed one-dimensional hydrodynamic solar wind model, the time-dependent pulses are imposed at the bottom to simulate the jet behaviors. The simulation results show that without other energy source, the injected plasmas are accelerated eﬀectively to be a transonic wind with a substantial mass ﬂux. The rapid acceleration occurs close to the Sun, and the resulting asymptotic speeds, number density at 0.3 AU, as well as mass ﬂux normalized to 1 AU are compatible with in site observations. As a result of the high speed, the imposed pulses lead to a train of shocks traveling upward. By tracing the motions of the injected plasma, it is found that these shocks heat and accelerate the injected plasma to make part of them propagate upward and eventually escape. The parametric study shows that as the speed and temperature of the imposed pulses increase, we get an increase of the speed and temperature of the driven solar wind, which do not be inﬂuenced by the increase of the number density of the imposed pulses. When the recurring period of the imposed pulses decreases, the obtained solar wind becomes slower and cooler.",

Our ability to validate such connections through nonstationary subterranean electric processes is limited with a technique developing from the end of 19 century. A couple of measuring lines, extended along magnetic meridian and parallel, are used to detect worldwide component of electrotelluric field and to recognize non-stationary processes occurring prior to earthquakes in seismic-hazardous areas. Rather poor attempts have been driven us to investigate results of subterranean electric measurements at the division of atmosphere and tectonosphere. In this talk, we discuss the network of low cost multielectrode systems (operated by Distant School Cosmic-Meteo-Tectonics cosmetecor.org). Active electrical signals in the surface soils have proton nature and provide a unique view into electric networks of currents (circuits) with non-stationary processes production. Exploiting the subterranean electric measurement technique specifically designed to be locally sensitive we had begun to measure the individual characteristics of non-stationary subterranean electric processes those preceded the greatest earthquakes with M≥7 on a global scale. We present and describe the rapid installations of dense sensor network, its operation, data processing and distribution.",

            "abstract": "Coastal and inland flooding has been a problematic occurrence, specifically over the past century. Global warming has caused an 8 inch sea level rise since 1990, which made the coastal flood zone wider, deeper and more damaging. Additionally, riverine flooding is extremely damaging to the country’s substructure and economy as well which causes river banks to overflow, inundating low-lying areas. New Jersey and New York are two areas at severe risk for flood hazard, sea level rise, land depletion and economic loss which are the main study area of this work. A decision making framework is being built to help mitigate the impacts of the environmental and economical dangers of storm surges, sea level rise, flashfloods and inland flooding. With vigorous research and the use of innovative hydrologic modeling software, this tool can be built and utilized to form resiliency for coastal communities. This will allow the individuals living in a coastal community to understand the details of climatic hazards in their area and risks associated to their communities. This tool will also suggest the best solution for the problem each community faces. Atlantic City and New York City has been modeled and compared using potential storm events and the outcomes have been analyzed. The tool offers all the possible solutions for the type of flooding that occurs. Green infrastructure such as rain gardens, detention basins and green roofs can be used as small scale solutions. Greater scale solutions such as removable flood barriers, concrete walls and height adjustable walls will also be displayed if that poses as the best solution. The results and benefits from the simulation and modeling techniques, will allow coastal communities to choose the most appropriate method for building a long lasting and sustainable resilience plan in the future.",

            "abstract": "The retention of soil moisture between rainfall or irrigation events is imperative to the productivity of terrestrial ecosystems. Amplified weather conditions are expected to result in widespread reduction in soil moisture. Extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) produced by soil bacteria have the ability to influence soil moisture by (i) retaining water directly within the hydrogel matrix, and (ii) promoting an aggregated soil structure. We have developed microfluidic devices that emulate realistic soil microstructures and enable direct observation of EPS production and drying resistance. The objective of this study was to compare moisture retention in emulated soil micromodels containing different soil microstructures. “Aggregated” devices contain a greater number of small (<30 μm) and large (>100 μm) pores, while “non-aggregated” devices contained more intermediate-sized (30-100 μm) pores. Particle-size distributions, similar to a sandy loam, were identical in both cases. Dilute suspensions of either of two strains of Sinorhizobium meliloti were introduced into replicate micromodels: one strain produced EPS (“EPS+”) and the other did not produce EPS (“EPS-“). Loaded micromodels were equilibrated at saturated conditions, then dried at 83% RH for several days. Direct observation showed micro-scale patterns of air infiltration. The rate and extent of moisture loss was determined as a function of bacterial strain and microstructure aggregation state. Results showed devices loaded with EPS+ bacteria retained moisture longer than devices loaded with EPS- bacteria. Moisture retention by EPS+ bacteria was enhanced in aggregated versus non-aggregated microstructures. This work illustrates how moisture retention in soil is the result of microbial processes acting within pore-scale soil microstructures. Validated microfluidics-based approaches may help quantitatively link pore-scale phenomena to ecosystem function.",

Here we introduce our new custom datalogger board that makes it very easy to build a rugged environmental monitoring system. These custom boards contain all of the essential features of a solar-powered datalogger with radio telemetry, plus they have a very convenient and modular method for attaching a wide variety of sensors and devices. Various deployment options and installations are shown, as well as the online database that is used for capturing the live streaming data from the loggers and displaying graphs on custom web pages. Following the introduction last year of the EnviroDIY online community (\nhttp://enviroDIY.org)\n, it continues to gain new members and share new ideas about open-source hardware and software solutions for observing our environment. EnviroDIY members can showcase their gadgets or describe their projects, ask questions, or follow along with helpful tutorials.

The time during which this site operated coincided with two large wildfires, Idaho’s Beaver Creek fire and California’s RIM fire, in addition to widespread agricultural fires in the Midwest. As part of our analyses, we examined multiple satellite-derived products that have been used in the analysis of tropospheric pollution, fires, and air mass flow patterns. The Fire Locating and Modeling of Burning Emissions (FLAMBE) inventory was used as an input to FLEXPART-WRF to quantify the contribution of particle trajectories and injection heights from the various sources. Trajectories from the sonde launch sites and fire locations were used as input for the two FLEXPART-WRF Model simulations to determine the origins of pollution plumes. The first simulation was conducted to model fire emissions within the planetary boundary layer (<3500m), while the second was added to investigate transportation effects from locations identified to have pyro-convective cumulonimbus. The Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5 (GEOS-5) potential vorticity was used to analyze the stratospheric component of ozone enhancements. We examined three meteorological test cases: 1) a cut-off low, 2) a blocking high pressure, and 3) a frontal passage, which involve mixed-layer O3 enhancements, which can be spotted at several sites within SEACIONS. We look to quantify the contribution of these ozone enhancement sources to local air quality.",

            "abstract": "For nearly a decade there has been a push in the planetary science community to support interoperable methods of accessing and working with geospatial data. Common geospatial data products for planetary research include image mosaics, digital elevation or terrain models, geologic maps, geographic location databases (i.e., craters, volcanoes) or any data that can be tied to the surface of a planetary body (including moons, comets or asteroids). Several U.S. and international cartographic research institutions have converged on mapping standards that embrace standardized image formats that retain geographic information (e.g., GeoTiff, GeoJpeg2000), digital geologic mapping conventions, planetary extensions for symbols that comply with U.S. Federal Geographic Data Committee cartographic and geospatial metadata standards, and notably on-line mapping services as defined by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The latter includes defined standards such as the OGC Web Mapping Services (simple image maps), Web Feature Services (feature streaming), Web Coverage Services (rich scientific data streaming), and Catalog Services for the Web (data searching and discoverability). While these standards were developed for application to Earth-based data, they have been modified to support the planetary domain.\nThe motivation to support common, interoperable data format and delivery standards is not only to improve access for higher-level products but also to address the increasingly distributed nature of the rapidly growing volumes of data. The strength of using an OGC approach is that it provides consistent access to data that are distributed across many facilities. While data-steaming standards are well-supported by both the more sophisticated tools used in Geographic Information System (GIS) and remote sensing industries, they are also supported by many light-weight browsers which facilitates large and small focused science applications and public use. Here we provide an overview of the interoperability initiatives that are currently ongoing in the planetary research community, examples of their successful application, and challenges that remain.",

To date, the reliable estimation of the wind and its components remains a challenge because of difficulties in both measurement and modeling. Previous methods that use ionospheric measurements to deduce winds provide their values only in the direction of the magnetic meridian. We will present the monthly climatology of the zonal and meridional components of thermospheric neutral wind at low and mid-latitudes obtained by a Kalman Filter technique. First, the climatology of the magnetic meridional wind is obtained by assimilating monthly maps of F-region ionosphere peak parameters (NmF2 and hmF2), obtained from COSMIC radio occultation data, into the Global Assimilation of Ionospheric Measurements Full Physics (GAIM-FP) model. The model provides the 3-D electron density throughout the ionosphere, together with the magnetic meridional wind. Next, the estimation of the global zonal and meridional wind components is performed using the newly developed Thermospheric Wind Assimilation Model (TWAM). TWAM combines magnetic meridional wind data obtained from GAIM-FP with a physics-based 3-D thermospheric neutral wind model using an implicit Kalman Filter technique. The ionospheric drag and ion diffusion velocities, needed for the wind calculation, are also taken from the GAIM-FP model. We present the monthly climatology of our wind estimation and compare individual horizontal wind components to their corresponding empirical model values and to measurements made by interferometers.",

            "abstract": "Accurate velocity and geometry of the slab is essential for better understanding of the thermal, chemical structure of the mantle earth, as well as geodynamics. Recent tomography studies show similar morphology of the subducting Pacific slab beneath northeast China, which was stagnant in the mantle transition zone with thickness of more than 200km and an average velocity perturbation of ~1.5% [Fukao and Obayashi, 2013]. Meanwhile, waveform-modeling studies reveal that the Pacific slab beneath Japan and Kuril Island has velocity perturbation up to 5% and thickness up to 90km [Chen et al., 2007; Zhan et al., 2014]. These discrepancies are probably caused by the smoothing and limited data coverage in the tomographic inversions. Here we adopted 1D and 2D waveform modeling methods to study the fine structure of Pacific slab beneath northeast China using dense regional permanent and temporary broadband seismic records. The residual S- and P-wave travel time, difference between data and 1D synthetics, shows significant difference between the eastern and western stations. S-wave travel time residuals indicate 5-10s earlier arrivals for stations whose ray path lies within the slab, compared with those out of the slab. Teleseimic waveforms were used to rule out the major contribution of the possible low velocity structure above 200km. Furthermore, we use 2D finite-difference waveform modeling to confirm the velocity perturbation and geometry of the slab. Our result shows that the velocity perturbation in the slab is significantly higher than those reported in travel-time tomography studies.\n",

            "abstract": "The seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 is largely controlled by the terrestrial biosphere. It is well known that the seasonal amplitude of net ecosystem productivity (NEP) is the largest in the far north, where forest productivity is compressed into a short growing season. Since 1960, the seasonal amplitude of atmospheric CO2 north of 45N has increased by 35-55%. The increase in the seasonal amplitude is a difficult benchmark for coupled climate-carbon models to replicate. In fact, the models vary widely in their mean seasonal cycle representation. The boreal region has a strong influence on CO2 seasonality at Barrow. Deciduous and evergreen plant functional types (PFTs) have different patterns of NEP. We identified four pairs of nearby deciduous and evergreen forest PFTs with eddy covariance measurements. Evergreen forests show an early peak in NEP in May-June, while deciduous forests have a larger peak in NEP later in June-July. The influence of each PFT on the seasonal cycle at Barrow was computed from atmospheric transport results. We normalized the amplitude influence by the growing season NEP of the tower-based PFT flux and found that deciduous forests have 1.4 to 1.8 times more influence (per unit of growing season NEP) at Barrow than evergreen PFT. This diagnosis depends on the timing of the sharp seasonal draw-down at Barrow, which occurs too late to be explained by evergreen forests. The cycle at Barrow therefore appears to be strongly influenced by deciduous PFT, despite the dominance of evergreen PFTs in boreal forests. This paradoxical conclusion is also reached when examining the seasonality of land surface fluxes calculated using atmospheric inverse methods. We examine how these different PFTs, and possible trends in relative abundance, affect the seasonality of atmosphere CO2 using FluxNet data and atmospheric transport modelling. Our results highlight the importance of parameterizing multiple PFTs or individual species within grid cells in models in order to understand the recent responses of the northern ecosystems to climate change.",

The RIS4E (Remote, In Situ and Synchrotron Studies for Science and Exploration) node of the SSERVI (Solar System Exploration Research Virtual Institute) program has conducted two field campaigns to the D1974 flow in an effort to study both its morphology and emplacement history as well as its geochemical and mineralogical signature. Several field portable instruments were deployed at the field site, including handheld x-ray fluorescence, field portable x-ray diffraction, a multispectral imager, Light Detection and Ranging, Ground Penetrating Radar, and a kite capable of producing high-resolution images and Digital Terrain Model data products.\nThis study specifically focuses on the combination of field data with laboratory infrared spectra acquired in the MIR and VNIR ranges. We focus on the solfatara site which consists of hydrothermally-altered basalt deposited in and around an actively degassing volcanic vent situated directly adjacent to the D1974 flow on its NW side. Preliminary laboratory results indicate that the samples exhibit IR signatures consistent with various sulfates (K, Ca, Mg, Na, Al, Fe+3, Cu, Zn, Sr), clay minerals, amorphous silica, Fe-oxides, and/or sulfur. This data will give us a rich understanding of the solfatara site and enable us to make inferences about the hydrothermal alteration products formed in similar Martian environments.",

Although SST and δ18O-water (correlated to SSS) variability both contribute to the δ18O signal in the coral carbonate archive, the paucity and limited temporal span of SST and SSS instrumental observations limit the ability to differentiate respective SST and SSS contribution to each δ18O record. From instrumental datasets such as HadISST v.3, ERSST, SODA, and Delcroix (2011), we forward model the δ18O (“pseudoproxy”) signal using the linear bivariate forward model from Thompson 2011 (“pseudoproxy”= a1(SST)+a2(SSS)). By iteratively weighting (between 0 and 1 by 0.005) the relative contribution of SST and SSS terms to the δ18O “pseudoproxy” following Gorman et al. 2012 method, we derive the percent contributions of SST and SSS to δ18O at each site based on the weights that produce the optimal correlation to the observed coral δ18O signal. A Monte Carlo analysis of error propagation in the weighted and unweighted pseudoproxy time series was used to determine how well the weighted and unweighted forward models captured observed δ18O variance. Across the south-western Pacific (40 sites) we found that SST contributes from less than 8 to more than 78% of the variance. This work builds upon this simple forward model of coral δ18O and improves our understanding of potential sources of differences in the observed and forward modeled δ18O variability. These results may also improve SST and SSS reconstructions from corals by highlighting the reef areas whose coral δ18O signal is most heavily influenced by SST and SSS respectively. Using an inverse approach, creating a transfer function, local SST and SSS could also be reconstructed based on the site-specific weights and observed coral δ18O time series.",

We address this question by analyzing ensemble simulations made with an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM); the Community Atmospheric Model version 5 with a newly developed unified convection scheme which can robustly simulate the tropical MJO activity.\nThe AMIP-type simulation, in which the observed SST is prescribed as the boundary condition, is repeated 10 times by starting the integrations with randomly perturbed initial conditions. The seasonal MJO activity level is measured as a variance during the boreal winter (November-April) of the MJO-filtered outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) anomalies. The SST-forced portion is estimated as the year-to-year MJO variability common to all ensemble members, while the inter-ensemble spread is considered as the internally driven component.\nWe show that the partitioning between the SST-forced and the internally driven components varies with geographical location. Over the tropical Pacific, the SST-forced component explains more than 50% of the total year-to-year variability, with the percentage reaching about 70% over the east Pacific. The SST anomalies associated with the El-Niño southern oscillation is identified as a primary driver of the SST-forced part over the tropical Pacific. In contrast, the SST-driven component over the Indian Ocean, which is associated with the basin-wide warming/cooling over the Indian Ocean, explains about 30% only. The remaining internally driven portion is related to the timing and duration of individual MJO events on which the internal atmospheric dynamics seem to have strong influence.\nOur results suggest that revealing the dynamical mechanisms that determines the timing and duration of MJO events is a key to enhance understanding of the internally driven component.",

            "abstract": "With potential risks of CO2 leakage and subsequent impacts on surrounding abiotic and biotic environments, development of adequate monitoring strategies is essential for successful geologic carbon storage (GCS). To accomplish such goal, a controlled artificial CO2 release experiment site has been established in Eumsung, Korea. Prior to the scheduled release in fall 2015 at the depth of 2.5 m, grid measurements of soil CO2 fluxes at the surface and shallow subsoil CO2 concentrations at various depths were conducted periodically in order to assess the background soil respiration fluxes. Following the installation of automated soil flux chambers, the mean flux was found to be 2.1 µmol m-2 s-1 over the period of June to August 2015. However, as expected, spatial and temporal variations of the CO2 flux among the chambers were observed, ranging from about 0.5 to 4.0 µmol m-2 s-1. In addition, it was found that rainfalls, including few incidents of heavy monsoonal rain, have hindered the collection of reliable data. Spatiotemporal variability of soil CO2 flux is due to its strong dependence on surrounding soil conditions (i.e. temperature and soil moisture content) and meteorological conditions. Hence by integrating the results obtained by portable accumulation flux chamber method and subsoil CO2 concentration measurements along with environmental data, we expect to produce a more reliable background value. In addition to expanding the sampling area, subsoil CO2 concentration measurements at various depths is also expected to provide valuable observations on the evolution and vertical movement of CO2 through the soil profile to the surface. Carefully assessed background CO2 flux level, from monitoring over a sufficiently long-term site characterization period and when its spatiotemporal variability is well understood, will be the key to successful leakage detection in GCS facilities.\n※ This subject is supported by Korea Ministry of Environment (MOE) as \"K-COSEM Research Program\".",

An example is observations of forest extent, species composition, health, and change; this information can help in assessing carbon sequestration, biodiversity and habitat, watershed management, fuelwood potential, and other ecosystem services as well as inform the opportunity cost of forest removal for alternative land use such as agriculture, pasture, or development. These “stacked” indicators or co- net benefits add significant value to Earth observations. In part because of reliance on case studies, much previous research about the value of information from Earth observations has assessed individual applications rather than aggregate across applications, thus tending to undervalue the observations. Aggregating across applications is difficult, however, because it requires common units of measurement: controlling for spatial, spectral, and temporal attributes of the observations; and consistent application of value of information techniques. This paper will discuss general principles of co-net benefit aggregation and illustrate its application to attributing value to Earth observations.",

            "abstract": "Carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of brachiopods are commonly used to reconstruct secular changes in ocean chemistry through the Phanerozoic but few studies have focused on the variations that occur laterally and concurrently across a single vast depositional system. Previous studies have identified significant isotopic variability to occur within an individual stratigraphic layer and the scatter in values has been attributed to diagenesis, non-equilibrium fractionation effects, and variability in oceanography. In order to further investigate these hypotheses, this study evaluates the δ18O and δ13C values from 346 living and Holocene brachiopods collected from surficial sediments across the latitude-parallel southern Australian shelf, a lateral distance of ~3000 km. Modern oceanographic measurements were used to calculate the range in δ18O values of calcite precipitated in apparent equilibrium with ambient seawater. A total of 84% of δ18O values from brachiopod samples (n = 684) fall within the range of calculated equilibrium calcite and accurately record a combination of normal shelf water conditions, winter downwelling across the shelf, and local summer upwelling. Most δ18O outliers are attributed to seasonal upwelling (90 of 108 outliers) and imply that either upwelling occurred in an area that has not been well established as an upwelling zone, or it occurred in a known upwelling area but the intensity was greater than previously measured. The δ13C values of brachiopods increase with increasing depth, which is the opposite of what is reported elsewhere. This unusual δ13C trend is caused by deeper slope currents being sourced from surface water southwest of Tasmania, an area with relatively high δ13C of DIC. The δ13C values of living specimens are consistently lower by 0.5-1.0‰ than most dead specimens, which is attributed to the decrease in δ13C values in the carbon cycle due to combustion of isotopically light fossil fuels over the last 200 years.",

This is most apparent in the change in curvature of the current sheet as the planet moves from equinox to solstice and back: the angle of attack (AOA - the effective angle between the dipole axis and the oncoming solar wind flow) varies from 0° at equinox, resulting in little to no curvature, to 26° at Northern and Southern solstice, when the magnetosphere is deformed into a \"bowl\" or \"basin\" shape.\nWe use the Saturn multifluid MHD model to investigate the changes in magnetospheric morphology and dynamics that result from seasonal variation. We have incorporated a static representation of Saturn's neutral cloud into the multifluid simulation, using scale height and equatorial density profiles for water-group neutrals, developed by H. T. Smith. This enables the simulation to calculate energy-dependent rate coefficients for electron impact ionization, and including the ability to specify a radially-dependent energetic/suprathermal electron distribution. Model outputs for a range of AOA values are used to study the specific response of current sheet curvature to the solar wind angle as a function of local time, as well as the implications of this for production and transport of plasma in the inner and middle magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "Seismological studies of recent well-monitored mega-earthquakes have revealed more high-frequency radiation in deeper portion of plate interface in subduction zones which suggests that the degree of stress heterogeneity may increase along the seismogenic zone towards its down-dip limit. These stress heterogeneities likely have great influence on the rupture behavior of earthquake faults, but we have limited understanding on the origins and controls of these heterogeneities. In order to investigate the potential interseismic processes governing the development of fault stress heterogeneity, we conducted numerical modeling to explore how shear stress anomalies on fault interfaces (shear stress patches) evolve spatiotemporally under the influence of viscoelastic rheology assigned to fault zones.\nTwo-dimensional viscoelastic models consisting of a fault zone and host rock were sheared to simulate shear stress accumulation on faults due to tectonic loading. Results show that magnitudes of shear stress patches evolve not only temporally, but also spatially, especially when the stress anomaly is created by a geometrical irregularity (asperity) along the interface of an elastic host rock and viscoelastic fault zone. Such shear stress anomalies diffuse spatially so that the spatial dimension of the shear stress patch appears to grow over time. Models with varying fault zone viscoelastic properties or varying fault zone viscosity show that such spatial diffusion of shear stress is enhanced by increasing the contribution of the viscous behavior. The absolute rate at which shear stress patches grow spatially is generally not influenced by the size of the shear stress patch. Therefore shear stress patches with smaller dimensions will appear to grow quicker, in the relative sense, compared to larger stress patches. These results suggest that the minimum dimensions of shear stress patches that can exist along a fault could be governed by the effective viscosity of the fault zone. Therefore patterns of accumulated shear stress could vary along faults when viscous properties are heterogeneous, for instance due to depth or material heterogeneity, which has implications on how earthquake rupture behavior could vary along faults.",

            "abstract": "Recent changes to the Arctic cryosphere have heightened societal requirements for understanding the Arctic system in a more sophisticated, coupled manner. Key drivers include the need for improved sea ice forecasting, understanding the fate of permafrost, and constraining hemispheric linkages with Arctic change. To make advances in all of these areas requires models that reliably represent Arctic surface fluxes and the coupled processes responsible for their variability on multiple scales. In the highly coupled Arctic system, clouds and related atmospheric boundary layer processes exert significant control on the flow of energy and how it ultimately affects surface energy budgets.\nTargeted observational and modeling studies over the past decade have provided foundational knowledge on Arctic cloud processes. Yet, these have also revealed significant challenges that inhibit accurate model representations of clouds and surface energy fluxes. This presentation highlights key advances in understanding Arctic clouds and their influential role in the coupled Arctic system by examining cloud phase partitioning, the surface response to cloud forcing, the role of vertical mixing processes, and others. Regional model simulations are used to demonstrate the sensitivity of modeled surface energy fluxes to cloud properties and to illustrate the influence of unconstrained cloud processes. Critical knowledge gaps and observational deficiencies are identified as a means for providing guidance on coupled-system observational and model development activities that are needed to improve future model predictive capabilities.",

Key effort in developing UQ techniques applicable to realistic large scale ocean models is numerical scalability for high dimensionality imposed by high resolution discretization of infinite dimensional PDEs governing ocean dynamics. This scalability requirement conflicts with the \"curse of dimensionality\" restricting current non-Gaussian UQ approaches to low dimensional idealized problems. On the other hand, practical progress in large scale UQ was enabled by Hessian-based methodologies, relying on a Gaussian approximation of the nonlinear state-space statistics. Validity of this approximation is rooted in the experience that for many large scale ocean problems the dynamics are smooth and not chaotic, supported by the expectation that small scale turbulence cancels out in aggregate converging to asymptotic normality on the large scale. Here, the dynamics of large scale uncertainty is addressed directly by explicit analysis of propagation of assimilated information in a global ocean model. It is demonstrated that for the case of barotropic Drake Passage transport separate uncertainty propagation mechanisms can be identified on small and large scales, with aggregate balances governed by simple low order dynamics. Reduced order Hessian is derived to approximate the dominant uncertainty evolution patterns, explaining the physical mechanisms of uncertainty propagation and reduction in a global ocean model.",

            "abstract": "Forest evapotranspiration (ET) can vary greatly at daily and seasonal time scales, but compared to carbon fluxes, often exhibits relatively consistent inter-annual behavior. The processes affecting ET involve physical and biological factors. Atmospheric conditions that promote high ET, consisting of high radiation and vapor pressure deficit (D), often occur during rainless periods when soil water supply may limit vegetation water use. In contrast, high soil water availability often coincides with frequent precipitation and low D. In mixed species forests, physiological differences in water use strategies (e.g. isohydric/anisohydric species), leaf habit (e.g., evergreen/deciduous species), and leaf phenology can produce conservative water use throughout wet and dry phases of the growing season and the year. Thus, the combination of these factors may explain some of the observed consistency in ET.\nWe examine the respective roles of climate and vegetation on variability in ET in a mature, temperate forest, dominated by deciduous species with an evergreen rhododendron understory at the Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in the southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. Since 2012, the site has experienced one year with a warm spring, leading to a two-week advance of leaf-out, and one year with the greatest amount of precipitation in the 80-year climate station record. While eddy covariance-based estimates of net primary productivity increased with earlier spring leaf phenology and decreased during a warm dry period, seasonal patterns in ET were consistent among years, leading to similar annual water vapor fluxes (coefficient of variation = 0.05). We combine these data with estimates of soil evaporation from a sub-canopy eddy covariance system, and transpiration from sap flux measurements to quantify the daily and seasonal contributions of canopy, understory, and soil to inter-annual variability in ET. These results will improve our ability to predict forest responses to future climatic variability and species composition, and have important implications for managing forest and water resources.",

In contrast, little is known about the climate history of coastal ice domes despite their relevance to ocean-ice interaction and sea level rise. The Roosevelt Island Climate Evolution project (RICE) recovered a 763 m ice core in 2013 from Roosevelt Island, West Antarctica. Located at the edge of the Ross Ice Shelf and grounded below sea level, Roosevelt Island is sensitive to oceanic forcing and may provide new information about potential drivers of abrupt interhemispheric climate connections and its location is ideal for exploring the retreat of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) from its glacial maximum through the Ross Sea. Here we present a continuous chronology for the RICE Ice Core covering the last 40,000 years with additional evidence of ice dating to at least 80,000 years near the bottom of the core. Both the depth-age relationship and reconstructed profile of annual layer thicknesses can be used to infer changes in climate and the glacial history of the East Ross Sea Embayment. The most striking feature of the record occurred during the Antarctic Cold Reversal. At this time a combination of data including thin annual layers, abrupt lowering of δ15N of N2 and δ40Ar in trapped air, and strongly depleted δD of ice suggest either a pronounced change in cyclonic activity and regional storm tracks and/or adjustment in the configuration of the Ross Ice Sheet during this period of rapid climate change and sea level rise.",

The momentum delivered to the asteroid can be greater than the momentum of the impactor because of the reaction force produced by ablation from the impact crater. We use an adaptive-mesh hydrocode to study the momentum-enhancement factor, or beta, varying the assumptions regarding the equation of state, strength, and porosity of the target. Spall from the back side of the asteroid, which partly counters the favorable effect of ablation, is also included in the calculations. The efficiency is shown to be most strongly dependent on the asteroid’s porosity, which unfortunately is the most difficult quantity to obtain via remote observations. This study is applied both to the proposed deflection of the 150-meter diameter moon of the binary asteroid 65803 Didymos by the AIDA/DART mission, and to the potential deflection of the 492-meter diameter asteroid 101955 Bennu, which has some possible Earth impacts late in the 22nd century, and is the target of the planned OSIRIS-Rex mission.

            "abstract": "Despite three decades of long-term field manipulations, there remains no clear consensus as to what regulates the magnitude of the CO2 stimulation of plant productivity across ecosystems and through time. A large body of work suggests that availability of nutrients or water, the factors that most strongly control NPP in most ecosystems, also control the magnitude of the CO2 effect on NPP. On the other hand, several recent studies have suggested that indirect CO2 effects, mediated through soil moisture savings, may hold importance in explaining results from individual sites. To determine how water availability may drive CO2 stimulation of productivity we collected annual NPP and rainfall data from 12 long-term CO2 studies. We found that the CO2 effect size was not consistently related to interannual variability in NPP under ambient conditions, indicating that the factors controlling interannual variability in NPP do not control the magnitude of CO2 effects on NPP in a consistent manner. Across sites and years, the CO2 effect size was negatively related to the number of rain days during the growing season, indicating that CO2 may have engendered important indirect effects on productivity that were manifested during under drying intervals. While the drivers underlying direct CO2 effect size remain elusive, this analysis suggests that indirect effects may exhibit generality across sites.",

In the literature, there are many examples of nonstationary spatial precipitation and streamflow models, yet these analyses are typically conducted separately.

We present a spatial Bayesian hierarchical model for simultaneously estimating nonstationary precipitation and streamflow extremes.

Since 1990 there have been 4\nlarge epidemics, the most recent in 2010 where there were nearly 27,000 cases reported, amounting to\nalmost 1% of the island’s total population. Because no vaccine is currently available, effective control\nis dependent on our ability to understand the complex relationship between environmental factors,\nmosquito vector ecology, and disease epidemiology. Dengue virus is transmitted primarily by Aedes\naegypti mosquitoes, as humans are the preferred host for Ae. aegypti.\nThe purpose of our analysis is to assess temporal and spatial patterns of dengue transmission in PR and\nrelate this to both climatic and anthropogenic factors. Unlike past studies, which have used San Juan to\nrepresent the island as a whole, our research will investigate regional dynamics in dengue transmission, as\npreliminary results have shown significant differences in population density, disease incidence, and\nenvironmental and climatic variables. Data from the Passive Dengue Surveillance System of CDC,\nmeteorological observations from NCDC, and remote sensing data from USGS and NASA will be used\ntogether to identify relationships between climate, urbanization, and dengue incidence for PR at various\nspatial and temporal scales. Preliminary climatic factors considered include precipitation, temperature,\nhumidity, and soil moisture. Finally, we will assess measures of urbanization such as land cover, land use,\npopulation density, and infrastructure that can make regional differences in dengue incidence each year.\nResults from this study could help create early warning systems for dengue surveillance in Puerto Rico,\nand develop techniques that can be applied to other areas of the world.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater recharge in semiarid mountains of the western U.S. remains a critical component of the regional water balance and has significant repercussions on water resources management, in particular during periods of drought. The bimodal distribution of annual precipitation in the southwest United States and northwest Mexico present a challenge as differential climate impacts during the winter and summer seasons are not currently well understood. In this work, we focus on the predictions of Mountain Block Recharge (MBR) using precipitation forcing from a reanalysis product, regional climate model-based precipitation products and available ground observations. MBR estimates in the Santa Cruz, San Pedro and Sonora River basins (>40,000 km2) are compared along a north to south gradient crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. As a result of the influence of the North American monsoon, the impact of seasonality in each of these systems is evaluated. Simulated precipitation fields under historical (1991-2000) conditions and climate change (2031-2040 and 2070-2080) scenarios are compared at resolutions of 10-km and 35-km as generated from the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model using boundary conditions from two general circulation models (MPI-ECHAM and HadCM3). Mountain subbasins to apply a seasonal MBR method were delineated using a threshold in terrain slope that matched official boundaries of known aquifers in these transboundary watersheds. We evaluated the MBR outcomes from the various precipitation products to quantify biases involved in the historical estimates and to inform groundwater management on the uncertainties inherent in future projections. We also inspect the variability of MBR across pluvial and drought periods lasting several years. Seasonal comparisons across a north to south spatial gradient yield a valuable assessment on the impacts of climate change on MBR for important basins in the U.S.-Mexico border region.",

            "abstract": "Numerical modeling of disposal of nuclear waste in a deep geologic repository in fractured crystalline rock requires robust characterization of fractures. Various methods for fracture representation in granitic rocks exist. In this study we used the fracture continuum model (FCM) to characterize fractured rock for use in the simulation of flow and transport in the far field of a generic nuclear waste repository located at 500 m depth. The FCM approach is a stochastic method that maps the permeability of discrete fractures onto a regular grid. The method generates permeability fields using field observations of fracture sets. The original method described in McKenna and Reeves (2005) was designed for vertical fractures. The method has since then been extended to incorporate fully three-dimensional representations of anisotropic permeability, multiple independent fracture sets, and arbitrary fracture dips and orientations, and spatial correlation (Kalinina et al. 20012, 2014).\nFor this study the numerical code PFLOTRAN (Lichtner et al., 2015) has been used to model flow and transport. PFLOTRAN solves a system of generally nonlinear partial differential equations describing multiphase, multicomponent and multiscale reactive flow and transport in porous materials. The code is designed to run on massively parallel computing architectures as well as workstations and laptops (e.g. Hammond et al., 2011).\nBenchmark tests were conducted to simulate flow and transport in a specified model domain. Distributions of fracture parameters were used to generate a selected number of realizations. For each realization, the FCM method was used to generate a permeability field of the fractured rock. The PFLOTRAN code was then used to simulate flow and transport in the domain. Simulation results and analysis are presented. The results indicate that the FCM approach is a viable method to model fractured crystalline rocks. The FCM is a computationally efficient way to generate realistic representation of complex fracture systems. This approach is of interest for nuclear waste disposal models applied over large domains.",

            "abstract": "As the most recent period of large climate change, the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) has been a useful target for analysis by model-data comparison. In addition, significant changes in greenhouse gas forcing across the last deglaciation and the relative wealth of LGM temperature reconstructions by proxy data provide a potentially useful opportunity to quantify equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS), the change in global mean surface air temperature due to a doubling of atmospheric CO2. Past model-data comparisons have attempted to estimate ECS using the LGM climate in two ways: (1) scaling of proxy data with results from general circulation model intercomparisons, and (2) comparing data with results from an ensemble of ECS-tuned simulations using a single intermediate complexity model. While the first approach includes the complexity of climate feedbacks, the sample size of the ECS-space may be insufficiently large to assess climate sensitivity. However, the second approach may be model dependent by not adequately incorporating uncertainty in climate feedbacks. Here, we present a new LGM-based assessment of ECS using the latter approach along with a simple linear parameterization of the longwave and shortwave cloud feedbacks derived from the CMIP5/PMIP3 results applied to the University of Victoria Earth System intermediate complexity model (UVIC). Cloud feedbacks are found to be the largest source of variability among the CMIP5/PMIP3 simulations, and our parameterization emulates these feedbacks in the UVIC model. In using this parameterization, we present a new ensemble of UVIC simulations to estimate ECS based on a Bayesian comparison with LGM temperature reconstructions that determines a probability distribution of optimal overlap between data and model results.",

            "abstract": "Severe wildfire has been shown to increase the magnitude and advance the timing of rainfall-generated stormflows across a range of hydro-climate regions. Loss of canopy and forest floor interception results in increased net precipitation which, along with the removal of forest organic layers and increased shorter-term water repellency, can result in strongly increased surface flow pathways and efficient routing of precipitation to streams. These abrupt changes have the potential to exacerbate flood impacts and alter the timing of runoff delivery to streams. However, while these effects are well documented in drier temperate mountain regions, changes in post-fire rainfall-runoff processes are less well understood in colder, more northern, snowfall dominated regimes.\nThe objectives of this study are to explore longer term precipitation and runoff dynamics of burned and unburned (reference) watersheds from the Southern Rockies Watershed Project (SRWP) after the 2003 Lost Creek wildfire in the front-range Rocky Mountains of southwestern Alberta, Canada. Streamflow and precipitation were measured in 5 watersheds (3.7 – 10.4 km2) for 10 years following the wildfire (2005-2014). Measurements were collected from a dense network of meteorological and hydrometric stations. Stormflow volume, peak flow, time to peak flow, and total annual streamflow were compared between burned and reference streams. Event-based data were separated into 3 post-fire periods to detect changes in rainfall-runoff dynamics as vegetation regenerated.\nDespite large increases in post-fire snowpacks and net summer rainfall, rainfall-generated runoff from fire-affected watersheds was not large in comparison to that reported from more temperate snowfall-dominated Rocky Mountain hydrologic settings. High proportions of groundwater contribution to annual runoff regimes (as opposed to surface flow pathways) and groundwater storage were likely contributors to greater watershed resistance to wildfire effects in these northern Rocky Mountain catchments.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_Neptune_BARS_COVIS_print.pdf\nInvestigating chemical and temperature changes in hydrothermal venting in the wake of seismic activity has typically been hampered by limited sampling in time and space. Seafloor observatories afford the opportunity for continuous collection of multiple data streams distributed over an area of interest to understand how geological, physical, and chemical processes are linked. Here we present results from chemical and geophysical sensor packages installed on the NEPTUNE observatory operated by Ocean Networks Canada to monitor temperature, chemistry and heat transport of the hydrothermal vent, Grotto, at Main Endeavour Field on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Benthic and Resistivity Sensors (BARS) make in-situ measurements of temperature and chloride concentration in high temperature hydrothermal fluid at one smoker. The Cabled Observatory Vent Imaging Sonar (COVIS) measures rise rates and heat transport in three nearby plumes and in areas of local diffuse discharge. These instruments are located in the vicinity of ocean bottom seismometers and alongside a Remote Access Sampler (RAS), a time-series fluid sampling device. BARS captured slow changes in temperature and chloride from September, 2013 to January, 2014, and rapid changes in the wake of seismic activity in March 2014. COVIS also captured a possible spike in heat transport above the most distal of the three plumes around the same time as the rapid variability in BARS data. Potential causes consistent with these data include seismic and fluid response to cracking of fresh rock, or earthquake-triggered changes in the underlying plumbing system. For the first scenario, spikes in the chloride signal can be used to constrain PT conditions of fluid phase separation by assuming peak and baseline chloride values represent brine and vapor conjugates, respectively. From this we estimate 422 °C and 336 bars as the conditions under which conjugates formed. For the second scenario, a single pass numerical model of the release of pressurized fluid deeper down can match initial and subsequent temperature spikes. Chemical analysis of diffuse samples and additional COVIS data streams collected during this period of increased heat transport coupled with high variability in temperature and chloride will help shed more light on an event that manifested in multiple metrics.",

            "abstract": "Ganymede exhibits two geologically distinct terrains known as dark and light (grooved) terrain. The mechanism for a transition from dark to light terrain remains unclear; however, inferences of strike-slip faulting and distributed shear zones suggest that strike-slip tectonism may be important to the structural development of Ganymede’s surface and in this transition. Here we investigate the role of tidal stresses on Ganymede in the formation and evolution of strike-slip structures in both dark and grooved terrains. Using numerical code SatStress, we calculate both diurnal and non-synchronous rotation (NSR) tidal stresses at Ganymede’s surface. Specifically, we investigate the role of fault friction and orbital eccentricity in the development of ~45 km of right-lateral offset at Dardanus Sulcus and a possible case of <10 km of right-lateral offset at Tiamat Sulcus. We compute Coulomb failure conditions for these target fractures and consider tidal stress scenarios for both present eccentricity (0.0013) and possible past high (~0.05) eccentricity of Ganymede. We find that while diurnal stresses are not large enough to support strike-slip failure at present or past eccentricities, models that include both diurnal and NSR stress readily generate shear and normal stress magnitudes that could give rise to shear failure. Results for a past high eccentricity assuming a low coefficient of friction (μf = 0.2) suggest shear failure is possible down to depths of 1-2 km along both Dardanus and Tiamat. For a high coefficient of friction (μf = 0.6), failure is limited to about 1 km depth at Dardanus and Tiamat, although confined to small episodic slip windows for the latter. Moreover, our models predict a right-lateral sense of slip, in agreement with inferred offset observed at both regions. Based on these results, we infer that past shear failure on Ganymede is possible when NSR is a driving stress mechanism. We complement this study with a detailed morphological mapping of strike-slip morphologies (en echelon structures, strike-slip duplexes, laterally offset pre-existing features, and possible strained craters) at Nun Sulcus and several other locations. These structures serve as example regions to provide improved constraints for global stress mechanisms responsible for strike-slip fault evolution on Ganymede.",

            "abstract": "Parameterizations of moist convection were originally developed for atmospheric modeling systems which horizontal resolutions were too coarse to explicitly simulate subgrid-scale convective motions. As global numerical models move towards non-hydrostatic scales and convective updrafts occupy a larger fraction of the model grid-box, these parameterizations must be modified to include the resolution dependence of the vertical convective eddy transport.\nWe implemented and tested the scale-aware Grell-Freitas (Grell and Freitas 2014) parameterization of convection in the Model for Prediction Across Scales (MPAS) using a variable-resolution mesh spanning between 50 km and 3 km centered over South America. Using three four-day forecasts initialized on 10thJanuary 2014 with GFS data, we analyzed the scale dependence of the partitioning between convective and grid-scale precipitation as a function of the convective updraft fraction.\nResults show that grid-scale precipitation contributes a major part to the total precipitation over the most refined region of the mesh in the tropics and that, conversely, convective precipitation contributes a major part of total precipitation over the coarsest region of the mesh. Furthermore, results show that there exists a smooth transition in the partitioning between convective and grid-scale precipitation as resolution varies between hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic scales. Comparisons of simulated precipitation against TRMM- Precipitation Analysis data are also presented.\n",

The objective of this study is to analyze marine mammal fisheries interactions data from fishermen self-reports and observer reports. We analyzed self-reports from 1996 - 2014 and Pacific Islands observer data from 2001 - 2014, and Northeast observer data from 1996 - 2014. We identify trends in the national marine mammal mortality/injury (M/I) self-report dataset; identify presence of complementary reports between self-reports and observer reports; and determine the compliance rate of self-reports and observer reports. The results of the self-report analysis indicate that the Greater Atlantic Region (GAR) receives the most M/I reports of the five National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) regional offices. The rate of animals reported as killed is three times higher than the rate for animals injured. Dolphins and porpoises are the most frequently reported species and gillnets are the most frequently reported gear type. This study will provide fisheries managers a greater understanding of the effectiveness of the requirement for fishermen to report moralities and injuries of marine mammals incidentally taken during commercial fishing operations. Refinements to the Marine Mammal Authorization Program (MMAP) reporting form will provide more accurate estimates of the M/I rate of marine mammals in each region and will help address the challenges with collecting self-reported incidental take data. Furthermore, the results can be used by managers to determine if self-reporting is informative and should be continued, with form improvements made to increase accuracy, or if the corresponding observer reports serve as sufficient data by themselves.",

            "abstract": "Over warm tropical oceans the increase in greenhouse trapping with increasing SST is faster than that of the surface emission, resulting in a decrease in outgoing longwave radiation at the top of the atmosphere (OLR) when SST increases, also known as the super greenhouse effect (SGE). If SGE is directly linked to SST changes, there are profound implications for positive climate feedbacks in the tropics. However, a number of studies in the last 20 years have provided compelling evidence that the OLR-SST relationship is coincidental rather than causal. These studies suggested that the onset of SGE is dominated by the large-scale dynamics, and that the apparent OLR-SST relationships disappear when individual large-scale regimes are considered.\nWe show that these conclusions are contingent on the quality of the datasets used in the analysis, and that modern satellite observations and reanalyses support a strong relationship between SGE and SST. We find that the SGE occurs across all dynamical regimes, suggesting that this may be related primarily to SST rather than large-scale dynamics. We also find that the discontinuity in the relationship between OLR and SST at high SST (29.5 C), i.e. the shutdown of SGE, also occurs across almost all dynamical regimes, suggesting that this behavior may also be strongly linked to SST.\nCollectively, these results suggest that the SGE may actually be controlled by SST. Work is ongoing to understand the robustness of this new result to other datasets, to understand whether SST is truly the controlling variable, and to understand the mechanism by which OLR could decrease with increasing SST even under strongly subsiding conditions.",

We present a detailed analysis of this event utilizing a new method of exploiting the EPAM Pulse Height Analyzer (PHA) data to precisely resolve helium and oxygen spectra within the 0.5 to 5 MeV/nuc range. We also present the flux, partial particle pressures, and pitch angle distributions of the ion measurements from RBSPICE. During this event, both EPAM and RBSPICE measured O:He ratios greater than 10:1. The pitch angle distributions from RBSPICE-B show a strong beam of oxygen at an L ~ 5.8 early on March 17th during orbit. The timing between the observations of the oxygen peak at ACE and the beam observed at RBSPICE-B is consistent with the travel-time required for energetic particle transport from L1 to Earth and access to the magnetosphere. We assert that the oxygen seen by RBSPICE during the initial phase of this event is the result of direct injection from the interplanetary medium of energetic ions.

Because future climate changes will be driven largely by only one forcing, CO2, it is important to separate and understand the individual contributions of different forcings in producing past recorded changes. We use idealized simulations of the coupled atmosphere-ocean-sea ice system as represented by the GFDL CM2.1 and the NCAR CESM to estimate fingerprints of the annual mean responses to changes in obliquity, precession, CO2, and ice sheets. For each location where we have observations, we can estimate the model’s time varying response to glacial cycle forcings by scaling and summing the fingerprints by known time series of past forcings. A multiple linear regression is conducted using Bayesian inference between the components of the linear reconstruction and long proxy time series for annual mean temperature from various geologic archives. In particular we determine scaling factors that would allow the modeled response to each forcing to better match the data. Estimates of the uncertainties in the data and model fingerprint patterns can be incorporated to establish the adequacy of different hypotheses (or models) to explain observed regional response patterns.",

The ETRHEQ method primarily uses meteorological data collected at common weather stations. Daily ET is inferred by choosing the surface conductance to water vapor transport that minimizes the vertical variance of the calculated relative humidity profile averaged over the day. The key advantage of the ETRHEQ method is that it does not require knowledge of the surface state (soil moisture, stomatal conductance, leaf are index, etc.) or site-specific calibration. We estimate daily ET at 229 weather stations for 53 years. Across the U.S., we find a decrease in summertime (JJAS) ET of 0.21 cm/yr/yr from 1961-2013 with recent (1998-2013) declines in summertime ET of 1.08 cm/yr/yr. We decompose the ET trends into the dominant environmental drivers. Our results suggest that the recent decline in ET is due to increased vegetation stress induced by increases in vapor pressure deficit. We will present out results in context of other commonly used, regional ET data products.",

The ability to accurately map aboveground carbon pools from lidar and collocated field plot data has been demonstrated in many studies. Our goal is to upscale this biomass information, mapped at 30 m resolution, to the regional level using wall-to-wall, multi-temporal Landsat imagery. We use the LandTrendr approach to transform Landsat time series into annual maps of Brightness, Greenness, and Wetness along with annual change estimates of these same tasseled cap indices. These, along with ancillary layers of canopy height (e.g., GLAS-derived), topography (e.g., insolation), and climate (e.g., mean annual precipitation) are used to predict 2002-2012 aboveground carbon annually across the northern half of Idaho, USA. Ecoregion-specific models are developed to impute aboveground biomass and forest type beneath a forest/non-forest mask. Annual maps are then summarized at the county-level and compared to publically available Forest Inventory and Analysis estimates for Monitoring, Reporting and Verification.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic shell crosslinked knedel-like nanoparticles (MSCKs) were originally engineered to aid in the cleanup of oil spills. These polymeric particles are spherical and approximately 70 nm in diameter. MSCKs have a hydrophobic shell and hydrophilic core which encapsulates suspended iron oxide nanoparticles, rendering them magnetic. MSCKs operate like discrete surfactant packets: increasing the mobility and apparent solubility of hydrophobic species, but do so within the confines of discrete particles which can then be recovered by filtration or magnetic removal. MSCKs accomplish this via sequestration of hydrophobic species from through the hydrophilic shell and into the hydrophobic core where hydrocarbon contaminants are entropically stabilized. In batch reactor testing, MSCKs have been shown to sequester crude oil up to ten times their mass (1000 mg of oil per 100 mg of MSCKs). This study examines the transport characteristics and contaminant sequestration capabilities of MSCKs in saturated porous media, in order to establish their potential for use in groundwater remediation.\nBaseline MSCK transport parameters were determined via one dimensional impulse column experiments. MSCKs were readily transported in saturated sand, with an average recovery rate of 99%. In the presence of 10% clay particles, recovery was reduced to 68%. MSCKs were able to completely sequester an aqueous phase pollutant (8.7 mg/L m-xylene), although it further reduced their recovery rate to 61% in sand and 53% in clay. The presence of a free phase contaminant (5% of pore space occupied by mineral oil) reduced MSCKs recovery in sand to 53%. The MSCKs recovered in the effluent had sequestered the mineral at ratios far below their capability (3-10 mg of oil per 100 mg of MSCKs).\nOverall, this study indicated that MSCKs show a number of promising attributes for use in remediation. However, further manipulation of their chemical and morphological properties is needed, with the objective of making “loaded” MSCKs either more amenable to transport and recovery or capable of permanently sequestering or reducing contaminants in-situ.",

Both effusive and explosive eruptions have built a young cone on the west side of the older volcanic complex and over an ancestral collapse scarp on the western flanks. Over the last two years Pacaya has experienced increased volcanic activity, including energetic strombolian eruptions, lava flows and continuous passive degassing. In January 2015, we installed a temporary seismic network consisting of 19 three-component, short-period sensors, and 2 three-element triangular infrasound arrays. During the two weeks of network operation, the volcano was constantly degassing, and incandescence at the summit was reported by local guides. In addition to seismic tremor, about 300 local events were detected. Spectrograms show a high frequency content, up to 10 Hz. Initial locations suggest the data are suitable for tomographic imaging of the cone. Tomographic modeling of the 3D P-wave structure is underway and results will be presented. The tomographic model will delineate the boundary between the older volcanic complex and the overlying cone, which is thought to represent a zone of weakness susceptible to failure. In addition, the velocity model will provide insight into the sources of deformation observed with GPS data since 2009.",

            "abstract": "Temperate deciduous forests of eastern US provide goods and services to millions of people and play a vital role in the terrestrial carbon and hydrological cycles. However, ongoing climate change and increased in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere (ca) are expected to alter growth and gas exchange of trees, and ultimately forest productivity. Still, the magnitude of these effects is unclear. A better comprehension of the species–specific responses to environmental changes will better inform models and managers on the vulnerability and resiliency of these forests. Tree-ring analysis was combined with δ¹³C and δ18O measurements to investigate growth and physiological responses of red oak (Quercus rubra L.) and tulip poplar (Liriodendron tulipifera L.) in northeastern US to changes in water availability and ca for the period 1950–2014. We found very strong correlations between summer climatic water balance (June-August) and isotopic tree-ring series for δ¹³C (r = −0.65 and −0.73), and δ18O (r = −0.59 and −0.70), for red oak and tulip poplar, respectively. In contrast, tree-ring width was less sensitive to summer water availability (r = 0.33–0.39). Prior to the mid 1980s, low water availability resulted in low stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, and growth. Since that period, pluvial conditions occurring in northeastern US have increased stomatal conductance, carbon uptake, and growth of both species. These findings demonstrate that broadleaf trees in this region could be more sensitive to drought than expected. This appears especially true since much of the calibration period looks wet in a multi-centennial perspective. Further, stronger spatial correlations were found between climate data with tree-ring isotopes than with tree-ring width and the geographical area of the observed δ18O-precipitation response (i.e. the area over which correlations are > 0.5) covers most of the northeastern US. Given the good fit between the isotopic time series and water availability, the robustness of the hydroclimatic reconstructions in this region could be improved considerably with further isotopic research. Overall, the results indicate that stable isotopes yield valuable climatic and physiological information that could be undetected when using solely tree-ring width.",

The HL assessment unit is a useful classification tool to relate and transfer hydrologically meaningful information between different watersheds without access to streamflow time series. A revised HL classification scheme was developed for over 10,000 assessment units (the fundamental unit of area for an HL) within the Pacific Northwest (PNW; Oregon, Washington, and Idaho). Aggregation and validation of the PNW HL assessment units to the watershed-scale was then completed for the PNW through use of clustering approaches and the hydrologic response as defined by hydroclimatic signatures. A result generated from this study was that the HL assessment units with greater moisture surplus or deficit formed a stronger connection between watershed-scale PNW HL and hydrologic response. The next step was to investigate the usefulness of the information contained within the PNW with regard to hydrologic modeling calibration and model structure selection. The hypothesis that we set forward for this study is that hydrologic response, as inferred and derived from the HL assessment units, is helpful for the structural identification and calibration of hydrologic models. A selection of streamgage stations and their associated watershed area across the PNW were modeled with lumped and semi-distributed modeling structures. The resulting model calibration and parameter space exploration leads to the identification of assessment unit types that are more hydrologically influential to the overall hydrologic functions of the watershed.",

The Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) aboard MAVEN measures the composition, structure, and variability of neutral and ionic species in the Martian upper atmosphere from approximately 125 to 500 km. Since September 2014 NGIMS has directly measured the Martian atmosphere over more than 500 MAVEN science orbits, covering large swaths of latitude, longitude, solar zenith angle, and local solar time. The careful development of retrieval methods is necessary to accurately and precisely investigate the neutral and ionic composition of the Martian upper atmosphere, as well as the distribution of these component species. These retrieval methods must include the determination of fragmentation patterns for all relevant species, exacting subtraction of instrument background, and determination of the instrument's sensitivity to neutrals and ions in its three operating modes. In this talk, we will describe the methodology for determining NGIMS neutral densities and present some preliminary results on the spatial distribution of active species.",

            "abstract": "Over the past decade NASA's Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO) has invested in new technologies for information systems to enhance the Earth-observing capabilities of satellites, aircraft, and ground-based in situ observations. One focus area has been to create a common infrastructure for coordinated measurements from multiple vantage points which could be commanded either manually or through autonomous means, such as from a numerical model. This paradigm became known as the sensor web, formally defined to be “a coherent set of heterogeneous, loosely-coupled, distributed observing nodes interconnected by a communications fabric that can collectively behave as a single dynamically adaptive and reconfigurable observing system”. This would allow for adaptive targeting of rapidly evolving, transient, or variable meteorological features to improve our ability to monitor, understand, and predict their evolution. It would also enable measurements earmarked at critical regions of the atmosphere that are highly sensitive to data analysis errors, thus offering the potential for significant improvements in the predictive skill of numerical weather forecasts.\nESTO’s investment strategy was twofold. Recognizing that implementation of an operational sensor web would not only involve technical cost and risk but also would require changes to the culture of how flight missions were designed and operated, ESTO funded the development of a mission-planning simulator that would quantitatively assess the added value of coordinated observations. The simulator was designed to provide the capability to perform low-cost engineering and design trade studies using synthetic data generated by observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs). The second part of the investment strategy was to invest in prototype applications that implemented key features of a sensor web, with the dual goals of developing a sensor web reference architecture as well as supporting useful science activities that would produce immediate benefit. We briefly discuss three of ESTO’s sensor web projects that resulted from solicitations released in 2008 and 2011: the Earth System Sensor Web Simulator, the Earth Phenomena Observing System, and the Sensor Web 3G Namibia Flood Pilot.",

We have designed a three-tier model of undergraduate chemistry courses that enable first-year students with no previous research experience to gain the skills needed to develop, fund and execute independent research projects by the close of their undergraduate studies. First-year students are provided with context through a broadly focused introductory class that exposes them to current faculty research activities, and also gives them direct experience with the research process through peer mentored research teams as they participate in faculty-directed projects. Mid-career undergraduate students receive exposure and support in two formats: illustrative examples from current faculty research are incorporated into lessons in core classes, and courses specially designed to foster research independence. This is done by providing content and process mentoring as students develop independent projects, write proposals, and build relationships with faculty and graduate students in research groups. Advanced undergraduates further develop their research independence performing student-designed projects with faculty collaboration that frequently result in tangible research products. Further, graduate students gain experience in mentoring though formal training, as well as through actively mentoring mid-career undergraduates. This novel, integrated approach enables faculty to directly incorporate their research into all levels of the undergraduate curriculum while fostering undergraduates in developing and executing independent projects and empowering mentoring relationships.",

            "abstract": "The Subsidence and Aquifer-System Compaction Packages, SUB and SUB-WT, for MODFLOW are two currently supported subsidence packages within the MODFLOW family of software. The SUB package allows the calculation of instantaneous and delayed releases of water from distributed interbeds (relatively more compressible fine-grained sediments) within a saturated aquifer system or discrete confining beds. The SUB-WT package does not include delayed releases, but does perform a more rigorous calculation of vertical stresses that can vary the effective stress that causes compaction. This calculation of instantaneous compaction can include the effect of water-table fluctuations for unconfined aquifers on effective stress, and can optionally adjust the elastic and inelastic storage properties based on the changes in effective stress. The next generation of subsidence modeling in MODFLOW is under development, and will merge and enhance the capabilities of the SUB and SUB-WT Packages for MODFLOW-2005 and MODFLOW-OWHM. This new version will also provide some additional features such as stress dependent vertical hydraulic conductivity of interbeds, time-varying geostatic loads, and additional attributes related to aquifer-system compaction and subsidence that will broaden the class of problems that can be simulated. The new version will include a redesigned source code, a new user friendly input file structure, more output options, and new subsidence solution options. This presentation will discuss progress in developing the new package and the new features being implemented and their potential applications.\nBy Stanley Leake, Scott E. Boyce, Randall T.

            "abstract": "Ascension Island, a remote island located in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean within the trade-wind region oat 8S, 14.5W, experiences the outflow of biomass-burning aerosols from continental Africa, over 2000 km away, from July through November, peaking in August and September. The shortwave-absorbing free-tropospheric aerosols, located in a region of high solar irradiance, provide a climate warming that is poorly represented in global aerosol climate models. The low clouds can respond to the smoke layer in myriad possible ways that are not yet well-documented. The shortwave-warming can stabilize the free-troposphere, enhancing the low cloud fraction. The deepening boundary layer and subsiding smoke layer also increase the likelihood of aerosol-cloud microphysical interactions. Interest in this climate regime is supporting an observational strategy of a year-long DOE ARM Mobile Facility deployment to Ascension (Layered Atlantic Smoke Interactions with Clouds, or LASIC), and an NSF aircraft campaign (ObservatioNs of Fireʼs Impact on the southeast atlantic REgion, or ONFIRE) based on Sao Tome Island. These campaigns will be integrated with NASA, UK and African activities sharing similar goals based further south in Namibia.\nInitial analysis is distinguishing meteorology from aerosol impacts on the boundary layer cloud fields. The forward trajectories of emissions from over 24,000 fire sources on continental Africa show that a free-tropospheric jet can advect aerosols to above Ascension island in just one-two days. The fast transport time encourages retention of signatures of the fire sources, in particular the radiatively-crucial single-scattering albedo value. Thereafter, a deep land-based anticyclonic high recirculates over one-third of these trajectories back to the African continent, explaining the widespread extent of the aerosol layer. The free-tropospheric jet also reduces the mean atmospheric subsidence independently of shortwave absorption by the aerosols.\nAscension Island has also experienced increasing rain this century, documented in United Kingdom meteorological measurements dating back to 1924. Preliminary analysis connects this primarily to rising sea surface temperatures. The long-term observations will be reviewed and related to larger-scale changes.",

            "abstract": "Long-term change in the Southern Ocean can be difficult to evaluate because of both the paucity of historic observations and the magnitude of eddy variability. The low stratification of the Southern Ocean means that eddies detected by altimetry at the ocean surface extend through the top 2 km of the ocean. Sea surface height anomalies are more strongly correlated with sub-surface variability at depths between about 600 and 1400 dbars than they are with variability in the upper 200 dbars. Altimetric variability can thus be used to remove eddy-related anomalies from individual Argo profiles, resulting in a smoother estimate of mean temperature and salinity. This “eddy-free” mean field serves as a benchmark against which to assess decadal-scale changes in the Southern Ocean, and we use historic hydrographic data to evaluate temperature and salinity changes through the second half of the 20th century. We also evaluate the behavior of Southern Ocean eddies themselves: Although in most parts of the ocean closed oceanic eddies appear to result in thermally indirect heat transport, eddies that are carried eastward by the ACC tend to propagate in the opposite direction, resulting in thermally direct, poleward heat transport across the ACC. Evidence suggests that this cell is maintained by the effective eastward propagation of eddies relative to the mean flow at deep levels.",

            "abstract": "Over the past decade, numerous research and industrial projects have been devoted to investigate the feasibility and efficiency of carbon dioxide capture, storage, and utilization. Besides the studies over the characteristics of candidate formations for CO2 injection, much attention has been paid to answer the environmental concerns regarding the CO2 leak to overlying formations. To first detect and then track a possible CO2 leak, different techniques have been proposed in the literature; however, most of them examine only a small portion of the formation and have a low resolution for early leak detection. To further increase the extent of the investigation zone and to monitor a large section of the formation in more detail, multi-well testing techniques have received a significant attention. Pressure pulse testing is a multi-well test technique in which a pressure signal generated by periods of injection and shut-in from a pulser well is propagated inside the formation, and the corresponding response is recorded at the observer wells. The recorded pressure response is then analyzed to measure the rock and fluid properties and to monitor the possible changes over the time. In this research study, we have applied frequency methods as well as superposition principle to interpret the pressure pulse test data and monitor the changes in transmissibility and storativity of the formation between the well pairs. We have used synthetic reservoir models and numerical reservoir simulations to produce the pressure pulse test data. The analysis of the simulation results indicated that even a small amount of CO2 leak in the investigation zone can have a measurable effect on the calculated storativity and transmissibility factors. This can be of a great importance when an early leak detection is of interest. Moreover, when multiple wells are available in the formation, the distribution of the calculated parameters can visualize the extent of CO2 leak, which has a great application in monitoring the plume evolution. Based on our study, the pressure pulse test analysis provides the capability to monitor large areas inside the formation and to detect the possible leaks with reasonable accuracy.",

The most important stabilization mechanisms for carbon in soil include chemical and physical association of organic compounds with soil minerals. However, to date, we don't have a complete understanding of the relative contribution of each process to carbon stabilization, especially under different soil conditions. To develop better process-level understanding of these stabilization mechanisms, the relative importance of chemical vs. physical mechanisms of carbon stabilization facilitated by iron oxides at different soil solution conditions using a variety of advanced approaches including electron microscopy and infrared spectroscopy is determined. Our preliminary results suggest that aggregation may be the dominant process in mineral-organic associations.

            "abstract": "The states of Jalisco, Colima, and Michoacan in western Mexico overlie the boundary of the subducting Rivera and Cocos plates, presenting an appealing target for seismological inquiry to better understand the resulting mantle flow and regional volcanism. The different dips between the subducting plates is thought to provide a mantle conduit that has contributed to the Colima Volcanic Complex, but there is considerable debate on the shallowness of the Rivera plate and width of the resulting conduit. With data from the Mapping the Rivera Subduction Zone (MARS) and Colima Deep Seismic Experiment (CODEX) networks, two temporary broadband arrays deployed in the region between 2006-2008, we invert for three-dimensional P- and S- wave velocity and later attenuation structure of the upper ~80 km of the crust and mantle in the Jalisco region. We improve upon previous tomography work by utilizing double-difference tomography, which enables the use of higher-accuracy differential times to sharpen the earthquake locations, and the inclusion of S-wave data. Current models that utilize only analyst-picked phase arrivals from 590 earthquakes yield P-wave high velocity anomalies that suggest a slab under the coastal regions at 15-25 km depth, and low velocity anomalies that may be related to Colima Volcano or other geologic features. Most of the S-wave model is poorly resolved. We will use a newly developed auto-picker to attempt to substantially increase the size of the S-wave dataset and to a lesser extent the P wave dataset, in order to densify ray coverage and improve model resolution. Additionally, we plan to employ the waveforms from this expanded dataset to compute a path attenuation operator for each arrival, which will then be used to invert for 3D P and S-wave attenuation models. The attenuation models combined with the velocity models will provide multiple constraints on physical properties of the crust in this region as well as those of specific geologic features.",

            "abstract": "Vehicle-based surveys using laser and other analyzers are now commonplace in research and industry. In many cases when these studies target biologically-relevant gases like methane and carbon dioxide, the minimum detection limits are often coarse (ppm) relative to the analyzer’s capabilities (ppb), because of the inherent variability in the ambient background concentrations across the landscape that creates noise and uncertainty. This variation arises from localized biological sinks and sources, but also atmospheric turbulence, air pooling, and other factors. Computational processing routines are widely used in many fields to increase resolution of a target signal in temporally dense data, and offer promise for enhancing mobile surveying techniques. Signal processing routines can both help identify anomalies at very low levels, or can be used inversely to remove localized industrially-emitted anomalies from ecological data. This presentation integrates learnings from various studies in which simple signal processing routines were used successfully to isolate different temporally-varying components of 1 Hz timeseries measured with laser- and UV fluorescence-based analyzers. As illustrative datasets, we present results from industrial fugitive emission studies from across Canada’s western provinces and other locations, and also an ecological study that aimed to model near-surface concentration variability across different biomes within eastern Canada. In these cases, signal processing algorithms contributed significantly to the clarity of both industrial, and ecological processes. In some instances, signal processing was too computationally intensive for real-time in-vehicle processing, but we identified workarounds for analyzer-embedded software that contributed to an improvement in real-time resolution of small anomalies. Signal processing is a natural accompaniment to these datasets, and many avenues are open to researchers who wish to enhance existing, and future datasets.",

            "abstract": "Presently, fugitive emissions released into the atmosphere during the completion and production of oil and gas wells are poorly regulated within Canada. Some possible upstream sources of these emissions include flowback during well completions, liquid unloading, chemical injection pumps, and equipment leaks. The environmental benefits of combusting natural gas compared to oil or coal are negated if methane leakages surpass 3.2% of total production, so it is important to have a thorough understanding of these fugitive emissions. This study compares atmospheric leakage pathways of methane and other fugitive gases in both conventional and unconventional oil and gas developments in Western Canada to help fill this knowledge gap.\nOver 5000 kilometers of mobile survey campaigns were completed in carefully selected developments in the Montney shale play in British Columbia, and in conventional oil fields in Alberta. These sites are developed by more than 25 different operators. High precision laser and UV fluorescence gas analyzers were used to gather geolocated trace gas concentrations at a frequency of 1 Hz while driving. These data were processed with an adaptive technique to compensate for fluctuations in background concentrations for each gas. The residual excess concentrations were compositionally fingerprinted on the basis of the expected gas ratios for potential emission sites in order to definitively attribute anomalies to infrastructural leak sources. Preliminary results from the mobile surveys of both conventional and unconventional oil and gas sites are presented here. Pathways of methane and other fugitive gases are mapped to their respective sources, identifying common causes of emissions leaks across the oil and gas industry. This is the first bottom-up study of fugitive emissions from Canadian energy developments to produce publicly available data. These findings are significant to operators interested in lowering emissions for economic benefit, as well as public and governmental groups looking to become more informed on the impacts of oil and gas developments in Canada.",

Results of simulations of shallow cumulus and stratocumulus clouds across a range of resolutions show that high-order WENO schemes for scalars and momentum equations yield superior results to traditional central-difference schemes, even when the latter are of high order. The results are particularly striking for stratocumulus clouds, where high-order WENO schemes allow simulations to maintain stratocumulus clouds at appreciably lower resolution than central difference schemes, leading to net computational savings in using WENO schemes despite their computational overhead at fixed resolution. We propose a mechanism for the sensitivity of stratocumulus clouds to the numerical discretization.",

            "abstract": "Globally, expanding agriculture is significantly impacting aquatic nutrient cycles. In mesic systems, agriculture is a source of nitrogen and phosphorus and increases concentrations of structurally simple dissolved organic carbon (DOC). In contrast, recent studies suggest in dryland systems, where wastewater effluent is a primary nutrient source, agriculture is a nutrient sink—retaining nitrogen and phosphorous. Importantly, very little, is known about the influence of agriculture on DOC dynamics in dryland systems.\nTo address this gap we used synoptic sampling, UV-absorbance, and fluorescence spectroscopy to elucidate source, character, and concentration of riverine and runoff DOC in a dryland agricultural system. Samples were collected along a 25 km stretch of the Rio Grande River in New Mexico (USA). The Rio Grande is an impoundment/irrigation-withdrawal controlled river that receives water from snowmelt, monsoonal storms, and wastewater effluent. During irrigation approximately 80% of the river’s water is diverted into a manmade network where it waters crops and percolates through the soil before it enters a series of drains that return water to the river. Our preliminary characterization of the DOC reentering the river (DOCmean=3.23 mg/L, sd=0.81; SUVAmean=4.05, sd=1.37) indicates the agricultural pool is similar in concentration and aromaticity to riverine DOC (DOCmean= 3.10 mg/L, sd=1.17; SUVAmean= 4.64, sd=1.12). However, riverine organic matter is more terrestrially derived (FImean=1.68, sd=0.17) than organic matter in the drains (FImean=1.9, sd=0.24). Additionally, drains directly adjacent to actively irrigated fields show high concentrations (DOCmean=58.35; sd=0.91) of low aromaticity organic matter (SUVAmean=0.33; sd=0.11). We are continuing analysis throughout the irrigation season to further explore organic matter quality (traits such as bioavailability and freshness) and identify locations and processes of DOC transformation within the system. Based on our current results dryland agricultural areas produce large quantities of structurally simple organic matter that is rapidly processed and transformed in surficial drains. Thus, future dryland agricultural expansion may impact food web dynamics, river biochemistry, and carbon cycling.",

            "abstract": "The grand challenge of surface leak monitoring is to detect and attribute even small leaks across large energy development sites, which often span hundreds of square kilometres. Ratio-based geochemical methods show great potential for near-surface leak detection and attribution in vehicle-based mobile surveys. Ratios are useful especially when applied to concentration anomalies that exceed the Ambient Background (ABG), because they preserve the ratio of emission, and allow for more definitive attribution. Predicting ABG is, however, difficult because its variance originates from many processes including atmospheric patterns, local vegetation, other natural factors, and human activity.\nHere we present a method of vehicle-based atmospheric leak detection. We have developed a signal conditioning process for accommodating a variable ABG throughout a survey dataset. ABG is the lowest value of a species within a time interval of variable length, and anomalies are detected when ratios of excess concentration (above ABG) exceed defined ratio limits based on expected sources. We computationally iterate through many configurations of ABG time interval and other parameters to find an optimized scenario. In surveys of CH4, δ13CH4, CO2 and H2S at a large energy development with active infrastructure, we compared our technique to a concentration threshold detection technique (2 ppm CH4), and a variation of our process where ABG is assumed to be the lowest dataset value.\nAcross ~1500 km of survey data, our process detected 8 times more leak anomalies than did the threshold technique. The lowest value background technique detected a similar number of leak anomalies as the optimized ABG, but was oversensitive to combustion (CO2-rich) emissions. With the optimized scenarios we observed some persistent leak anomalies in as many as 50% of survey passes, throughout different seasons and wind conditions. Leak persistence showed no significant relationship to leak size. CO2-rich leaks typically ranged from 10 to 80 ppm above ABG, while CH4-rich leaks were detected typically in the 10-40 ppb range. Overall, our technique increased both the visibility of small leaks, and the persistence of leaks of all sizes at only moderate computational expense.",

            "abstract": "Green roofs are an increasingly popular low impact development tool used to mitigate the adverse effects of urbanization and the loss of vegetated spaces. The benefits of green roofs include reducing stormwater volume and peak flows, reducing building energy loads, and mitigating the urban heat island effect. Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key process fundamental to hydrologic and thermal performance of green roofs. For example, ET governs the water storage volume available in the soil medium and thus the ability of the green roof to retain and attenuate stormwater. Green roof design considerations such as soil medium depth and plant type impact ET rates. Additionally, climate has a strong impact on ET rates. To date, the influence between climate and green roof design factors (e.g. vegetation type and soil medium depth) on ET rates have not been well quantified. We performed a field study to evaluate the impact of climate, vegetation type, and soil medium depth on ET rates from extensive modular green roofs over prolonged drying periods. Three Canadian cities with distinct climates were chosen as field sites: London, ON, Calgary, AB, and Halifax, NS. At each site, daily module weights were recorded from May to August in 2013 and 2014 for approximately 40 green roof modules. These modules were divided into four vegetation treatments (three single species and one mixed species), and each treatment was divided into two groups of soil medium depth (10 cm or 15 cm). Daily ET rates and seasonal moisture loss were calculated and compared for the modules to determine which treatment provided the highest ET rates. The root depth profile, leaf area index, and stomatal resistance were also measured. On average, daily ET rates among the vegetation treatments did not vary greatly, however, observations on plant survival indicate which plant types are best suited for each site. In all three sites, mixed species in 15 cm of soil medium had higher seasonal moisture loss compared to similar depth modules with individual species. Furthermore, the depth of the root structure was found to influence the seasonal moisture loss among the vegetation treatments. These data provide insight on the vegetation type and soil medium depth best suited for different climates.",

            "abstract": "To better assess seismic hazard and fault behavior along the southern peninsula in the San Francisco Bay Area on the Santa Cruz Mountain section of the San Andreas Fault, we combine field observations and high-resolution lidar topography data with 10Be exposure dating on offset landforms to estimate geologic fault slip rates. Our mapping at Sanborn County Park near Saratoga reveals a progression of alluvial fans and debris flows offset from their upstream sources by dextral slip on the San Andreas Fault. These upstream sources are 3 drainages, Todd Creek, Service Road Creek and Aubry Creek. Coarse alluvial deposits from each of these creeks contain large Tertiary sandstone boulders of varying size and abundance, derived from the Vaqueros Formation, that allow us to constrain the provenance of offset alluvial deposits to their upstream sources. Initial reconstruction, based on clast-count data on lithology and size from Todd Creek (n=68), Service Road Creek (N=32) and the offset deposits (n=68), suggest ≥140 m of dextral fault movement. Initial 10Be cosmogenic dating of sandstone boulders on an offset deposit from Service Road Creek yields a maximum date of 8 ka, a date uncorrected for hillslope residence and fluvial transport of inherited 10Be concentrations. These data suggest a minimum slip rate of at least 17 mm/yr on the Santa Cruz Mountain section of the San Andreas Fault in the peninsula. Ongoing analysis will refine this fault slip rate. Our preliminary data underscore the potential of this site to provide geologic slip rate estimates, and therefore answer a question critical to seismic hazard assessment, in a region where steep terrain, mass wasting, vegetation and urban development have generally made slip rate estimates challenging to obtain.",

            "abstract": "North Ice Cap (~76.9°N, 68°W, summit elevation 1322 m asl), a small, independent ice cap in northwestern Greenland, is located within ~25 km of the Greenland Ice Sheet margin and Harald Molkte Bræ outlet glacier. We present geochronological, geomorphic and sedimentological data constraining the Holocene extents of North Ice Cap and suggest that its past fluctuations can be used as a proxy for climate conditions along the northwestern margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Prior work by Goldthwait (1960) used glacial geomorphology and radiocarbon ages of subfossil plants emerging along shear planes in the ice cap margin to suggest that that North Ice Cap was not present during the early Holocene and nucleated in the middle to late Holocene time, with the onset of colder conditions. Subfossil plants emerging at shear planes in the North Ice Cap margin yield radiocarbon ages of ~4.8-5.9 cal kyr BP (Goldthwait, 1960) and ~AD 1000-1350 (950-600 cal yr BP), indicating times when the ice cap was smaller than at present. In situ subfossil plants exposed by recent ice cap retreat date to ~AD 1500-1840 (450-110 cal yr BP) and indicate small fluctuations of the ice cap margin. 10Be ages of an unweathered, lichen-free drift <100 m from the present North Ice Cap margin range from ~500 to 8000 yrs ago. We suggest that the drift was deposited during the last ~500 yrs and that the older 10Be ages are influenced by 10Be inherited from a prior period of exposure. We also infer ice cap fluctuations using geochemical data from a Holocene-long sediment core from Deltasø, a downstream lake that currently receives meltwater from North Ice Cap. The recent recession of the North Ice Cap margin influenced a catastrophic drainage of a large proglacial lake, Søndre Snesø, that our field team documented in August 2012. To our knowledge, this is the first significant lowering of Søndre Snesø in historical time.",

            "abstract": "Gravity driven water flow into an initially dry porous medium can lead to a non-monotonic behaviour. Instead of a uniform flow front, water infiltrates in finger patterns, which has been observed experimentally. Fingering effect cannot be described by the Richards equation or standard two-phase flow system, unless some additional terms are incorporated. One of the most effective approaches to model the observed saturation and pressure overshoot is to include the so-called non-equilibrium capillarity effect. Besides it, capillary or relative permeability hysteresis between imbibition and drainage processes also plays a key role in the degree of nonmonotonicity and its pattern.\nIn this work, we investigated and compared different approaches for modelling non-monotonic saturation and pressure behaviours in fingering effect. Either hysteresis and/or dynamic capillarity was included. We showed different overshoot patterns in various models and discussed the main regime of these numerical models. Moreover, we employed our model to fit the experimental data conducted by S. Fritz (2012). Five different combinations of dynamic and hysteretic effects were done to investigate our ability to simulate the experimental data.",

            "abstract": "A widespread high velocity layer (HVL) has been detected by numerous seismic experiments at the base of crust in southern Tibet and northern Himalaya. Its general explanation is eclogitization of Indian lower crust under Tibet. However, its specific property is elusive. Eclogitization and the behavior of felsic to intermediate lower crust are significantly different from those of mafic lower crust. Determining the geophysical properties (thickness, Poisson’s ratio, density, and velocity structure) of the HVL could greatly improve our understanding about geodynamic process of an ongoing continental collision zone.\n We present a new receiver function (RF) layer stripping approach to remove the Moho phase and isolate the HVL phase in each RF. We first carry out a joint inversion of RFs and ambient noise dispersion observations to determine the shear velocity structure. We use the velocity contrast across the Moho to create synthetic RFs that consists of only the Moho phases. Next we fix the values of accurate arrivals and amplitude of the observed Moho phases on the basis of HK stacking results plus a local search. We calibrate the synthetic Moho phases to the observed values and subtract from the observed RFs. Finally we perform two-step HK stacking method to search the thickness (H) and Vp/Vs ratio (K) of first layer (from surface to the top of HVL) and then the underlying HVL. The average Vs of each layer obtained from joint inversion are used in the HK staking instead of an assumed Vp.\nWe test this method on 23 Hi-CLIMB stations that exhibit HVL. The “doublets” merge together once the HVL is thinner than 10km, which is the resolution limit of this method. We found the average H and K of first layer are about 59km and 1.76, the southernmost station show highest K value (1.88) which is in agreement with presence of lower velocity zone in the middle crust. The average Vs of first layer ranges from 3.3 to 3.45 km/s. The HVL shows complex variation from station to station in H (with a maximum thickness 20.7 km in the center of profile) and K (mean: 1.69). Average Vs ranges from 3.89 to 4.09 km/s. Previous gravity anomaly study further shows the density of HVL is 3300kg/m3. All these evidences suggest the property of the HVL is felsic eclogite rather than mafic eclogite.",

These software systems provide mechanisms for sharing data among disparate computational modules during simulation runtime, to collectively solve a given problem. This functionality is particularly desirable when modeling cross-disciplinary systems such as climate science and watershed hydrology. Many hydrologic models rely on weather parameters, which may be observed in the field or estimated by other models, to drive simulation. While much of this data is readily available, the method by which it is integrated into coupled hydrologic simulations is not a trivial process, especially when dealing with large data stores. This work investigates modes of integration for large datasets within coupled hydrologic models. The approach is demonstrated by incorporating publicly available observation data as well as preprocessed datasets within a coupled modeling framework. We present this work and demonstrate how the methodology can be leveraged to simulate watershed-scale hydrologic systems.",

            "abstract": "Although subsurface oceans are confirmed in Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, and strongly suspected in Enceladus and Titan, the exact mechanism required to heat and maintain these liquid reservoirs over Solar System history remains a mystery. Radiogenic heating can supply enough energy for large satellites whereas tidal dissipation provides the best explanation for the presence of oceans in small icy satellites. The amount of thermal energy actually contributed to the interiors of these icy satellites through oceanic tidal dissipation is largely unquantified. Presented here is a numerical model that builds upon previous work for quantifying tidally dissipated energy in the subsurface oceans of the icy satellites.\nRecent semi-analytical models (Tyler, 2008 and Matsuyama, 2014) have solved the Laplace Tidal Equations to estimate the time averaged energy flux over an orbital period in icy satellite oceans, neglecting the presence of a solid icy shell. These models are only able to consider linear Rayleigh friction. The numerical model presented here is compared to one of these semi-analytical models, finding excellent agreement between velocity and displacement solutions for all three terms to the tidal potential. Time averaged energy flux is within 2-6% of the analytical values. Quadratic (bottom) friction is then incorporated into the model, replacing linear friction. This approach is commonly applied to terrestrial ocean dissipation studies where dissipation scales nonlinearly with velocity. A suite of simulations are also run for the quadratic friction case which are then compared to and analysed against recent scaling laws developed by Chen and Nimmo (2013).",

            "abstract": "In-situ recovery (ISR) mining of uranium involves the injection of O2 and CO2 (or NaHCO3) into saturated roll-front deposits to oxidize and solubilize the uranium, which is then removed by ion exchange at the surface and processed into U3O8. While ISR is economical and environmentally-friendly relative to conventional mining, one of the challenges of extracting uranium by this process is that it leaves behind a geochemically-altered aquifer that is exceedingly difficult to restore to pre-mining geochemical conditions, a regulatory objective.\nIn this research, we evaluated the ability of the aquifer downgradient of an ISR mining area to attenuate the transport of uranium and other problem constituents that are mobilized by the mining process. Such an evaluation can help inform both regulators and the mining industry as to how much restoration of the mined ore zone is necessary to achieve regulatory compliance at various distances downgradient of the mining zone even if complete restoration of the ore zone proves to be difficult or impossible.\nThree single-well push-pull tests and one cross-well test were conducted in which water from an unrestored, previously-mined ore zone was injected into an unmined ore zone that served as a geochemical proxy for the downgradient aquifer. In all tests, non-reactive tracers were injected with the previously-mined ore zone water to allow the transport of uranium and other constituents to be compared to that of the nonreactive species. In the single-well tests, it was shown that the recovery of uranium relative to the nonreactive tracers ranged from 12-25%, suggesting significant attenuation capacity of the aquifer. In the cross-well test, selenate, molybdate and metavanadate were injected with the unrestored water to provide information on the transport of these potentially-problematic anionic constituents. In addition to the species-specific transport information, this test provided valuable constraints on redox conditions within the system, as redox couples involving these species collectively bracket the predicted transition redox potential for the U(VI)/U(IV) couple. Reduction should provide much longer-lasting immobilization of constituents than adsorption, especially given the inherent reducing characteristics of roll-front systems.",

The field-related aspects of the project were initiated in 2009 and focused on the development of a baseline dataset developed from hydrometric, isotopic, and water quality monitoring of a set of small paired catchments. In the winter of 2013 a series of treatments, representing typical forest management strategies in the southeastern US were implemented, and monitoring will continue through 2018. We have used the available long-term measurements to outline a conceptual model of catchment hydrology in this region which is characterized by low gradient slopes and deep sandy soils. The conceptual model has been translated into an object-oriented landscape modeling framework, allowing for the development of a set of long term landuse scenarios which serve as temporally-varying boundaries conditions for the catchment model. The presentation focuses primarily on these modeling results, with particular emphasis on the influence of short rotation harvest on groundwater recharge and stream water quantity over decadal scales.",

Reducing this uncertainty is critical for assessing the future of the Amazon region as well as its vulnerability to climate change. The AmazonFACE (Free-Air CO2 Enrichment) research program is an integrated model-experiment initiative of unprecedented scope in an old-growth Amazon forest near Manaus, Brazil – the first of its kind in tropical forest. The experimental treatment will simulate an atmospheric CO2 concentration [CO2] of the future in order to address the question: “How will rising atmospheric CO2 affect the resilience of the Amazon forest, the biodiversity it harbors, and the ecosystem services it provides, in light of projected climatic changes?” AmazonFACE is divided into three phases: (I) pre-experimental ecological characterization of the research site; (II) pilot experiment comprised of two 30-m diameter plots, with one treatment plot maintained at elevated [CO2] (ambient +200 ppmv), and the other control plot at ambient [CO2]; and (III) a fully-replicated long-term experiment comprised of four pairs of control/treatment FACE plots maintained for 10 years. A team of scientists from Brazil, USA, Australia and Europe will employ state-of-the-art methods to study the forest inside these plots in terms of carbon metabolism and cycling, water use, nutrient cycling, forest community composition, and interactions with environmental stressors. All project phases also encompass ecosystem-modeling activities in a way such that models provide hypothesis to be verified in the experiment, which in turn will feed models to ultimately produce more accurate projections of the environment. Resulting datasets and analyses will be a valuable resource for a broad community, especially ecosystem and climate modelers, and policy-makers.",

Scaling analysis tasks that are traditionally developed using desktops, laptops or computing clusters to effectively leverage national and regional scale cyberinfrastructure pose unique challenges and barriers to adoption. To address some of these challenges in Fall 2014 an ‘Applied Cyberinfrastructure Concepts’ a project-based learning course (ISTA 420/520) at the University of Arizona focused on developing scalable models of ‘Effective Energy and Mass Transfer’ (EEMT, MJ m-2 yr-1) for use by the NSF Critical Zone Observatories (CZO) project. EEMT is a quantitative measure of the flux of available energy to the critical zone, and its computation involves inputs that have broad applicability (e.g. solar insolation). The course comprised of 25 students with varying level of computational skills and with no prior domain background in the geosciences, collaborated with domain experts to develop the scalable workflow. The original workflow relying on open-source QGIS platform on a laptop was scaled to effectively utilize cloud environments (Openstack), UA Campus HPC systems, iRODS, and other XSEDE and OSG resources. The project utilizes public data, e.g. DEMs produced by OpenTopography.org and climate data from Daymet, which are processed using GDAL, GRASS and SAGA and the Makeflow and Work-queue task management software packages. Students were placed into collaborative groups to develop the separate aspects of the project. They were allowed to change teams, alter workflows, and design and develop novel code. The students were able to identify all necessary dependencies, recompile source onto the target execution platforms, and demonstrate a functional workflow, which was further improved upon by one of the group leaders over Spring 2015. All of the code, documentation and workflow description are currently available on GitHub and a public data portal is in development. We present a case study of how students reacted to the challenge of a real science problem, their interactions with end-users, what went right, and what could be done better in the future.",

            "abstract": "The reactivation of Montserrat’s South Soufrière-Soufrière Hills volcanic complex has impelled the creation of tephrochronologic records in the Lesser Antilles Arc in order to assess volcanic hazards to human safety. Developing an eruptive history of Montserrat by recording tephra layers preserved in marine sediment is hindered by the lack of a rapid, non-destructive method for detecting cryptotephra, tephra deposits invisible to the naked eye, in marine cores. Identifying cryptotephra is important because some cryptotephra layers represent primary tephra emplacement from small proximal eruptions, events that if excluded from a volcanic record could mischaracterize a volcano’s eruptive frequency over time.\nVSWIR [0.4-2.5 μm] reflectance spectroscopy is a candidate for rapid, non-destructive cryptotephra detection in marine sediment cores because it can detect tephra in hemipelagic sediment using summary parameters sensitive to iron content and clay minerals (McCanta et al. 2014, AGU abstract OS53D-1086). Spectra from marine cores U1396C-1H-1A through U1396C-1H-5A, collected during International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) mission 340, reveal 29 potential cryptotephra layers (McCanta et al. 2014, AGU abstract OS53D-1086). This study seeks to determine the effectiveness of reflectance spectroscopy at identifying cryptotephra by measuring the abundance of volcanic materials (i.e., glass shards/vesicular pumice and non-vesicular lava clasts) in these layers ( LeFriant et al. 2008; Cassidy et al. 2014).\nComponent analysis was conducted on select core intervals with both cryptotephra-identifying peaks in reflectance parameters, and tephra-indicative peaks in core scanning XRF and magnetic susceptibility parameters (McCanta et al. 2014, AGU abstract OS53D-1086). Samples in this subset show abundances of non-vesicular lava and vesicular pumice clasts above expected background abundances, supporting the existence of cryptotephra at these locations (Fig. 1; LeFriant et al. 2008; Cassidy et al. 2014). This suggests that reflectance spectroscopy is an effective means of identifying cryptotephra in situ, and when employed in concert with other core scanning techniques could facilitate widespread rapid identification of cryptotephra in future tephrochronology studies.",

Although the thermosphere is dominated by neutral wind processes and the ionosphere is governed by plasma electrodynamics, we can compare the LCS in the two modeled flow fields to yield insight into transport and interaction processes in the high-latitude IT system.\nFor obtaining thermospheric LCS, we use the Horizontal Wind Model 2014 (HWM14) [1] at a single altitude to generate the two-dimensional velocity field.

Software is needed to investigate specific CEC sites to simulate power generation and hydrodynamic responses of a flow through a CEC turbine array.

The data thus far have supported two seemingly opposing models for the injection acceleration region: (1) a large-scale, near-Earth (~8-9 RE) region that explosively forms perhaps as a result of current disruption and global dipolarization, which then propagates both earthward and tailward; (2) multiple, localized, transient acceleration episodes that propagate earthward with the dipolarizing flux bundle at fast speeds (~400 km/s) after reconnection, resulting in flux pile-up near Earth with effects then progressing downtail. Our work utilizes both in-situ data as well as ground-based riometers to explore whether the injection region results from a global phenomenon, such as disruption in the cross-tail current leading to global dipolarization, or localized, earthward-traveling dipolarizing flux bundles and fast flows—or possibly both.",

            "abstract": "Space weather generally refers to heliophysical phenomena or events that produce a negative impact on manmade systems. While many space weather events originate with impulsive disturbances on the sun, others result from complex internal interactions in the ionosphere-thermosphere system. The reliance of mankind on satellite-based services continues to increase rapidly, yet the global capacity for sensing space weather in the ionosphere seems headed towards decline. A number of recent ionospheric-focused space-based missions are either presently, or soon-to-be, no longer available, and the end of the multi-decade Defense Meteorological Satellite Program is now in sight. The challenge facing the space weather community is how to maintain or increase sensing capabilities in an operational environment constrained by a decreasing numbers of sensors. The upcoming launch of COSMIC-2 in 2016/2018 represents the most significant new capability planned for the future. GNSS RO data has some benefit for background ionospheric models, particularly over regions where ground-based GNSS TEC measurements are unavailable, but the space weather community has a dire need to leverage such missions for far more knowledge of the ionosphere, and specifically for information related to space weather impacts. Meanwhile, the number of ground-based GNSS sensors worldwide has increased substantially, yet progress instrumenting some vastly undersampled regions, such as Africa, remains slow. In fact, the recent loss of support for many existing ground stations in such areas under the former Scintillation Network Decision Aid (SCINDA) program may actually result in a decrease in such sensing sites over the next 1-2 years, abruptly reversing a positive trend established over the last decade. Here we present potential solutions to the challenges these developments pose to the space weather enterprise. Specific topics include modeling advances required to detect and accurately characterize irregularities and associated scintillations from GNSS RO measurements, the exploitation of existing/planned radio beacons for improved bottomside definition and scintillations, and an affordable approach to leverage existing ground stations to expand sensing capacity at critical locations in otherwise data-sparse regions.",

            "abstract": "Our group has made several efforts to develop the systematics for processing multiple satellite mission inland altimetry data with the purpose of creating a pre-SWOT climate data record of world’s rivers greater than 900m in width. The project is a component of a NASA MEaSUREs (Making Earth System Data Records for Use in Research Environments) project undertaken by UCLA, Princeton U., NASA/GSFC and Ohio State Univ. The first method developed allows for the identification of measurements that represent the target river through height filtering and is based on USGS flow data from 105 gauges on rivers with watersheds over 20,000 km2. Proximal topographic variations led to some contamination of the radar returns. We were able to identify them using the previously mentioned height filter, and correlated their frequency with near-river topographic indices. Significant efforts have also been made to detect river ice using only radar backscatter. Over 631 Landsat images were processed and given an ice cover designation then compared with measured backscatter profiles; demonstrating that isolating a one- to-one relationship between ice and backscatter will be challenging. An additional focus of the group has been automation of detecting altimeter/river intersections as well as the creation of “virtual stations” or masks for data extraction at those locations. Using RivWidth parameters to generate polygons and a raster proximity based intersection detection methods have both shown promising results for automation of this process. This project will soon be producing validated climate data records in the form of geocentric river height changes, both in terms of scale of the study area and access to previously unmonitored regions. Once established, these methods will also be applicable to the study of future satellite cycles. Preliminary river height change data products have been produced for the Mississippi, St Lawrence, Yukon, Mackenzie, and part of the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghan Rivers. We have found that 43.9% of virtual stations in North America produce viable altimetry river height time series with at least 50% of cycles represented.",

            "abstract": "Unusually heavy rainfall occurred over the Colorado Front Range during the second week of September 2013, with record or near-record totals recorded in several locations. It was associated predominantly with a stationary large-scale weather pattern (akin to the North American Monsoon, which occurs earlier in the year) that drove a strong plume of deep moisture inland from the Gulf of Mexico and eastern tropical Pacific towards the Front Range foothills. The resulting floods across the South Platte River basin impacted several thousands of people and many homes, roads, and businesses. A recent study using observational-based re-analysis to drive the regional WRF model finds that, given very little change in the large-scale weather pattern, there is an increase in atmospheric water vapour over northeast Colorado under anthropogenic climate warming, with a positive dynamical feedback drawing in moisture from further afield. This leads to a substantial increase in the magnitude and odds of heavy rainfall occurring over northeast Colorado during the rainy week of September 2013. Here we develop this work by including a hydrological modelling component in order to investigate any anthropogenic influence on the actual flood magnitude and occurrence across the South Platte basin during that time. We use WRF precipitation output from the aforementioned study – in both anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic configurations for September 2013 – to drive the recently developed high-resolution WRF-Hydro model over the basin and generate river runoff. Thus by comparing changes in runoff under the anthropogenic / non-anthropogenic driving conditions we assess any influence on the magnitude and odds of flood occurrence. Integral to this, we test the sensitivity of our results to hydrological parameters, such as infiltration, base flow, and land use/cover.",

These characteristics make these aquifers highly productive, and vulnerable to contamination. Previous studies in the northern karst aquifers of Puerto Rico have shown significant distribution of contaminants, including volatile organic compounds, phthalates and other contaminants of emerging concern, beyond demarked sources of contamination. This study develops spatial-temporal distributions of phthalate contaminants in the karst system of northern Puerto Rico and assesses statistical correlations between hydrogeologic factors and groundwater contamination with phthalates. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) tools and technologies, and statistical models are applied to attain these objectives. Results show that there is an extensive contamination with phthalates that varies with time. Contamination is present in the confined and shallow aquifers. Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is the most detected contaminant (20.6% of the sites). Diethyl phthalate and and dibutyl phthalate are also detected in 6.7% and 8.24% of the sites, respectively. Phthalates detected as mixtures components are significantly detected in areas of high urban and industrial development. They are also detected in areas within 5 miles of superfund sites and landfills. The results indicate that phthalate contamination is highly related to land use. Statistical models show that the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifers, sinkholes density, and time are significantly related to the presence of phthalates in groundwater. The extensive spatio-temporal contamination suggests that contaminants can persist in the environment for long periods of time, and that land use and hydrogeological factors are important factors contributing to the presence of emerging contaminants in karst systems.",

            "abstract": "Wetland restoration has been proposed as a potential long-term carbon storage solution, with a goal of engineering geochemical dynamics to accelerate peat accretion and encourage greenhouse gas (GHG) sequestration. However, wetland microbial community composition and metabolic rates are poorly understood and their predicted response to wetland restoration is a veritable unknown. In an effort to better understand the underlying factors that shape the balance of carbon flux in wetland soils, we targeted the microbial communities along a salinity gradient ranging from freshwater tidal marshes to hypersaline ponds in the San Francisco Bay-Delta region. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomics, coupled with greenhouse gas measurements, we sampled sixteen sites capturing a range in salinity and restoration status. Seawater delivers sulfate to wetland ecosystems, encouraging sulfate reduction and discouraging methane production. As expected, we observed the highest rates of methane production in the freshwater wetlands. Recently restored wetlands had significantly higher rates of methane production compared to their historic counterparts that could be attributed to variations in trace metal and organic carbon content in younger wetlands. In contrast, our sequencing results revealed an almost immediate return of the indigenous microbial communities following seasonal flooding and full tidal restoration in saline and hypersaline wetlands and managed ponds. Notably, we found elevated methane production rates in hypersaline ponds, the result of methylotrophic methane production confirmed by sequence data and lab incubations. Our study links belowground microbial communities and their aboveground greenhouse gas production and highlights the inherent complexity in predicting wetland microbial response in the face of both natural and unnatural disturbances.",

In the first ten years of USArray, geophysical instruments were deployed across roughly 2% of the Earth’s surface. The USArray operated a rolling deployment of seismic stations that occupied ~1,700 sites across the USA, made co-located atmospheric observations, occupied hundreds of sites with magnetotelluric sensors, expanded a backbone reference network of seismic stations, and provided instruments to PI-led teams that deployed thousands of additional seismic stations. USArray included a comprehensive outreach component that directly engaged hundreds of students at over 50 colleges and universities to locate station sites and provided Earth science exposure to roughly 1,000 landowners who hosted stations. The project also included a comprehensive data management capability that received, archived and distributed data, metadata, and data products; data were acquired and distributed in real time.\nThe USArray project was completed on time and under budget and developed a number of best practices that can inform other large-scale science initiatives that the Earth science community is contemplating. Key strategies employed by USArray included: using a survey, rather than hypothesis-driven, mode of observation to generate comprehensive, high quality data on a large-scale for exploration and discovery; making data freely and openly available to any investigator from the very onset of the project; and using proven, commercial, off-the-shelf systems to ensure a fast start and avoid delays due to over-reliance on unproven technology or concepts. Scope was set ambitiously, but managed carefully to avoid overextending. Configuration was controlled to ensure efficient operations while providing consistent, uniform observations. Finally, community governance structures were put in place to ensure a focus on science needs and goals, to provide an informed review of the project’s results, and to carefully balance consistency of observations with technical evolution. We will summarize lessons learned from USArray and how these can be applied to future efforts such as SZO.",

One of the possibilities being considered, storing super-critical CO2 in underground reservoirs, has drawn more attention and pilot projects are being supported worldwide. Monitoring of the post-injection fate of CO2 is of utmost importance. Generally, monitoring options are active methods, such as 4D seismic reflection or pressure measurements in monitoring wells. We propose here to develop a 4-D density tomography of subsurface CO2 reservoirs using cosmic-ray muon detectors deployed in a borehole. Muon detection is a relatively mature field of particle physics and there are many muon detector designs, though most are quite large and not designed for subsurface measurements. The primary technical challenge preventing deployment of this technology in the subsurface is the lack of miniaturized muon-tracking detectors capable of fitting in standard boreholes and that will resist the harsh underground conditions. A detector with these capabilities is being developed by a collaboration supported by the U.S. Department of Energy. Current simulations based on a Monte Carlo modeling code predict that the incoming muon angle can be resolved with an error of approximately two degrees, using either underground or sea level spectra. The robustness of the design comes primarily from the use of scintillating rods as opposed to drift tubes. The rods are arrayed in alternating layers to provide a coordinate scheme. Preliminary testing and measurements are currently being performed to test and enhance the performance of the scintillating rods, in both a laboratory and a shallow underground facility. The simulation predictions and data from the experiments will be presented.",

The images provided from visible and thermal infrared satellite observations are widely used in physical, biological, and ecological oceanography. The present work proposes a method to understand the multi-scaling properties of satellite products such as the Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), and the Sea Surface Temperature (SST). The specific objectives of this study are to show how the small scale heterogeneities of satellite images can be characterised using tools borrowed from the fields of turbulence. We show how the structure function, which is classically used in the frame of scaling time series analysis, can be used also in 2D. The main advantage of this method is that it can be applied to process images which have missing data. Based on both simulated and real images, we demonstrate that coarse-graining (CG) of a gradient modulus transform of the original image does not provide correct scaling exponents. We show, using a fractional Brownian simulation in 2D, that the structure function (SF) can be used with randomly sampled couple of points, and verify that 1 million of couple of points provides enough statistics.\nAfter this methodological study, some applications are presented: the nonlinear moment function ζ(q) is fitted using the lognormal model with 2 parameters, the Hurst index H and the intermittency μ. The values of H and μ are discussed for 4 different parameters (Chl-a, SST, Rrs-443 and Rrs-555) and for different locations, chosen among different contrasted regions of the ocean, characterized by high spatial heterogeneity in Chl-a and SST.",

            "abstract": "Titanite, an important accessory mineral in plutonic rocks, is commonly interpreted as crystallizing early owing to euhedral habit and large size (up to 1 cm across), but this form can also result from temperature cycling. We performed experiments in the synthetic system titanite-albite (ttn-ab) to observe how ttn growth responds to thermal cycling. Thermal cycling causes crystal coarsening through precipitation-dissolution where crystals with larger surface areas outlive smaller or newly nucleated crystals during up-temperature cycle segments.\nExperiments were carried out using a 1-atmosphere furnace at a mean temperature of 1280°C, 30°C below the experimentally determined liquidus for bulk composition ttn50ab50. Temperature cycles were pseudo-sinusoidal, with amplitudes up to 20°C, a 24-minute period, and run times up to 100 hours. Heterogeneous nucleation on starting material oxides and carbonates occurred in all experiments. Median sizes of the largest 50 crystals show that growth rates increase from 2.7 μm2hr-1 to 15.3 μm2hr-1 from static to high amplitude. Static runs generated crystal number densities of ~8000 mm-2, whereas large-amplitude runs were ~400 mm-2. 20°C amplitude at ~70 hours run time created the largest crystal size of 4610 μm2.\nGrowth rate is a strong function of cycle amplitude. Crystals grown during cycling conditions are more euhedral and significantly larger than those grown under static run conditions. Cycled runs compared to static show reduced crystal number densities by one order of magnitude and growth rates increased by a factor of 5. Thermal cycling coarsens crystal populations and is an important process to consider when interpreting plutonic rock textures.",

            "abstract": "The fracture and failure of Europa’s icy shell are not only observable scars of variable stress and activity throughout its evolution, they also serve key as mechanisms in the interaction of surface and subsurface material, and thus crucial aspects of the study of crustal overturn and ice shell habitability. Galileo images, our best and only reasonable-resolution views of Europa until the Europa Multiple Flyby Mission arrives in the coming decades, illustrates a single snapshot in time in Europa’s history from which we deduce many temporally-based hypotheses. One of those hypotheses, which we investigate here, is that sub-surface water–both in the form of Great Lake-sized perched water pockets in the near-surface and the larger global ocean below–drives the deformation, fracture, and failure of the surface. Using Galileo’s snapshot in time, we use a 2D/3D hydraulic fracturing model to investigate the propagation of vertical fractures upward into the ice shell, motion of water within and between fractures, and the subsequent break-up of ice over shallow water, forming the chaos regions and other smaller surface features. We will present results from a cohesive fragmentation model to determine the time over which chaos formation occurs, and use a fracking model to determine the time interval required to allow water to escape from basal fractures in the ice shell. In determining the style, energy, and timescale of these processes, we constrain temporal variability in observable activity and topography at the surface. Finally, we compare these results to similar settings on Earth–Antarctica–where we have much higher resolution imagery and observations to better understand how sub-surface water can affect ice surface morphology, which most certainly have implications for future flyby and surface lander exploration.",

The relative importance of these two forces remains unknown but may have important and long-term biophysical effects that are not adequately incorporated into current modeling efforts. Humans have altered the landscape of the Eastern U.S. both historically through deforestation during European settlement and more recently through climatic reductions in snow cover. Here we empirically reconstruct historic albedo in the Eastern U.S. using both modern and historic data. We focus on the Western Great Lakes region (MI, WI, MN, IL, IN), a global hotspot of historic deforestation that spans latitudes where anthropogenic climate modifications have produced important changes in snow cover. We find that vegetation changes have caused an overall increase in regional albedo that is strongest where intensive land use persists (i.e. agriculture) and weakest where forest regrowth has occurred. Changes in snow cover have caused an overall decrease in regional albedo that is about half as strong as increase in albedo due to vegetation change. Although the negative forcings of historic land use change may currently provide a radiative ‘discount’ on regional warming, these benefits are likely to disappear with time as snow cover decreases and forest regrowth continues.",

The effectiveness of these efforts relies not only on scientists and policymakers, but on individuals and their risk perception and preparedness levels. This study examines the individual knowledge, perception, and preparedness of over 500 survey respondents living or working within the lahar zones of Mount Baker and Glacier Peak volcanoes. We (1) explore the common disconnect between accurate risk perception and adequate preparedness; (2) determine how participation in hazard response planning influences knowledge, risk perception, and preparedness; and (3) assess the effectiveness of current lahar hazard maps for public risk communication. Results indicate that a disconnect exists between perception and preparedness for the majority of respondents. While 82% of respondents accurately anticipate that future volcanic hazards will impact the Skagit Valley, this knowledge fails to motivate increased preparedness. A majority of respondents also feel “very responsible” for their own protection and provision of resources during a hazardous event (83%) and believe they have the knowledge and skills necessary to respond effectively to such an event (56%); however, many of these individuals still do not adequately prepare. When asked what barriers prevent them from preparing, respondents primarily cite a lack of knowledge about relevant local hazards. Results show that participation in response-related activities—a commonly recommended solution to this disconnect—minimally influences preparedness. Additionally, although local hazard maps successfully communicate the primary hazard—97% of respondents recognize the lahar hazard—many individuals incorrectly interpret other important facets of the maps. Those who participate in response-related activities fail to understand these maps better than the general public. This study’s findings will be provided to emergency managers to assist in the development of educational programs and response plans.",

In this study, Remote Sensing (RS) derived Evapotranspiration (ET) is used to improve the spatially distributed processes of ET of SWAT model application in the upper Mara basin (Kenya) and the Blue Nile basin (Ethiopia). The RS derived ET data is obtained from recently compiled global datasets (continuously monthly data at 1 km resolution from MOD16NBI,SSEBop,ALEXI,CMRSET models) and from regionally applied Energy Balance Models (for several cloud free days). The RS-RT data is used in different forms:\nMethod 1) to evaluate spatially distributed evapotransiration model results\nMethod 2) to calibrate the evotranspiration processes in hydrological model\nMethod 3) to bias-correct the evapotranpiration in hydrological model during simulation after changing the SWAT codes\nAn inter-comparison of the RS-ET products shows that at present there is a significant bias, but at the same time an agreement on the spatial variability of ET. The ensemble mean of different ET products seems the most realistic estimation and was further used in this study.\nThe results show that:\nMethod 1) the spatially mapped evapotranspiration of hydrological models shows clear differences when compared to RS derived evapotranspiration (low correlations). Especially evapotranspiration in forested areas is strongly underestimated compared to other land covers.\nMethod 2) Calibration allows to improve the correlations between the RS and hydrological model results to some extent.\nMethod 3) Bias-corrections are efficient in producing (sesonal or annual) evapotranspiration maps from hydrological models which are very similar to the patterns obtained from RS data.\nThough the bias-correction is very efficient, it is advised to improve the model results by better representing the ET processes by improved plant/crop computations, improved agricultural management practices or by providing improved meteorological data.",

            "abstract": "Despite the wealth of observations of spatio-temporal changes in ice elevation, or ice velocity, it is extremely challenging for ice sheet models to reproduce these observed contemporary changes. However, if ice sheet models could replicate the observed thinning/thickening, it would increase confidence in their capability of projecting ice sheet evolution, hence future sea level. The challenge therefore becomes how to obtain a set of contemporary forcing that can be applied to ice sheet models and result in ice evolution that reproduces the observed behavior. Three type of forcing need to be estimated: i) the surface mass balance and temperature, ii) the change in basal lubrication due to surface runoff reaching the base of the ice sheet and iii) the oceanic forcing. Nonetheless, the SeaRISE effort (Sea level Response to Ice Sheet Evolution) has demonstrated that ice sheet models have a characteristic and distinct thickness response, or thickness fingerprint, depending on the type of forcing. In addition, the linear combination of the thickness fingerprint resulting from distinct forcing (for example, atmospheric and oceanic) closely resembles the thickness fingerprint resulting from multiple forcing applied simultaneously. We use this fingerprint technique along with the NASA GEOS-5 climate and ISSM ice sheet models to seek a set of forcing that may be used to reproduce contemporary Greenland Ice Sheet change.",

However, the data and computational requirements to operate at relevant process scales still represent significant challenges, especially in the context of regional and global modeling. Here we investigate a space-time strategy which enables subsurface runoff routing processes to be upscaled to coarser model scales while maintaining event hydrograph peak discharge and timing characteristics. A case study in the Ohio River Basin (roughly 500,000 km2) is presented using a synthetic 1 cm 30 days runoff experiment. The method combines statistical and physically-based Hillslope River Routing (HRR) modeling techniques. Cumulative Probability Distributions (CDFs) for subsurface flowpath travel times based on 90-m topographic data and conceptualized model units representing individual catchments in the (HRR) model are equated by adjusting hydraulic conductivity along HRR hillslopes. Based on the 90-m digital elevation model (DEM) data, The CDF travel time for individual catchments are approximated by the beta distribution to reduce processing time for large watersheds. Nine model scales are investigated: 1, 3.2, 10, 32, 100, 320, 1000, 3200 and 10000 km2, where model scale represents the threshold areas used to define the underlying river network and catchment boundaries. In this study, the reference scale is set to 1 km2. A correction coefficient is applied to the whole basin to overcome limitations associated with catchment shape and discretization assumptions in the HRR model. Simulated hydrographs at the outlet of the Ohio River Basin for the eight coarser model scales have peak discharge and time-to-peak discharge values that are nearly identical to the reference scale model.",

Radiosonde data are essential inputs for numerical weather prediction models and are used for climate research, particularly in the creation of reanalysis products. However, radiosonde programs are costly to maintain, in particular in the remote regions of the Arctic (e.g., $440,000/yr at Summit, Greenland), where only 40 of approximately 1000 routine global launches are made. The climate of this data-sparse region is poorly understood and forecast data assimilation procedures are designed for global applications. Thus, observations may be rejected from the data assimilation because they are too far from the model expectations. For the most cost-efficient deployment of resources and to improve forecasting methods, analyses of the effectiveness of individual radiosonde programs are necessary. Here, we evaluate how radiosondes launched twice daily (0 and 12 UTC) from Summit Station, Greenland, (72.58⁰N, 38.48⁰W, 3210 masl) influence the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) operational forecasts from June 2013 through May of 2015. A statistical analysis is conducted to determine the impact of the observations on the forecast model and the meteorological regimes that the model fails to reproduce are identified. Assimilation rates in the inversion layer are lower than any other part of the troposphere. Above the inversion, assimilation rates range from 85%-100%, 60%-98%, and > 99% for temperature, humidity, and wind, respectively. The lowest assimilation rates are found near the surface, possibly associated with biases in the representation of the temperature inversion by the ECMWF model at Summit. Consequently, assimilation rates are lower near the surface during winter when strong temperature inversions are frequently observed. Our findings benefit the scientific community who uses this information for climatological analysis of the Greenland Ice Sheet, and thus further analysis is warranted.",

The first-row transition metals Sc and V represent one such pair, with generally similar mass, radius, and ionization energies up to the trivalent redox state. However, as a d3 transition metal, Sc is limited to a maximum oxidation state of 3+, while d5 vanadium may be further oxidized to form tetravalent and pentavalent ions. Due to the greater incompatibility of pentavalent (relative to trivalent) metal cations in silicate melts, V/Sc ratio has been applied to the silicate rock record as a tracer of magma redox – indicating roughly constant mantle oxygen fugacity over Earth history1,2. As a result, the solid earth represents a boundary condition with constant V/Sc observed over geologic time1. However, oxidation state also affects the weathering, solubility, and coordination behaviour of V and Sc, resulting in a potential redox signal in the sedimentary V/Sc record.\nWe apply the weighted bootstrap resampling approach of [2] to a geochemical dataset of ~87,000 sedimentary whole-rock analyses from the EarthChem portal3. The resulting trends reveal a 4 Gyr record of V/Sc redox chemistry, with the great oxidation event represented as an upward step ca. 2.5 Ga, and Phanerozoic variation suggestive of low oxygen in the early Paleozoic, increasing to twin maxima circa 270 Ma and 130 Ma, remarkably similar to that predicted by the COPSE model4, and broadly congruent with the Phanerozoic biochar record5.\nLi, Z.-X.

However, due to this ecosystem complex dynamics, our understanding about the mechanisms controlling net ecosystem exchange is limited. In this study, five years of continue water and carbon fluxes measurements from eddy covariance complemented with remotely sensed vegetation greenness were used to investigate the ecosystem carbon balance of a TDF in the North American Monsoon region under different hydro climatic conditions. We identified a large CO2 efflux at the start of the summer season that is strongly related to the preceding winter precipitation and greenness. Since this CO2 efflux occurs prior to vegetation green-up, we infer a predominant heterotrophic control owed to high decomposition of accumulated labile soil organic matter from prior growing season. Overall, ecosystem respiration has an important effect on the net ecosystem production over the year, but can be overwhelmed by the strength of the primary productivity during the monsoon season. Precipitation characteristics during the monsoon have significant controls on sustaining carbon fixation in the TDF ecosystem into the fall season. A threshold of ~350 to 400 mm of summer precipitation was identify to switch the annual carbon balance in the TDF ecosystem from a net source (+102 g C/m2/yr) to a net sink (-249 g C/m2/yr). This research points at the needs for understanding the potential effects of changing seasonal precipitation patterns on ecosystem dynamics and carbon sequestration in subtropical regions.",

Thus, it is possible to derive some information about the vector field from line-of-sight data in round sunspots, assuming that average properties of vector magnetic field in these sunspots depend mostly on distance from center of sunspot. Under this assumption, one can reconstruct vertical, radial, and tangential components of vector magnetic field using azimuthal averaging.

Using the classification of periods as Canonical or Modoki ENSO proposed by Tedeschi et al.

The observations show that for the precipitation in Colombia, ENSO Modoki effects are different from Canonical ENSO effects, producing in general opposite climatic conditions between ENC and ENM, as well as between LNC and LNM. In other regions, the ENSO Modoki produces anomalies with the same sign that ENC, but with lower intensity.\nR. G. Tedeschi, I. F. Cavalcanti, and A. M. Grimm.

We adapt the “pseudo-global warming” (PGW) methodology employed by Lackmann (2013, 2015) and others, who have investigated flooding and tropical cyclone events under climate change. Here, we exploit coupled atmosphere-ocean GCM data contributed to the CMIP5 archive, and take the mean 3D atmospheric state simulated during May 1990-1999 and subtract it from that simulated during May 2090-2099. Such 3D changes in temperature, humidity, geopotential height, and winds are added to synoptic/meso-scale analyses (NAM-ANL) of specific events, and this modified atmospheric state is then used for initial and boundary conditions for real-data WRF model simulations of the events at high resolution. Comparison of an ensemble of these simulations with control (CTRL) simulations facilitates assessment of PGW effects.\nIn contrast to the robust development of supercellular convection in our CTRL simulations, the combined effects of increased CIN and decreased forcing under PGW led to a failure of convection initiation in many of our ensemble members. Those members that had sufficient matching between the CIN and forcing tended to generate stronger convective updrafts than in the CTRL simulations, because of the relatively higher CAPE under PGW. And, the members with enhanced updrafts also tended to have enhanced vertical rotation. In fact, such mesocyclonic rotation and attendant supercellular morphology were even found in simulations that were driven with PGW-reduced environmental wind shear.",

Regionally, Miocene volcanic rocks are concentrated along an elongate path roughly parallel to the Arabian suture zone. They are often geographically isolated and form large, broad edifices above the surrounding Anatolian Plateau. In some instances, Miocene volcanic rocks are intercalated with terrestrial basin sediments. It has been proposed that the initiation of this volcanism represents the onset of the major shift in the regional tectonic framework, and geochemical changes exhibited by these lavas could record the evolution of magma sources.\nIn order to constrain the regional initiation and evolution of syn- to post-collisional volcanism, and the mantle melting sources responsible for them, mafic samples were collected from Miocene volcanic fields between Malatya and Konya, Turkey, an area representing ~50,000 km2. New 40Ar/39Ar geochronology data and geochemical data, coupled with stratigraphic relations and limited existing data for this region, show that mafic magmatism began in early Miocene time (~20 Ma) and continued through Pliocene time throughout east-central Anatolia. Our results will be interpreted with the overall context of understanding how the timing and geochemistry of Miocene volcanism relates to the transition between collision and escape tectonics.",

The latter accounts for the unexplained variability in the ground motion data used to calibrate the GMPE and is typically 0.5-0.7 in natural log units. Reducing this residual or “aleatory” variability is a high priority for seismic hazard analysis, because the probabilities of exceedance at high Y values go up rapidly with σT. adding costs to the seismic design of critical facilities to account for the prediction uncertainty. However, attempts to decrease σT by incorporating more explanatory variables to the GMPEs have been largely unsuccessful (e.g., Strasser et al., SRL, 2009). An alternative is to employ physics-based earthquake simulations that properly account for source directivity, basin effects, directivity-basin coupling, and other 3D complexities. We have explored the theoretical limits of this approach through an analysis of large (> 108) ensembles of 3D synthetic seismograms generated for the Los Angeles region by SCEC’s CyberShake project using the new tool of averaging-based factorization (ABF, Wang & Jordan, BSSA, 2014). The residual variance obtained by applying GMPEs to the CyberShake dataset matches the frequency-dependence of σT obtained for the GMPE calibration dataset. The ABF analysis allows us to partition this variance into uncorrelated components representing source, path, and site effects. We show that simulations can potentially reduce σT by about one-third, which could lower the exceedance probabilities for high hazard levels at fixed x by orders of magnitude. Realizing this gain in forecasting probability would have a broad impact on risk-reduction strategies, especially for critical facilities such as large dams, nuclear power plants, and energy transportation networks.",

            "abstract": "Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the land use sector constitute the largest source category for many countries in Africa. Enhancing C sequestration and reducing GHG emissions on managed lands in Africa has to potential to attract C financing to support adoption of more sustainable land management practices that, in addition to GHG mitigation, can provide co-benefits of more productive and climate-resilient agroecosystems. However, robust systems to measure and monitor C sequestration/GHG reductions are currently a significant barrier to attracting more C financing to land use-related mitigation efforts.\nAnthropogenic GHG emissions are driven by a variety of environmental factors, including climate and soil attributes, as well as human-activities in the form of land use and management practices. GHG emission inventories typically use empirical or process-based models of emission rates that are driven by environmental and management variables. While a lack of field-based flux and C stock measurements are a limiting factor for GHG estimation, we argue that an even greater limitation may be availabiity of data on the management activities that influence flux rates, particularly in developing countries in Africa.\nIn most developed countries there is a well-developed infrastructure of agricultural statistics and practice surveys that can be used to drive model-based GHG emission estimations. However, this infrastructure is largely lacking in developing countries in Africa. While some activity data (e.g. land cover change) can be derived from remote sensing, many key data (e.g., N fertilizer practices, residue management, manuring) require input from the farmers themselves. The explosive growth in cellular technology, even in many of the poorest parts of Africa, suggests the potential for a new crowd-sourcing approach and direct engagement with farmers to ‘leap-frog’ the land resource information model of developed countries. Among the many benefits of this approach would be high resolution management data to support GHG inventories at multiple scales. We present an overall conceptual model for this approach and examples from on-going projects in Africa employing direct farmer engagement, cellular technology and apps to develop this information resource.",

High-fidelity predictive capabilities of flood inundation risk requires hydrologic and hydrodynamic modeling at hyper-resolution (<100 m) scales. Using spatiotemporal data from climate models as the driver, we couple a continental scale river routing model known as Routing Application for Parallel ComputatIon of Discharge (RAPID) with a regional scale flood delineation model called AutoRoute to estimate flood extents. We demonstrate how the coupled tool, referred to as AutoRAPID, can quickly and efficiently simulate flood extents using a high resolution dataset (~10 m) at the regional scale (> 100,000 km2). The AutoRAPID framework is implemented over 230,000 km2 in the Midwestern United States (between latitude 38°N and 44°N, and longitude 86°W to 91°W, approximately 8% of the Mississippi River Basin) using a 10 m DEM. We generate the flood inundation map over the entire area for a June 2008 flood event. The model is compared with observed data at five select locations: Spencer, IN; Newberry, IN; Gays Mills, WI; Ft. Atkinson, WI, and Janesville, WI. We show that the model results are generally satisfactory with observed flow and flood inundation data and suggest that the AutoRAPID model can be considered for several potential applications, such as: forecast flow and flood inundation information; generating flood recurrence maps using high resolution vector river data; and for emergency management applications to protect/evacuate large areas when time is limited and data are sparse.",

Precipitation over the Arctic Ocean is projected to increase thorough the twenty-first century, in part linked to AA and SIE decline [Kattsov et al., 2007; Bintanja and Selten, 2014]. Since mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) is a key element in sea level rise through the end of this century, it is important to understand how precipitation may change in the future and impact the GrIS mass balance. As the first step, we need to better understand how current ice loss may be impacting precipitation over the ice sheet. Towards this end, monthly precipitation data from the Arctic System Reanalysis (ASR) is compared with gauge observations over Greenland. ASR is a high-resolution regional assimilation of model output developed as a resource for the detection and diagnosis of change in the coupled Arctic climate system [Bromwich et al., 2015]. In order to explore linkages between precipitation over Greenland and the surrounding SIE, ASR forecast precipitation data and SIE data from the NASA Team Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer and Special Sensor Microwave/Imager data set [Cavalieri et al., 1999] are statistically analyzed from 2000 to 2012. As a case study, spatial distributions of precipitation and pressure at the surface and in the middle troposphere over the Arctic are analyzed during the great Arctic cyclone of August 2012 [Simmonds and Rudeva, 2012; Parkinson and Comiso, 2013; Zhang et al., 2013].",

In almost all situations, it is difficult to hold even one of these factors constant while focusing on another factor; however, in our study site—the East and West side of a narrow North-South running ridge, above timberline in SE Wyoming—we can hold three factors nearly constant (time, parent material, and climate) and focus on how topography, in particular, has influenced the soil differences on the two sides. The East side is the leeside of prevailing and strong westerly winds and receives a large snow pack while the West is consistently snow-free during winter creating a very different moisture and soil temperature regime. The East receives aeolian dust deposition while the West loses surface material from wind scour. A standard chemical and physical analysis found that while the two sides are nearly identical textually, with a similar pH and low electrical conductivity, the East side is richer in minerals. During the short growing season, soil moisture results show that the West side is holding more water than the East side; however, the East side has a higher percentage of organic matter and is more shrub and forb rich. An isotope analysis shows that the C:N ratios are very similar on the two sides. Microbial biomass and functional groups will be analyzed in the soil samples as well as a seismic study conducted to quantity depth of soil to bedrock. Using all these results will help quantify the differences on the two sides of this narrow ridge and add to our understanding of fine-scale soil heterogeneity and its relationship to watershed hydrology.",

This approach involves pumping contaminated groundwater to the surface for treatment. The treated water is often re-injected into the groundwater aquifer system to create a pressure ridge so that the pore-volume exchange rates can be increased. The water treatment system is to reduce the dissolved-phase contaminant concentrations sufficiently (herein referred to as “full treatment”) so that the groundwater complies with the cleanup standards or the treated water can be put back to beneficial use. However, in many cases multiple contaminants are present in groundwater, and the selected treatment system is not capable of reducing the dissolved-phase concentrations sufficiently for all contaminants (herein referred to as “partial treatment”).\nWhen developing numerical models for pump-treat-injection systems, customarily under a “full treatment” scenario, the post treatment concentration of dissolved-phase contaminants in the injected water is assumed to be zero. However, under “partial treatment” scenarios, contaminant concentrations in the injected water may vary significantly, making the numerical modeling more challenging. This study presents an iterative approach to modeling pump-treat-injection systems under “partial treatment” scenarios in which the injected water concentration is linked to the modeled extracted water concentration. Numerical test runs show that the iterative simulation results converge to a viable final solution.",

Interaction of nTiO2 with soils and sediments will largely influence their fate, transport, and ecotoxicity. Measuring the interaction between nTiO2 and natural substrates (e.g. such as sands) is particularly challenging due to highly heterogeneous and rough natural sand surfaces. In this study, an engineered controllable rough surface known as three dimensional nanostructured sculptured columnar thin films (SCTFs) has been used to mimic surface roughness. SCTFs were fabricated by glancing angle deposition (GLAD), a physical vapor deposition technique facilitated by electron beam evaporation. Interaction between nTiO2 and SCTF coated surfaces was investigated using a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D). In parallel, a Generalized Ellipsometry (GE) was coupled with the QCM-D to measure the deposition of nTiO2. We found that the typical QCM-D modeling approach, e.g. viscoelastic model, would largely overestimate the mass of deposited nTiO2, because the frequency drops due to particle deposition or water entrapment in rough areas were not differentiated. Here, we demonstrate a new approach to model QCM-D data for nTiO2 deposition on rough surfaces, which couples the viscoelastic model with a model of flow on the non-uniform surface.",

Many of the paleosols preserved in this basin contain paleosol carbonate nodules, thick calcretes and abundant organic-rich horizons, which makes it ideally suited for a multiproxy study that explores the role of paleoenvironmental change in driving floral and faunal change. Here we focus on the carbonate samples where we measured carbon and oxygen isotopes (δ13Cc and δ18Oc, respectively); used clumped isotope thermometry (Δ47) to estimate soil temperature and soil water δ18O; and assessed the preservation state and additional paleoenvironmental features of the samples using optical and cathodoluminescence (CL) microscopy.\nThe carbon isotope record matches previous studies from the region and shows an increase in the relative abundance of C4 biomass on the landscape since the late Miocene. The Δ47 temperatures and the δ18O of soil water, while variable, show no significant change in average values through time. The textural and luminescenece characteristics suggest some samples have undergone moderate to extensive diagenetic alteration from groundwater fluids, perhaps causing some of the variability in the geochemical records. Soil depth may also account for some of the variability. Overall, these data suggest that temperature is unlikely to be the dominant factor driving paleovegetation and faunal change in this region from the Miocene to Pleistocene. In addition, these data highlight the importance of assessing preservation for all carbonate samples, regardless of whether or not the samples have been deeply buried.",

The rocks of interest to this study include mafic (amphibolites) and silicic (granitic gneiss) end members. The experiments will systematically add components to capture discrete changes in both water and EBS component chemistries.\nExperiments in the system wall rock-clay-concrete-groundwater will evaluate interactions among components, including: mineral phase stability, metal corrosion rates and thermal limits. Based on engineered barrier studies, experimental investigations will move forward with three focusses. First, evaluation of interaction between “seal” materials and repository wall rock (crystalline) under fluid-saturated conditions over long-term (i.e., six-month) experiments; which reproduces the thermal pulse event of a repository. Second, perform experiments to determine the stability of zeolite minerals (analcime-wairakitess) under repository conditions. Both sets of experiments are critically important for understanding mineral paragenesis (zeolites and/or clay transformations) associated with “seals” in contact with wall rock at elevated temperatures. Third, mineral growth at the metal interface is a principal control on the survivability (i.e. corrosion) of waste canisters in a repository.\nThe objective of this planned experimental work is to evaluate physio-chemical processes for ‘seal’ components and materials relevant to deep borehole disposal. These evaluations will encompass multi-laboratory efforts for the development of seals concepts and application of Thermal-Mechanical-Chemical (TMC) modeling work to assess barrier material interactions with subsurface fluids and other barrier materials, their stability at high temperatures, and the implications of these processes to the evaluation of thermal limits.",

Multiple rapid warming events, associated with transient deep sea temperature increases of 2 to 4°C (termed ‘hyperthermals’), potentially related to orbital forcing of the carbon cycle and climate, occurred from the late Paleocene through at least the early middle Eocene and onset of long-term Cenozoic cooling (~47 Ma). While deep ocean circulation patterns associated with the great glaciations of the Plio-Pleistocene have been studied extensively, the behavior of the ocean’s overturning circulation on orbital-timescales in the extreme warmth of the early Cenozoic is largely unknown. Here we present new evidence for changing patterns of ocean overturning in the southern hemisphere associated with four orbitally paced hyperthermal events in the early-middle Eocene (~50 to 48 Ma) based on a combination of multi-site bulk carbonate and benthic foraminiferal stable isotope measurements and Earth system modeling. Our results suggest that southern-sourced overturning weakens and shoals in response to modest atmospheric carbon injections and consequent warming, and is replaced by invasion of nutrient-rich North Atlantic-sourced deep water, leading to predictable spatial patterns in deep-sea carbon isotope records. The changes in abyssal carbon isotope ‘aging’ gradients associated with these hyperthermals are, in fact, two to three times larger than the change in aging gradient associated with the switch in Atlantic overturning between the Last Glacial Maximum and today. Our results suggest that the Atlantic overturning circulation was sensitive to orbital-scale climate variability during Eocene extreme warmth, not just to interglacial-glacial climatic variability of the Plio-Pleistocene.",

Key to predicting recovery of mercury contaminated ecosystems is an understanding of the mobilization of legacy Hg sources, and the subsequent bioavailability and biogeochemical cycling of mobilized Hg within aquatic ecosystems. Herein, we utilize natural abundance stable Hg isotope techniques to place new constraints on mercury sources, transport, and transformations along the flow path of East Fork Poplar Creek (EFPC), Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The isotopic composition of mercury in stream water and suspended sediment along the flow path suggest that: (1) physical processes such as dilution and sedimentation cannot fully explain decreases in total mercury concentrations along the flow path and that in-stream processes may be more important than previously realized; (2) in-stream processes include photochemical transformations (~20%), but microbial reduction is likely more dominant (~80%); and (3) additional sources of mercury inputs to EFPC at base-flow may predominantly arise from the hyporheic zone during the growing season, with adjacent riparian wetlands and non-point-source impacted tributaries increasing in importance during the dormant season when the stream channel is more hydrologically connected to the watershed.",

            "abstract": "Global-scale changes in the hydrological cycle have been reconstructed in many parts of the world using various archives of proxy information. The signals found in proxies allow us to study the complex response of the global hydrological cycle to the combined forcing and feedback mechanisms. However, it remains a challenge to attribute the observed variations to specific causes, in particular, it is difficult to distinguish CO2 and ice-sheet response in time series. Here, we present new results from a set of transient paleoclimate simulation of the last eight glacial cycles (784,000 years) using accelerated forcing.\nIn order to isolate the ice-sheet forcing from the CO2 -driven response and orbital forcing, we made use of additional transient experiments with varying forcing combinations covering the last 408,000 years: (a) keeping CO2 concentrations constant, (b) keeping the ice-sheet fixed, (c) orbital forcing only. The simulations show that orbital forcing has strongest impact in the tropical and subtropical regions. The northern hemisphere ice-sheets stamp a characteristic spatial footprint on the global precipitation variability. The ice-sheets mainly affect the extratropical northern hemisphere, but the cone of influence extends further into the North African monsoon regions, and to a weaker extent into the Asian monsoon.\nIn an attempt to validate our model-specific results we compared our results with existing hydrological paleo proxy records. Despite the growing number of proxy archives, the aim to identify the ice-sheet influence in spatially limited networks of proxy time series remains as challenge. More records that cover at least two full glacial cycles could significantly increase the signal separation. In conclusion, our results suggest that the northern hemisphere ice-sheets played an important role in modulating the global hydrological cycle.",

            "abstract": "Planktic foraminifera have been used as carriers of stable isotopic signals since the pioneering work of Urey and Emiliani. In those heady days, instrumental limitations required hundreds of individual foraminiferal tests to return a usable value. This had the fortunate side-effect of smoothing any seasonal to decadal changes within the planktic foram population, which generally turns over monthly, removing that potential noise from each sample. With the advent of more sensitive mass spectrometers, smaller sample sizes have now become standard. This has been a tremendous advantage, allowing longer time series with the same investment of time and energy. Unfortunately, the use of smaller numbers of individuals to generate a data point has lessened the amount of time averaging in the isotopic analysis and decreased precision in paleoceanographic datasets. With fewer individuals per sample, the differences between individual specimens will result in larger variation, and therefore error, and less precise values for each sample. Unfortunately, most workers (the authors included) do not make a habit of reporting the error associated with their sample size. We have created an open-source model in R to quantify the effect of sample sizes under various realistic and highly modifiable parameters (calcification depth, diagenesis in a subset of the population, improper identification, vital effects, mass, etc.). For example, a sample in which only 1 in 10 specimens is diagenetically altered can be off by >0.3‰ δ18O VPDB or ~1°C. Additionally, and perhaps more importantly, we show that under unrealistically ideal conditions (perfect preservation, etc.) it takes ~5 individuals from the mixed-layer to achieve an error of less than 0.1‰. Including just the unavoidable vital effects inflates that number to ~10 individuals to achieve ~0.1‰. Combining these errors with the typical machine error inherent in mass spectrometers make this a vital consideration moving forward.",

            "abstract": "There is strong evidence that metamorphic reactions play a role in enabling the rupture of intermediate-depth earthquakes; however, recent studies of the Bucaramanga Nest at a depth of 135-165 km under Colombia indicate that intermediate-depth seismicity shows low radiation efficiency and strong scaling of stress drop with slip/size, which suggests a dramatic weakening process, as proposed in the thermal shear instability model. Decreasing stress drop with slip and low seismic efficiency could have a measurable effect on the magnitude-frequency distribution of small earthquakes by causing them to become undetectable at substantially larger seismic moment than would be the case if stress drop were constant. We explore the population of small earthquakes in the Bucaramanga Nest using an empirical subspace detector to push the detection limit to lower magnitude. Using this approach, we find ~30,000 small, previously uncatalogued earthquakes during a 6-month period in 2013. We calculate magnitudes for these events using their relative amplitudes. Despite the additional detections, we observe a sharp deviation from a Gutenberg-Richter magnitude frequency distribution with a marked deficiency of events at the smallest magnitudes. This scarcity of small earthquakes is not easily ascribed to the detectability threshold; tests of our ability to recover small-magnitude waveforms of Bucaramanga Nest earthquakes in the continuous data indicate that we should be able to detect events reliably at magnitudes that are nearly a full magnitude unit smaller than the smallest earthquakes we observe. The implication is that nearly 100,000 events expected for a Gutenberg-Richter MFD are “missing,” and that this scarcity of small earthquakes may provide new support for the thermal runaway mechanism in intermediate-depth earthquake mechanics.

            "abstract": "A central motivation of the Biogeosciences is to understand the cycling of biologically essential elements over multiple scales of space and time. This charge is vital to basic knowledge of Earth system functioning. It is also relevant to many of the global challenges we face, such as climate change, biodiversity conservation, and the multifaceted role of global fertilizer use in maximizing human health and well-being. Nitrogen is connected to all of these; yet it has been one of the more vexing elements to quantitatively appraise across systems and scales. Here I discuss how research in my group has been exploring the use of natural nitrogen isotope abundance (15N/14N) as a biogeochemical tracer – from the level of gene expression to nitrogen’s role in global climate change. First, I present evidence for a positive correlation between the bacterial genes that encode for gaseous nitrogen production (i.e., nirS) and the 15N/14N of soil extractable nitrate pools across an array of terrestrial ecosystems. Second, I demonstrate how these local-scale results fit with our work on ecosystem-scale nitrogen isotope budgets, where we quantify a uniformly small isotope effect (i.e., < 1 per mil) of nitrogen leaching losses from tropical rainforest to highly disturbed arid sites. Third, I present results from our global isotope model, which is based on results from our field investigations, providing a new nitrogen “benchmarking” scheme for global computational models and climate change forecasts. Finally, I move to a new research frontier where we have been developing a technique to measure the nitrogen isotope composition of ancient terrestrial plant compounds (i.e., chlorins) buried in the soil. This research aims to address the response of the nitrogen cycle to glacial-interglacial transitions over millennia, which is beyond the window of experimental testing. Together, this research highlights the utility of nitrogen isotope composition in addressing the myriad scales of this element’s interaction with Earth’s environment, and supports the working hypothesis that bacterial denitrification is the major fractionating pathway of nitrogen loss from the terrestrial biosphere, much like the global ocean.",

            "abstract": "The Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna River system (GBM) is among the world’s largest in terms of both annual water and sediment discharge. The subaerial delta (110,000 km2) is home to ~160 million people, in addition to the ecologically and economically critical Sundarbans National Forest (SNF). Recent sediment budgets suggest that ~15% of the 1 x 109 t yr-1 sediment load carried by the GBM is subsequently advected along shore and inland via tidal activity, to the otherwise-abandoned SW portion of the delta. A unit-scale estimate based on observed offshore suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) >1.0 g L-1 suggests that sufficient sediment is available in the system to maintain the elevation of the subaerial delta plain, even under current relative sea-level-rise rates. Recent work measuring sedimentation within SNF corroborates this finding, and understanding these sediment delivery dynamics will be critical for protecting the future of nearby regions that are heavily populated, but drastically altered by human activities.\nCross-channel hydrodynamic surveys were conducted to estimate what fraction of the water (and sediment) is diverted from the major tidal channels toward the SNF interior. Measurements including profiles of velocity and SSC were collected on spring and neap tides during the dry and monsoon seasons, along transects bracketing major conduit channels into the SNF. During the dry season, we observe water flux at the southern end of the study area to be in approximate equilibrium regardless of tidal range, with SSC <0.3 g L-1 during neap tides, and <1.0 g L-1 during spring tides. North of the SNF conduit channels, we observe equilibrium water discharge and similarly low SSC during neap tides, but a modest ebb dominance and surface SSC >1.0 g L-1 during spring tides. This suggests the possibility of additional inputs of water and sediment from an adjacent tidal channel, as well as a potential source for the deposition observed on the Sundarbans platform during spring-tide flooding. Within channels in SNF, near-bed SSC increase by >5x from neap to spring tides, to a peak of ~1.0 g L-1. Sediment grab samples collected in a distributary channel show a moderate fining trend with distance from the major conduit, which has implications for the sedimentation rates observed on the tidal delta plain.",

FOXSI's direct imaging technology allows it to measure hard X-ray (HXR) emissions from the Sun with superior dynamic range and sensitivity relative to indirect HXR observations. During the December FOXSI-2 flight, several microflares were observed. We wish to characterize the temperature distributions of these microflares using supporting measurements in order to validate the FOXSI spectral response. The temperature distribution of solar plasma is best described by the differential emission measure (DEM), a physical quantity that characterizes the amount of material present in the corona in each temperature range. To determine the DEM, we employ multi-wavelength extreme ultraviolet observations by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (SDO/AIA) using a regularization method. We also perform isothermal fitting of thermal X-ray spectra from the Reuven Ramaty Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). This poster will show the temperature distribution for each of the December 11 microflares and compare these results with those obtained from FOXSI-2.",

Monthly averages of evening ion densities often clearly show a WN4 or WN3 pattern along the magnetic equator, although these patterns are not always consistent on a day-to-day basis.

Thin mafic oceanic crust or thick felsic continental crust each imprints chemical characteristics on the magmas that originated by hydrous melting of the mantle wedge above a subduction zone (e.g., Kimura et al. 2009). It is widely accepted that arcs built on thickened continental crust (e.g. the Andes) have more felsic and calc-alkaline magmas than those built on oceanic crust (Winter, 2010). However, it is not trivial to untangle the processes responsible for the differing lines of descent taken by the mantle magma (primary melt) as it ascends through the mantle and crust to its final eruption or emplacement. Here we examine the Alaska-Aleutian arc from Piip seamount to Spurr volcano using statistical technique. We use published data (from the Earthchem database) to characterize geochemistry along the arc, then using similar methods to extract geochemical signals (trends and structures) from the dataset. We show the geochemistry differences between the oceanic affiliated Aleutian and the continental affiliated Alaskan magma and the transition from one lava to the other along the arc. We replicated previously identified geochemical signatures associated with the arc, such as its variations due to the Amlia Fracture Zone, and sediment flux / convergence velocity. We model these features of the arc so that they can be subtracted from the overall trend. We propose that the remainder signals are attributed to the different processes of the two crustal types.",

We use this OCO-2 data to estimate weekly surface CO2 flux corrections at 6.7ºx6.7º resolution with a variational data assimilation technique built around the off-line PCTM atmospheric transport model driven with MERRA 1ºx1.25° winds and mixing parameters.\nSince such flux estimates can depend strongly on the prior fluxes assumed (which may remain unchanged in regions of sparse sampling), the initial 3-D concentrations assumed (especially in the upper part of the atmosphere), vertical transport/mixing errors in the model, and un-corrected biases in the satellite data, we invert the OCO-2 data in multiple inversions in which different prior fluxes are used (e.g. SiB4 vs. CASA land bio, Takahashi vs. Doney ocean, FFDAS vs. CDIAC fossil fuel), in which ACOS GOSAT data and NOAA surface in situ and aircraft profile data are used (or not) to correct the prior fluxes and concentration fields, and in which the vertical mixing in the transport model is artificially increased/decreased by a factor of 3, to assess the sensitivity of the OCO-2 flux corrections. These inversions are done in the context of a longer span (2009-2015) to allow the impact of the fluxes and other data sources to fully impact the upper layers of the model.\nThe bias between the OCO-2 data and the prior forward CO2 fields is also calculated before doing the inversions, and compared to similar retrieval biases solved for the ACOS GOSAT data (B3.5). The impact of these bias corrections, as well as the standard ones provided by the OCO-2 team, is assessed by comparing the fit of the a posteriori CO2 fields to independent data (including surface in situ and NOAA aircraft).",

All samples are characterized by clear zonation corresponding to the presence or absence of kyanite and the state of preservation of clinopyroxene. The sampled zones are defined as KF (free of kyanite, with well-preserved garnet and clinopyroxene), KZ (preserved clinopyroxene is absent; garnet occurs with kyanite); and TZ (partially preserved clinopyroxene and more altered garnet; kyanite may or may not be present). We report on results of petrographic observations, mineral chemistry, and trace element and oxygen isotope analyses for the different zones. Results from adjacent zones are presented as geochemical transects perpendicular to the layering for each xenolith. We use the results to infer the geochemical evolution of likely protoliths for the various samples.\nMineral chemistry of garnets across the different zones shows decreasing FeO*, Cr2O3, MgO and MnO and increasing in CaO from KF into KZ. Clinopyroxene shows increasing in Al2O3 and Na2O from KF into KZ. Clinopyroxenes approach a more jadeitic composition towards the KZ and are more diopsidic in KF.\nTrace element analyses were conducted with laser ablation ICP-MS on hand-picked mineral separates. Garnets show subchondritic LREE depletion and superchondritic HREE enrichment in both KF and KZ. Positive europium anomalies in garnet are present in all zones, with relatively larger anomalies in garnet grains from KZ. Preserved clinopyroxenes show complementary REE patterns to garnet grains, with superchondritic LREEs and subchondritic HREEs.\nFor the suite of xenoliths, results from mass spectrometry on oxygen extracted by laser fluorination on mineral separates show that δ18O values are above the accepted mantle value and fall within the range of hydrothermally altered oceanic crustal material. At this stage of the research, the bulk protolith is interpreted to be of crustal origin.",

            "abstract": "Due to a limited number of measurements made on a single space-craft, satellite rainfall retrieval algorithms are under-constrained and often make assumptions about the vertical structure of precipitation. For example, an algorithm may assume the rain rate is constant with height below the freezing level. In order to help support or validate the assumptions used in NASA Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite rainfall retrieval algorithms, this study investigates the vertical structure of raindrop size distribution (DSD) parameters derived from vertically pointing ground based Doppler radars during GPM field campaigns MC3E (Mid-latitude Continental Convective Clouds Experiment), IFloodS (Iowa Flood Studies), and IPHEX (Integrated Precipitation and Hydrology EXperiment). The three estimated DSD parameters represent the scale and shape of the raindrop size distribution using the parameters: normalized number concentration Nw, mass spectrum mean diameter Dm, and mass spectrum effective variance νm = σm2 / Dm2(mass spectrum variance / mean diameter squared).\nA vertical pattern in the DSD parameters was often observed during stratiform rain. While the reflectivity was nearly uniform with height, the normalized number concentration (Nw) and mean diameter (Dm) had opposite vertical structures with Nw decreasing and Dm increasing from the melting layer down to the surface. Interestingly, the mass spectrum effective variance (νm) decreased as the raindrops fall indicating that the DSD was evolving into a narrower effective mass spectrum with a loss of small and/or large raindrops. This vertical structure of DSD parameters suggests breakup, coalescence, and evaporation were occurring in the vertical column.\nIn summary, the analysis of vertically pointing radar data during GPM ground validation field campaigns suggests that the net result of breakup, coalescence, and evaporation during stratiform rain appear in the vertical structure of DSD parameters Nw, Dm, and νm. Much work is still needed to verify and quantify the slopes of the DSD parameter vertical structures and whether these results can be used to support or validate the initial profiles used in satellite rainfall probabilistic retrieval algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Intensified winter sea-ice formation at some Antarctic coastal polynyas is key to local production of dense Shelf Water. Near the shelf break immediately offshore of these polynyas, outflow of newly formed types of Antarctic Bottom Water results from rapid mixing of local Shelf Water and Circumpolar Deep Water entrained down the continental slope. Located off the Sabrina (120°E) and Adélie (145°E) Coasts, similar characteristics are found at the Dalton and Mertz Polynyas: relatively high rates of sea-ice production, large areal extent and lengthened duration. Until the recent partial breakage of the Mertz Ice Tongue, both Polynyas were limited to the east by grounded northward-protruding ice tongues that provide favorable conditions to form sea-ice. Nevertheless, Shelf Water production and export of Antarctic Bottom Water with origin in the Mertz Depression has been consistently observed during the past two decades, although with progressively fresher characteristics.\nThe first oceanographic expeditions to the shelf depression located off the Sabrina Coast were made in the past two austral summers, by the U.S. in 2014 and Australia in 2015. These new measurements reveal contrasting characteristics to those found at Mertz. They indicate a more prominent role played by local freshwater inputs, which overshadow the effect from winter salt rejection within the Dalton Polynya. Results from a combined study of in-situ, remote sensing, and historical reanalysis datasets for 2014-2015 are used to describe the regional interaction of winds, ocean currents and sea-ice off Sabrina Coast. The inferred interactions at the Dalton and Mertz Polynyas are contrasted for the 2005-2015 period, to distinguish regional influences on the climatic freshening of Antarctic waters.",

Thus, over regions such as China, where a higher frequency of heavy aerosol plumes is expected, regional aerosol optical depth analyses reported from passive satellite-based aerosol products may biased low. This fundamental error can be suppressed under certain conditions. In this study, with a synergistic use of satellite observations from MODIS, OMI and CALIOP, a low bias in the MODIS Dark Target (DT) and Deep Blue (DB) aerosol products is studied over Asia for the influence of dense aerosol plume undersampling. A new scheme has been developed for detecting heavy aerosol plumes by coupling OMI aerosol index retrievals with available CALIOP level 1B and cloud and aerosol profile data. Collocated CALIOP, MODIS and OMI data are then used to further investigate the potential low bias in the MODIS DT and DB aerosol products, in an attempt to quantify the measure of undersampling in the regional DT and DB archive. Our preliminary results show that DT and DB aerosol algorithms detect about half heavy aerosol loading when CALIPSO and OMI AI believe there are heavy absorbing aerosols.",

            "abstract": "Huge amounts of African dust travels thousands of kilometers from the Sahara and Sahel regions to the Caribbean, northern South America and southern North America. However, not much is understood about how the aging process that takes place during transport changes dust properties, and how it affects cloud’s composition and microphysics. In order to improve our understanding of the role of long-range transported African dust (LRTAD) in cloud formation processes we had field campaigns measuring dust physical and chemical properties in summers of 2013, 2014 and 2015, as part of the Puerto Rico African Dust and Cloud Study (PRADACS), and of the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory (LCZO). Measurements were performed at the tropical montane cloud forest (TMCF) of Pico del Este (PE, 1051 masl) and at the nature reserve of Cabezas de San Juan (CSJ, 60 masl). In both ground stations we monitored meteorological parameters (e.g., temperature, wind speed, wind direction). At CSJ, we measured light absorption and scattering at three wavelengths (467, 528 and 652 nm). At PE we collected cloud and rainwater for chemical analyses and monitored cloud microphysical properties (e.g., liquid water content, droplet size distribution, droplet number concentration, effective diameter and median volume diameter). Summer 2015 was the first attempt to characterize microphysical properties of the summer period (June to August) at PE, where dust is in its higher concentrations of the year. Samples were classified using data from models and satellites together with CSJ measurements as low or high dust influenced. Soluble ions, insoluble trace metals, pH, conductivity, total and dissolved organic carbon and total and dissolved nitrogen were measured for cloud and rainwater. Enrichment factor analysis was used to determine sea and crustal contribution of species by sample, as well as the neutralization factor and fractional acidity. Some preliminary results show cloud water conductivity for low and high dust periods was 47.7 vs 81.1 mS/cm, respectively, and for rainwater was 12.8 mS/cm vs 15.0 mS/cm. pH showed differences no larger than 11% for both 2013 and 2014 periods. Also, microphysical data from summer 2013 suggest that dust may be hindering cloud formation processes. Detailed results from all campaigns will be presented at the meeting.",

This low-lying region of the Bay of Bengal is one of the most densely populated in the world and is prone to monsoonal flooding, potentially aggravated by intensified cyclones due to climate change. In this context, sea-level rise, along with tectonic, sediment load and groundwater extraction induced land uplift/subsidence, significantly exacerbate the Bangladesh’s coastal vulnerability. Here we present the goals and results of a Belmont Forum/IGFA-funded project, BanD-AID (\nhttp://Belmont-SeaLevel.org\n). For the last 5 decades, we analyze the decadal / multi-decadal sea level in this region. To do this, we use a reconstruction of sea level past variations over the past 50 years based on the joint statistical analysis of tide gauge records and grids of sea level from a ocean circulation model. We also determine the relative sea level trend, which reflects the sea level change felt by the population locally, by combining space geodetic observations, including satellite altimetry and GPS, together with tide gauges, and different reconstructed sea-level approaches. This unique combination of different techniques offers the possibility to better quantify the major contributions to the relative sea-level rise at the Bangladesh delta, towards addressing its coastal vulnerability and future sustainability.",

            "abstract": "Advances in sequencing technologies are rapidly expanding our abilities to unravel aspects of microbial community structure and function in complex systems like soil; however, characterizing the highly diverse communities is problematic, due primarily to challenges in data analysis. To tackle this problem, we aimed to constrain the microbial diversity in a soil by enriching for particular functional groups within a community through addition of “trigger substrates”. Such trigger substrates, characterized by low molecular weight, readily soluble and diffusible in soil solution, representative of soil organic matter derivatives, would also be rapidly degradable. A relatively small energy investment to maintain the cell in a state of metabolic alertness for such substrates would be a better evolutionary strategy and presumably select for a cohort of microorganisms with the energetics and cellular machinery for utilization and growth. We chose glycine, a free amino acid (AA) known to have short turnover times (in the range of hours) in soil. As such, AAs are a good source of nitrogen and easily degradable, and can serve as building blocks for microbial proteins and other biomass components. We hypothesized that the addition of glycine as a trigger substrate will decrease microbial diversity and evenness, as taxa capable of metabolizing it are enriched in relation to those that are not. We tested this hypothesis by incubating three Kansas native prairie soils with glycine for 24 hours at 21 degree Celsius, and measured community level responses by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, metagenomics, and metatranscriptomics. Preliminary evaluation of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed minor changes in bacterial community composition in response to glycine addition. We will also present data on functional gene abundance and expression. The results of these analyses will be useful in designing sequencing strategies aimed at dissecting and deciphering complex microbial communities.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Joshi_AGU-Poster-2015.pdf\nSeismic and hydrologic observations of the Nankai subduction zone made by the Ocean Drilling Program suggest that pore fluid pressures within the accretionary wedge décollement are highly overpressured to near lithostatic values below depths of 2 km beneath the sea floor as a result of sediment diagenesis and dehydration of the subducting oceanic plate. This overpressured zone is also observed to discharge pulses of high fluid pressure that migrate up-dip along the décollement at rates of 1’s of km/day. These high pressure pulses along the décollement may cause large enough reductions in the local effective stress to account for aseismic slip events that have been found to propagate also at rates of 1’s of km/day. Because elevated fluid pressure and correspondingly decreased effective stress can lead to a dilation of porosity, the pressure waves may become effective agents of fluid transport that can travel more quickly than fluids flowing in the background Darcian flow regime. The purpose of the present study was to seek theoretical confirmation that pressure waves are able to travel quickly enough to account for the seismic and hydrological observations documented. This confirmation was sought through a transient one-dimensional numerical solution to the differential fluid mass conservation equation for an elastic porous medium.\nResults of the numerical simulations show that when overpressures at depths greater than 2 km in the décollement exceed lithostatic pressure by at least 3%, pressure waves are formed that migrate up-dip at rates fast enough to account for aseismic slip over a broad range of geologic conditions. Pressure waves spawned from these depths in the décollement may travel fast enough to account for aseismic slip when overpressures there are as low as 99% of lithostatic pressure, but require low specific storage of 3×10−6 m−1, high sensitivity of permeability to effective stress, low permeability no higher than about 10−21 m2 at depths below 2 km in the décollement, and an accurate accounting of the decrease in fluid viscosity with increasing depth. Thus, pressure waves could account for aseismic slip in the Nankai accretionary wedge if conditions were near the limits of geologically reasonable ranges.",

The Digital Library also includes community data collections and custom data portals for the GeoPRISMS, MARGINS and Ridge2000 programs, for active source reflection data (Academic Seismic Portal), and for marine data acquired by the US Antarctic Program (Antarctic and Southern Ocean Data Portal). Ensuring that these data are discoverable not only through our own interfaces but also through standards-compliant web services is critical for enabling investigators to find data of interest.\nOver the past two years, MGDS has developed several new RESTful web services that enable programmatic access to metadata and data holdings. These web services are compliant with the EarthCube GeoWS Building Blocks specifications and are currently used to drive our own user interfaces. New web applications have also been deployed to provide a more intuitive user experience for searching, accessing and browsing metadata and data. Our new map-based search interface combines components of the Google Maps API with our web services for dynamic searching and exploration of geospatially constrained data sets. Direct introspection of nearly all data formats for hundreds of thousands of data files curated in the Marine-Geo Digital Library has allowed for precise geographic bounds, which allow geographic searches to an extent not previously possible.

            "abstract": "Some forty years ago, Schaule and Patterson established the first accurate profile of lead in waters off Bermuda. In evidence was a massive environmental insult from lead emissions being carried seaward by the atmosphere over the Sargasso Sea. Further documentation was possible using contiguous time series in the atmosphere on Bermuda, surface sea water nearby and recorded in local corals. Lead had then an overwhelming source from the combustion of gasoline, primarily in the USA and secondarily in Europe. These were carried to Bermuda on seasonally alternating temperate and trade winds from the west and east, respectively. The anthropogenic sources were well distinguished based on the unique radiogenic nature of stable lead isotopes in the gasoline being used by these countries. Subsequently, decreasing use in the west (USA) followed by that in the east (Europe) was isotopically evident. As such, the two signatures were subjected to transient mixing in the atmosphere and subsequently with depth in ocean.\nA transient experiment uses data during 1996-1998, a period of transition in leaded gasoline use in the USA and Europe. Here are complimentary records of lead concentration and stable isotopes in atmospheric deposition and surface waters. The results allow an isotopic mass balance, indicating much of the lead in Bermuda surface water at that time may not have been deposited locally. As such, it may be presumed to reflect easterly advection of some lead at the surface under limited scavenging via the prevailing subtropical gyre circulation. These annual circulation periods are consistent with both physical data and another lead isotopic mass balance in the east. Going forward, Bermuda time series of trace elements and isotopes such as lead could continue to record climatological (e.g. NAO) transients in atmospheric scavenging, potential impact on surface ecosystems, and changes in mixing into deeper waters of the Sargasso Sea and points further afield.",

            "abstract": "Resilience in urban coastal areas is affected by actions at multiple levels from individuals to community groups to city, state and federal governments. At any level, actions can be a response to immediate hazards (e.g. flooding of coastal homes) or long-term drivers of change (e.g. sea level rise). Jamaica Bay, a highly urbanized estuary within New York City, exemplifies the Nation’s coastal zone challenges. Prior to Hurricane Sandy, city, state, and federal governments had made the estuary a major focal point for habitat restoration, improvements to public access and outdoor recreation, and sustainable development. Sandy caused the highest flood level in the recorded history of New York City, eventually claiming 44 lives and costing over $19 billion. Electrical system failure caused four of NYCs wastewater pollution control plants to shutdown, discharging untreated sewage into Jamaica Bay.\nThe Sea Level Rise Tool for Sandy Recovery (the Tool), a flood mapping tool developed by several government agencies including FEMA, NYC, and the Executive Branch, integrated science from the National Flood Insurance Program and the New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC). While compound flooding hazards (stormwater plus coastal flooding) remain an important uncertainty, the Tool and subsequent NPCC mapping efforts provide sufficient evidence for science-based discourse around coastal flood risks in Jamaica Bay. But toward what outcome?\nCoastal flood risk reduction measures and other management actions are managed within existing regulatory frameworks. Disaster relief funds appropriated by Congress in the immediate aftermath of Sandy have provided critical resources to the Jamaica Bay region. However, the challenge now is to transition from the short-term response to long-term resilience planning, a challenge which requires new institutional capacity. This transition to resilience planning and implementation is not only critical in New York City, but in other coastal cities around the nation. The Science and Resilience Institute at Jamaica Bay is a rare partnership between the City of New York, the National Park Service and a consortium of nine research institutions, focused on collaborative problem solving. Central to the Institute’s to success will be the question – can we start mapping resilience and not risk?",

            "abstract": "Airborne electromagnetics (AEM) investigations have established themselves as an invaluable tool for near-surface investigation. They are an economical and efficient means to rapidly obtain a geophysical characterization of electrical properties of the subsurface, which can often be correlated with lithology as well as water content and quality. While many AEM surveys are inherently aimed at obtaining a 3D image of the earth, the most mature means of data interpretation involves stitched 1D inversions. In many AEM surveys the geology is generally layered and changes slowly enough along the survey such that the earth beneath the instrument at any moment is effectively 1D–justifying this approach. However, AEM surveys are being conducted in increasingly challenging locales where these assumptions break down. AEM surveys in areas with large topographic relief, complicated geology, and/or surveys that are concentrated on characterizing compact features do not permit a 1D approximation. The 3D inverse problem is computationally challenging due to large memory requirements as well as the singular nature of Maxwell’s equations in the air.\nWe propose a deterministic 3D inversion methodology utilizing a vector- and scalar-potential frequency-domain formulation of Maxwell’s equations, which is not degenerate in the air. The potentials are decoupled through Schur decomposition resulting in smaller systems in the forward-problem formulation and no redundant matrix storage. The Schur decomposition also permits the reuse of direct solvers within the forward problem. Time-domain calculations are made tractable by avoiding costly solver refactoring at every frequency and conductivity model. The computational mesh is necessarily finer than the resolving power of the survey and reduced order models are relied upon in order to avoid nearly redundant sensitivity calculations. The proposed inversion approach is able to reproduce 3D features and avoids biases and inaccuracies of 1D interpretation in geologically complicated media.",

To quantify this dispersive effect, scientists look into what the culprit is that causes this signal bias on an atomic level. Results have shown that the concentration of oscillating electrons is directly proportional to the amount of bias the signal from a point on earth to a GPS satellite witnesses. This is called the Total Electron Content (TEC) of a specified path, measured in electrons per meters squared (. In this project, the process of collecting and analyzing TEC units was kept the same as the previous methods while keeping the cost below $3,000. Using a dual-frequency GNSS receiver from Javad, Triumph-2, the project team recorded a series of 24 hour interval data logs as the receiver stored incoming signals from any reachable satellite. Because of the dispersive media in the ionosphere, the signal witnesses a bend in its path causing a delay, called the Slant TEC (sTEC). Using libraries from GPStk and TEQC, we analyzed RINEX files to view the differential phase and differential pseudorange frequency to compute slant TEC units (sTECU). Using the obtained data, we analyzed the difference between the sTEC units collected in Houston, Texas to the ones collected in Fairbanks, Alaska. Afterwards, the project will continue on another balloon in Kiruna, Sweden at the Esrange Space Center. The receiver will be in flight this time on a 48 hour flight. ",

Surface to air greenhouse gas fluxes are largely dependent on such surface controls as the frozen/thawed state of the snow and soil. Satellite remote sensing is an important means to create continuous mapping of surface properties. Advances in the ability to determine soil and snow freeze/thaw timings from microwave frequency observations improves upon our ability to predict the response of carbon gas emission to warming through synthesis with in-situ observation, such as the 2012-2015 Carbon in Arctic Reservoir Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE). Surface freeze/thaw or snowmelt timings are often derived using a constant or spatially/temporally variable threshold applied to time-series observations. Alternately, time-series singularity classifiers aim to detect discontinuous changes, or “edges”, in time-series data similar to those that occur from the large contrast in dielectric constant during the freezing or thaw of soil or snow. We use multi-scale analysis of continuous wavelet transform spectral gradient brightness temperatures from various channel combinations of passive microwave radiometers, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E, AMSR2) and Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I F17) gridded at a 10 km posting with resolution proportional to the observational footprint. Channel combinations presented here aim to illustrate and differentiate timings of “edges” from transitions in surface water related to various landscape components (e.g. snow-melt, soil-thaw). To support an understanding of the physical basis of observed “edges” we compare satellite measurements with simple radiative transfer microwave-emission modeling of the snow, soil and vegetation using in-situ observations from the SNOw TELemetry (SNOTEL) automated weather stations. Results of freeze/thaw and snow-melt timings and trends are reported for Alaska and the North-West Canadian Arctic for the period 2002 to 2015.",

            "abstract": "Traditionally, large-scale river network models in hydrology have used reduced physics, e.g. Muskingum-Cunge, to handle unsteady river flows. Recently, it has been demonstrated that efficient dynamic solutions of the 1D Saint-Venant equations can be applied over large river networks with the Simulation Program for River Networks (SPRNT). The advantage of solving the Saint-Venant equations is that models can represent water depth (as well as flow) throughout the network. However, this approach is not without challenges. In particular, a Saint-Venant solution must include representation of channel geometry, which can be difficult to consistently and comprehensively obtain over a large river network.\nIn the present work, we explore methods for combining different data sources into a consistent river network geometric description. High-resolution lidar, cross-section surveys, and data from the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) are merged to create reach-scale geometric descriptions of a river network suitable for Saint-Venant modeling. The Upper Alabama River is used as a study site. In this data set, 3.3% (169 out of 5069) of the reaches showed significant mismatches between available high-resolution DEMs and the NHD flowlines, which creates uncertainty as to the quality of the resulting geometric model. We investigate simplified methods for representing approximate cross-section geometry and the effect of these simplifications on flow simulations.\nAcknowledgement: This research was supported by the National Science Foundation under grant number CCF-1331610.

Our focus was aimed at understanding the downscaling process in multiscale flows during storm intensification. To represent the various length scales of atmospheric systems, we extracted Intrinsic Function Modes (IMFs) from raw data using the PEEMD and found that the non-oscillatory trend mode can be used to represent large scale environmental flow and the third oscillatory mode (IMF3) is to represent AEW/TC scale systems. Our results: 1) identified 42 developing cases from 272 AEWs, with 25 eventually developing into hurricanes; 2) indicated that maximum shear largely occurs over the ocean for the IMF3 mode and over land near the coast for the trend mode for developing cases, suggesting shear transfer between the trend mode and the IMF3; 3) displayed opposite wind shear tendencies for the trend mode and the IMF3 during storm intensification, signifying the downscaling process in 13 hurricane cases along their tracks; 4) showed that among the 42 developing cases, only 13 of the 25 hurricanes were found with significant downscaling transfer features, so other processes such as upscaling processes may play an important role in the other developing cases, especially the remaining 12 hurricane cases. Investigating the upscaling process between the convection scale and the AEW/TC requires data from the finer grid resolution and will be the subject of a future study.",

Political science and international relations research often use simplistic metrics to characterize terrain and its relation to conflict. We examine linkages between environmental conditions and conflict using fine-resolution spatially disaggregated data for violent events occurring in five wars in the broader Caucasus region: between the Russian state and separatists in Chechnya and the neighboring republics (1999-2002); the Russian state and Islamists in the North Caucasus (2002-2015); between Armenians and Azerbaijanis in Nagorno-Karabakh (1990-2015); and between Georgia and separatists in South Ossetia (1991-2008) and Abkhazia (1992-2008). For environmental conditions, we consider land use, elevation, and slope to identify profiles of violence intensity within each of the five cases. Data include forest cover derived from Landsat imagery, slope data calculated from a digital elevation model, and land cover derived from MODIS imagery. The Landsat imagery provide consistent 30 meter information on percent forest cover across the multiple study regions. We use GIS (buffers around conflict points) to create categorical summary statistics. The “operational costs of context” vary dramatically across regions within the study area and by the actor who initiates subsets of violent events. Our empirical focus is on Russia’s south and the neighboring countries of the South Caucasus but we leverage comparisons between the five wars to generalize outward to other world regions and to contribute to research on conflict propensity in regions of rugged and mountainous terrain.",

The detection efficiency of the OKLMA decreases with distance from the center of the LMA, which causes a false maximum in sources over the network when working with very large data sets. Using five months worth of data and assuming a VHF source detection efficiency of 100% over the network, a map of detection efficiency at different ranges is presented. Two methods of eliminating the bias of source detection over the network are explored: a normalization method based on the decreasing VHF power of detected sources with range and a flash-sorting method. Although both methods yield similar results, the flash sorting method is chosen for future climatology studies because it is more readily understood and is already in use throughout the community in case studies and lightning jump algorithms. The first maps and time series of total lightning over central Oklahoma for a 10-year period are presented.",

            "abstract": "The partitioning of C and S between Fe-rich alloy and silicate melt are critical to understand the origin and distribution of these two volatile elements in terrestrial planets. Thirty-five experiments in graphite capsule have been performed at 2-8 GPa and 1600-2200 °C to investigate the effects of P, T, fO2, H2O, and melt composition on C and S partitioning in Fe-Ni±S±Si alloy and silicate melt systems. The results show that C-solubility in Si-free alloy melt is ~5.5 wt% and is little affected by P, T, or the presence of 0-5 wt.% S [1]. However, C-solubility in Si-bearing alloy decreases from ~5.5 to ~1.8 wt% with increasing Si content to 10 wt.%. C-solubility in silicate melt is mainly controlled by fO2 and the bulk H2O content. At fO2 from IW-0.6 to IW-1.5, C-solubility drops from ~90 to ~10 ppm. However, at fO2 below IW-1.5, C-solubility increases up to 240 ppm with decreasing fO2 if the melt H2O content is 0.3-0.8 wt.%; whereas C-solubility decreases or only slightly increases if melt H2O is <0.2 wt.%. Raman and FTIR spectra show that the silicate glass with fO2 around IW-0.6 contained ~10-30 ppm carbon as CO32-; however, at fO2<IW-1 CO32- peak was undetectable in IR-spectra and a strong correlation between Raman peak intensities of H2 and CH4 was observed. varied from 130 to 4600 and is mainly controlled by fO2 and melt H2O content, as in the case for C-solubility in silicate melt but in an opposite way. varied from 0.4 to 38, mainly controlled by fO2, P, and T. Our new results along with previous data suggest that in a magma ocean, in particular at dry conditions, much more C than S would have segregated in the core. To satisfy the C/S ratios currently estimated for Earth’s core and silicate mantle [2], a C-rich but S-poor material needs to be delivered to the silicate Earth after complete core formation. Alternatively, a C- and S-rich material was delivered to the Earth during the late stage of core formation, but with S preferentially segregated in the core in the form of sulfide. [1] Li et al.

The main geomorphologic feature in the site is the wave-cut beach platform permanently exposed at the lowest tides and an 18 m-high coastal cliff retreat with an estimated rate of ca. 2.5 meter/year (Chunga, 2014). One of the most remarkable geoarchaeological evidences found in this outcrop, it is the remains of two large bones (ie., radius and radial) of the human forearm of ca. 800 years ago (with archaeological vestiges of the Manteña culture) covered by a 8 to 25 cm-thick volcanic ash layer, stratigraphically at the top, an erosive contact with chaotic deposition of medium to fine-grained sand which indicates a potential tsunami deposit. Moreover, several volcanic ash and lahar layers are well distinguished on the sea cliff, which are associated with pyroclastic products transported as lahars from the Quilotoa and Cotopaxi, Pululahua volcanic structures (northern Andes in Ecuador) situated at a distance between of 150-190 kilometers (Mothes and Hall, 2008; Usselman, 2006). It is not excluded that previous pre-Columbian cultures also have been displaced in the last 2,000 years by disastrous geological events such as subduction earthquakes, local tsunami and volcanic lahar-ash deposits. All of these stratigraphic and palaeoseismologic features will allow us to understand the catastrophic geological events that abruptly shaped the landscape, furthermore, to investigate the changes of moderate to high Late Holocene progradation rates of the Jaramijó bay coastline.",

Mining in this region has occurred since the late 19th century and has produced ore and waste rock having elevated levels of uranium and other contaminants. Fluvial transport of these contaminants from mine sites is a possibility, as this arid region is susceptible to violent storms and flash flooding which might erode and mobilize ore or waste rock. In order to assess and manage the risks associated with uranium mining, it is important to understand the transport and storage rates of sediment and uranium within the ephemeral streams of this region.\nWe are developing a 1-dimensional sediment transportation model to examine uranium transport and storage through a typical canyon system in this region. Our study site is Hack Canyon Mine, a uranium and copper mine site, which operated in the 1980’s and is currently experiencing fluvial erosion of its waste rock repository. The mine is located approximately 40km upstream from the Colorado River and is in a deep, narrow canyon with a small watershed. The stream is ephemeral for the upper half of its length and sediment is primarily mobilized during flash flood events. We collected sediment samples at 110 locations longitudinally through the river system to examine the distribution of uranium in the stream. Samples were sieved to the sand size and below fraction (<2mm) and uranium was measured by gamma-ray spectroscopy. Sediment storage zones were also examined in the upper 8km of the system to determine where uranium is preferentially stored in canyon systems. This information will quantify the downstream transport of constituents associated with the Hack Canyon waste rock and contribute to understanding the risks associated with fluvial mobilization of uranium mine waste.",

Chemically induced weakening is often encountered in hydraulic fracturing of low-permeability oil/gas reservoirs and heat reservoirs, during storage of CO2 and nuclear waste corroding canisters, and other circumstances when rock matrix acidizing is involved. Upon acidizing, mineral mass dissolution is substantially enhanced weakening the rock and causing crack propagation and eventually permeability changes in the medium.\nThe crack process zone is modeled mathematically via a chemo-plastic coupling and chemo-elastic coupling model. In plasticity a two-way coupling is postulated between mineral dissolution and a yield limit of rock matrix. The rate of dissolution is described by a rate law, but the mineral mass removal per unit volume is also a function of a variable internal specific surface area, which is in turn affected by the micro-cracking (treated as a plastic strain). The behavior of the rock matrix is modeled as rigid-plastic adding a chemical softening capacity to Cam-Clay model. Adopting the Extended Johnson’s approximation of processes around the crack tip, the evolution of the stress field and deformation as a function of the chemically enhanced rock damage is modeled in a simplified way. In addition, chemical reactive transport is made dependent on plastic strain representing micro-cracking. Depending on mechanical and chemical boundary conditions, the area of enhanced chemical softening is near or somewhat away from the crack tip.\nIn elasticity, chemo-mechanical effect is postulated via a chemical volumetric shrinkage strain proportional to mass removal variable, conceived analogously to thermal expansion. Two versions are considered: of constant coefficient of shrinkage and a variable one, coupled to deviatoric strain. Airy Potential approach used for linear elasticity is extended considering an extra term, which is uncoupled or coupled to strain. The later case requires iterations with solution of reactive transport equation. A decrease of stress intensity factor with time of reaction is well reproduced.",

The model takes into account radial, energy, pitch-angle and mixed diffusion, losses into the atmosphere, and magnetopause shadowing. We include scattering by hiss and chorus based on a recently developed statistical models of VLF/ELF waves obtained from EMFISIS instrument. We consider the energetic (>100 KeV), relativistic (~0.5-1 MeV) and ultra-relativistic (>2 MeV) electrons. One year of relativistic electron measurements are well reproduced by the simulation during a period of the various geomagnetic activity. However, for ultra-relativistic energies, the VERB code simulation significantly overestimates electron phase space density. Since the additional loss is required only at very high energies we conclude that EMIC waves is the most likely additional source of scattering that could explain observed decay rates.",

            "abstract": "Diagenetic history plays a dominant role in determining the suitability of subsurface rock units as hosts for fluids that have societal importance. The performance of subsurface aquifers and storage facilities for CO2, natural gas, and liquid waste, is largely tied to the evolution of pore space and distribution and composition of authigenic minerals. While geoscientists may be well aware of the importance and nuances of diagenesis, project managers and decision-makers are unlikely to have a geologic understanding of determining factors such as burial history, fluid flow, and mineral thermodynamics. Thus, if falls to the geoscientists to effectively communicate meaningful conceptual models that adequately capture diagenetic heterogeneity and the potential for temporal changes with anthropogenically-induced changes in subsurface chemistry. This can be particularly difficult in subsurface systems that are sparsely sampled. Here, we look at the example of the basal Cambrian Mount Simon Sandstone and overlying Eau Claire Formation in the Illinois Basin, the respective reservoir and seal for the largest ongoing demonstration of anthropogenic CO2 sequestration in the United States. Relatively few cores are available to study the pore-scale composition and structure of these units, and those that are available show a complex and spatially variable diagenetic history. Compilation of past studies and new analyses from the Illinois Basin are combined to illustrate the burial history and fluid flow record that will influence how these units respond to the massive volumes of supercritical CO2 injected into the subsurface. Pore to regional scale differences in authigenic mineral composition and texture result in significantly different predicted fluid-rock interactions and various potential consequences of injection. This project provides examples of both successes and challenges associated with communicating the diagentic complexity to stakeholders and the potential implications of those experiences.",

            "abstract": "In-season monitoring of crop conditions provides critical information for agricultural policy and decision making and most importantly for food security planning and management. Nationwide agricultural monitoring in countries dominated by smallholder farming systems, generally relies on extensive networks of field data collectors. In Tanzania, extension agents make up this network and report on conditions across the country, approaching a “near-census”. Data is collected on paper which is resource and time intensive, as well as prone to errors. Data quality is ambiguous and there is a general lack of clear and functional feedback loops between farmers, extension agents, analysts and decision makers. Moreover, the data are not spatially explicit, limiting the usefulness for analysis and quality of policy outcomes.\nDespite significant advances in remote sensing and information communication technologies (ICT) for monitoring agriculture, the full potential of these new tools is yet to be realized in Tanzania. Their use is constrained by the lack of resources, skills and infrastructure to access and process these data. The use of ICT technologies for data collection, processing and analysis is equally limited.\nThe AgriSense-STARS project is developing and testing a system for national-scale in-season monitoring of smallholder agriculture using a combination of three main tools, 1) GLAM-East Africa, an automated MODIS satellite image processing system, 2) field data collection using GeoODK and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and 3) the Tanzania Crop Monitor, a collaborative online portal for data management and reporting. These tools are developed and applied in Tanzania through the National Food Security Division of the Ministry of Agriculture, Food Security and Cooperatives (MAFC) within a statistically representative sampling framework (area frame) that ensures data quality, representability and resource efficiency.",

This model dependency presents a major weakness in our current understanding of the BDC and can partly be attributed to deficiencies in non-orographic GW drag parameterizations.\nWe quantify the contribution of small-scale GWs from summer US storm systems to the BDC using a high-resolution, GW-resolving modeling approach. A nonlinear idealized dry version of the WRF model is forced with high-resolution latent heating/cooling derived from precipitation observations. For several case studies, it is shown that this model produces an excellent quantitative comparison to waves observed by satellite and captures the intermittency associated with convective sources of strong GW events. We model the entire month of June 2014 over the continental US.\nThe contribution of GWs from summer US storm systems to the BDC is quantified and compared to MERRA reanalysis data and the CAM5 model. Non-orographic GW drag parameterizations used in large-scale models are poorly constrained by observational validation and commonly have tuning parameters with large uncertainties. In particular, capturing the high intermittency of the GW field presents an ongoing important challenge, as a given averaged momentum flux carried by a large number of small-amplitude GWs will produce a drag at much higher altitudes than that produced by the same averaged flux carried by a small number of high-amplitude GWs. In studying the relationship between precipitation strength, GW momentum flux amplitude and magnitude of the stratospheric GW drag, we highlight the potential for improving gravity wave drag parameterizations in global models.",

Many problems of interest involve the advection of some scalar quantity (e.g., bulk composition, trace elements, melt fraction, water content, grain size). However, it is well-known that in the absence of limiters or some other numerical technique, high-order accurate advection methods will introduce a physically incorrect 'overshoot' and 'undershoot' of the advected quantity in regions where the computed solution has steep gradients. We have developed a finite difference method for approximating solutions to the Rayleigh-Benard equations coupled to a scalar advection equation in which the solution to this advection equation are approximated with a monotone finite difference method. This method is based on second-order accurate finite difference methods with slope limiters that are a proven and mature methodology for modeling solutions of the equations of gas dynamics, advection in meterological flows, etc. We test our method by computing the classic falling block benchmark originally introduced by Gerya and Yuen in 2003 in which the viscosity is the scalar quantity which jumps by up to six orders of magnitude between the block and the background flow.\n The long-term goal of this project is to implement monotonicity preserving numerical methods in modern codes for modeling convection in the Earth's mantle.",

The interplay between fluid flow, medium deformation and fracture is essential in geoscience problems as disparate as fracking for unconventional hydrocarbon production, conduit formation and methane venting from lake and ocean sediments, and desiccation cracks in soil.\nRecent work has pointed to the importance of capillary forces in some relevant regimes of fracturing of granular materials (Sandnes et al., Nat. Comm. 2011), leading to the term hydro-capillary fracturing (Holtzman et al., PRL 2012). Most of these experimental and computational investigations have focused, however, on 2D or quasi-2D systems. Here, we develop an experimental set-up that allows us to observe two-phase flow in a 3D granular bed, and control the level of confining stress. We use an index matching technique to directly visualize the injection of a liquid in a granular media saturated with another, immiscible liquid. We determine the key dimensionless groups that control the behavior of the system, and elucidate different regimes of the invasion pattern. We present result for the 3D morphology of the invasion, with particular emphasis on the fracturing regime.",

The results indicate that (local) land-use changes within the catchments may have a relatively more important role (than climate change) for the temporal changes shown in the discharge power spectra.\nWith a basis in stream network maps from present day in two different resolutions as well as a historical map from the 1880’s, anthropogenic modifications, in terms of the flow paths within the stream networks, were identified for an agricultural catchment in southern Sweden. Through scenario modelling using a 1-D distributed routing model, the influence of common anthropogenic activities such as e.g. straightening of flowpaths, widening of stream channels to avoid damming and excavation to eliminate thresholds in the stream bottom topography, on the travel time distributions within a stream network were quantified.\nThe map studies showed that the average flow path length had decreased over the last century. The study also shows that all of the studied anthropogenic factors can potentially have a substantial impact on the travel times through the stream networks - by decreasing the average travel time as well as by decreasing the variance. These types of temporal changes in stream network properties leads to a diminished possibility to attenuate peakflows, and are expected to have a substantial influence on discharge hydrographs. This study verifies the hypothesis that anthropogenic impacts of stream networks can influence the hydrological response in catchments, and that land-use changes on a local scale may be relatively more important than climate change.",

            "abstract": "In many large river systems, solutes released by chemical weathering in mountainous regions are transported through floodplains before being discharged into the ocean. Chemical reactions within floodplains can both add and remove solutes, significantly modulating fluxes. Despite their importance in the relationship between tectonic uplift and solute fluxes to the ocean, many aspects of floodplain processes are poorly constrained since the chemistry of large rivers is also significantly affected by the mixing between multiple tributaries, which makes the separation and quantification of floodplain processes challenging.\nHere we explore how floodplain processes affect a suite of major and trace elements in the Madre de Dios River system in Peru. To separate floodplain processes from conservative mixing, we developed a tributary mixing model that uses water isotopic ratios and chloride concentrations measured in each tributary and upstream and downstream of each tributary confluence for all major tributaries along a floodplain reach. The results of the tributary mixing model allow for the chemical composition of the mainstem of the Madre de Dios River to be modeled assuming completely conservative mixing. Differences between the modeled and measured chemical composition of the mainstem are then used to identify and quantify the effects of floodplain processes on different solutes.\nOur results show that during both the wet and dry seasons, Li is removed and Ca, Mg, and Sr are added to the dissolved load during floodplain transit. Other solutes, like Na and SO4, appear to behave conservatively during floodplain transit. Likely, the removal of Li from the dissolved load reflects the precipitation of secondary silicate minerals in the floodplain. The release of Ca, Mg, and Sr likely reflects the dissolution of detrital carbonate minerals. Our analyses also show that tributaries with Andean headwaters contribute disproportionately to solute budgets while the water budget is more equally split between Andean and pure foreland-floodplain tributaries. In part, this may explain the observation that solute concentrations in the mainstem of the Madre de Dios River dilute with increasing runoff.",

            "abstract": "Drought in the Anthropocene is a function of both supply and demand. Despite its importance, demand is typically incorporated into planning models exogenously using a single scenario of demand change over time. Alternatively, demand is incorporated endogenously in hydro-economic models based on the assumption of rationality. However, actors are constrained by limited information and information processing capabilities, casting doubt on the rationality assumption. Though the risk of water shortage changes incrementally with demand growth and hydrologic change, significant shifts in management are punctuated and often linked to periods of stress. The observation of lasting decreases in per capita demands in a number of cities during periods of water stress prompts an alternate hypothesis: the occurrence of water stress increases the tendency of cities to promote and enforce efficient technologies and behaviors and the tendency of users to adopt them. We show the relevance of this hypothesis by building a model of a hypothetical surface water system to answer the following question: what is the impact of reservoir operation policy on the reliability of water supply for a growing city? The model links the rate of demand decreases to the past reliability to compare standard operating policy (SOP) with hedging policy (HP). Under SOP, demand is fulfilled unless available supply drops below demand; under HP, water releases are reduced in anticipation of a deficit to decrease the risk of a large shortfall. The model shows that reservoir storage acts both as a buffer for variability and as a delay triggering oscillations around a sustainable level of demand. HP reduces the threshold for action thereby decreasing the delay and the oscillation effect. As a result per capita demand decrease during periods of water stress are more frequent but less drastic and the additive effect of small adjustments decreases the tendency of the system to overshoot available supplies.",

The neodymium (Nd) crustal formation boundary seen in geochemical and the long-wavelength magnetic anomaly data is not apparent in the crustal or mantle seismic parameters or density. This is not completely surprising since the Nd systematics and magnetization is controlled by accessory minerals rather than bulk physical parameters. The USArray station spacing is not sufficient to capture the density and corresponding magnetic variations associated with mafic plutons except where stations are located over the plutons themselves (e.g., the Bloomfield Pluton). With the standard Moho density contrasts, Vp/Vs based crustal densities, and mantle velocity-density relationships, significant long-wavelength residuals (misfit) between observed and modeled Bouguer gravity anomalies remain over the Illinois Basin, the TIKL, and the Grenville Front in Ohio, extending north into Lake Erie and New York. Jointly inverted USArray receiver functions and gravity based Vp/Vs and the crustal thickness suggest that the Moho in the western Illinois basin and the Grenville Front in Ohio are thicker than previously known (about 50 km). The bottom of the strong crustal magnetization layer is unusually thin (15-20 km) in the New Madrid Seismic Zone, which extends northward from there into Illinois, northern Missouri and Indiana. In the Rough Creek Graben, the magnetic layer thickness is about 40 km, which is consistent with the non-magmatic nature of that branch of the rift. These observation may also imply that the rift related basal crustal layer in the New Madrid Seismic Zone is non-magnetic or very weakly magnetic. The thinner magnetic layer is also present over much of the Eastern Granite-Rhyolite Province (except in its southeastern part).",

            "abstract": "The explosive eruption of Chile’s Calbuco volcano on April 22nd-23rd produced large volcanic ash and sulfur dioxide clouds that were observed by satellites for over a week. The volcanic clouds were reported to have spanned a large range of altitudes, from 12 km to greater than 20 km. This is confirmed by the vertical profiles of aerosols observed by the NPP/OMPS Limb Profiler, which have a frequency and sensitivity allowing for a thorough look into the evolving vertical structure of the volcanic clouds. The volcanic cloud aerosol signature in the OMPS Limb profiles can be better understood by comparing them to simulations of the volcanic sulfate aerosols, and volcanic ash of various particle sizes.\n UV and IR satellite observations from the first few days of the eruption are used to constrain the initial source parameters that describe the volcanic eruption (eruption time, duration, mass emitted, injection altitude). The GEOS-5/GOCART model uses these initial source parameters to simulate the transport, deposition, and chemical conversion processes within the volcanic clouds. OMPS limb observations taken during the first days after the eruption provide numerous detailed vertical profiles of the volcanic clouds. The OMPS Limb Aerosol Scattering Index profiles are compared to the GEOS-5/GOCART simulations of sulfate aerosols and volcanic ash to show: the complex vertical structure of the volcanic plumes, the extended presence of aerosols in the volcanic clouds well after the eruption, and how OMPS Limb profiles can be used to constrain different volcanic aerosols in the GEOS-5/GOCART model simulations.",

            "abstract": "In 2005, the tropical forests in Amazonia went through a severe drought event across the entire basin. There have been conflict reports on the drought impact on vegetation and the issue was never settled due to limited ground truth. Remote sensing data have been used but often questioned for signal saturation, data quality, or atmosphere contamination. The quantification of carbon changes in this vast terrestrial carbon pool, especially the post-drought effect, is difficult but essential. Lidar measurements, which are regarded as the accurate retrieval of canopy vertical structure, give us the opportunity to quantify the carbon changes for this severe event. Here, we use the lidar waveforms measured from the GLAS sensor from 2004 to 2007 to calculate the vertical profiles of Amazonian forests and their associated carbon stock. After careful quality-filtering, removal of seasonal effect, as well as uncertainty reduction through spatial averaging and random sampling, we find that the mean canopy height in Amazon has much higher reduction from 2006 to 2007 compared to either the drought year from 2004 to 2005, or the immediate post-drought change from 2005 to 2006, demonstrating a lagged effect of drought. Our estimation of carbon loss from model calculation also show that 2005 drought had an significant impact on the carbon exchange, and emissions from post drought disturbance may match the emissions of annual deforestation from Amazonia.",

            "abstract": "About 10% of the global population lives in the word’s 20 megacities (cities with urban populations greater than 10 million people). Megacities account for approximately 20% of the global anthropogenic fossil fuel CO2 (FFCO2) emissions, and their proportion of emissions increases monotonically with the world population and urbanization. Megacities range in spatial extent from ~1000 – 10,000 km2 with complex topography and variable landscapes. We present here the first attempt at building an integrated land-atmosphere modeling system for megacity environments, developed and evaluated for urban CO2 emissions over the Los Angeles (LA) Megacity area. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) – Chem model was coupled to a ~1.3-km FFCO2 emission product, “Hestia-LA”, to simulate the transport of CO2 across the LA magacity.\\\nWe define the optimal model resolution to represent both the spatial variability of the atmospheric dynamics and the spatial patterns from the CO2 emission distribution. In parallel, we evaluate multiple configurations of WRF with various physical schemes, using meteorological observations from the CalNex-LA campaign of May-June 2010. Our results suggest that there is no remarkable difference between the medium- (4-km) and high- (1.3-km) resolution simulations in terms of atmospheric model performance. However, the high-resolution modeled CO2 mixing ratios clearly outperform the results at medium resolution for capturing both the spatial distribution and the temporal variability of the urban CO2 signals.\nWe compare the impact of physical representation errors and emission aggregation errors on the modeled CO2 mixing ratios across the LA megacity. Finally, we present a novel approach to evaluate the design of the current surface network over the LA megacity using the modeled spatial correlations. These results reinforce the importance of using high-resolution emission products over megacities to represent correctly the large spatial gradients in atmospheric CO2 mixing ratios.",

            "abstract": "Plumes of water vapor and ice particles have been observed from the cracks, the so-called tiger stripes, at the south polar region of the Saturn's satellite Enceladus. The observed high salinity (~ 1%) of the ice particles in the plumes may indicate that the plumes originate from a subsurface liquid ocean. Additionally, intense thermal radiation has been observed near the tiger stripes (within tens of meters). This could indicate that the radiation is associated with the plumes’ activitity, but the connection has not been studied in detail. Here, we investigate whether plumes originating from a subsurface liquid ocean can explain the observed vapor mass flux and heat flow. We investigate the fluid dynamics of the flow in the crack as well as interactions between the flow and ice walls. As the flow rises within the crack, some water vapor condenses on to the ice walls and releases latent heat. This heat is conducted through the ice and is eventually emitted to space by thermal radiation. The rest of the flow reaches the surface and is emitted to space as plumes. Furthermore, we consider the possibility that the total length of the cracks can be larger than that of the tiger stripes. We find that our model could explain the observed vapor mass flux and heat flow if the crack width is 0.05-0.075 m and each tiger stripe has ~1.7 fractures on average (the total length of the crack is 1.7× 500 km). The observed intense heat flow near the tiger stripes can be explained by latent heat release through vapor sublimation from the flow to the ice walls near the surface. Additionally, we find that if the flow contains 5-10 % of ice particles at the bottom of the flow (at the liquid-vapor interface), the ice to vapor ratio near the surface could reach 10-30 %. We find that the total mass flux of the plumes becomes larger when the crack width is larger, which is consistent with the observation that the plume mass flux increases near the apocenter where the crack width is expected to be largest. We discuss conditions to maintain the liquid subsurface ocean in our companion presentation (Ingersoll & Nakajima, 2015 AGU).",

Thus, the effects of road construction on wetland hydrological pathways can have significant implications on water movement within the region, and by extension the productivity of vegetation communities and carbon sequestration. However, little is known about the effect that roads have on wetland hydrology. In 2013, a gravel road built within a fen peatland was reclaimed to evaluate hydrologic impacts post removal. Prior to removal, ground and surface water flow was obstructed leading to surface ponding, and vegetation mortality was observed on the up-gradient (wet) side of the road. Rebounding of the peat column was observed throughout the fen immediately following road removal in 2013 (maximum of 12 cm, mean of 2 cm), with modest but slightly smaller expansion in 2014. For both years, peat rebound was greatest in areas where the road was removed. Peat physical properties contrasted sharply between the reclaimed road (RR) peat and the adjacent, unimpacted peatland (UP). Surface bulk densities (pb, 0-10 cm) ranged from 0.1-0.25 g cm-3 along the RR compared to 0.02-0.07 g cm-3 for the UP and on average, pb for all depths were lower at the RR compared to the UP. Similar spatial patterns were observed for peat porosity. Correspondingly low horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivities (Kh) were observed along the RR compared to the UP, averaging 5.7x10-4 m s-1 and 1.7x10-3 m s-1, respectively. The local flow system across the RR and thus subsurface flow was impeded by almost half (0.4 m d-1) compared to flow observed within the UP (0.8 m d-1), leading to ponding on the upgradient side. A marked change in hydrophysical properties and ground and surface water flow patterns post road removal has implications for plant reestablishment and restoration and will form the basis of further study.",

Using the VIC hydrological model, this study investigated the relative contribution of temperature and precipitation anomalies to the ongoing 2011-2015 drought in comparison with another multiyear drought between 1987 and 1992 over the same region. By swapping the observed temperature and precipitation anomalies between two drought events, the study was able to show how temperature and precipitation anomalies and their spatial variability affect other elements of the hydrological cycle including evapotranspiration, soil moisture and streamflow, thus the severity of the drought. The comparison between these two events helps to reveal the unique characteristics of the current drought and provides useful insights for drought prediction and mitigation.",

The DSCOVR spacecraft, which arrived at the first Earth-Sun Lagrange point in June 2015, bears the PLASMAG Faraday Cup Experiment. That instrument is identical in most respects to the Wind SWE Faraday Cup instrument that has been measuring 92-second proton spectra in the solar wind for the last twenty years.

However, BC observations are currently limited in space and time; leading to considerable uncertainties in the estimates of BC distribution from regional and global models. Here, we investigate the usefulness of carbon monoxide (CO) in quantifying BC across continental United States (CONUS). We use high resolution EPA AQS observations of CO and IMPROVE BC to estimate BC/CO ratios. We model the BC and CO distribution using the community Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). We configured WRF-Chem using MOZART chemistry, NEI 2005, MEGAN, and FINNv1.5 for anthropogenic, biogenic and fire emissions, respectively. In this work, we address the following three key questions: 1) What are the discrepancies in the estimates of BC and CO distributions across CONUS during summer and winter periods?, 2) How do BC/CO ratios change for different spatial and temporal regimes?, 3) Can we get better estimates of BC from WRF-Chem if we use BC/CO ratios along with optimizing CO concentrations? We compare ratios derived from the model and observations and develop characteristic ratios for several geographical and temporal regimes. We use an independent set of measurements of BC and CO to evaluate these ratios. Finally, we use a Bayesian synthesis inversion to optimize CO from WRF-Chem using regionally tagged CO tracers. We multiply the characteristic ratios we derived with the optimized CO to obtain BC distributions. Our initial results suggest that the maximum ratios of BC versus CO occur in the western US during the summer (average: 4 ng/m3/ppbv) and in the southeast during the winter (average: 5 ng/m3/ppbv). However, we find that these relationships vary in space and time and are highly dependent on fuel usage and meteorology. We find that optimizing CO using EPA-AQS provides improvements in BC but only over areas where BC/CO ratios are close to observed values.Black Carbon (BC) emissions significantly affect the global and regional climate, air quality, and human health.

            "abstract": "The end-Permian mass extinction, 252 million years ago, was the most devastating loss of biodiversity in Earth’s history. Massive volcanic eruptions of the Siberian Traps and the concurrent burning of coal, carbonate, and evaporite deposits emplaced greenhouse and toxic gasses. Hyperthermal events of the surface ocean, up to 40°C, led to reduced gradient-driven ocean circulation which yielded extensive equatorial oxygen minimum zones. Today, anthropogenic greenhouse gas production is outpacing carbon input modeled for the end-Permian mass extinction, which suggests that modern ecosystems may yet experience a severe biotic crisis.\nThe Early Triassic records the 5 million year aftermath of the end-Permian mass extinction and is often perceived as an interval of delayed recovery. We combined a new, high resolution carbon isotope record, sedimentological analysis, and paleoecological collections from the Italian Werfen Formation to fully integrate paleoenvironmental change with the benthic ecological response. We find that the marine ecosystem experienced additional community restructuring events due to subsequent hyperthermal events and pulses of erosion.\nThe benthic microfauna and macrofauna both contributed to disaster communities that initially rebounded in the earliest Triassic. ‘Disaster fauna’ including microbialites, microconchids, foraminifera, and “flat clams” took advantage of anoxic conditions in the first ~500,000 years, dominating the benthic fauna. Later, in the re-oxygenated water column, opportunistic disaster groups were supplanted by a more diverse, mollusc-dominated benthic fauna and a complex ichnofauna. An extreme temperature run-up beginning in the Late Dienerian led to an additional hyperthermal event in the Late-Smithian which co-occurred with increased humidity and terrestrial run-off. Massive siliciclastic deposits replaced carbonate deposition which corresponds to the infaunalization of the benthic fauna.\nThe disaster taxa dominated community may represent an alternative ecological state. However, subsequent environmental changes including the return of an oxygenated water column, increased sea surface temperatures, and sedimentary influx led to continued restructuring of the benthic fauna throughout the Early Triassic.",

            "abstract": "While it is understood that river channel width is determined by fluxes of water and sediment, predictive models of channel width, and especially changes in width under non-stationary conditions, have proven elusive. Classic hydraulic geometry relations commonly used in numerical models and channel design typically scale width as a power law function of discharge, without consideration of bank properties. This study investigates the role of bank material in determining spatial and temporal variability in channel width and widening rates for semi-alluvial rivers that have experienced increases in flow. The 45,000 km2 Minnesota River Basin contains many semi-alluvial rivers that have been rapidly incising into fine-grained glacial deposits over the last 13,400 years in response to a catastrophic base level drop. Large, recent increases in streamflows have caused significant channel widening and migration, exacerbated erosion of channel (alluvial) banks and (consolidated till) bluffs, and dramatically increased sediment supply. Here we leverage multiple decades of aerial photos, repeat lidar surveys, Structure from Motion photogrammetry and sediment gaging to examine past, and predict future, changes in channel width. We use empirical observations and a simple model to examine whether semi-alluvial channels tend toward a single, or multiple, equilibrium channel width(s). Preliminary results suggest that under stationary hydrologic conditions (1930s - 1970s) channel width was relatively consistent among reaches underlain by alluvium versus consolidated till. Since the late 1970s the study area has undergone profound hydrologic changes, with geomorphically-active flows nearly doubling in magnitude. Alluvial reaches widened relatively quickly in response to the increase in flows, whereas reaches underlain by till have not seen the same amount of widening. Aerial lidar-based geomorphic change detection between 2005 – 2012 records channel width changes in response to an extreme flood in 2010 and corroborates the notion that alluvial reaches respond more quickly than do till counterparts. We use a bathymetric map and morphodynamic modeling to explore whether the rates of adjustment simply differ or whether differences in bank strength change the processes governing channel width adjustment.",

This research is being done in conjunction with the Fognet Project that is looking at the levels of monomethyl mercury in fog water.\nData collected reveal a fascinating variability in the amount of fog water collected across different scales of distance, elevation, time and location. In addition, a number of different types of mesh have been deployed and co-located to examine the variation in their fog water collecting capability in identical conditions. Mesh variations exhibit smaller variability across mesh type than had previously been expected.\nThis study documents results found thus far across the network and also discusses the quantification of the errors associated with tipping bucket rain gauge measurements of water volumes and thus the importance of tipping bucket rain gauge calibration.",

Results indicated that stream water was hyper saturated with methane (CH4), and moderately saturated with carbon dioxide (CO2), and nitrous oxide (N2O). The values of dissolved CO2 (88.3 μmol/L), dissolved CH4 (1.2 μmol/L), and dissolved N2O (0.02 μmol/L) found in the stream were 5.8, 432, and 2.3 times in excess of atmospheric equilibrium, respectively. Results of dissolved GHG measured in interstitial water across various sites: riparian dry (RZ-Dry), riparian wet (RZ-Wet), riparian mucky (RZ-Mucky), pool with fine textured bed sediments (IS-fine-sedpool), pool with coarse textured bed sediments (IS-coarse-sed-pool), and riffles (Riffle) indicated high variations in the degree of saturation of all three GHG. RZ-Mucky, RZ-Wet, and IS-fine-sedpool sites were hotspots of CH4 and CO2 relative to other sites. RZ-Dry sites were hotspots of N2O. Multiple linear regression models indicated that dissolved oxygen (D.O.) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) influenced dissolved CO2 and CH4 at most of the sites. Relationships between dissolved N2O and predictor variables were highly variable across all sites. Patterns of dissolved N2O in relatively oxic RZ-Dry sites (D.O. 5.3 mg/L) were positively correlated with nitrate (NO3) indicating nitrification as a dominant process in N2O production. In contrast, patterns of dissolved N2O were positively correlated with ammonium (NH4+) at RZ-Wet and RZ-Mucky sites where concentrations of D.O. were significantly lower compared to other sites.",

            "abstract": "Recurring Slope Lineae (RSL) are narrow, low-reflectance features forming on present-day Mars that have been hypothesized to be due to the transient flow of liquid water. RSL extend incrementally downslope on steep, warm slopes, fade when inactive, and reappear annually over multiple Mars years as monitored by the HiRISE camera on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). In the southern mid-latitudes of Mars, RSL are observed to form most commonly on equator facing slopes, but in equatorial regions RSL often “follow the sun”, forming and growing on slopes that receive the greatest insolation during a particular season. The temperature on slopes where RSL are active typically exceeds 250 K and often but not always exceeds 273 K, although sub-surface temperatures would be colder. These characteristics suggest a possible role of salts in lowering the freezing point of water, allowing briny solutions to flow. Confirmation of this wet origin hypothesis for RSL would require either (i) detection of liquid water absorptions on the surface, or (ii) detection of hydrated salts precipitated from that water. The mineralogical composition of RSL and their surroundings can be investigated using orbital data acquired by the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) also on board MRO, which acquires spectral cubes with 544 spectral channels in the visible to near-infrared range of ~0.36 μm to 3.92 μm [13], within which both liquid water and hydrated salts have diagnostic absorption bands at ~1.4 μm, ~1.9 μm, ~3.0 μm. Additionally, hydrated salts may have combination of overtones at other wavelengths from 1.7 μm to 2.4 μm. We present results from examination of individual pixels containing RSL at four different sites that confirm the hypothesis that RSL are due to present-day activity of briny water.",

            "abstract": "Fluid transport along faults is important throughout the seismic cycle due to the effects on fault strength. Rheological boundaries in the crust such as the quartz brittle-plastic transition coincide with permeability changes, and play an important role in controlling fluid distribution. Here we present a newly recognized mechanism for fluid migration through the brittle-plastic transition in an ancient San Andreas Fault analogue: The Pofadder Shear Zone in Namibia and South Africa. Breccias formed in elongate pods during the passage of an earthquake rupture through a fault stepover. These breccias form subvertical fluid pathways (perpendicular to the slip direction). Over time, many overprinting or adjacent ruptures could have allowed fluid migration over a large (~ kms) scale, facilitating fluid flow through a low porosity region of the crust. These pathways were subsequently closed during breccia compaction by crystal plastic flow, facilitated by the presence of fluids. Thus, fluid migration within and across the brittle-plastic transitional zone is time and rate dependent and can both cause fault weakening and strengthening. We observed breccias formed in slip events with displacements between ~1-15 cm, consistent with small to moderate magnitude earthquakes and/or tectonic tremor, which occurs at similar depths in the San Andreas Fault. In addition to providing a new way of identifying paleo-seismic slip in the rock record, these observations may help explain co- post-seismic fluid advection in mid-crustal faults. This process of local brecciation in stepovers may be the origin of cryptic geophysical signals such as tremor bursts in continental faults.",

The global warming increments constructed from the CMIP3 multi-model ensemble mean were added to the reanalysis and SST data to perform the future climate simulations. We found that the Hawaiian Islands are vulnerable to global warming effects and the changes are diverse due to the varied topography. The windward side will have more clouds and receive more rainfall. The increase of the moisture in the boundary layer makes the major contribution. On the contrary, the leeward side will have less clouds and rainfall. The clouds and rain can slightly slow down the warming trend over the windward side. The temperature increases almost linearly with the terrain height. Cloud base and top heights will slightly decline in response to the slightly lower trade wind inversion base height, while the trade wind occurrence frequency will increase by about 8% in the future. More extreme rainfall events will occur in the warming climate over the Hawaiian Islands. And the snow cover on the top of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa will nearly disappear in the future winter.",

            "abstract": "The transition to quasi-periodic ~100-kyr glacial cycles during the mid-Pleistocene transition (MPT, ~1.2 Ma) saw an acceleration of sediment delivery from the St. Elias orogen. Eroded sediment from the St. Elias Mountains is transferred to the deep sea via glacially carved shelf troughs and eventually to the Aleutian Trench via the Surveyor Channel and Fan system. By analyzing the submarine sediments in this Fan, we can evaluate the source-to-sink relationship between the erosion of an orogen and deep-sea deposition and inform our understanding of the impact of climate on local tectonics. Our work seeks to update depositional models of the unique sedimentary sequences, architecture, and origins of the glacially-fed Surveyor Fan using well-log-seismic correlation and new data from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 341. Exp. 341 results question proposed ages of major fan stratigraphic packages, necessitating this update. We created an integrated velocity model using discrete core-based p-wave velocities acquired at site U1417 from 100-152m, down-hole sonic log velocities from 152m-476m, and then projected the trend of the sonic log velocity from 476m to the base of the borehole. Previous work has interpreted the Sequence I/II boundary (~300 mbsf at U1417) to correspond with the start of the Surveyor Fan and the onset of tidewater glaciation in the late Miocene and the Sequence II/III boundary (~160 mbsf at U1417) to coincide with the intensification of glaciation and subsequent increase in sediment flux at the MPT. Our updated velocity model places these major sequence boundaries at the correct depths in borehole site U1417. We can use the revised velocity model to correlate lithologic, biostratigraphic, paleomagnetic, and logging data from the borehole/cores to seismic data, allowing for construction of a temporal model for the evolution of the Surveyor fan. We can then examine the relationship between glacial-interglacial cycle duration and intensity with distal sediment flux. Integration with provenance studies can address potential changes in orogen response to deformation and erosion patterns and changes in fan evolution to changing sediment flux.",

            "abstract": "The influence of snow on climate in general circulation models (GCMs) has proven challenging to effectively model because of imperfect knowledge and parameterization of arctic and sub-arctic climate processes, and a shortage of reliable observations for model assessment and development. This analysis uses several satellite-derived datasets to evaluate how well the current generation of climate models from the fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) simulate the seasonality of climatological snow cover fraction (SCF) and surface albedo over the Northern Hemisphere extratropical snow season (September – June). Using a variety of metrics, the CMIP5 models are found to simulate SCF evolution better than that of albedo. The seasonal cycle of SCF is well reproduced despite substantial biases in simulated surface albedo of snow-covered land (αsfc_snow), which affect both the magnitude and timing of the seasonal maximum in αsfc_snow during the fall snow accumulation period, and the springtime snow ablation period. Insolation-weighting demonstrates that the biases in αsfc_snow during spring are of greater importance for the surface energy balance. Albedo biases are greatest across the boreal forest, where the simulated seasonal cycle of albedo is biased high in 15/16 CMIP5 models. This bias is explained primarily by unrealistic treatment of vegetation masking and subsequent overestimation (more than 50% in some cases) of peak αsfc_snow, rather than by biases in SCF. While seemingly straightforward corrections to peak αsfc_snow could yield significant improvements to simulated snow albedo feedbacks, changes in αsfc_snow could potentially introduce biases in other important model variables such as surface temperature.",

            "abstract": "River systems play an important role in both transporting and altering organic carbon fixed in terrestrial systems. However, there is a key gap in our understanding of riverine fluxes due to the lack of systematic measurements made in the lower, tidally-influenced reaches of large river systems. For example, the traditional end-member for the Amazon River is located at Óbidos, which is 900km from the mouth of the river. Below this point, tides produce semi-diurnal fluxes to and from floodplains and channels, resulting in complete flow reversal without salinity intrusion.\nThe lower Amazon remains a critical study area because (1) outgassing rates in tropical rivers are extremely high, typically exceeding temperate counterparts and (2) the Amazon’s discharge represents a significant proportion of global freshwater input to the ocean(~20%). Furthermore, a lack of measurements in this area due to sampling difficulties means that the processes governing biogeochemical dynamics in this region remain unconstrained.\nIn this study, we implemented a continuous, in-situ equilibrator system for the real-time measurement of pCO2, 13C-CO2, and [O2]. Measurements were collected along various river transects, at floodplain margins and river confluences, and during transit up and down the river. Cruises were planned to coincide with various stages of the hydrograph, with measurements collected at high water, low water and falling water.\nHigh-resolution measurements showed both temporal changes in pCO2 and 13C-CO2, and also allowed us to identify “hotspots” of increased pCO2. Within the lower river, several of these hotspots coincided with river confluences and floodplain margins. Measurements over the course of tidal cycles revealed little change in dissolved gas measurements within the mainstem. This approach shows the importance of considering spatial variability in large, dynamic systems influenced by tidal fluxes.",

            "abstract": "OFIDIA (Operational FIre Danger preventIon plAtform) is a two-year project started in May 2013 funded by the European Territorial Cooperation Programme Greece Italy (2007 – 2013). The project aims to improve the operational capability of forecasting, preventing, and fighting forest wildfires, and enhance the cross-border cooperation for fire danger assessment. More specifically, OFIDIA aims at developing an operational fire danger prevention platform, with the ability for near real-time fire danger forecast and fire behaviour analysis in Apulia (Italy) and Epirus (Greece) regions to help forest fires services in the effective prevention and response to forecasted danger.\nOne of the preliminary activities of the project was the evaluation of fire danger performances by analysing the relationship between the predicted daily fire danger and observed fire activity (number of fires and area burned). To achieve this task, fire activity and danger patterns were characterised and their relationships were investigated for the period 2000-2012. The Italian Forest Service (CFS, Corpo Forestale dello Stato) provided fire statistics at NUT03 level. The data were homogenized and uncertainties corrected, and then burned area and number of fires were analysed according to the main fire regime characteristics (seasonality, fire return interval, fire incidence, fire size distribution, etc). Then, three fire danger models (FFWI, FWI, and IFI) were selected and computed starting from the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University–National Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5) forecast.\nResults showed a high inter- and intra-annual variability in fire activiy, also considering the different type of affected vegetation. As for other Mediterranean areas, a smaller number of large fires caused a high proportion of burned area. Furthermore, fire activity showed significant correlations with the outputs obtained by the applied models. High relationships were found between fire danger and fire occurrence, confirming the importance of the prediction to forecast fire occurrence in these areas.\nFor further information on the OFIDIA project please visit the web site (www.ofidia.eu)",

            "abstract": "Tiled web maps in browsers are a major success story, forming the foundation of many current web applications. Enabling tiled data access is the next logical step, and is likely to meet with similar success. Many ad-hoc approaches have already started to appear, and something similar is explored within the Open Geospatial Consortium. One of the main obstacles in making browser data access a reality is the lack of a well-known data format. This obstacle also represents an opportunity to analyze the requirements and possible candidates, applying lessons learned from web tiled image services and protocols. Similar to the image counterpart, a web tile raster data format needs to have good intrinsic compression and be able to handle high byte count data types including floating point. An overview of a possible solution to the format problem, a 2D data raster compression algorithm called Limited Error Raster Compression (LERC) will be presented. In addition to the format, best practices for high request rate HTTP services also need to be followed. In particular, content delivery network (CDN) caching suitability needs to be part of any design, not an after-thought. Last but not least, HTML 5 browsers will certainly be part of any solution since they provide improved access to binary data, as well as more powerful ways to view and interact with the data in the browser. In a simple but relevant application, digital elevation model (DEM) raster data is served as LERC compressed data tiles which are used to generate terrain by a HTML5 scene viewer.",

            "abstract": "Iron carbides Fe7C3 and Fe3C have been proposed as candidates for the dominant components of the Earth's inner core to explain its density deficit and velocity discrepancy with respect to those of pure iron at relevant pressure-temperature conditions (e.g. Chen et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2014; Gao et al., 2011). Testing the hypothesis of carbon-rich inner core requires knowledge of the thermal equations of state of the iron carbides to megabar pressures. Existing experimental data, however, are restricted to either ambient temperature or the pressures near the top of the lower mantle. In particular, the thermal expansion coefficients of the carbides under high pressures remain poorly constrained. Previous studies showed that both Fe7C3 an Fe3C are Invar-type alloys with extremely low thermal expansions in the ferromagnetic phases, and their thermal expansion coefficients more than triple across the ferromagnetic–paramagnetic transition at 1 bar (Litasov et al., 2015). On the other hand, both iron carbides experience pressure-induced spin transitions under high pressures (e.g. Chen et al., 2012; Prescher et al., 2012), but their effects on the thermal expansion are still unknown.\nWe conducted synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements on Fe7C3 and Fe3C up to the core’s pressure and temperature conditions. High pressures up to ~140 GPa were generated by using diamond anvil cells (DAC), while high temperatures were generated using the whole-cell resistive heating device up to 700 K, and using the double-sided laser-heating system up to ~ 3500 K. The new data allow us to construct the magnetic phase diagrams of Fe7C3 and Fe3C and to assess the influences of magnetic transitions on their thermal expansion coefficients. The density profiles of appropriate magnetic phases are calculated and compared with that of the Earth’s inner core to estimate its carbon content.",

            "abstract": "It is a common practice for urban areas in the south to control the mosquito population through the routine spraying of pesticides utilizing ultra-low volume (ULV) foggers, either aerially or from trucks. Adult mosquitoes are known disease-borne vectors, including, but not limited to, West Nile Virus. Common mosquito adulticides include Permethrin (a pyrethroid) which is a neurotoxin. The EPA has labelled this pesticide good for mosquito treatment due to low cost, high effectiveness and low pest resistance. Permethrin is released directly into the atmosphere during active ULV fogger spraying, resulting in potentially significantly elevated atmospheric concentrations for hours to days after spray event. The metropolitan area of Houston, TX has a population of nearly 6 million people, making it the fourth most populous city in the U.S., and covers over 9000 square miles. During the DISCOVER-AQ sampling campaign in September 2013, nearly 300 atmospheric particular matter samples were collected during the month-long sampling campaign at four different locations in the Houston metropolitan area. Both total suspended particle (TSP) and particulate matter less than 2.5 microns in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) samples were collected, the latter of which is more readily inhaled and presents a greater risk to human health. Harris County, the main county of the Houston metropolitan area, controls mosquito for ~4-7 months, annually, covering the summer months. During 2013, Harris County utilized Permethrin as one of two pesticides in a weekly rotation from April to October. Proposed daily ULV treatment plans are published online on a neighborhood scale (Zip Code). Preliminary atmospheric concentrations show that Permethrin has been detected coinciding with days when treatment was proposed by the county. During or directly after use, atmospheric concentration of Permethrin were measuring at typically >10 ng m-3, but as high as 90 ng m-3. Atmospheric concentrations were also examined at downwind receptor sites. Size distributions (TSP v. PM2.5) were also examined.",

Our goal was to evaluate the seasonal and interannual variations in CO2 exchange for a grass-dominated Cerrado stand over a three-year period and to elucidate the biophysical controls on CO2 exchange. We hypothesized that soil water availability (SWA) would be a key control over the direction and magnitude of CO2 exchange. Field measurements were conducted Mar 2011- Dec 2013 at the Fazenda Miranda, located 15 km SSE of Cuiabá, Mato Grosso, Brazil. Net CO2 (NEE), latent, and sensible heat fluxes were quantified using eddy covariance. NEE was strongly affected by SWA; however, other biophysical variables were also important in controlling temporal patterns of CO2 exchange. Step-wise regression revealed four variables that explained 69% of the seasonal and interannual variation in gross primary production (GPP), and GPP increased as a function of the MODIS enhanced vegetation index (EVI), solar radiation (Rs), and soil water content (θs) but declined as a function of the vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Similarly, stepwise regression identified six variables that explained 78% of the variance in ecosystem respiration (Reco), and Reco was positively related to air temperature, the EVI, Rs, and θs and negatively correlated with VPD and precipitation. Consistent net CO2 losses during the dry season caused a cumulative net CO2 loss of 840 gC/m2 over the 3 year study period. Periods of accumulated net loss occurred when the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration declined, which typically occurred between March and November of each year. The annual net CO2 losses are in contrast to rates of NEE reported for other cerrado ecosystems, and the differences between our results and those reported for other cerrado ecosystems may reflect the low average annual rainfall that occurred during the study period and/or the low water-holding capacity of the shallow, coarse-grained soils typical of the Cuiaba Basin. These data indicate that seasonal and interannual drought can lead to high rates of CO2 emission from Brazilian savanna ecosystems, especially those with low soil water holding capacity",

A large portion of the N load is stored in groundwater before being discharged through base flow into streams. Understanding the groundwater-stream connection is crucial for determining the N flux to coastal waters. Nitrate in the groundwater and streamwater was studied in four low-relief, gaining coastal streams on the Delmarva Peninsula of Virginia with the goal of identifying factors important in controlling N flux. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) was measured by rising and falling head tests in piezometers installed at depths of 60, 100, and 150 cm below the sediment surface and in 70-cm-long sediment cores collected at each stream. Percent organic matter was determined along the sediment cores through weight-loss on ignition. Percent organic matter was inversely related to Ks, but both were extremely variable among the different samples at each stream, differing as much within a single stream as among streams. Ks was between <0.006 and 0.24 cm/sec, while organic matter content ranged from 0.3 to 42%. Nitrate concentrations in the streamwater were fairly similar among the streams and were always less than 8 mg NO3--N L-1. One site, Tommy’s Ditch, consistently had the highest concentrations, but also had the lowest groundwater NO3- concentrations. Another site, Cobb Mill Creek, had groundwater NO3- concentrations which were dramatically larger than the groundwater at the other streams (8.5 to 13.3 mg NO3--N L-1 compared to <0.1 to 3 mg NO3--N L-1). The notable differences in the N concentration of water at Cobb Mill Creek compared to the other streams may be related to their respective hydrologic settings. The relatively great topographic relief at Cobb Mill Creek may favor deep groundwater circulation, and such a flowpath could cause groundwater to bypass favorable zones for dentirfication, resulting in higher N concentrations persisting at very shallow depths under the stream channel.",

            "abstract": "Martian analogs, meteorites, and data from unmanned missions have greatly advanced our understanding of martian surface and near-surface processes. In particular, terrestrial analogs allow us to investigate Mars-relevant geomorphic, geochemical, petrogenetic, and hydrologic processes, as well as potential habitability. Craters of the Moon National Monument (COTM), located on the Snake River Plain of Idaho in the United States, represents a valuable phosphate-rich Mars analog, allowing us to examine phosphate minerals, important as volatile indicators and potential nutrient providers, under Mars-relevant conditions.\nCOTM is in an arid to semi-arid environment with sub-freezing lows much of the year. Though wetter than present day Mars (24 - 38 cm MAP) [1], COTM may be analogous to a warmer and wetter past Mars. The area is also the locale of numerous lava flows, a number of which have been dated (2,000 to >18,000 y.b.p.) [2]. The flows have experienced weathering over time and thus represent a chronosequence with application to weathering on Mars. The flows have unusual chemistries, including high average phosphate contents (P2O5 1.75 wt% n=23 flows) [2], close to those in rocks analyzed at Gusev Crater, Mars (P2O5 1.79 wt% n=18 rocks) [3]. The Mars-like high phosphorus contents indicate a potential petrogenetic link and are also of astrobiological interest. Further, current samples of Mars phosphate minerals are limited to meteorites which have been heavily shocked - COTM represents a potential pre-shock and geochemical analog to Mars.\nWe investigated weathering on COTM basalts and shock effects on Mars-relevant phosphate minerals. We used scanning electron microscopy, backscattered electron imagery, and X-Ray analysis/mapping to investigate COTM thin sections. Synchrotron diffraction was used to investigate martian meteorites and laboratory shocked Mars/COTM-relevant minerals for comparison.\nResults of our investigations indicate porosity development correlates with flow age, and shock alteration of phosphate minerals obscures the original phosphate mineralogy in martian meteorites. Thus COTM represents an important chronosequence and pre-shock mineralogy analog for Mars.\n[1] Vaughan et al. (2008) SSSAJ 75, [2] Kuntz, et al. (1992) GSA Mem. 179, [3] Adcock et al. (2013) Nat.

We have developed a technique to estimate the time-varying magnetic field at the Earth for periods within CMEs. This technique uses solar observational data and empirical relationships along with a constant alpha flux rope model to make the predictions. The technique can be more simply treated as the aggregate from two significant contributions: 1) Estimating the initial topological structure of the CME and 2) Estimating the hypothetical Earth-trajectory after CME evolutionary effects have been considered. In this presentation, we focus on how the evolutionary effects during interplanetary propagation affect the prediction made. We focus on how reliable the predictions are for CME events when the structural shape of the CME is well defined through triangulation of multi-point observations. We show that in such cases of reliable triangulation, the predictions are relatively well constrained to perturbations in the hypothetical Earth trajectory. However, we show how the predictions can be drastically different for cases where the CME direction and orientation remain ambiguous by removing the off Sun-Earth line observations.",

It has the largest emission rate of any non-methane VOC and is very reactive, and therefore has a major impact on the chemical composition of the atmosphere. Isoprene Hydroperoxides (IHP) are formed in the atmosphere from the chemical degradation of isoprene. These compounds can then potentially react in the atmosphere with atmospheric oxidants (ozone, OH, NO3) to produce secondary products. This chemistry is potentially important as it may contribute to particle growth and to mediation of ozone concentrations. In this work, the kinetics and mechanisms of the reactions of two IHPs with ozone were investigated. IHPs were synthesized and purified, and were characterized by NMR and HPLC. The gas phase chemistry of these compounds was then studied in chamber experiments using PTRMS as the primary analytical tool. The rate coefficients for reaction with ozone were measured at room temperature and 1 atmosphere using the relative rate technique, and yields of major gas phase reaction products were measured. Implications of these results will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The development of large fluvial distributary systems at the foot of mountain belts depends from the efficiency of sediment production and routing from the uphill catchments. Valley glaciers reaching the foreland during Pleistocene glaciations were very efficient conveyors of sediments to alluvial basins, as demonstrated by megafan progradation in the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) along the southern margin of the European Alps. In our study, stratigraphy of alluvial deposits, coupled by sand petrography and OSL and radiocarbon dating, allow to reconstruct the early aggradation of the Piave River megafan between 40 and 30 kyr BP, in response to the starting of ice accumulation in the higher Alpine catchments at the end of MIS 3. A lateral shift of 12 km of the megafan apex across the uplifting thrust-ramp anticline of the Montello hill has been framed at around 28 kyr BP. The river switched from a water gap to the neighboring one several times since the Lower Pleistocene, leading to the formation of 7 strath terraces at the western end of the Montello Hill. Our research indicates that the last river diversion took place at the onset of full glacial environmental conditions of the LGM. River shift had basin-scale impact on the overall distribution of both gravels and finer-grained sediments within 60 km from the mountain front. This suggests that abrupt changes of facies distribution and geometry of sedimentary bodies in alluvial basins, at the front of tectonically-active and cyclically-glaciated mountain chains, may primarily reflect climatically–driven fluctuations of sediment delivery from the highland glaciers, rather than variations in tectonic uplift, even if the river cuts through active and seismogenic (as for the Montello thrust) structures.",

Dense GPS and leveling data sets in Taiwan provide measurements of the present-day vertical deformation field over the entire Taiwan island. However, it is unclear how much of this vertical field is transient (varies over earthquake cycle) or steady (over millennial time scale). A deformation model is required to decouple transient from steady deformation. This study takes a look at how the 82 mm/yr of convergence motion between the Eurasian plate and the Philippine Sea plate is distributed across the faults on Taiwan. We build a plate flexure model that consists of all known active faults and subduction zones cutting through an elastic plate supported by buoyancy. We use horizontal and vertical GPS data, leveling data, and geologic surface uplift rates with a Monte Carlo probabilistic inversion method to infer fault slip rates and locking depths on all faults. Using our model we examine how different fault geometries influence the estimates of distribution of slip along faults and deformation patterns.",

The most dramatic thermospheric response is the intensification and upwelling of the thermospheric mass density. The neutral mass density is not only a key parameter to understanding the solar wind - IT coupling, but also plays an important role in understanding satellite orbital drag, which in turn impacts satellite position predictions. Results of numerical simulations and satellite observations (CHAMP and GRACE) have shown that the neutral mass density is rapidly intensified (within minutes) after the initial storm shock impact and also after the onset of storm main phase. This almost immediate response is typical of CME-driven storms in which the neutral density is enhanced first in the dayside polar cap and the intensification subsequently spreads out to all magnetic local time regions and lower latitude regions. We perform a superposed epoch analysis using CHAMP and GRACE satellite data as well as DMSP data to study the spatial and temporal distribution of the measured Poynting flux and neutral density response during the main phase of storms of different intensity. We also examine the correlation characteristics between Poynting flux and neutral density response, in space and time during the storm.",

In addition, it can be used in the indication of the post-depositional magnetic fabric re-working, or in tracing the magnetic fabric changes during pedogenesis. Recently developed techniques using anisotropy of frequency-dependent susceptibility (fdAMS) and anisotropy of out-of-phase susceptibility (opAMS) can assess the magnetic sub-fabrics of viscous particles on transition between SP and SSD. The width of the particle size interval investigated by the fdAMS is controlled by the operating frequencies used and their differences. In case of opAMS, the interval is always narrower than that in fdAMS and depends also on the operating frequency used. In three loess/paleosol sequences investigated in the Czech Republic, the degrees of AMS, fdAMS, and opAMS are significantly lower in paleosols than in loess horizons. This indicates that the preferred orientation of magnetic particles created during pedogenesis is much weaker than that of the particles deposited during loess formation. In addition, the degrees of fdAMS and opAMS are much higher than that of AMS. This may indicate strong anisotropy of viscous magnetic particles, because the fdAMS and opAMS are primarily controlled by them. The degree of AMS of the whole rock is low due to compensation effects of SP and SSD particles, whose grain anisotropies are anti-coaxial. The principal directions of AMS, fdAMS, and opAMS are mostly roughly co-axial suggesting more or less identical origins of magnetic sub-fabrics according to grain size. Less frequently, the principal directions of fdAMS or opAMS differ from those of AMS probably indicating post-depositional effects on particular grain-size classes. The fdAMS and opAMS show as powerful tools in the investigation of magnetic sub-fabrics due to different grain-size classes of magnetic minerals.",

This has allowed rich vibrational spectra to be observed for submicron particles, with detailed functional group and phase state information. Single particle pH is been developed to allow direct observation of individual particle pH through a combination of a spectral approach and an independent method based on changes in diameter at different relative humidities.

We outline a tiered observing strategy involving satellite, aircraft, and surface observations to identify these super-emitters and their contribution to regional methane emissions. We demonstrate this approach with field studies of agricultural and oil and gas sources in California’s San Joaquin Valley with cooperation a multi-stakeholder team. This partnership between researchers, regulators, and methane emitting industry took advantage of data sharing, site access, and complementary measurement approaches to identify appropriate methane mitigation targets. This experience suggests that collaborative partnerships that leverage multiple observational methods will be required for identifying methane mitigation targets and crafting regionally appropriate methane mitigation policy.",

            "abstract": "Iron-bearing magnesium carbonates (Mg,Fe)CO3 are believed the major carbon carriers in the Earth’s deep lower mantle; they may play a crucial role in the Earth’s deep carbon cycle. Knowledge of the physical and chemical properties of these carbonates is thus essential for our understanding of the mantle’s role in global carbon cycle. Experiments have shown that (Mg,Fe)CO3 ferromagnesite (calcite structure) can be stable up to 80-100 GPa. At 45-50 GPa, ferromangsite undergoes a high-spin to low-spin transition, accompanied by a volume reduction and elastic anomalies. Starting ~100 GPa, ferromagnesite goes through a complicated structural transition. The detail of this transition and the atomic structures of high-pressure (Mg,Fe)CO3 phases are still highly debated. Experimental observations and theoretical results are inconsistent so far. In experiments, several distinct high-pressure (Mg,Fe)CO3 structures have been reported, including a P21/c phase [1] and a Pmm2 phase [2]. In theory, a C2/m phase [3] and a P-1 phase [4] have been suggested, while the Pmm2 phase is not found. One possible reason for such a discrepancy is that all available theoretical calculations so far are based on pure MgCO3, while experimental works are performed using (Mg,Fe)CO3 with high iron concentration ( > 50%). Clearly, the concentration of iron and the possible iron spin crossover can significantly affect the stability of these high-pressure (Mg,Fe)CO3 phases. Here, we use density functional theory + self-consistent Hubbard U (DFT+Usc) calculations to study this structural transition. The effects of composition and iron spin state on these (Mg,Fe)CO3 phases are also discussed. Our results can be expected to provide insightful information for better understanding the Earth’s deep carbon cycle.\n[1] E. Boulard et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 108, 5184 (2011).\n[2] J.

The GLM on-board software is designed to allow a large amount of non-lightning data (noise) to be transmitted to the ground. This is done so that the ground software can remove the noise while at the same time preserving the weak lightning events in the data stream. The ground software has a noise filter that removes events that do not meet certain coherency requirements. The filter utilizes the location, time, and amplitude of the event, along with the background level to determine the likelihood that the event is actually due to lightning and not noise. Due to various constraints, the technique does not use all relevant information to determine the likelihood that the event is actually due to lightning. A more complete filter that uses the full extent of the information available, including clustering results, should produce better results. However, the extra coding and complexity needed to implement the full clustering based filter may not justify the slightly better results. To test the various filter options, this study uses GLM proxy data generated from numerous ground based and orbital sources that mimic the expected characteristics of the GLM lightning event data. These proxy data sets have noise data added, again based on the expected characteristics of GLM noise data. The full proxy data sets (noise and lightning) are filtered by the two methods and the results compared.",

However, due to the small magnitudes of LP events, only the most energetic part of the signals (as seen from velocity waveforms) is used in inversions. Ground displacement periods longer than 5 seconds - if they exist - are very difficult (if not impossible) to recover from such small signals due to the contamination of the signal by high-amplitude microseisms and the velocity signal base-line fluctuations (long-period instrumental noise). Consequently, the source-time functions (STF) obtained in LP inversions are band-limited representations of the true displacements in the source. Here we use a good-quality LP dataset recorded near the summit of Turrialba volcano. Aided by results from step table laboratory experiments we carefully recover the broadband ground motion displacement, containing frequencies much lower than 0.3 Hz observed on the velocity seismograms. The resulting MT solution that we recover is a classical earthquake “ramp” function, rather than a pulsing or oscillating waveform. We suggest that this new observation will contribute to a better understanding of LP seismicity.",

Little progress has been made in understanding the causes of these ongoing emissions or identifying their contributing sources. In this study, we employed multiple inverse modeling techniques (i.e. Bayesian and geostatistical inversions) to assimilate CCl4 mole fractions observed from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) flask-air sampling network over the US, and quantify its national and regional emissions during 2008 – 2012. Average national total emissions of CCl4 between 2008 and 2012 determined from these observations and an ensemble of inversions range between 2.1 and 6.1 Gg yr-1. This emission is substantially larger than the mean of 0.06 Gg/yr reported to the US EPA Toxics Release Inventory over these years, suggesting that under-reported emissions or non-reporting sources make up the bulk of CCl4 emissions from the US. But while the inventory does not account for the magnitude of observationally-derived CCl4 emissions, the regional distribution of derived and inventory emissions is similar. Furthermore, when considered relative to the distribution of uncapped landfills or population, the variability in measured mole fractions was most consistent with the distribution of industrial sources (i.e., those from the Toxics Release Inventory). Our results suggest that emissions from the US only account for a small fraction of the global on-going emissions of CCl4 (30 - 80 Gg yr-1 over this period). Finally, to ascertain the importance of the US emissions relative to the unaccounted global emission rate we considered multiple approaches to extrapolate our results to other countries and the globe.",

However, both inorganically and organically bound carbon forms are found in soil but estimates on global soil inorganic carbon (SIC) mass are even more uncertain than those for SOC. Globally, about 947 Pg SIC may be stored in the top 1 m, and especially in arid and semi-arid regions SIC stocks can be many times great than SOC stocks. Both SIC and SOC stocks are vulnerable to management practices, and stocks may be enhanced, for example, by optimizing net primary production (NPP) by fertilization and irrigation (especially optimizing belowground NPP for enhancing SOC stocks), adding organic matter (including black C for enhancing SOC stocks), and reducing soil disturbance. Thus, studies on soil C stocks, fluxes, and vulnerability must look at both SIC and SOC stocks in soil profiles to address large scale soil C cycling.",

Furthermore, multiphase rifts will display a greater frequency and range of styles of fault interactions than single-phase rifts. Although these models have yielded useful information on the map view evolution of fault networks, the 3D geometry of the faults and branchlines are poorly understood. Here, we use an integrated 3D seismic reflection and borehole dataset to examine fault interactions that occur in a natural multiphase fault network in the northern Horda Platform, northern North Sea. In particular we aim to: i) determine the range of styles of fault interaction that occur; ii) examine the typical geometries and throw patterns associated with each style; and iii) highlight the differences between single-phase and multiphase rift fault networks. Our study focuses on a region around the >60 km long, N-S-striking Tusse Fault, a normal fault system that was active in the Permian-Triassic and again in the Late Jurassic-to-Early Cretaceous. The Tusse Fault is one of a series of large N-S-striking faults forming part of the northern Horda Platform fault network, which includes numerous smaller (2-10 km long), lower throw (<100 m), predominantly NW-SE-striking faults that were only active during the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous. We examine how the 2nd-stage NW-SE-striking faults grew, interacted and linked with the N-S-striking Tusse Fault, documenting a range of interaction styles including mechanical and kinematic isolation, abutment, retardation and relay reactivation. We show that: i) isolated and abutting interactions are the most common fault interaction styles; ii) pre-existing faults can act as sites of nucleation for 2nd-stage faults or may form mechanical barriers to propagation; iii) the throw distribution on reactivated 1st-stage faults will be modified in a predictable manner if they are intersected or influenced by 2nd-stage faults; iv) sites of fault linkage and relay-breaching associated with the first phase of extension can act as preferential nucleation sites for 2nd-stage faults; and v) the development of fault intersections is a dynamic process, involving the gradual transition from one style to another.",

The onset of the eruption was marked by more than 8000 earthquakes (Wilcock et al., AGU-2015; Garcia et al., AGU-2015) and a drop in the seafloor of 2.4 m (Nooner et al., AGU-2015). Follow-on analyses of hydrophone data (Tolstoy et al., AGU-2015) pointed to the location of the eruption as the Northern Rift zone.\nDuring the OOI-NSF-UW Cabled Array maintenance cruise, the Northern Rift and eastern side of the caldera was mapped using the R/V Thompson’s EM302 system at. Differencing of 2007 (Hydrosweep) and 2013 EM302 bathymetric data indicated that the flow was ~ 7 km in length and up to 127 m thick, where it filled in a preexisting small depression. On July 26th, the ROV ROPOS dove near the toe of the northeastern lobe of the flow, the location of the highest bathymetric difference. The steep north face of this lobe is composed of glassy pillow flows: ROPOS ascended ~ 85 m before reaching the summit. Immediately upon reaching the summit, the vehicle was engulfed in a blizzard of biologically-produced ‘snowblower’ material issuing from distributed small sites of diffuse flow that reached 18°C. These areas hosted white filamentous bacteria, presumably methane metabolizers. Extensive areas of the flow summit were covered with orange microbial mats that completely masked the underlying pillows flows. Particle-poor diffuse fluids issued from microbially-covered collapse features along the summit, assumed to mark the main feeder channels. This eruption was markedly different than the Axial April 2011 eruption, which was characterized by vast sheet flows and extensive collapse zones.",

In this study, an integrated land surface and subsurface model enhanced with hydrologic exchange was assembled within the land component of an ESM (i.e., the Community Land Model (CLM) coupled with PFLOTRAN) to investigate how land surface and subsurface states and fluxes are influenced by the lateral flow and mixing of waters within the SIZ. The new model was applied to a domain including 400 m of the Columbia River shoreline where subsurface properties and processes have been well-characterized through sediment characterization, pump tests, tracer experiments, and field monitoring of river water intrusion events driven by river stage changes. Simulations of CLM-PFLOTRAN at multiple spatial resolutions were conducted using observed meteorological and river stage data under different climate and hydrologic conditions. The coupled model revealed the importance of interaction zone processes in regulating temporal and spatial variability in land surface and subsurface hydrological fluxes and state variables, indicating strong nonlinear coupling between hydrologic and biogeochemical processes in riparian zones. The simulations are validated against field measurements collected at the site. Our results provide a foundation for better understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of biogeochemical cycling and biogenic gas generation in the SIZ, and their regulation by the changing water cycle and climate.",

            "abstract": "Currently the functionality required to directly track the transport of regionally tagged chemical species does not exist in global models as it does in select regional models. While some global models contain adjoint formulations that allow for the concentration sensitivities of a given region to be determined, this method does not show how pollution from a given region impacts all the areas around it. The closest that global models get to directly tracking regionally tagged species have primarily been through brute-force or zero-out applications, which tend to be either very limited in scope or have significant impacts on chemical reaction rates. Specifically the tagged species approach captures both the non-linear behaviors within the model, missed in the brute-force method, and the full scope of the chemical reactions, missed in the zero-out applications.\nWith the ability to easily tag pollutants based on their source region it becomes realistic to estimate the impacts that sub-continent scale regions can have on air pollution levels. Depending on the resolution of both the model and available population data, it is possible to use this functionality to estimate exposure resulting from region specific pollution.\nIn this study we have implemented a module within the GEOS-Chem 3-D atmospheric composition model that will allow for this type of flexible region tagging for non-reactive species as a step towards being able to track species point of origin through chemical reactions. Functionally this module behaves similarly to the Particulate Matter Source Apportionment Technology (PSAT) feature within the Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) which tracks the species utilizing the various fluxes in each grid cell in the model.\nUtilizing this module we have divided the sub-Saharan into several distinct regions in order to track how dust from each region is transported around the globe. The results are compared to identify regional differences in how sub-Saharan dust from different regions is transported both regionally and globally. Furthermore we discuss how this data compares to satellite observations of sub-Saharan dust transport and the insights garnered through this comparison.",

However, the fault system is over 1200 km in length and has proven challenging to identify paleoseismic sites that preserve more than 2-3 Paleoearthquakes (PEQ). In 2012 and 2015 we developed the ‘Dead Mouse’ site, providing the first long PEQ record west of the 2002 rupture extent. This site is located on the west-central segment of the DF near the southernmost intersection of the George Parks Hwy and the Nenana River (63.45285, -148.80249). We hand-excavated three fault-perpendicular trenches, including a fault-parallel extension that we excavated and recorded in a progressive sequence. We used Structure from Motion software to build mm-scale 3D models of the exposures. These models allowed us to produce orthorectified photomosaics for hand logging at 1:5 scale. We document evidence for 4-5 surface rupturing earthquakes that have deformed the upper 2.5 m of stratigraphy. Age control from our preliminary 2012 investigation indicates these events occurred within the past ~2,500 years. Evidence for these events include offset units, filled fissures, upward fault terminations, angular unconformities and minor scarp-derived colluvial deposits. Multiple lines of evidence from the primary fault zones and fault splays are apparent for each event. We are testing these correlations by constructing a georeferenced 3D site model and running an additional 20 geochronology samples including woody macrofossils, detrital and in-situ charcoal, and samples for post-IR IRSL from positions that should closely constrain stratigraphic evidence for earthquakes. We expect this long PEQ history to provide a critical test for future modeling of recurrence and fault segmentation on the DF.",

Robustly testing this paradigm, however, requires a level of chronological precision currently lacking in terrestrial and marine records. Here we report a bidecadally-resolved New Zealand tree-ring sequence spanning two millennia that preserves a record of atmospheric radiocarbon (14C), allowing us to precisely align terrestrial, marine and ice sequences across a period encompassing ice-rafted debris event Heinrich 3 (H3) in the North Atlantic and Antarctic Isotope Maximum 4 (AIM4) in the Southern Hemisphere. We observe no significant difference in atmospheric and marine 14C records across H3 suggesting negligible impact on Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) but find that a climate downturn before AIM4 had a global impact, with warming in the North Atlantic (D-O 5.1) and a dramatic change in low latitude hydroclimate. Using the fully coupled CSIRO Mk3L climate system model we find that these trends are consistent with an Antarctic meltwater event propagated globally by atmospheric teleconnections. Our results suggest Southern Ocean dynamics played a significant role in driving global climate change across this period with implications for abrupt events through the late Pleistocene.",

The boreal region contains 50% of the world’s soil organic C, with northern peatlands accounting for 30% of that pool. However, climate change in this region, in the form of warming air temperatures, has the potential to release a significant portion of this C due to changes in ecosystem structure and function. In particular, permafrost thaw in low-lying, moderately ice-rich areas results in the formation of collapse-scar bogs, dramatically altering the C cycle. Recent studies have shown that the transition from permafrost plateau to thermokarst bog results in the rapid loss of silvic (forest) peat, followed by a slow accumulation of C in post-thaw bog peat. Results from these studies suggest that this transition may turn these areas from net C sinks to C sources in the decades to centuries following thaw. Here we examine a bog chronosequence located within the Tanana River floodplain of Interior Alaska to determine if this pattern of C loss and gain holds true. Peat cores were taken to mineral soil from a permafrost plateau and three bogs with different ages of thaw (within the last several decades, within the last century, and within the past several centuries). All sites were located within the Bonanza Creek Long-term Ecological Research (LTER) site near Fairbanks, AK. We examined how the complex history of these thermokarst features can affect the C cycle. Macrofossil analysis reveals that most cores contained multiple cycles of permafrost aggradation and degradation, with the permafrost aggradation occurring epigenetically after peat initiated from a floodplain fen. Differences in vegetation communities that form peat, and the respective bulk densities associated with fens, permafrost plateaus, and collapse-scar bogs, resulted in different C accumulation rates. These data will provide insight into the fate of C within thermokarst bogs with complex permafrost histories in Interior AK, ultimately providing a better understanding of past and present controls on the regional C balance.",

FW-SHS observations were compared with an already well-characterized dual-etalon Fabry Perot Interferometer (FPI) optimized for [Ha], also at PBO. The FW-SHS is a robust new Fourier-transform instrument that combines a large throughput advantage with high spectral resolution and a relatively long spectral baseline (~10x that of the FPI) in a compact, versatile instrument with no moving parts. Coincident [Ha] observations by FW-SHS and FPI were obtained over similar integration times, resolving power (~80,000 at [Ha]) and field-of-view (1.8 and 1.4 degrees, respectively). This paper describes the FW-SHS first light performance and [Ha] observational results collected from observing nights across 2013 and 2014.\nInitial FW-SHS observations of Balmer-alpha intensity and temperature (doppler width) vs. viewing geometry (shadow altitude) show excellent relative agreement with the geocoronal observations previously obtained at PBO by FPI. The FW-SHS is capable of determining geocoronal Balmer-alpha doppler shifts on the order of 100 m/s across a 640km/s [Ha] spectral bandpass, with a temporal resolution on the order of minutes. These characteristics make the FW-SHS well suited for spectroscopic studies of relatively faint, diffuse-source geocoronal Balmer-alpha emission from Earth’s upper atmosphere (~2-14R) and the interstellar medium in our Galaxy. Current and future observations expand long-term geocoronal hydrogen observation data sets already spanning two solar maximums.",

Hot spots and hot moments occur when dynamic soil hydrology triggers important shifts in soil biogeochemical and physical processes that control GHG emissions. Soil oxygen (O2), a direct control on biogenic GHG production (i.e., nitrous oxide-N2O, carbon dioxide-CO2 and methane-CH4), may serve as both an important proxy for determining sudden shifts in subsurface biogenic GHG production, as well as the physical transport of soil GHG to the atmosphere. Recent technological advancements offer opportunities to link in-situ, near-continuous measurements of soil O2 concentration to soil biogeochemical processes and soil gas transport. Using high frequency data, this study asked: Do soil O2 dynamics correspond to changes in soil GHG concentrations and GHG surface fluxes? We addressed this question using precipitation event-based and weekly sampling (19 months in duration) data sets from a restored riparian wetland in Ohio, USA. During and after precipitation events, changes in subsurface (10 and 20 cm) CO2 and N2O concentrations were inversely related to short-term (< 48 h) changes in soil O2 concentrations. Subsurface CH4 concentrations changes during precipitation events, however, did not change in response to soil O2 dynamics. Changing subsurface GHG concentrations did not necessarily translate into altered surface (soil to atmosphere) GHG fluxes; soil O2 dynamics at 10 cm did not correspond with changes in surface N2O and CH4 fluxes. However, changes in soil O2 concentration at 10 cm had a significant positive linear relationship with change in surface CO2­ flux. We used a random forest approach to identify the soil sensor data (O2, temperature, moisture) which contribute the most to predicting weekly GHG fluxes. Our study suggests that monitoring near-continuous soil O2 concentration under dynamic soil hydrology may lead to greater understanding of GHG emissions and incorporation of hot spots and hot moments into GHG modeling efforts.",

            "abstract": "Landscapes are mainly driven by river processes that control the dynamic reorganization of networks. Discovering and identifying whether river basins are in geometric equilibrium or disequilibrium requires an analysis of water divides, channels that shift laterally or expand upstream and river captures. Issues specifically discussed include the variation of drainage area change and erosion rates of the basins. In southeastern Brazil there are two main escarpments with extensive geomorphic surfaces: Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira Mountains. These landscapes are constituted of Neoproterozoic and early Paleozoic rocks, presenting steep escarpments with low-elevation coastal plains and higher elevation interior plateaus. To identify whether river basins and river profiles are in equilibrium or disequilibrium in Serra do Mar and Serra da Mantiqueira Mountains, we used the proxy (χ), evaluating the effect of drainage area change and erosion rates. We selected basins that drain both sides of these two main escarpments (oceanic and continental sides) and have denudation rates derived from pre-existing cosmogenic isotopes data (Rio de Janeiro, Paraná and Minas Gerais). Despite being an ancient and tectonically stable landscape, part of the coastal plain of Serra do Mar Mountain in Rio de Janeiro and Paraná is in geometric disequilibrium, with water divides moving in the direction of higher χ values. To achieve equilibrium, some basins located in the continental side are retracting and disappearing, losing area to the coastal basins. On the contrary, there are some adjacent sub-basins that are close to equilibrium, without strong contrasts in χ values. The same pattern was observed in Serra da Mantiqueira (Minas Gerais state), with stream captures and river network reorganization in its main rivers. The initial results suggest a strong contrast between erosion rates in the continental and the oceanic portions of the escarpments.",

            "abstract": "Organic carbon in soils can take on many chemical forms, cycle through different processes, and have different radiocarbon ages. In fact, measurement of different 14C ages in different chemical pools of soil organic carbon (SOC) has demonstrated that the radiocarbon “age” of SOC is more accurately discussed as the turnover time – a measure of the time it takes for SOC to cycle through a specific pool of carbon. Much has been learned, and is still being learned, about SOC turnover times by measuring ages of discrete reservoirs cycling over a continuum of time scales from minutes to millennia. Coupled measurements of radiocarbon age and thermochemical stability of SOC provide a novel approach to deconvoluting SOC turnover times from all present thermochemical reservoirs. We present results over a latitudinal gradient that relate thermochemical radiocarbon spectra to SOC turnover. From subtropical and temperate latitudes, radiocarbon spectra are nearly constant over the continuum of thermochemical stabilities. Contrast is evident at high latitudes, and where inputs of carbon from lateral transport and/or bedrock are high. In the active layer of soil from Svalbard, radiocarbon spectra span time scales of 102 – 105 14C y while in soil mineral horizons from Taiwan radiocarbon spectra varied between 4,000 and 13,000 14C y . Thus, as polar regions shrink and temperate/subtropical regions expand, thermochemical radiocarbon spectra provide a potential proxy for changes in SOC turnover time. Much remains to be investigated, however, before linking our observations to latitude. If the relationship holds, incorporation of such data into climate models enable more constraint on scenarios for anthropogenic warming such as the IPCC.",

            "abstract": "Positively buoyant volcanic plumes rise until the bulk density of the plume is equal to the density of the ambient atmosphere. As ambient air mixes with the plume, it lowers the plume bulk density; thus, the plume is diluted enough to reach neutral density in a naturally stratified atmospheric environment. We produced scaled plumes in analogue laboratory experiments by injecting a saline solution with a tracer dye into distilled water, using a high-pressure injection system. We recorded each eruption with a CASIO HD digital camera and used ImageJ’s FeatureJ Edge toolbox to identify individual eddies. We used an optical flow software based off the ImageJ toolbox FlowJ to determine the velocities along the edge of each eddy. Eddy densities were calculated by mapping the dye concentration to the RGB digital color value. We overlaid the eddy velocities over the densities in order to track the behavioral relationship between the two variables with regard to plume motion. As an eddy’s bulk density decreases, the vertical velocity decreases; this is a result of decreased mass, and therefore momentum, in the eddy. Furthermore as the density rate of change increases, the eddy deceleration increases. Eddies are most dense at their top and least dense at their bottom. The less dense sections of the eddies have lower vertical velocities than the sections of the eddies with the higher densities, relating to the expanding radial size of an eddy as it rises and the preferential ingestion of ambient air at the base of eddies. Thus the mixing rate in volcanic plumes fluctuates not only as a function of height as described by the classic 1D entrainment hypothesis, but also as a function of position in an eddy itself.",

The model biases are comparable to those commonly found in coupled global coupled models (CGCMs): the Findlater jet is too weak, precipitations are underestimated over India while they are overestimated over South-East Asia and the Maritime Continent. The ASM onset is delayed by several weeks, an error which is also very common in current CGCMs.\nWe show that land surface temperature errors are a major source of the ASM low-level circulation and rainfall biases in our model: a cold bias over the Middle-East region weakens the Findlater jet while a warm bias over India strengthens the monsoon circulation in the Bay of Bengal. To explore the origins of those biases and their relationship with the ASM, a series of sensitivity experiments is presented.\nFirst, we show that changing the land surface albedo representation in our model directly influences the ASM characteristics by reducing the cold bias in the Middle-East region. It improves the “heat low” representation, which has direct implication on the Findlater jet strength and precipitation over India. Furthermore, the ASM onset is shifted back by almost one month in agreement with observations.\nSecond, a parameterization of the convective cloud-radiative feedback is introduced in the atmospheric model. It acts to reduce the warm bias present in convective regions such as India and favors the monsoon northward migration. As a consequence, the dry bias is reduced in this region.\nFinally, horizontal resolution is increased from 0.75° to 0.25° for both oceanic and atmospheric models to assess the sensitivity of the ASM biases to the model resolution. Large-scale model errors persist at higher resolution, but are significantly attenuated. Precipitation is improved in mountainous areas with strong orographic control, but also in other regions where orography is weak such as central India.",

Additionally, the ESAO hosts 80% of the world’s subsea permafrost, and presumably holds large amounts of methane in sediments as gas hydrate and free gas. Despite these vast stores of vulnerable carbon, the ESAO is sparingly explored. Here, we present pore water geochemistry results from cores taken during the SWERUS-C3 international expedition and along five transects. Four of these are along the slopes of Arlis Spur, Central East Siberia, Henrietta Island-Makarov Basin, and Eastern Lomonosov Ridge; one is along the shelf in Herald Trough.\nUpward methane flux toward the seafloor, as inferred from dissolved sulfate and alkalinity profiles, is negligible on slopes the Arlis Spur, Central East Siberia, and Eastern Lomonosov Ridge. Methane flux from slopes near Henrietta Island and Makarov Basin ranged from 13.7 (367 m water depth) to 16.2 mmol/m2-kyr (964 m water depth). The highest flux on the slope, located at the intersection with Lomonosov Ridge, is 25.8 mmol/m2-kyr. In contrast to the generally low methane fluxes of the continental slope, the shelf sediments in Herald Trough have high upward methane fluxes, with measured rates up to 156.9 mmol/m2-kyr. These methane results are the first of their kind in this climatically sensitive region, and contradict previous assumptions regarding high methane flux rates along the slope.",

We investigate seismicity in the vicinity of the EGS development at The Geysers Prati-32 injection well to determine moment magnitude, focal mechanism, and kinematic finite-source models with the goal of developing a rupture area scaling relationship for the Geysers and specifically for the Prati-32 EGS injection experiment. Thus far we have analyzed moment tensors of M ≥ 2 events, and are developing the capability to analyze the large numbers of events occurring as a result of the fluid injection and to push the analysis to smaller magnitude earthquakes. We have also determined finite-source models for five events ranging in magnitude from M 3.7 to 4.5. The scaling relationship between rupture area and moment magnitude of these events resembles that of a published empirical relationship derived for events from M 4.5 to 8.3. We plan to develop a scaling relationship in which moment magnitude and corner frequency are predictor variables for source rupture area constrained by the finite-source modeling. Inclusion of corner frequency in the empirical scaling relationship is proposed to account for possible variations in stress drop. If successful, we will use this relationship to extrapolate to the large numbers of events in the EGS seismicity cloud to estimate the coseismic fracture density. We will present the moment tensor and corner frequency results for the micro earthquakes, and for select events, finite-source models. Stress drop inferred from corner frequencies and from finite-source modeling will be compared.",

This is done by calibrating against the known galactic background radiation spectrum after removal of receiver noise and thermal plasma noise where possible. Flux density spectra and lower limits to the maximum brightness temperature are determined for three type II and three type III radio bursts based on two calibration methods, one of which uses the effective antenna lengths as a function of frequency. The second calibration method uses Wind data for the relative flux in dB to equate the minimum flux observed with the galactic background and receiver noise. The results emphasize that the second method is more successful in obtaining calibrated type II and III fluxes. Calibrated flux densities obtained show that The type IIs have similar maximum flux densities to the type III events in this sample, but the type IIs are much more variable in frequency and time. Theoretical predictions are obtained for shocks moving with a suitable range of initial speeds and accelerations. Dynamic spectra are then predicted for the three selected type II events using the theory of Knock et al. [2001] and a simple, unstructured, solar wind model. Because of the continuous emission of 24-26 August 1998 that is present in a wide range from 100 MHz to 21 kHz, albeit with strongly varying intensity, a comparison between its observed and predicted dynamic spectra is presented. The agreement between theory and data is discussed and the implications described for future modeling.",

            "abstract": "Recent literature investigating active folding indicates that crustal-scale anticlines grow primarily through slip on underlying faults. Such studies use the geometry and uplift rates of active fault-related folds to infer fault slip rate based upon an assumed kinematic relationship between fault slip and particle motion in the surrounding crust. Our method uses a boundary element model of flexural slip folding called BEAFS (Boundary Element Analysis of Flexural Slip), allowing us to focus on the mechanics of deformation.\nIn many cases, the shallow geometry (<5km) of natural folds are well constrained by subsurface data. However, the geometry of the causative blind thrust faults are often not well imaged. By comparing our numerical simulations with published subsurface and surface data on naturally occurring active folds, we can determine fault geometry and the extent to which various mechanisms are controlling fold evolution. For this work, we present our model results for the underlying faults at Kettleman Hills South Dome, Kettleman Hills North Dome, and Coalinga Anticline in the San Joaquin Valley of Central California. The rupturing of blind thrust faults associated with actively growing anticlines such as these pose a significant global seismic hazard. Our study area is of particular interest as it is the site of two such recent earthquakes—a Mw=6.5 earthquake in 1983 at Coalinga and a Mw=6.1 in 1985 at Kettleman Hills North Dome. Thus, we can compare the published earthquake data from these events to the parameters predicted by our model results from BEAFS.",

These processes range from polar ice sheet dynamics and mass balance, hydrological processes including deep aquifers, ocean mass transport, glacial isostatic adjustment, and even large earthquakes. GRACE has provided data that is not only critically valuable on its own, but also as an excellent complement to ocean altimetry, radar, and soil moisture measuements to more fully characterize these complex processes. The value of this data led to the development of the GRACE Follow-On mission, set to launch in 2017. In this talk, we will review the history of gravity mapping from space, the realization of the value of measuring time variable gravity vs the static mean field, the future technologies in this field, and the inextricable linkage between GRACE and other geodetic techniques. We will also highlight the key science findings of the mission.",

Scientific relevancy may be defined by mapping the impacts of a particular NASA mission, instrument, and/or retrieved variables to disciplines such as climate predictions, natural hazards detection and mitigation processes, education, and scientific discoveries. Related to relevancy, is the ability to expose data with similar attributes. This in turn depends upon the ability for us to extract latent, implicit document features from scientific data and resources and make them explicit, accessible and useable for search activities amongst others.\nThis paper presents MemexGATE; a server side application, command line interface and computing environment for running large scale metadata extraction, general architecture text engineering, document classification and indexing tasks over document resources such as social media streams, scientific literature archives, legal documentation, etc. This work builds on existing experiences using MemexGATE (funded, developed and validated through the DARPA Memex Progrjam PI Mattmann) for extracting and leveraging latent content features from document resources within the Materials Research domain. We extend the software functionality capability to the domain of scientific literature with emphasis on the expansion of gazetteer lists, named entity rules, natural language construct labeling (e.g. synonym, antonym, hyponym, etc.) efforts to enable extraction of latent content features from data hosted by wide variety of scientific literature vendors (AGU Meeting Abstract Database, Springer, Wiley Online, Elsevier, etc.) hosting earth science literature. Such literature makes both implicit and explicit references to NASA datasets and relationships between such concepts stored across EOSDIS DAAC’s hence we envisage that a significant part of this effort will also include development and understanding of relevancy signals which can ultimately be utilized for improved search and relevancy ranking across scientific literature.",

            "abstract": "Age distributions of base flow to streams are important to estimate for predicting the timing of water-quality responses to changes in distributed inputs of nutrients or pollutants at the land surface. Simple models of shallow aquifers will predict exponential age distributions, but more realistic 3-D stream-aquifer geometries will cause deviations from an exponential curve. In addition, in fractured rock terrains the dual nature of the effective and total porosity of the system complicates the age distribution further. In this study shallow groundwater flow and advective transport were simulated in two regions in the Eastern United States—the Delmarva Peninsula and the upper Potomac River basin. The former is underlain by layers of unconsolidated sediment, while the latter consists of folded and fractured sedimentary rocks. Transport of groundwater to streams was simulated using the USGS code MODPATH within 175 and 275 watersheds, respectively. For the fractured rock terrain, calculations were also performed along flow pathlines to account for exchange between mobile and immobile flow zones. Porosities at both sites were calibrated using environmental tracer data (3H, 3He, CFCs and SF6) in wells and springs, and with a 30-year tritium record from the Potomac River. Carbonate and siliciclastic rocks were calibrated to have mobile porosity values of one and six percent, and immobile porosity values of 18 and 12 percent, respectively.\nThe age distributions were fitted to Weibull functions. Whereas an exponential function has one parameter that controls the median age of the distribution, a Weibull function has an extra parameter that controls the slope of the curve. A weighted Weibull function was also developed that potentially allows for four parameters, two that control the median age and two that control the slope, one of each weighted toward early or late arrival times. For both systems the two-parameter Weibull function nearly always produced a substantially better fit to the data than the one-parameter exponential function. For the single porosity system it was found that the use of three parameters was often optimal for accurately describing the base-flow age distribution, whereas for the dual porosity system the fourth parameter was often required to fit the more complicated response curves.",

The current model of PMA-qPCR operates under the assumption that PMA is only capable of entering membrane-compromised cells, where it irreversibly cross-links to DNA and makes it unavailable for amplification via qPCR. However, the exact mechanism behind PMA’s entry into the cell and its interaction with genetic material is not well understood. To better understand PMA’s capabilities, we have examined the effect PMA has on enzyme binding and processivity using endonucleases and exonucleases. Our results suggest that the current model behind PMA-qPCR inhibition is incomplete, in that rather than precipitating the entirety of the DNA, PMA also inhibits enzyme binding and/or processivity in soluble DNA. These results have important implications for studying the viable community of microorganisms in various applications, such as environmental monitoring, planetary protection and bioburden assessment, and biohazard detection.",

            "abstract": "Ground, surface, and atmospheric water affected the Okmok (central Aleutians, Alaska) 2008 eruption in diverse ways. An initial 16-km-high column produced a widespread coarse fallout. Explosion breccias and lithic-rich fallout overlie this deposit proximally, topped by an ash with abundant accretionary lapilli and ash pellets. After this, a water-rich flood, likely from ejected lake water, left deposits in the eastern caldera. Pyroclastic density currents traveled northward in the caldera, leaving both coarse-ash dune forms and massive unsorted deposits. We interpret these to mark vent opening or widening, with diverse currents forming in different sectors due to directed explosions and partial column collapse. The rest of the eruption was characterized by water-rich ash and steam columns 1-4 km high, with brief <9-km-high periods. Several vents formed during the eruption; one enlarged a pre-existing lake and others formed a new lake, a small tuff ring, and a 300-m-high tuff cone. Surface water, shallow groundwater in coarse sediments, and atmospheric water were abundantly available throughout the eruption. Cone D Lake (13.6 Mm3 volume) drained into the North vent 7-10 days into the eruption, with massive groundwater and sediment removal. Nearby pit craters have no ejecta; surficial lava collapsed when underlying sediments were removed. The eruption column was typically gray or white, rarely black, and ashfall dominates the deposits at all localities, reflecting efficient fragmentation and deposition. Scrubbing of the plume by erupted and atmospheric water caused rapid deposition of the ash, so deposits thin rapidly away from the vent. Laminae and thin lenses dominate the deposits outside the caldera whereas some intracaldera deposits are massive beds up to several decimeters thick. Wind-blown ash-laden mist made low-angle ripples and discontinuous laminae; ash rain deposited continuous laminae. A capping vesicular ash (Av soil horizon) formed as a water-saturation front trapped air in the ash. These observations highlight how water affected fragmentation, transport, and deposition during the 2008 Okmok eruption.",

            "abstract": "One of the most powerful positive feedback mechanisms to anthropogenic climate change postulated is the increase in carbon emissions from polar-regions. Warmer temperatures at the poles is predicted to increase the rate of methanogensesis in thawing permafrost soils as well as destabilize the network of arctic marine and terrestrial methane hydrates. Recent estimates put the quantity of organic carbon stored in soils in the northern permafrost zone around 1,700 Pg of C, which is well in excess of the maximum carbon emissions necessary to limit global average temperature increase to only 2 C° (260-410 Pg of C between 2011 and 2100 as CO2). However, many climate models used to forecast changes in average global temperature and inform policy decisions do not take into account arctic carbon feedback. This is largely due in part to the daunting observational challenge presented by observing methane fluxes in the Arctic. An ideal measurement system must be able to distinguish between biological and anthropogenic methane sources, have the ability to cover large spatial ranges, and have the sensitivity to distinguish changes from season to season, and year to year. The FOCAL platform has been engineered to address these challenges and help bridge the gap in spatial coverage between ground based and inverse modelling studies. It consists of a small aircraft equipped with the best atmospheric turbulence (BAT) probe, and gas sensors for in situ measurements of CH4, CO2, δ13CH4, δ13CO2 to make regional scale surface eddy-covariance flux measurements of methane and carbon dioxide as well as their stable isotopologues. We will present data from the initial FOCAL flight series in August 2013 based out of Deadhorse, AK, including CH4 concentration and running flux data, as well as in situ δ13CH4 observations to gain mechanistic insight. With the FOCAL platform we were able to dramatically extend regional coverage of methane flux observations beyond what can normally be observe with tower flux measurements, and improve our understanding of the size and mechanism of the arctic contribution to the global carbon budget.",

            "abstract": "NASA Earth Exchange (NEX) is a data, supercomputing and knowledge collaboratory that houses NASA satellite, climate and ancillary data where a focused community can come together to address large-scale challenges in Earth sciences. As NEX has been growing into a platform for analysis, experiments and production of data on the order of petabytes in volume, it has been increasingly important to enable users to easily retrace their steps, identify what datasets were produced by which process or chain of processes, and give them ability to readily reproduce their results. This can be a tedious and difficult task even for a small project, but is almost impossible on large processing pipelines. For example, the NEX Landsat pipeline is deployed to process hundreds of thousands of Landsat scenes in a non-linear production workflow with many-to-many mappings of files between 40 separate processing stages where over 100 million processes get executed. At this scale it is almost impossible to easily examine the entire provenance of each file, let alone easily reproduce it. We have developed an initial solution for the NEX system - a transparent knowledge capture and reproducibility architecture that does not require any special code instrumentation and other actions on user’s part. Users can automatically capture their work through a transparent provenance tracking system and the information can subsequently be queried and/or converted into workflows. The provenance information is streamed to a MongoDB document store and a subset is converted to an RDF format and inserted into our triple-store. The triple-store already contains semantic information about other aspects of the NEX system and adding provenance enhances the ability to relate workflows and data to users, locations, projects and other NEX concepts that can be queried in a standard way. The provenance system has the ability to track data throughout NEX and across number of executions and can recreate and re-execute the entire history and reproduce the results. The information can also be used to automatically create individual workflow components and full workflows that can be visually examined, modified, executed and extended by researchers. This provides a key component for accelerating research through knowledge capture and scientific reproducibility on NEX.",

Sunset Crater, an alkali basalt (~3.7 wt.% alkalis) scoria cone volcano, erupted explosively in 1085 AD. We analyzed 125 primary melt inclusions (MIs) from Sunset Crater tephra deposited by 2 subplinian phases and 1 Strombolian explosion to compare magma volatiles and storage conditions. We picked rapidly quenched free olivine crystals and selected large volume MIs (50-180 µm) located toward crystal cores. MIs are faceted and exhibit little major element composition variability with minor post entrapment crystallization (2-10%). MIs are relatively dry but CO2-rich. Water content varies from 0.4 wt.% to 1.5 wt.% while carbon dioxide abundance ranges between 1,150 ppm and 3,250 ppm. Most MIs contain >1 wt.% H2O and >2,150 ppm CO2. All observed MIs contain a vapor bubble, so we are evaluating MI vapor bubbles with Raman spectroscopy and re-homogenization experiments to determine the full volatile budget. Because knowledge of volatile solubility is critical to accurately interpret results from MI analyses, we measured H2O-CO2 solubility in the Sunset Crater bulk composition. Fluid-saturated experiments at 4 and 6 kbar indicate shallower entrapment pressures for these MIs than values calculated for this composition using existing models. Assuming fluid saturation, MIs record depths from 6 km to 14 km, including groupings suggesting two pauses for longer-term storage at ~6 km and ~10.5 km. We do not observe any significant differences in MIs from phases exhibiting different eruptive styles, suggesting that while a high CO2 content may drive rapid magma ascent and be partly responsible for highly explosive eruptions, shallower processes may govern the final eruptive character. To track shallow processes during magma ascent from depth of MI-entrapment up to the surface, we are examining MI re-entrants.",

The timescales of mercury cycling are poorly constrained, and better knowledge of these would allow us to understand trends and responses to policies. We synthesize information from a global suite of observations to provide improved constraints on the global (past and present) mercury cycle and trends. We project future mercury emissions under policy scenarios consistent with the Minamata Convention, and assess their impacts on atmospheric concentrations, deposition, and the global biogeochemical cycle. We examine the importance of uncertainties, and identify key uncertainties in measurements and our understanding of atmospheric chemistry, ecosystem processes and human responses that affect our ability to link emissions to impacts. Finally, we draw conclusions about the ability for currently-available measurements and networks to evaluate levels and trends, and draw lessons for policy implementation.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of heat transfer mechanisms in arctic rivers is critical for forecasting the effects of climate change on river temperatures. Building on the collection of key data and a dynamic river temperature model that accounts for heat fluxes found important in temperate climates, we were able to identify portions of an arctic basin and hydrologic conditions for which heat flux dynamics differ from those found in temperate systems. During the open water season, similarities in heat flux influences include dominant shortwave radiation, greater surface exchanges than bed exchanges and greater influences of lateral inflows in the lower order portions of the basin. Differing from temperate systems, the heat flux contribution of net longwave radiation is consistently negative and both latent heat and bed friction are negligible. Despite these differences, accounting for the bulk lateral inflows from the basin resulted in accurate predictions during higher flows. Under lower flow conditions, however, lateral inflows were limited and resulting temperature predictions were poor. Work in a temperate system demonstrated that spatial variability in hydraulics influencing stream residence times are necessary for accurate river temperature predictions. Because heat fluxes at the air-water interface become increasingly dominant at low flows and these fluxes are sensitive to parameters representing the water surface area to volume ratio, similar to temperate systems, we expect that high-resolution representations of stream geometry and hydraulics are important both for accurate flux and residence time estimates. Furthermore, given the highly dynamic nature of flows in arctic basins, we anticipate that detailed information regarding spatially variable hydraulic characteristics (e.g., channel width, depth, and velocity) is critical for accurate predictions in low arctic rivers through a large range of flow conditions. Upon identifying key processes controlling temperatures and the corresponding data required to quantify these processes, novel remote sensing techniques are being developed to make such information accessible at targeted time periods, high spatial resolution, and basin scales.",

            "abstract": "The extent and density of forest trees in mountain landscapes is a first order control on watershed function, affecting patterns of snow accumulation, timing of snowmelt, and amount and quality of run-off, through alterations of surface energy and water fluxes and wind. Climate change is increasingly affecting the density and distribution of mature forests through changes to disturbance regimes, increases in physiological stress and increases in mortality due to warmer temperatures. In addition, climate change is likely altering patterns of regeneration and driving establishment of trees in high elevation meadows and alpine tundra. Though hard to detect in current forestry datasets, changes in tree establishment are critical to the future of forests. Experimental approaches, such as our climate warming experiment in the Colorado Front Range, can provide valuable data regarding seedling sensitivity to climate variability and change across important landscape positions. We’ve found that warming enhances negative effects of water stress across forest, treeline and alpine sites, reducing recruitment in the absence of additional summer moisture. At the lowest elevation, reductions with warming have reduced Engelmann spruce recruitment to zero. Species differ in their responses to warming in the alpine, but together confirm the importance of seed dispersal to upward forest shifts. The presence of trees or other vegetation can facilitate tree establishment by modifying microclimates, especially at and above treeline. Ultimately, these ecological and demographic processes govern the timescales of tree and forest responses to climate variability and change. For the long-lived species that dominate high elevation watersheds, these processes can take decades or centuries to play out, meaning many tree populations are and will continue to be out of equilibrium with a rapidly changing climate. Projecting changes in tree distributions and abundances across mountain landscapes requires integration of changes in hydroclimatic conditions across diverse topoclimatic settings; the sensitivity of recruitment, growth and mortality to climate; and feedbacks between trees and microclimate into modeling tools that represent time-explicit ecological and demographic processes.",

            "abstract": "The Earth's bow shock is known to be an efficient particle accelerator, with ions having energies exceeding 100 keV frequently seen at and upstream of the shock. This energization is generally attributed to diffusive shock acceleration, however, for this process to become effective the ions must first undergo an initial acceleration or injection process. How and where this takes place has not yet been fully determined, and it is a key issue in shock acceleration theory. We here investigate the nature of these ion acceleration processes at oblique quasi-parallel shocks, with particular focus on the contribution from specularly reflected ions. Using Cluster spacecraft observations we show that specular reflection events are common in the turbulent transition layer upstream of the shock, however, contrary to earlier belief, these appear more often to show ion distributions associated with a enegized reflection process than that of cold specularly reflected ion beams previously reported. In order to explain the origin of these signatures and their relation to the injected high-energy ion population upstream of the shock, we make use of a series of large two-dimensional hybrid simulations. The results show that almost all of the injected ions originate from reflection events localized in time and space, with upstream ion distributions that are in good agreement with the spacecraft observations. These reflection events develop in particular in the region where the trailing edge of large-amplitude upstream waves intercept the local shock ramp and the local upstream magnetic field configuration changes from quasi-perpendicular to quasi-parallel. We relate the results of our observations and simulations to previously suggested models for ion injection.",

This segment is the most inflated of the EPR due to its interaction with the Mathematician hotspot. The French PARISUB (\"Panache Ridge Submersible\") cruise in 2010 acquired high-resolution geophysical data using the Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) Aster-X and the manned submersible Nautile (Ifremer). The goal was to investigate in detail the magmatic and tectonic processes at the intersection between the hotspot and the ridge.\nWe investigate tectonic and volcanic processes using high-resolution data along the 16°N segment of the EPR. Near bottom bathymetric data (1 meter grid spacing) are improved by photos, videos and human observations from submersible survey. Data are used : 1/ to characterize in detail tectonic feature (faults and fissures) geometries (e.g., dip and vertical throw), 2/ to distinguish between different lava flows (pillow, lobate and sheet flows) and to locate lava sources defined in particular by flow front orientations and lava channels.\nIn a context of an unusual spreading segment under influence of a hot spot, these data allow us to evaluate how small-scale volcanic and tectonic processes near ASTs, interact for nucleation and evolution of faulting patterns, and affect tectonic stain evaluation. The distinction between eruptive and non-eruptive tectonic features allows to estimate the distribution of tectonic feature affected by magnetic overprinting. We propose two origins for nucleation and evolution of faults around the AST, and define relations between faults, lava flows and seismic layer 2A.",

            "abstract": "One of the most vital ecosystem services currently provided by the terrestrial biosphere is the removal of approximately one quarter of the anthropogenic CO2 emitted to the atmosphere. However, as patterns of temperature and precipitation change so is the frequency and intensity of ecosystem disturbance. Despite evidence that ecosystem disturbance regimes have shifted leading to widespread forest mortality, the net effect of disturbance on the carbon (C) balance of forest ecosystems remains uncertain. We will use satellite and atmospheric observations to deconvolve net carbon exchange (NEE) into its component fluxes of gross primary productivity and total respiration (e.g. NEE= GPP – R) at global to regional scales. At the global scale we find that NEE has increased over the last 50 years and appears to have accelerated as a result of diminished R over the last 15 years. However the variance in global NEE has also increased perhaps due to inter-annual variability in R, especially within semi-arid ecosystems. These global trends are not necessarily consistent with regional patterns in the net carbon balance, especially across the western US. Atmospheric mass balance suggests that ecosystems of North America have shifted from a net C sink to a net C source. While prolonged drought across the Western US has likely caused this shift in continental scale NEE, attributing this shift in the net C balance to any one mechanism of disturbance (e.g. drought, insect infestation, and fire) or their interactions is challenging. Lastly, we will evaluate existing observing networks, such as NOAA/ESRL and Ameriflux, and how they can be combined with nascent networks, such as NEON, EarthNetworks, and OCO-2, to identify regional disturbance processes that may be causing increasing variance in the global C cycle.",

            "abstract": "The response of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) to Pliocene warmth provides a critical way to gauge its sensitivity to climate change. Considerable uncertainty surrounds the Pliocene behavior of the EAIS, however. For instance, global sea level estimates for the mid-Pliocene warm period range from <10 m to >30 m, and numerous cosmogenic nuclide and sedimentological studies from the Transantarctic Mountains imply extreme landscape stability over the last several Myr whereas ocean records suggest orbital-scale instability of at least marine-based sectors of the ice sheet. These stabilist versus dynamicist views are difficult to resolve because onshore records are generally biased toward intervals of expanded ice cover and limited to areas with exposed land, while marine sediments typically provide indirect evidence for conditions on land and cannot distinguish between marine versus land-based ice sheet collapse.\nThe AND-1B marine sediment core drilled beneath the Ross Ice Shelf contains a remarkably complete late Cenozoic sequence of glacial diamictons sourced from the adjacent EAIS, intercalated with open-water sediments likely associated with West Antarctic Ice Sheet collapse. We measured concentrations of in situ 10Be – produced only when ice cover is reduced and the landscape is exposed – in eight samples of glacially-derived quartz sand from AND-1B spanning parts of the last 8 Myr. Decay-corrected concentrations are low and show a long-term decline from 13,000 atoms/g to 1000 atoms/g over the record. These low values and the monotonic trend suggest that land-based ice sheet sectors have experienced little, if any, exposure during the past 8 Myr; the 10Be concentrations we measured are equivalent to only centuries or a few kyr of surface exposure. Perhaps more likely, the small quantities of 10Be were produced prior to the establishment of a full EAIS in the mid-Miocene, and reflect deeply-exhumed and thus 10Be-poor material that has been radioactively decaying beneath near-continuous ice sheet cover. In either case, these results strongly suggest that land-based portions of the EAIS draining into the Ross Embayment have been stable over the range of climatic conditions experienced during the late Cenozoic and exhibited, at most, short-lived ice margin responses to Pliocene warmth.",

In 2013 a new system for annual report data collection was implemented by the National Science Foundation for all awards, including REU Sites. As a result, REU Site Directors must ask students to self-report data using the NSF Fastlane system. NSF has been collecting this data for several years and information is now available about the effectiveness of this new data collection system. Information on the GEO REU Site student demographics from 2014 will be presented and compared to data from previous years. Results show low participation rates by REU students in the data submission process. Many students who do participate skip questions or chose not to provide answers to the questions. Methods for increasing student participation in the data collection process will be discussed and suggestions for other ways to improve data collection as a community will be presented.

(2015). Here, we show how the response of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to a 4xCO2 forcing differs in our model when commonly ignored ozone-climate interactions are considered. Most importantly, we find that excluding the ozone feedback has a large impact on projected changes of ENSO variability in several long climate model integrations. For example, sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) in the ENSO-3.4 region show only weakly increased variability under 4xCO2 when the ozone feedback is included (σSSTs increased by 0.08 K), as compared to significantly increased variability when the ozone feedback is ignored (σSSTsincreased by 0.37 K). We explain the attenuating feedback behind this large difference in SST variability within the coupled atmosphere-ocean chemistry-climate framework. In addition, we discuss the fidelity of different methods to represent this feedback in climate models. Our results indicate the importance of representing changes in atmospheric composition in ENSO modeling studies. These changes are often not included, or represented inconsistently. In particular, our study implies the need to consider not only the extensively studied effect of ENSO on ozone but also, vice versa, the effect of composition changes on the ENSO.\n",

Despite recognizing advances in the space research over the whole Latin America, this review is restricted to the evolution observed in three countries (Argentina, Brazil and Mexico) only, due to the fact that these countries have recently developed operational center for monitoring the space weather. The work starts with briefly mentioning the first groups that started the space science in Latin America. The current status and research interest of such groups are then described together with the most referenced works and the challenges for the next decade to solve space weather puzzles. A small inventory of the networks and collaborations being built is also described. Finally, the decision process for spinning off the space weather prediction centers from the space science groups is reported with an interpretation of the reason/opportunities that lead to it. Lastly, the constraints for the progress in the space weather monitoring, research, and forecast are listed with recommendations to overcome them.",

In these assessments, each climate variable has generally been considered independently, and downscaling methodologies have generally not been tailored to the extremes of a variable’s distribution. In the wake of events such as Hurricane Sandy, stakeholder need and scientific advances are increasingly converging towards assessments focused on extreme events from a joint hazards perspective, across multiple climate variables. Such a joint approach requires consideration of possible correlation across climate variables (e.g., changes in relative sea level rise and coastal storms), as well as emphasis on additional variables—and their extremes—not considered quantitatively to date (e.g., humidity). This presentation will focus on two examples: 1) heat stress, based on combined impacts of high temperatures and high humidity, and 2) coastal flood risk associated with combined impacts of sea level rise and changes in coastal storms. This talk will demonstrate how the joint hazards approach can lead to large changes in projected extreme event frequency, relative to downscaling approaches that treat climate variables as independent. Challenges—and opportunities--associated with downscaling across multiple climate variables, with an emphasis on the extremes of the variables, will also be highlighted.",

The course, which has been highly rated by the more than 500 students who completed the end-of-year evaluations, serves as a model for a quality educational experience that can influence future decisions and behaviors. We survey students who have completed this course at least five years ago to determine their carbon emissions trajectories since taking the class.

            "abstract": "Coupled climate-carbon cycle models indicate that Amazon forests may be vulnerable to drought, with some predicting drought-induced collapse of the Amazon forest and conversion to savanna, under future climate change. While much progress has been made in understanding tropical forest drought response, a holistic picture encompassing both short-term physiological (e.g., photosynthesis) and longer term demographic responses (e.g., mortality) remains elusive, mainly due to the rarity of coinciding relevant measurements and drought events. Here we address this knowledge gap by analyzing the response of an eastern Amazonian forest at both timescales to the El Nino-induced drought of late 2009 / early 2010 (distinct from the Atlantic SST-induced drought to hit Western Amazonia in mid/late 2010) using eddy flux measurements of carbon exchange and periodic tree demographic surveys. We partitioned the drought response of GPP into environmental (light, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), diffuse light) and biological responses. Based on environmental conditions alone (high VPD), we expected GPP to be 1-2 umol CO2 m-2 s-1 less than average during drought. In contrast, GPP was elevated by 2-4 umol CO2 m-2 s-1 above this expected negative response over a period of ~45 days, consistent with previously observed green-up from satelliltes during the 2005 Amazon drought. At the same time, drought significantly elevated 2009-2011 tree mortality, by ~50% above that during non-drought periods, consistent with a quantitative drought-mortality relationship reported for other Amazon forests. This work suggests that observations of “green-up” of forest canopies during drought may be consistent with subsequent drought-induced tree mortality, in contrast to expectation. More importantly, it highlights endogenous biological regulation of photosynthesis as an important mechanism, neglected by models, in mediating drought responses in tropical forests.",

            "abstract": "Smectite clays are widely found on the Earth surface. They are porous materials possessing a connected mesoporosity in the micrometer range, in-between mineral grains, and a nanoporosity inside the grains. These grains are stacks of individual 1 nm-thick clay particles (the layers) and have the ability to swell by incorporating H2O molecules (or other molecules such as CO2) in-between the layers, depending on the ambiant temperature and on the humidity present in the mesoporosity surrounding the grain. Imposing a gradient of relative humidity H along a temperature- controlled dry sample of smectite clay, we investigate the diffusive transport of water molecules in vapor phase through the material. As water molecules diffuse through the mesoporosity, some of them intercalate into the nanoporosity, causing the grains to swell and therefore a decrease in the mesoporous volume available for vapor diffusion. These two effects render the transport process potentially anomalous; we monitor it using space- and time-resolved X-ray diffraction at a synchrotron source. Indeed, water absorption into the nano-layered grains changes the interlayer repetition distance (d-spacing) of the stacks, which is seen as a horizontal translation of a peak in the diffraction data. A calibration experiment performed under controlled constant temperature and controlled humidity level all around the sample, varying H by steps, has allowed us to map the monotonous evolution of d as a function of H. By mapping d in space and time in the transport experiments we thus obtain humidity H(x) profiles along the direction of the initial humidity gradient, at regular time intervals t. To model the data we consider a one-dimensional effective diffusion process described by a fractional time diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient that depends on humidity. It is possible to rescale all humidity profiles onto a single master curve as a function of (x/t)γ/2, where γ is the exponent characteristic of the fractional derivative. We observe that when the clay sample is prepared with sodium cations intercalated in the nano-porosity, vapor transport is normal (γ=2), while if the interlayer cation is lithium the transport is strongly subdiffusive. In both cases we also obtain the dependence of the effective diffusion coefficient on humidity.",

In addition, there are over 20 metagenomic studies of such environments. This provides a rich source of latent data that can be exploited for understanding the biology of biomining environments and for advancing biotechnological applications. Genomic and metagenomic data are already yielding valuable insights into cellular processes, including carbon and nitrogen management, heavy metal and acid resistance, iron and sulfur oxido-reduction, linking biogeochemical processes to organismal physiology. The data also allow the construction of useful models of the ecophysiology of biomining environments and provide insight into the gene and genome evolution of extreme acidophiles. Additionally, since most of these acidophiles are also chemoautolithotrophs that use minerals as energy sources or electron sinks, their genomes can be plundered for clues about the evolution of cellular metabolism and bioenergetic pathways during the Archaean abiotic/biotic transition on early Earth.\nAcknowledgements: Fondecyt 1130683.",

            "abstract": "An improved understanding of the kinematic properties of CMEs and CME-associated phenomena has several impacts: 1) a less ambiguous method of mapping propagating structures into their inner coronal manifestations, 2) a clearer view of the relationship between the “main” CME and CME-associated brightenings, and 3) an improved identification of the heliospheric sources of shocks, Type II bursts, and SEPs. However, there are several challenges in characterizing the kinematic properties of CMEs. Most rapidly-evolving eruptions are accompanied by changes in the surrounding corona. The larger the impact on the surrounding corona, the more difficult it is to separate the “main” CME from the CME-associated brightenings. Complicating the issue is the range of observed propagation properties: super-radial expansion, asymmetric expansion, non-radial propagation, and alterations in the direction of propagation. These properties can be a function of both the internal magnetic structure of the CME and the structure of the corona through which the CME is propagating. While the relative contribution of internal/external factors can be difficult to assess, it is of fundamental importance because it not only reveals the nature of CMEs but also CME-associated phenomena such as EUV waves, Type II radio bursts, shocks, and SEPs. Most halo CMEs are a combination of both the “main” CME and the CME-associated brightenings, but new diagnostic methods such as time convolution mapping can help separate the CME mass from the impacted corona. Additionally, while most CME-fitting methods assume symmetry about the radial direction, adaptive methods allow us to study highly asymmetric CME expansion and take into account the fundamentally different natures of the CME and the shocked/deflected corona. Several methods will be examined, and each has their respective strengths and weaknesses; for example, the difference between the direction of a highly non-radial CME and a sun-centered model’s orientation can exceed 45 degrees, which impacts our ability to correctly assess changes in propagation direction and the causes of these changes. We examine the assumptions inherent in these methods and how they may produce artifacts that can influence conclusions about CME kinematics.",

            "abstract": "While long-term objectives of monitoring and verification regimes include remote characterization and discrimination of surficial geologic and topographic features at sites of interest, ground truth data is required to advance development of remote sensing techniques. Increasingly, it is desirable for these ground-based or ground-proximal characterization methodologies to be as nimble, efficient, non-invasive, and non-destructive as their higher-altitude airborne counterparts while ideally providing superior resolution. For this study, the area of interest is an alluvial site at the Nevada National Security Site intended for use in the Source Physics Experiment’s (Snelson et al., 2013) second phase. Ground-truth surface topographic characterization was performed using a DJI Inspire 1 unmanned aerial system (UAS), at very low altitude (< 5-30m AGL). 2D photographs captured by the standard UAS camera payload were imported into Agisoft Photoscan to create three-dimensional point clouds. Within the area of interest, careful installation of surveyed ground control fiducial markers supplied necessary targets for field collection, and information for model georectification. The resulting model includes a Digital Elevation Model derived from 2D imagery. It is anticipated that this flexible and versatile characterization process will provide point cloud data resolution equivalent to a purely ground-based LiDAR scanning deployment (e.g., 1-2cm horizontal and vertical resolution; e.g., Sussman et al., 2012; Schultz-Fellenz et al., 2013). In addition to drastically increasing time efficiency in the field, the UAS method also allows for more complete coverage of the study area when compared to ground-based LiDAR. Comparison and integration of these data with conventionally-acquired airborne LiDAR data from a higher-altitude (~ 450m) platform will aid significantly in the refinement of technologies and detection capabilities of remote optical systems to identify and detect surface geologic and topographic signatures of interest. This work includes a preliminary comparison of surface signatures detected from varying standoff distances to assess current sensor performance and benefits.",

            "abstract": "Urbanization alters the magnitude and composition of hydrologic and biogeochemical fluxes from watersheds, with subsequent deleterious consequences for receiving waters. Projected changes in storm characteristics such as rainfall intensity and event size are predicted to amplify these impacts and render current regulations inadequate for protecting surface water quality. As stormwater management practices (BMPs) are increasingly being relied upon to reduce excess nutrient pollution in runoff from residential development, empirical investigation of their performance across a range of conditions is warranted. Despite substantial investment in urban and suburban BMPs, significant knowledge gaps exist in understanding how landscape structure and precipitation event characteristics influence the amount of stormwater runoff and associated nutrient loads from these complex catchments. Increasing infiltration of stormwater before it enters the sewer network (source control) is hypothesized to better mimic natural hydrologic and biogeochemical fluxes compared to more centralized BMPs at sewer outlets such as wet and dry ponds. Rainfall and runoff quality and quantity were monitored in four small (1-5 ha) residential catchments in Maryland to test the efficacy of infiltration-based stormwater management practices in comparison to end-of-pipe BMPs. Results indicated that reduced hydrologic connectivity associated with infiltration-based practices affected the relationship between the magnitude of rainfall events and water yield , but only for small precipitation events: compared to end-of-pipe BMPs, source control was associated with both lower runoff ratios and lower nutrient export per area for a given rainfall event size. We found variability in stormwater runoff responses (water yield, quality, and nutrient loads) was associated with precipitation event size, antecedent rainfall, and hydrologic connectivity as quantified by a modified directional connectivity index. Accounting for the interactive effects of landscape structure and precipitation event characteristics can reduce the uncertainty surrounding stormwater runoff responses in complex urban watersheds.",

            "abstract": "Evolution of metazoan life is closely linked to the Phanerozoic evolution of ocean temperatures and chemistry. Oxygen isotopic evidence for early Phanerozoic paleotemperatures has been equivocal, with decreasing δ18O values with age being interpreted as warmer early oceans, decreasing seawater δ18O with age, or increasing diagenetic alteration in older samples. Here we compare an updated compilation of oxygen isotope data for carbonate and phosphate fossils and microfossils (Grossman, 2012, Geol. Time Scale, Elsevier, 195-220) with a compilation of new and existing clumped isotope data. Importantly, these data are curated based on sample preservation with special consideration given to screening techniques, and tectonic and burial history. Burial history is critical in the preservation of carbonate clumped isotope temperatures in particular, which can undergo reordering in the solid state. We use a model derived for reordering kinetics (Henkes et al., 2014, Geochim. Cosmochim. Acta 139:362-382) to screen clumped isotope data for the effects of solid-state burial alteration. With minor but significant exceptions (Late Cretaceous, Early Triassic), average δ18O values (4 m.y. window, 2 m.y. steps) for post-Devonian brachiopods, belemnites, and foraminifera, representing tropical-subtropical surface ocean conditions, yield average isotopic temperatures below 30°C (assuming a seawater δ18O value [ -1‰ VSMOW] of an “ice-free” world). In contrast, Ordovician to Devonian data show sustained temperatures of 35-40°C. Likewise, isotopic paleotemperatures from conodont apatite, known to be resistant to isotopic exchange, follow the same pattern. Clumped isotope data derived from Paleozoic brachiopod shells that experienced minimal burial (< 100 °C) and <1% reordering according to the taxon-specific clumped isotope reordering model yield typical temperatures of 25-30°C for the Carboniferous, and 35-40°C for the Ordovician-Silurian. Inserting clumped temperatures and δ18O values into the oxygen isotopic paleotemperature equation yields a mean seawater δ18O of -0.7 ± 1.4‰ for the Phanerozoic. Collectively, these findings argue for extremely warm early Paleozoic oceans, and constant seawater δ18O throughout the last ~450 million years.",

            "abstract": "A minor fraction of atmospheric aerosol particles, so-called ice-nucleating particles (INPs), initiates the formation of the ice phase in tropospheric clouds and thereby markedly influences the Earth’s weather and climate systems. Whether an aerosol particle acts as an INP depends on its size, morphology and chemical compositions. The INP fraction of certain aerosol types also strongly depends on the temperature and the relative humidity.\nBecause both desert dust and soil dust aerosols typically comprise a variety of different particles, it is difficult to assess and predict their contribution to the atmospheric INP abundance. This requires both accurate modelling of the sources and atmospheric distribution of atmospheric dust components and detailed investigations of their ice nucleation activities. The latter can be achieved in laboratory experiments and parameterized for use in weather and climate models as a function of temperature and particle surface area, a parameter called ice-nucleation active site (INAS) density. Concerning ice nucleation activity studies, the soil dust is of particular interest because it contains a significant fraction of organics and biological components, both with the potential for contributing to the atmospheric INP abundance at relatively high temperatures compared to mineral components.\nFirst laboratory ice nucleation experiments with a few soil dust samples indicated their INP fraction to be comparable or slightly enhanced to that of desert dust. We have used the AIDA (Aerosol Interaction and Dynamics in the Atmosphere) cloud simulation chamber to study the immersion freezing ability of four different arable soil dusts, sampled in Germany, China and Argentina. For temperatures higher than about -20°C, we found the INP fraction of aerosols generated from these samples by a dry dispersion technique to be significantly higher compared to various desert dust aerosols also investigated in AIDA experiments. In this contribution, we will summarize the experimental results, introduce related INP parameterizations for use in weather and climate models, and briefly discuss possible reasons for the discrepancy between the INP fraction of desert and soil dust aerosols.",

The EOS ART 2010-2013 was a pilot program that also facilitated the active engagement of regional artists with issues related to Earth science, sustainable societies, and innovative methods for science outreach. An interdisciplinary jury of art critics, curators and Earth scientists selected art projects proposed by regional artists, and funds were awarded to develop and realize the projects.\nThe artworks–including installations, photographs, and video art–were showcased in the “Unearthed” public exhibit at the Singapore Art Museum from March to July of 2014.

            "abstract": "Row crop farmers routinely add inorganic carbon to soils in the form of crushed lime (e.g., calcite or dolomite minerals) and/or inadvertently as bicarbonate alkalinity naturally dissolved in groundwater used for irrigation. In the soil these carbonates can act as either a source or sink of carbon dioxide, depending in large part on nitrogen fertilization and nitrification. The potentially variable fate of lime carbon is not accounted for in the IPCC greenhouse gas inventory model for lime emissions, which assumes that all lime carbon becomes carbon dioxide (irrigation additions are not accounted for). In a corn-soybean-wheat crop rotation at the Kellogg Biological Station Long Term Ecological Research site in southwest Michigan, we are collecting soil porewater from several depths in the vadose zone across a nitrogen fertilizer gradient with and without groundwater irrigation. The soil profile in this region is dominated by carbonate rich glacial outwash that lies 1.5 m below a carbonate-leached zone. We analyze the porewater stoichiometry of calcium, magnesium, and carbonate alkalinity in a conceptual model to reveal the source/sink fate of inorganic carbon. High nitrate porewater concentrations are associated with net carbon dioxide production in the carbonate-leached zone, according to our model. This suggests that the acidity associated with nitrification of the nitrogen fertilizer, which is evident from soil pH measurements, is driving the ultimate fate of lime carbon in the vadose zone. Irrigation is a significant source of both alkalinity and nitrate in drier years, compared to normal rates of liming and fertilization. We will also explore the observed dramatic changes in porewater chemistry and the relationship between irrigation and inorganic carbon fate above and within the native carbonate layer.",

            "abstract": "The NASA EOSDIS Global Imagery Browse Services (GIBS) is rapidly becoming an invaluable GIS resource for the science community and for the public at large. Reliable, fast access to historical as well as near real time, georeferenced images form a solid basis on which many innovative applications and projects can be built. Esri has recognized the value of this effort and is a GIBS user and collaborator. To enable the use of GIBS services within the ArcGIS ecosystem, Esri has built a GIBS reflector server at http://modis.arcgis.com, server which offers the facilities of a time enabled Mosaic Service on top of the GIBS provided images. Currently the MODIS reflectance products are supported by this mosaic service, possibilities of handling other GIBS products are being explored. This reflector service is deployed on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud platform, and is freely available to the end users. Due to the excellent response time from GIBS, image tiles do not have to be stored by the Esri mosaic server, all needed data being retrieved directly from GIBS when needed, continuously reflecting the state of GIBS, and greatly simplifying the maintenance of this service. Response latency is usually under one second, making it easy to interact with the data. The remote data access is achieved by using the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library (GDAL) Tiled Web Map Server (TWMS) driver. The response time of this server is excellent, usually under one second. The MODIS imagery has proven to be one of the most popular ones on the ArcGIS Online platform, where it is frequently use to provide temporal context to maps, or by itself, to tell a compelling story.",

Knowing the exact quantity of stored water and necessary water for each of these usages is a critical component of sustainable water resources management. However, limited amounts of hydrologic data in developing nations, most of which are located in the tropics, hinders the accurate monitoring of water storage and allocation. Recent improvements in remote sensing have greatly enhanced the ability to calculate volumetric fluctuations of lakes and reservoirs at given points through time but are limited by temporal resolution as well as the computational time required for image processing. This study utilizes the newly developed MODISTools package for the programming language R in conjunction with satellite altimetry from three different altimetry databases to estimate lake and reservoir volumes at eight day intervals over a 15 year period. The study specifically examines three large lakes and reservoirs: Balbina Reservoir in the Amazon River Basin, Lake Tana in the Nile River Basin, and Tonle Sap Lake in the Mekong River Basin. Altimetry-based water level estimations are validated by in situ water level data from monitoring stations while surface area estimations are validated by Sound Navigation and Ranging (SONAR) generated bathymetric maps with corresponding stage-area relationships. Preliminary results indicate that both remotely sensed water levels and surface areas agree well with in situ measurements, supporting the appropriateness of this methodology.",

Furthermore, Daily Temperature Range (DTR) exhibits a positive trend (increments), thus implying an increase in temperature extremes.

Critical impact information is often stored in ephemeral news articles or other isolated resources, which cannot be queried or located easily. A global ash impacts database would improve 1) warning messages, 2) public and lifeline emergency preparation, and 3) eruption response and recovery. Ashfall can have varying consequences, such as disabling critical lifeline infrastructure (e.g. electrical generation and transmission, water supplies, telecommunications, aircraft and airports) or merely creating limited and expensive inconvenience to local communities. Impacts to the aviation sector can be a far-reaching global issue. The international volcanic ash impacts community formed a committee to develop a database to catalog the impacts of volcanic ash. We identify three user populations for this database: 1) research teams, who would use the database to assist in systematic collection, recording, and storage of ash impact data, and to prioritize impact assessment trips and lab experiments 2) volcanic risk assessment scientists who rely on impact data for assessments (especially vulnerability/fragility assessments); a complete dataset would have utility for global, regional, national and local scale risk assessments, and 3) citizen science volcanic hazard reporting. Publication of an international ash impacts database will encourage standardization and development of best practices for collecting and reporting impact information. Data entered will be highly categorized, searchable, and open source. Systematic cataloging of impact data will allow users to query the data and extract valuable information to aid in the development of improved emergency preparedness, response and recovery measures.",

            "abstract": "The sequence of feedbacks that characterized 100-kyr glacial cycles of the past million years remains uncertain, hampering an understanding of the interconnections between insolation, ice sheets, greenhouse gas forcing, and climate. Critical to addressing this issue is an accurate interpretation of the marine δ18O record, the main template for the Ice Ages. This study uses a global compilation of 49 paired sea surface temperature-planktonic δ18O records to extract the mean δ18O of surface ocean seawater over the past 800 kyr, which we interpret to dominantly reflect global ice volume. The results indicate that global surface temperature, inferred deep ocean temperature, and atmospheric CO2 decrease early during each glacial cycle in close association with one another, whereas major ice sheet growth occurs later in glacial cycles. These relationships suggest that ice volume may have exhibited a threshold response to global cooling, and that global deglaciations do not occur until after the growth of large ice sheets. This phase sequence also suggests that the ice sheets had relatively little feedback on global cooling. Simple modeling shows that the rate of ice volume change through time is largely determined by the combined influence of insolation, temperature, and ice sheet size, with possible implications for the evolution of glacial cycles over the past three million years.",

However, their radiative forcing is not well-constrained observationally and recent estimates of just the direct forcing ranges from 0.08 to 1.27 W/m2 - the upper limits of which puts BC second only to carbon dioxide in terms of radiative forcing. Consequently, the climate impacts of these heterogeneous short-lived forcing agents are highly uncertain. To establish the uncertainty in the climate response to BC, we conduct a suite of idealized experiments with the DOE/NCAR CESM1.0 model with the atmosphere component (CAM4) coupled to a Slab Ocean Model (SOM) forced separately with increasing BC concentrations covering a large swath of the estimated range of current BC radiative forcing. We find that the increase in BC results in global warming – with a sensitivity of 0.22 K/W/m2 including the semi-direct effects, decrease in global precipitation – despite the increase in global temperatures, a northwards shift of the ITCZ – along with an increase in cross-equatorial southwards energy transport, tropical expansion in the Northern Hemisphere – associated with BC induced mid-latitude warming, and an increase in precipitation during the Indian Monsoons – with the enhancement of the meridional tropospheric gradient, among other responses. Further, these global responses are near-linear functions of the increase in BC concentration, suggesting that the climate response to BC aerosols can be readily estimated if the uncertainty in BC can be constrained.",

            "abstract": "The assessment of hydroclimatic and hydrometeorological extremes in changing climates has gathered special attention in the latest IPCC 5thAssessment Report (AR5). In monsoon regions such as South Asia, hydrologic modeling (i.e., stream flow assessment, water budget analysis, etc.) needs to incorporate such extremes to simulate retrospective and future scenarios. For information of past and future climate, Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are preferred over global models due to their higher resolution and dynamic downscaling capabilities. Although the models perform well in representing the mean climate, they still possess significant biases, especially in daily hydrometeorological extremes over monsoon regions. Therefore, modification and correction of RCM results while preserving the extremes are crucial for hydrologic modeling in changing monsoon climates such as in South Asia. In this context, we generate a gridded observed product that preserve the hydroclimatic and hydrometeorological extremes for the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) basin region in South Asia. A recent approach to bias correction is also proposed for correcting regional climate data in currently available future projections. The 30 year dataset (1971-2010) is used for comparing hydroclimatic and hydrometeorological extremes with APHRODITE and ERA-Interim Reanalysis products. The assessment has revealed that the new gridded data set provides much accurate maximum rainfall intensity, number of dry days, number of wet days and number of rainy days with greater than 500mm rainfall than any other available gridded data products. Using the gridded data sets, bias correctionis applied on CMIP5 multi-model historical datasets to evaluate RCM data performance over the region, which show great improvement in regional climate data for future hydrologic modeling scenarios and analyzing impacts of climate extremes.",

Hydrocarbon generation and primary migration can be controlled by numerous parameters; the most important are temperature, pressure, hydrocarbon composition, and organic matter type and content. Several experimental studies focused on the influence of these main parameters. However few dedicated works investigated how the primary structure characteristic and organic matter content affects the pore space transformation of rocks. For this purpose we simulated the primary migration processes in laboratory conditions (pyrolises and CT scanning) in order to observe the dynamics of pore space transformation. Our experiments demonstrate that after each stage of heating the rocks change their original morphology with the formation of new pores and conduits connecting the primary voids. The samples with relatively low content in organic matter revealed fewer changes in pore space morphology, in contrast to rocks rich in organic content. Our results also highlight that the newly formed pore structures are directly related with the original structure of the unaltered rocks and the primary connectivity of the organics. Most of the structural changes were observed during the sequential heating between 260 – 430 ° C; within this interval also occur the most intense reactions for hydrocarbons formation.",

Historically the selection of the quietest days (Q-days) and most disturbed days (D-days) of each month is deduced from the Kp indices. Other techniques include the use of magnetic indices and solar wind conditions. Common for these techniques is the long list of assumptions on which they are based. For example: duration of quiet period (e.g. 1 hour or 24 hours), start of quiet periods (e.g. 0 UT), inferred response of the magnetosphere-ionosphere system to solar wind conditions, and the ability of the magnetic indices to quantify the external field contributions (e.g. using only north-south component). We show that previous published techniques include periods of intense substorms and magnetic storms while SMDL effectively excludes these disturbances. The SMDL indices provides more temporal coverage through better quantification of the external field component. We show events, statistics, and we show that the SMDL index provides a powerful tool to quantify the external field contribution.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - CALKINS AGU POSTER.pdf\nIn March 2015, UN member states adopted the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction: 2015-2030. The Sendai Framework recognises the cross-cutting nature of DRR policy and calls on a range of stakeholders to help governments. The Sendai Framework sets the aim of achieving “the substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods and health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets of persons, businesses, communities and countries” (para 16). The international science community is acknowledged as a key stakeholder in supporting countries to implement the Sendai Framework. With this call to action and the gravity of disaster risk escalating around the globe, it is now vital that scientific knowledge and research resources are shared and become accessible in a form that can directly support coordinated application.\nRecent work is presented on the DRR gaps voiced by governments and scientists across a range of science and technology related needs, including through the drafting process for the Sendai Framework. Across regions and development levels, countries are seeking to address specific gaps they face in scientific capacities and information.\nConsidering the many existing programmes, research initiatives and resources already seeking to generate evidence on DRR at all scales, how can science and technology improve delivery? Models and case studies prompt a useful discussion on what does and does not work. We provide an example of recent work in the UK disasters research community to assess scientific and technical capacity and collaborative effort to fulfil the commitment of the Sendai Framework. While there is no one-size-fits-all, any implementation approach needs to take into account the extraordinary, dynamic and localised nature of disasters and needs to be able to deliver relevant information to decision-makers at national and local levels, in a timely manner.",

A shortcoming of this technique, however, is the limited temporal and spatial sampling that it provides. We consider a different approach where radio occultation measurements are taken between two spacecraft orbiting an extra-terrestrial body. Such “crosslink” radio occultations between the Global Positioning System satellites and low-earth orbiting spacecraft have been routinely acquired to provide global observations of the Earth’s atmosphere and ionosphere that are used for weather forecast, climate analysis, and space weather applications. The feasibility of applying this concept to other planets has recently been demonstrated for the first time, where crosslink occultation measurements have been acquired between the Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft. These measurements leverage the proximity link telecommunication payloads on each orbiter, which are nominally used to provide relay communication and navigation services to Mars landers and rovers. In this presentation, we will describe the Mars crosslink experiments and the corresponding data analysis in detail. In addition, we will discuss how the crosslink occultation concepts can be effectively applied in future space exploration missions.",

            "abstract": "On faults where the static stress state is near but below the failure criterion, dynamic stress perturbations from passing seismic waves may initiate earthquakes. To study how these transient stresses can cause failure, we perform Discrete Element Method numerical simulations of shear failure in a layer of non-cohesive granular material. The granular material mimics crushed gouge in the fault core - the weakest part of the fault and the region most likely to initiate slip. The applied shear stress is slowly increased until failure (a slip event) to determine the frictional strength of the granular layer under non-perturbed conditions. Pre-failure states of the gouge layer are saved during the loading process and used as initial conditions in triggering experiments: one boundary of the gouge is subjected to a transient pulse in boundary stresses, to simulate a passing seismic waves. Various amplitudes and frequencies of the stress pulse are tested on layers at different static stress levels from 0.95 to 0.99 of the failure strength.\nIn order to trigger an immediate failure, the pulse must increase the normal stress ratio to reach the previously measured frictional strength of the layer. However, we find that this is not a sufficient condition for immediate failure. The stress state must be above the frictional strength threshold long enough to allow for significant grain shifting (~ 0.1 grain diameters). This introduces a frequency dependence in addition to the amplitude dependence of the pulse. For low pre-stress levels, high frequency pulses do not remain above the threshold long enough and are incapable of causing immediate triggering. This frequency cutoff is directly proportional to the stress level, meaning lower frequencies can cause immediate triggering at a wider range of initial stress levels. Systems that are not immediately triggered may still experience “delayed triggering” - slip induced by the pulse after a time delay. This implies that transient boundary stresses can cause small permanent changes in the network of granular forces, which changes the ultimate failure strength of the layer. These experiments will help us better understand the conditions needed for seismic waves to trigger nearby earthquakes, and any possible changes such perturbations have on the stress state for future events.",

Turbulent entrainment is commonly assumed to increase proportionally with the average plume rise velocity and the wind stress. There exist multiple scalings linking eruption source conditions to plume height. However, most scalings are empirical and/or incompletely verified with: i) analogue experiments that do not capture the full range of dynamical conditions under which explosive eruption occur; ii) direct observations of a restricted number of eruptions; or iii) numerical models with parameterized turbulent entrainment physics.\nIn this study, we produce a self-consistent intercomparison of scalings commonly used in the literature. We use extensive analogue laboratory experiments on buoyant jets rising into a uniform wind field and a set of observations from 27 explosive eruptions (Mastin, 2014) to test each scaling.",

            "abstract": "Despite major advances in the ability of satellites to detect gases and aerosols in the atmosphere, there remains significant, untapped potential to apply space-based data to air quality regulatory applications. Here, we showcase research findings geared toward increasing the relevance of satellite data to support operational air quality management, focused on model evaluation. Particular emphasis is given to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and formaldehyde (HCHO) from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument aboard the NASA Aura satellite, and evaluation of simulations from the EPA Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. This work is part of the NASA Air Quality Applied Sciences Team (AQAST), and is motivated by ongoing dialog with state and federal air quality management agencies.\nWe present the response of satellite-derived NO2 to meteorological conditions, satellite-derived HCHO:NO2 ratios as an indicator of ozone production regime, and the ability of models to capture these sensitivities over the continental U.S. In the case of NO2-weather sensitivities, we find boundary layer height, wind speed, temperature, and relative humidity to be the most important variables in determining near-surface NO2 variability. CMAQ agreed with relationships observed in satellite data, as well as in ground-based data, over most regions. However, we find that the southwest U.S. is a problem area for CMAQ, where modeled NO2 responses to insolation, boundary layer height, and other variables are at odds with the observations. \nOur analyses utilize a software developed by our team, the Wisconsin Horizontal Interpolation Program for Satellites (WHIPS): a free, open-source program designed to make satellite-derived air quality data more usable. WHIPS interpolates level 2 satellite retrievals onto a user-defined fixed grid, in effect creating custom-gridded level 3 satellite product. Currently, WHIPS can process the following data products: OMI NO2 (NASA retrieval); OMI NO2 (KNMI retrieval); OMI HCHO (NASA retrieval); MOPITT CO (NASA retrieval); MODIS AOD (NASA retrieval).

            "abstract": "In porous sandstones many factors including grain size, sorting, stress-state, and composition influence deformation mechanisms and resulting deformation band properties, especially those related to fluid flow. Using high resolution SEM-CL, EDS, and BSE images we quantitatively point counted various band types and their associated host rocks at the sub-micron scale, performed comprehensive grain size analyses on the undeformed host rocks, and calculated the total porosity lost through coupled chemical-mechanical means for each host rock and band. Our goals were to 1) determine the influence of detrital composition and texture [Cedar Mesa, Navajo, and Entrada sandstones] both on bands formed by different mechanisms and on bands formed by the same deformation mechanism at various stages of development, and to 2) assess the effects of coupled chemical-mechanical processes leading to deformation localization within these sandstone reservoir outcrop analogs. Analyzed samples include a non-cataclastic disaggregation band, a non-cataclastic pressure solution band, and single, multistrand, and clustered cataclastic bands, all of which formed through combinations of grain reorganization, brittle processes, pressure solution, and cementation. The textural, compositional, and diagenetic properties of the older burial-related bands (pressure solution and disaggregation) are more comparable to the detrital host rocks than the later, faulting-related cataclastic bands, regardless of the host rock characteristics. Furthermore, the relative influence of the detrital sandstone properties varies throughout the evolutionary stages of cataclastic band development. For example, multistrand bands across formations have undergone similar chemical-mechanical deformation, yet their remnant porosities and compositions vary drastically. Cluster bands, on the other hand, represent a later developmental stage than multistrand bands, and yet their porosities and compositions are similar across formations, while the amount of chemical versus mechanical diagenesis seems to be dependent on the detrital host rock.",

However, little information is available on spatial metabolic patterns in the benthic and hyporheic regions. Based on observations from real systems, we used particle tracking simulations to explore the effects of localized metabolism on estimates of reach-scale nutrient uptake rates. Metabolism locally depletes nutrient concentrations relative to conservative tracers, causing their concentration profiles of injected nutrients and conservative tracers to diverge. At slow rates of hyporheic exchange relative to rates of metabolism, overall hyporheic nutrient uptake is limited by delivery from the stream, and effective reach-scale nutrient uptake parameters will be controlled by the hyporheic exchange rate. At high rates of hyporheic exchange relative to rates of metabolism, the injected tracer can propagate beyond regions of high microbial activity, which commonly occur near the streambed surface. In this case, the injected tracer may not adequately capture timescales of nutrient replenishment in the most bioactive regions. Reach-scale nutrients uptake rate increases with increasing heterogeneity in local metabolic patterns, altering the shape of breakthrough curves downstream. More observations of hyporheic rates and metabolic patterns are needed to understand how flow heterogeneity and reaction heterogeneity interact to control nutrient dynamics at reach-scale.",

            "abstract": "The Gulf Stream off North Carolina has current velocities that approach 3 m/s and an average volume transport of 90 Sv (1 Sv= 106 m3/s) off of Cape Hatteras, making it the most abundant MHK (Marine Hydrokinetic Energy) resource for the state. Resource availability at a specific location depends primarily on the variability in Gulf Stream position, which is least offshore of Cape Hatteras after the stream exits the Florida Straits. Proximity to land and high current velocities in relatively shallow waters on the shelf slope make this an optimal location to quantify the MHK energy resource for NC.\n3.5 years of current measurements beginning in August of 2013 from a moored 150 kHz ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) at an optimal location for energy extraction quantify the available energy resource and its variability, and establish the skill of a Mid-Atlantic Bight and South Atlantic Bight Regional Ocean Model in predicting the MHK energy resource. The model agrees well with long-term observed current averages and with weekly to monthly fluctuations in the current speeds. Model and observations over the first 9 months of the ADCP deployment period both averaged 1.15 m/s thirty meters below the surface. The model under estimates observed current speeds for the higher frequency current fluctuations of days to weeks. Comparisons between the model and ADCP observed currents, and velocity derived power density over the entire 3.5 years of observations demonstrate the significant inter-annual variability in power density.\nShipboard 300 kHz ADCP cross-stream transects and hourly surface currents measurements off Cape Hatteras from a network of land based HF (high frequency) radars further quantify available MHK energy and assess model skill.\nCross-stream transects were made with a vessel-mounted 300 kHz ADCP on a line from the 100-1000m isobaths, and measured currents in the top 100m. These measurements demonstrate the variability in the resource with water depth, and reveal significant variability in Gulf Stream position in time periods as short as 12 hours. Model comparisons help quantify the models’ ability to estimate resource variability with depth. Determination of Gulf Stream position with the HF radar surface currents correlates Gulf Stream position variability with the available power density.",

            "abstract": "Dissolved organic matter (DOM) represents the most mobile and active form of natural organic matter. It plays important roles in terrestrial C transport and biogeochemical cycles. Its reactivity makes it sensitive to seasonal variations and climate change. The objective of this study is to investigate the transport and transformation of DOM by tracking the spatial and seasonal variations of DOM concentrations and characteristics throughout the vadose zone and groundwater within a semi-arid floodplain at Rifle, Colorado. Three sets of vertically stratified pore water samplers were installed along a groundwater flow transect, and allowed collection of temporally resolved pore water samples from different depths. Fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy was used to trace changes in DOM characteristics. The humification index (HIX) was applied to evaluate variations in humification extent of DOM. EEM analysis identified fulvic-like, humic-like, tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like substances as the major fluorescent components of DOM in pore waters. Tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like compounds are typically considered as the recent microbial by-products, and they showed higher concentrations in the deeper vadose zone in late spring, and decrease from spring to winter. HIX values are smaller within the deeper vadose zone (1.5 ̶ 3.5 m) than in the overlying 1.0 m soil water and underlying groundwater samples (≥ 3.5 m), suggesting that some non- or less-humified DOM (or “fresh” microbial-derived DOM) was transferred during late spring. HIX value at each depth increased continuously from late spring to winter, with rapid humification occurring in late spring to early summer. These results suggest an annual cycle in which less humified soil organic matter is transferred into the deeper vadose zone during snowmelt/rainfall events, and then humified further through microbial transformation.",

            "abstract": "Crop phenology models are important components of crop growth models. In the case of phenology models, generally only a few parameters are calibrated and default cardinal temperatures are used which can lead to a temperature-dependent systematic phenology prediction error. Our objective was to evaluate different optimization approaches in the Oryza2000 and CERES-Rice phenology sub-models to assess the importance of optimizing cardinal temperatures on model performance and systematic error. We used two optimization approaches: the typical single-stage (planting to heading) and three-stage model optimization (for planting to panicle initiation (PI), PI to heading (HD), and HD to physiological maturity (MT)) to simultaneously optimize all model parameters. Data for this study was collected over three years and six locations on seven California rice cultivars. A temperature-dependent systematic error was found for all cultivars and stages, however it was generally small (systematic error < 2.2). Both optimization approaches in both models resulted in only small changes in cardinal temperature relative to the default values and thus optimization of cardinal temperatures did not affect systematic error or model performance. Compared to single stage optimization, three-stage optimization had little effect on determining time to PI or HD but significantly improved the precision in determining the time from HD to MT: the RMSE reduced from an average of 6 to 3.3 in Oryza2000 and from 6.6 to 3.8 in CERES-Rice. With regards to systematic error, we found a trade-off between RMSE and systematic error when optimization objective set to minimize RMSE or systematic error. Therefore, it is important to find the limits within which the trade-offs between RMSE and systematic error are acceptable, especially in climate change studies where this can prevent erroneous conclusions.",

The SNODAS product provides daily estimates of SWE at 1 km resolution from 30 Sept 2003 to present. By monitoring the change in water contained in the snowpack for a given watershed over time, it is possible to quantify the timing, duration, and magnitude of the spring freshet in a given watershed for multiple years. Variability in the onset of the spring freshet in the past is evident in the Lake Superior basin, providing strong indication of variability in export of allocthonous DOC to Lake Superior. Specifically, metrics such as center of mass of spring runoff, timing of melt initiation, timing of snow absence and duration of snowmelt for the study watersheds were determined using the SNODAS SWE dataset. Large variation in timing, duration and magnitude of snowmelt is evident for all watersheds over the past decade. Additionally, spatial variation in snowmelt timing is apparent.",

            "abstract": "A recent study of the angular distribution of the Jovian decameter radiation occurrence probability, relatively to the local magnetic field B and its gradient Grad B in the source region, revealed that the radio emission is beamed in a hollow cone presenting a flattening in a certain direction. In the present work, we investigate some physical reasons for the existence of such a flattening in the beam geometry. The Jovian decameter radiation, like the other auroral radio emissions emanating from the magnetized planets in the solar system, is known to be produced by the cyclotron maser instability (CMI). This mechanism allows the direct amplification of the waves through a resonant coupling between the electron population of the plasma and the electromagnetic waves with right circular polarization of the X mode. In a medium with axial symmetry, i.e., where B and Grad B are parallel, the maximum amplification is obtained for a particular value of the emergence angle relatively to the local magnetic field B. We suppose that the plasma is constituted of a cold component which supports the wave propagation and an energetic component which takes part in the growth of the waves by supplying the CMI with free energy. The angle corresponding to the maximum amplification is not constant anymore when B and Grad B are not parallel, so that the emission cone does not have any axial symmetry and then presents a flattening in a privileged direction. The topology of the magnetic field models (O6, VIP4, VIT4, VIPAL) developed for describing the Jovian magnetospheric environment seems to indicate that such a geometry exists in the case of the Io-controlled Jovian decameter radiation.",

We exploit this record to determine a multi-year climatology of the properties of Asian and Saharan dust, in particular seasonal optical depths, layer frequencies, and layer heights of dust gridded in accordance with the Level 3 data products protocol between 2006 and 2015. The data are screened using standard CALIPSO quality assurance flags, cloud aerosol discrimination (CAD) scores, overlying features and layer properties. To evaluate the effects of transport on small-scale phenomena such as morphology, vertical extent and size of the dust layers, we compare probability distribution functions of the layer integrated volume depolarization ratios, geometric depths and integrated attenuated color ratios near the source to the same distributions in the far field or transport region. CALIPSO is collaboration between NASA and Centre National d’Études Spatiales (CNES), was launched in April 2006 to provide vertically resolved measurements of cloud and aerosol distributions. The primary instrument on the CALIPSO satellite is the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), a near-nadir viewing two-wavelength polarization-sensitive instrument. The unique nature of CALIOP measurements make it quite challenging to validate backscatter profiles, aerosol type, and cloud phase, all of which are used to retrieve extinction and optical depth. To evaluate the uncertainty in the lidar ratios, we compare the values computed from dust layers overlying opaque water clouds, considered nominal, with the constant lidar ratio value used in the CALIOP algorithms for dust. We also explore the effects of noise on the CALIOP retrievals at daytime by comparing the distributions of the properties at daytime to the nighttime distributions.",

However, this approach has reached its limit of quality and reliability, being difficult to adapt to current weather conditions (climate change), to extreme weather conditions, and to ungauged basins. In this work, we evaluated the bias correction of NCEP-CSv2 daily precipitation with the aim of incorporating this forecast into a real-time hydrological forecasting system. Bias correction was performed using two approaches of the Quantile Mapping (QM) method: a) a polynomial fit (APo) applied to the differences between the forecasted and observed cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) for the training period; and b) using a Gamma probability distribution (APb) to fit the forecasted and observed CDFs. The bias correction was applied at two locations in south-central Chile: over the valley and in the Andes mountains. To estimate the CDFs and the QM fitting models in the training period, historical records and data from the CFSv2 Reforecast model (between 1995 and 2009) were used. The bias correction evaluation was done between 2011 and 2014 with the forecast of the CFSv2 model. The uncorrected CFSv2 results show that the mid-term forecasts (six months) have a high correlation (r>0.5) for the first days of the forecast (2 weeks), but an important underestimation in the observed data from both the valley and the mountain. After applying the bias correction (APo or APb), the errors of the corrected forecasts decrease in relation to the uncorrected CFSv2 forecasts, with a noticeable improvement for the first forecasted days (being the APo errors lower than those of the APb). In the long term, and as might be expected, the errors increase: the peak precipitation is underestimated and the null rainfall is overestimated.",

            "abstract": "Proper characterization of mineralogy is an essential part of geologic interpretation. This process becomes even more critical when attempting to interpret the history of a region remotely, via satellites and/or landed spacecraft. Orbiters and landed missions to Mars carry with them a wide range of analytical tools to aid in the interpretation of Mars’ geologic history. However, many instruments make a single type of measurement (e.g., APXS: elemental chemistry; XRD: mineralogy), and multiple data sets must be utilized to develop a comprehensive understanding of a sample. Hydrothermal alteration products often exist in intimate mixtures, and vary widely across a site due to changing pH, temperature, and fluid/gas chemistries. These characteristics require that we develop a detailed understanding regarding the possible mineral mixtures that may exist, and their detectability in different instrument data sets.\nThis comparative analysis study utilized several analytical methods on existing or planned Mars rovers (XRD Raman, LIBS, Mössbauer, and APXS) combined with additional characterization (thin section, VNIR, XRF, SEM-EMP) to develop a comprehensive suite of data for hydrothermal alteration products collected from Poás and Turrialba volcanoes in Costa Rica. Analyzing the same samples across a wide range of instruments allows for direct comparisons of results, and identification of instrumentation “blind spots.” This provides insight into the ability of in-situ analyses to comprehensively characterize sites on Mars exhibiting putative hydrothermal characteristics, such as the silica and sulfate deposits at Gusev crater [eg: Squyres et al., 2008], as well as valuable information for future mission planning and data interpretation.\n",

They exert a net radiative cooling effect on climate due to their high albedo. In this presentation, we will examine the 3D characteristics of marine boundary layer clouds using observations from the CALIOP lidar onboard CALIPSO satellite. CALIOP is a two-wavelength (532 nm and 1064 nm) polarization-sensitive (at 532 nm) elastic backscatter lidar that provides high vertical resolution cloud profiles giving accurate estimates of cloud boundaries. Different from passive remote sensors, CALIOP can detect even thin marine boundary layer clouds in columns with multiple cloud layers. With its 70-meter footprint diameter, CALIOP has high sensitivity to detect small-scale marine boundary layer clouds. Specifically, we will examine cloud fraction, cloud top and cloud thickness partitioned by cloud opacity. Further we will investigate how characteristics such as cloud thermodynamic phase are different between Arctic and tropical marine boundary clouds. Results from CALIOP will be compared with those from passive remote sensors such as MODIS. As part of our preparations for a future CALIPSO Level 3 cloud product, we also examine which of the five Level 2 CALIOP cloud products best characterizes marine boundary layer. This research will produce a more accurate representation of marine boundary layer clouds that could be used to evaluate the representation of such clouds in global climate models.",

SSA is a critical interface for biogeochemical interactions that span every Critical Zone discipline with significant feedbacks between SSA and landscape evolution. We strategically sampled two 21-meter deep drill cores of greenschist bedrock in the Christina River Basin Critical Zone Observatory, located in the Piedmont physiographic province. Drill sites were positioned at the ridge top and an interfluve with 11 meters of elevation difference to assess hillslope dynamics among the processes responsible for SSA generation. Our SSA data reveal that the inventory of SSA reaches an asymptotic relationship with depth, with a distinct change in rock physical properties presenting at 3 meters below the ground surface at both hillslope positions, identified by a distinct inflection point in the SSA inventory. Below this 3 meter deep interface SSA changes very little, which we understand to represent a very gradual transition from weathered to fresh bedrock. The mineralogical changes that influence the generation of SSA are driven by near-surface pedogenic and biotic process, including organic-matter occlusion of surface area, yet the 3-meter deep inflection in SSA inventory reveals that these processes are not the sole driving mechanism for SSA generation. We identify that the primary controls on mineral SSA production occur in near-surface environments where multiple biogeochemical processes combine to physically disrupt and chemically weather minerals.",

            "abstract": "The Hurricane Fault is an active 250-km long, west dipping, Basin and Range bounding normal fault in SW Utah and NW Arizona. Fault rock alteration and mineralization is common in the damage zone along strike, indicating that this structure has influenced past groundwater flow. Multiple Quaternary basaltic centers are located proximal to the fault. This study tests the hypothesis that fault-zone diagenesis is being driven by deeply circulated meteoric groundwater infiltration and associated rock-water interaction that is punctuated by periods of hydrothermal alteration associated with local magmatism. Fault-parallel/oblique fractures and small-offset antithetic and synthetic normal faults have been found within fault-zone rocks. The intensity of fracturing and associated evidence of fluid-rock interaction progressively decreases away from the main fault trace into the footwall. Host rock alteration, hematite mineralized fault surfaces, and calcite and hematite cemented deformation bands and veins are observed. These features are focused in 1 – 2 m wide zones of fracturing with densities of 6 – 18 m-1 located within the footwall damage zone. Host rock alteration in the form of both “bleaching” and oxidation along fractures provides evidence for past redox reactions. Mineralization in deformation bands suggests that some fluid flow and diagenesis was penecontemporaneous with deformation. Laminations and cross-cutting relationships in veins indicate periodic mineralization that could be controlled by episodic fluid flow, or fracturing and degassing leading to calcite precipitation. Stable isotopic results from calcite veins show δ13CPDB values of -7 to 3 ‰ and δ18OPDB values of -19 to -9 ‰. Carbon stable isotope ratios suggest multiple carbon sources such as marine carbonates, organic sedimentary rocks, and mantle derived CO2. Temperature differences in paleofluids and associated fluid-rock interaction may explain the observed range in δ18O values. Fluid inclusion microthermometry is combined with the δ18O of calcite to constrain the temperature and the oxygen isotopic composition of the paleofluids. The Hurricane Fault-zone exhibits fault-rock diagenesis focused in densely fractured, fault-parallel zones within the damage zone that provide insight into paleofluid chemistry and temperatures.",

It is unclear how microbial diversity constrains enzymatic potential, making it difficult to predict future carbon cycling under climate change scenarios that could alter microbial community composition. To address this question, we deployed fine-pore nylon mesh “microbial cage” litterbags containing grassland litter with and without local inoculum across five sites in southern California, spanning a gradient of 4.0-24.5º C in mean annual temperature and 129-630 mm mean annual precipitation. Litterbags were deployed in October 2014 and collected in March and June 2015. Collected litterbags were assayed for mass loss and potential activity of nine extracellular enzyme classes. We hypothesized that extracellular enzyme potential would be greatest in litter transplanted to moister sites, given the importance of moisture as a driver of ecosystem function in southern California. We also hypothesized that litter inoculated with local microbiota would exhibit greater extracellular enzyme potential than litter containing only grassland microbes, with the assumption that local decomposer microbes would be more effective than grassland microbes at decomposing litter in their native environment. We found that potential extracellular enzyme activities varied significantly (p<0.01) by site for all nine enzyme classes. Six of the nine enzymes assayed (and six of the seven hydrolytic enzymes) failed to support our hypothesis, exhibiting significantly lower enzyme activity in the coldest and wettest site in comparison to the other four sites (p<0.01). Conversely, both oxidative enzymes assayed exhibited the greatest observed activity in the coldest, wettest site, supporting our hypothesis and indicating that hydrolytic and oxidative enzyme classes from the same microbial community respond independently to changes in temperature and moisture. The addition of local inoculum to grassland litter did not have an effect on mass loss or on observed potential enzyme activity for any of the nine enzymes assayed, suggesting that grassland microbial communities may adapt to future changes in climate.",

            "abstract": "Disasters have an enormous cost in lives and livelihoods, but the use of rigorous evidence-based scientific approaches to minimise their impact remains poor. Vast amounts of science which could be readily applied for disaster risk reduction (DRR) is under-utilised, if used at all. Previous international agreements have failed to change this picture, but there is a clear call from the international community that the 2015 Sendai framework should make a difference; it is thus re-appraising how to bridge the chasm that exists between DRR relevant scientists and potential users of their research. There is widespread recognition of the need for risk affected countries and communities to engage in science-based decision-making, but several barriers, such as a lack of infrastructure or necessary skills, institutions, and enforcement of science-based policies require significant attention. There are now incentives for governments to respond: the framework has science embedded throughout and it sets-out national targets against which science uptake can be monitored; similarly, widening access to insurance also demands sound science. Advances such as open-data and models, increasing computational capacity, expanding networks, evolving diverse mobile technologies and the other multiple facets of the big data agenda, also should drive change. So, how does the scientific community need to adapt? Whilst vast amounts of ‘DRR-relevant’ science has been produced, too little of it can be readily used in DRR science. Much remains highly disciplinary and focused on analysis of limited distributions or single processes with a small number of agents; by contrast real-world DRR problems are commonly complex, with multiple drivers and uncertainties. There is a major need for a trans-disciplinary DRR-focused risk research agenda to evolve. Not only do research funders need to develop and resource risk research, but researchers themselves need to identify that focussing on the bigger risk picture is commonly more important than addressing the traditional disciplinary topics that they have commonly engaged.",

We have developed detailed 1D models describing the transport of flare-accelerated electrons and ions through magnetic flux loops in the solar atmosphere, how these particles heat the ambient plasma, and the emission produced from the flaring loops. However, because of their 1D geometry these models do not include important spatial information. For example, the flare impulsive phase may last several hundred seconds, but it is unlikely that flare-accelerated particles precipitate down a single flux loop for the duration of the entire impulsive phase. In fact, from high-resolution spatial observations we know that many filaments are successively heated in the impulsive phase. We will describe a novel approach which uses the timing of pulses in hard and soft X-ray fluxes observed during the 15 February 2011 flare as a proxy for the lifetime of the impulsive phase on individual loops. We will combine many loops simulated with our 1D flare loop model to construct a multi-filamented model of the Sun's atmospheric response and emission produced during this flare. We will compare this predicted emission to observations of obtained by the EVE, AIA and RHESSI instruments.",

However, delivery of nZVI in the subsurface to the treatment zones is challenging as the bare nZVI particles have a higher tendency to agglomerate. The subsurface mobility of nZVI can be enhanced by stabilizing nZVI with polymer, such as carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC). In this study, numerical simulations were conducted to evaluate CMC stabilized nZVI transport behavior in porous media. The numerical simulations were based on a set of laboratory-scale transport experiments that were conducted in a two-dimensional water-saturated glass-walled sandbox (length – 55 cm; height – 45 cm; width – 1.4 cm), uniformly packed with silica sand. In the transport experiments: CMC stabilized nZVI and a non-reactive dye tracer Lissamine Green B (LGB) were used; water specific discharge and CMC concentration were varied; movements of LGB, and CMC-nZVI in the sandbox were tracked using a camera, a light source and a dark box. The concentrations of LGB, CMC, and CMC-nZVI at the sandbox outlet were analyzed. A 2D multiphase flow and transport model was applied to simulate experimental results. The images from LGB dye transport experiments were used to determine the pore water velocities and media permeabilities in various layers in the sand box. These permeability values were used in the subsequent simulations of CMC-nZVI transport. The 2D compositional simulator, modified to include colloid filtration theory (CFT), treated CMC as a solute and nZVI as a colloid. The simulator included composition dependent viscosity to account for CMC injection and mixing, and attachment efficiency as a fitting parameter for nZVI transport modeling. In the experiments, LGB and CMC recoveries were greater than 95%; however, CMC residence time was significantly higher than the LGB residence time and the higher CMC concentration caused higher pressure drops in the sandbox. The nZVI recovery was lower than 40% in all experiments. The simulation results were found to be in good agreement with the experimental results, implying that the compositional simulator including CFT-modified transport equations could be utilized for the estimation of CMC-stabilized nZVI transport in porous media and design of field scale implementations of CMC-nZVI for remediation.",

NASA’s Applied Remote Sensing Training (ARSET) program works directly with agencies and policy makers to develop in-person and online training courses that teach end users how to access, visualize, and apply NASA Earth Science data in their profession. The expansion of ARSET into wildfire applications began in 2015 with a webinar and subsequent in-person training hosted in collaboration with Idaho State University’s (ISU) GIS Training and Research Center (TReC). These trainings featured presentations from the USDA Forest Service’s Remote Sensing Training and Applications Center, the Land Processes DAAC, Northwest Nazarene University, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and ISU’s GIS TReC. The webinar focused on providing land managers, non-governmental organizations, and international management agencies with an overview of 1) remote sensing platforms for wildfire applications, 2) products for pre- and post-fire planning and assessment, 3) the use of terrain data, 4) new techniques and technologies such as Unmanned Aircraft Systems and the Soil Moisture Active Passive Mission (SMAP), and 5) the RECOVER Decision Support System. This training highlighted online tools that engage the wildfire community through collaborative monitoring and assessment efforts. Webinar attendance included 278 participants from 178 organizations in 42 countries and 33 US states. The majority of respondents (93%) from a post-webinar survey indicated they displayed improvement in their understanding of specific remote-sensing data products appropriate for their work needs. With collaborative efforts between federal, state, and local agencies and academic institutions, increased use of NASA Earth Observations may lead to improved near real-time decision making and long-term wildfire mitigation and management.",

            "abstract": "Drought is one of the most complicated natural hazards, and causes serious environmental, economic and social consequences. Agricultural production systems, which are highly susceptible to weather and climate extremes, are often the first and most vulnerable sector to be affected by drought events. In Africa, crop yield potential and grazing quality are already nearing their limit of temperature sensitivity, and, rapid population growth and frequent drought episodes pose serious complications for food security. It is critical to promote sustainable agriculture development in Africa under conditions of climate extremes. Soil moisture is one of the most important indicators for agriculture drought, and is a fundamentally critical parameter for decision support in crop management, including planting, water use efficiency and irrigation. While very significant technological advances have been introduced for remote sensing of surface soil moisture from space, in-situ measurements are still critical for calibration and validation of soil moisture estimation algorithms. For operational applications, synergistic collaboration is needed to integrate measurements from different sensors at different spatial and temporal scales.\nIn this presentation, a collaborative effort is demonstrated for drought monitoring in Africa, supported and coordinated by WMO, including surface soil moisture and crop status monitoring. In-situ measurements of soil moisture, precipitation and temperature at selected sites are provided by local partners in Africa. Measurements from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) are integrated with in-situ observations to derive surface soil moisture at high spatial resolution. Crop status is estimated through temporal analysis of current and historical MODIS measurements. Integrated analysis of soil moisture data and crop status provides both in-depth understanding of drought conditions and potential impacts on crop yield. This information is extremely useful in local decision support for agricultural management.",

            "abstract": "Resulting from a NSF funded REU program at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 2015, this research utilized gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to analyze the fatty acid composition of suspended particulate organic matter (POM) and zooplankton (ZP; primarily copepods). Samples analyzed for this study were collected simultaneously from surface waters approximately 9 miles off the coast of San Diego in June 2015. I was testing the hypothesis that essential fatty acids in ZP should reflect their diet, in particular, distinguishing contributions from a microbial versus traditional food web. Food web structure in this region of the ocean has been shown to be sensitive to climate change on inter-annual and longer timescales. Thus, a proxy that identifies restructuring of food webs would be useful for examining the response of ocean ecosystems to future climate change. Lipids were extracted from ZP and POM using a modified Bligh and Dyer method with sonication. Following saponification free fatty acids and other lipids were further purified using column chromatography. Polar functional groups in lipids were then methylated prior to GC-MS analysis. In addition, 2-dimensional GCxGC with time of flight MS was used to distinguish polyunsaturated fatty acid isomers. My poster will present initial findings of shared fatty acids of zooplankton and POM suspended material from the Northern Pacific collection site. Further research will be focused on analyzing the hydrogen isotope composition of fatty acids in zooplankton and suspended DOM obtained at the collection site to further characterize and increase certainty on the role of microbes and phytoplankton in the region’s food-web to distinguish prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources.",

It is currently building the spacecraft and instrumentation to observe the sun in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) through 2036. After more than 6 million calibrated images, it is appropriate to examine NOAA data as providing retrospective context for scientific missions. In particular, this presentation examines the record of GOES Solar X-ray Imager (SXI) observations, including continuity, photometric stability and comparison to other contemporary x-ray imagers. The first GOES Solar X-ray Imager was launched in 2001 and entered operations in 2003. The current SXIs will remain in operations until approximately 2020, when a new series of Solar (extreme-)Ultraviolet Imagers (SUVIs) will replace them as the current satellites reach their end of life. In the sense that the SXIs are similar to Yokoh’s SXT and Hinode’s XRT, the SUVI instruments will be similar to SOHO’s EIT and SDO’s AIA. The move to narrowband EUV imagers will better support eventual operational estimation of plasma conditions. In particular, plans are to leverage advances in automated image processing and segmentation to assist forecasters. While NOAA’s principal use of these observations is real-time space weather forecasting, they will continue to provide a consistent context measurement for researchers for decades to come.",

The objective was to determine if a difference in tree water use was detectible at the USGS gaged basin scale. It was hypothesized that ET rates are higher in Evergreen dominated watershed due to greater annual productivity. Discharge from United States Geological Survey (USGS) gages (D), landcover from the National Landcover Dataset (NLCD), and precipitation (P) from Daymet, Mauer, Observed Gridded, and PRISM. Annual ET was estimated using ET = P – D. To reduce geological influences the study basins were selected from an area of crystalline bedrock within the Piedmont and Southern Blue Ridge physiographic provinces. Correlations between ET and forest type show a significant difference between evergreen and deciduous forest cover. Evergreen forest dominated watersheds had a positive relationship with ET. Deciduous and Mixed forest dominated watersheds had a negative relationship with ET. These findings are similar to other studies looking at the effect of forest type on ET although other land uses in the basins have potentially indiscernible influences on discharge.",

However, this region has currently few landslide susceptibility maps implemented on an adequate scale. Identification of landslide susceptibility areas is fundamental in successful land use planning and management practices to reduce risk. This paper applied the Bayes’ theorem based on weight of evidence (WoE) using 8 landslide-related factors in a geographic information system (GIS) for landslide susceptibility mapping. 378 landslide locations were identified and mapped on a selected basin in the city of Nova Friburgo, triggered by the January 2011 rainfall event. The landslide scars were divided into two subsets: training and validation subsets. The 8 landslide-related factors weighted by WoE were performed using chi-square test to indicate which variables are conditionally independent of each other to be used in the final map. Finally, the maps of weighted factors were summed up to construct the landslide susceptibility map and validated by the validation landslide subset. According to the results, slope, aspect and contribution area showed the higher positive spatial correlation with landslides. In the landslide susceptibility map, 21% of the area presented very low and low susceptibilities with 3% of the validation scars, 41% presented medium susceptibility with 22% of the validation scars and 38% presented high and very high susceptibilities with 75% of the validation scars. The very high susceptibility class stands for 16% of the basin area and has 54% of the all scars. The approach used in this study can be considered very useful since 75% of the area affected by landslides was included in the high and very high susceptibility classes.",

We need to be able to measure, understand and interpret variability in mercury concentrations in seawater, which is often as low as some 10 percent. We organized international intcalibration exercises for total mercury and total methylmercury determination in seawater collected during the 2013 Dutch GEOTRACES MedBlack cruise (GA04- Black Sea), the 2014 French GEOTRACES GEOVIDE (GA01- North Atlantic Ocean) and the 2015 German GEOTRACES TranArc II cruise ( GN04 - Arctic Ocean). The exercises were intended to primarily evaluate the analytical performance of each participating laboratory. Therefore each laboratory received a single sample bottle of similar size, that has undergone the same cleaning procedure prior to sampling, and each sample was preserved in the same manner. The 2013 exercise was intended as a broader screening with a maximum number (25) of participating laboratories. Results indicated substantial disagreement between the participating laboratories, for both total mercury and methylmercury determinations. For the 2014 exercise we could only invite 10 laboratories of the 2013 exercise. Intercomparability of the second exercise was considerably better, but needs to be further improved in the years to come. The 2015 will be organized this summer. We will present the results of both intercalibration exercises in detail, attempt to explain causes for disagreements, and share our ideas about future developments to achieve traceable mercury measurements in the oceans. We will also make use of this occasion to plan the 2016 GEOTRACES intercalibration cruise.",

Ensembles of climate simulations give a range of projections, but it is unclear how large these ensembles need to be to provide an accurate assessment of the influence of internal variability on Arctic sea ice projections. As large ensembles of fully coupled globak climate models are expensive to run, the maximum ensemble size in the CMIP5 archive consisted of ten simulations, with many models represented by only one to six ensemble members. An analysis of the Arctic sea ice simulation from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) large ensemble with 30 members for RCP8.5 and the CESM medium ensemble with 15 members for RCP4.5 demonstrates how many ensemble members are needed to constrain the range of uncertainty in Arctic sea ice predictions for the 21th century in one of the CMIP5 models. The goal of this analysis is to aid in the interpretation of smaller ensembles and encourage larger ensembles for CMIP6.",

            "abstract": "Significant amounts of ionospheric plasma can be transported to high altitudes (above 1000 km) in response to a variety of plasma heating and uplifting processes. Soft electron precipitation heats ambient, F-region ionospheric electrons creating electron pressure increases and upflows. Strong DC electric fields frictionally heat the ion population also resulting in ion upflows. Lastly, field-aligned thermospheric winds can contribute to ion motion at lower altitudes, while geomagnetically perpendicular winds may affect frictional heating. Once ions have been lifted to high altitudes, transverse ion acceleration by broadband ELF waves can give the upflowing ions sufficient energy to escape into the magnetosphere (ionospheric outflow). This study examines the thermospheric wind regulation of ionospheric upflow and outflow with a focus on how lower ionosphere dynamics feed source populations for transverse energization and determine the types, and amounts, of outflowing ions. The model used here for this study is a 2D ionospheric model based on a modified 16-moment transport description. It solves conservation of mass, momentum, and parallel and perpendicular energy for all relevant ionospheric species. This model encapsulates ionospheric upflow and outflow processes through the inclusion of DC electric fields, and empirical descriptions of heating by soft electron precipitation and BBELF waves. This model is used to conduct a parametric study of neutral wind effects on upflow and outflow and highlights how low-altitude processes affect ion outflow through the regulation of source plasma available to higher altitudes. This model is also used to construct a case study of ion outflows at the nightside polar cap boundary using data from the VISIONS sounding rocket campaign.",

The aim of this study was to first establish the structural framework of a ~1500 km2 region in the central Qilian-Nan Shan thrust belt through detailed geologic mapping and couple this mapping with a systematic U-Pb zircon geochronology. This study identifies two Cenozoic thrust systems in the region: (1) the Shule and (2) Tuo Lai thrust systems. We present LA-ICP MS U-Pb zircon ages of samples collected from these thrust systems that record Neoproterozoic to the Paleozoic magmatism. According to our U-Pb zircon dating results, the basement of the Qilian Shan has experienced at least three periods of intrusive activity since the Neoproterozoic: (1) 930±8.0 to 897±4.0 Ma, (2) 529±9.0 to 403±18 Ma, and (3) 383.0±6.0 Ma to 345.0±17 Ma, with the peak ages of 920 Ma, 475 Ma and 378 Ma, respectively. Zircons from high- and ultrahigh-pressure eclogites from the northern central Qilian have an igneous protolith with an age of ca. 916±22.8 Ma (2σ, MSWD=1.71). Most zircons display recrystallized rims, which suggests that eclogite-faces metamorphism occurred at ca. 485±22 Ma (2σ, MSWD=1.4). We integrate our U-Pb zircon ages with stratigraphic and paleontological data to discuss the origin and tectonic evolution of the Qilian Shan Precambrian basement in northwestern China. A Proterozoic continental quartzite sample yields detrital zircon age-clusters at ca. 1.3–1.2 Ga and ca. 2.0–1.7 Ga, and minor peaks scattered between ca. 2.7 and ca. 2.2 Ga. This age signature is very similar to our quartzite sample from the Baiyunerbo Group of the North China craton, in Inner Mongolia. This similarity provides further support for the idea that the Precambrian Qilian Shan basement was part of the North China craton.",

The model employs a spherical coordinate system with finite differences in r and θ and Fourier decomposition in Φ. The model is linearized assuming a background azimuthal velocity field UΦ(r,θ) and an arbitrary background magnetic field Br,θ,Φ(r,θ). The Boussinesq approximation is employed and the buoyancy forces are prescribed in terms of a spatially variable Brunt-Vaisala frequency N(r,θ). The equations are cast into a sparse generalized eigenvalue problem by assuming solutions of the form uj,bj,p=CjeimΦ+λt and eigenmodes are found. Good agreement is obtained with previous approximate analytical solutions for zonal (m=0) magnetic-Archimedes-Coriolis (MAC) waves (e.g. Braginsky, 1993), global magnetic-Rossby (m>0) waves (e.g. Braginsky, 1998), and equatorially-trapped magnetic-Rossby waves (e.g. Bergman, 1993). This model is employed to study the origins of the fast equatorial waves observed by Chulliat et al. (2015) in recent high-resolution magnetic field models to constrain plausible properties of the stably-stratified layer and core-surface magnetic field.",

The biogenic emissions are calculated in each subgrid vegetation and land use tile in LM3, based on parameters including vegetation type, leaf area index, canopy air temperature, and soil moisture. The LM3-MEGAN model computes global isoprene emissions of ~520 Tg C/yr in the year of 2005, comparable to previous estimates. We find that isoprene emissions in this coupled system depend strongly on the diurnal range of canopy air temperature simulated by LM3, leading to significantly higher isoprene emissions than obtained by running MEGAN with atmospheric temperatures from AM3 (~ 380 Tg C/yr). We also find that isoprene emissions simulated by LM3-MEGAN over the eastern United States vary significantly from year to year, although global emission totals remain stable over the same period. Preliminary analysis indicates that this large interannual variability results mainly from strong variations in soil moisture over the US as a result of precipitation changes. LM3-MEGAN will be further evaluated against satellite HCHO columns as well as isoprene fluxes measured at surface sites. We will then apply the LM3-MEGAN-AM3 modeling system to investigate the impacts of land-use change on air quality and radiative forcing in past, present and projected future atmospheres.",

With an average of eight million people flying every day, this view represents a major opportunity to engage a large and captive audience with the great insights that scientists have made through hundreds of years of investigation. Curating entire continents’ worth of geological information covering any possible flight path would be impossible; fortunately, the NSF EarthCube initiative has facilitated the interoperability and accessibility of many geoscience databases full of rich scientific content ready to be exposed. Flyover Country (FC; fc.umn.edu) is an NSF funded mobile application leveraging hybrid mobile app technologies and data repositories to create a robust, offline, geoscience education and data discovery tool for both Android and iOS. Given a flight path, FC downloads a strip of relevant data from from geoscience databases including geological, paleobiological, Wikipedia, and map data that is saved to the device, allowing offline use during the journey without the need for in-flight wifi. Location, altitude, speed, and direction are provided by GPS in order to prompt the user with descriptions of points of interest that are visible from his or her current location. The app is not limited to use from the sky: its offline capabilities are also useful on roads and hiking trails, acting as a location aware and interactive version of something like the Roadside Geology book series. Using data spanning many domains, FC works as a data discovery tool for students and scientists in the field, bringing spatially referenced geoscience data into their hands and providing valuable location information in map view without the need for a cellular network signal. This context allows decisions to be made in the field based on the maximum amount of relevant information. A custom FC module created as part of outreach for Proyecto Lago Junín, an NSF/ICDP funded paleoclimate drilling project in the Central Peruvian Andes, is the first test case of the extensible nature of the application and custom content creation for specific projects.",

            "abstract": "A model has been developed to determine the theoretical limits of steam survival in a water column during a subaqueous explosive eruption. Understanding the role of steam dynamics in particle transport and the evolution of the thermal budget is critical to addressing the first order questions of subaqueous eruption mechanics. Ash transport in subaqueous eruptions is initially coupled to the fate of volatile transport. The survival of steam bubbles to the water surface could enable non-wetted ash transport from the vent to a subaerial ash cloud. Current eruption models assume a very simple plume mixing geometry, that cold water mixes with the plume immediately after erupting, and that the total volume of steam condenses in the initial phase of mixing. This limits the survival of steam to within tens of meters above the vent. Though these assumptions may be valid, they are unproven, and the calculations based on them do not take into account any kinetic constraints on condensation. The following model has been developed to evaluate the limits of juvenile steam survival in a subaqueous explosive eruption.\nThis model utilizes the analytical model for condensation of steam injected into a sub-cooled pool produced in Park et al. (2007). Necessary parameterizations require an iterative internal calculation of the steam saturation temperature and vapor density for each modeled time step. The contribution of volumetric expansion due to depressurization of a rising bubble is calculated and used in conjunction with condensation rate to calculate the temporal evolution of bubble volume and radius. Using steam bubble volume with the BBO equation for Lagrangian transport in a fluid, the bubble rise velocity is calculated and used to evaluate the rise distance.\nThe steam rise model proves a useful tool to compare the effects of steam condensation, volumetric expansion, volume flux, and water depth on the dynamics of juvenile steam. The modeled results show that a sufficiently high volatile flux could lead to the survival of steam bubbles from >1km depths to the ocean surface, though low to intermediate fluxes lead to fairly rapid condensation. Building on this result we also present the results of simulations of multiphase steam jets and consider the likelihood of collapse inside a vapor envelope.",

            "abstract": "Carbonyl sulfide (OCS) is currently a focus of ground-, aircraft-, and satellite-based measurements as well as of model development, owing mainly to its potential use as a large-scale proxy for gross primary production (GPP). OCS is taken up by leaves and either taken up or emitted by soils, depending on the circumstances. Because OCS is destroyed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase within the leaf rather than by any light-dependent reaction, the leaf uptake is expected to be related to the conductance of the diffusive pathway into the leaf (stomata + mesophyll + leaf boundary air layer) rather than to GPP directly, though GPP and the diffusive conductance are often strongly correlated.\nHere we use 2 years of eddy covariance measurements of the net ecosystem-atmosphere exchange of OCS, along with measurements of the vertical profile of OCS within the forest, to investigate the controls on ecosystem-scale OCS uptake and emission. We compare the OCS measurements, and simultaneous CO2 isotope flux and profile measurements, to predictions from the Simple Biosphere (SiB) model, which has been used to simulate OCS and 13CO2 fluxes for both vegetation and soils but has not yet been systematically tested against these relatively novel tracers. We thereby address the key question: How can measurements of the net ecosystem-atmosphere OCS exchange contribute to empirical quantification of stomatal conductance and GPP and to improving process-based ecosystem models?",

The two-phase magma/mantle, time-dependent flow is modeled by conservational laws of fluid and solid matrix. Resulting coupled Stokes equations and Darcy's law are solved using finite-element method for a geologically relevant time, thus predicts the melt evolution within the upper mantle in terms of porosity distribution in 3-D space. Then we implement MuMap to forward calculate and visualize the seismic velocities of the two-phase mixture, resulting from variations in temperature, bulk composition and melt/frozen-in melt distribution. By exploring a broad parameter space, our work provides a framework to model and identify the most likely causes of the seismic anomalies at LAB and within the Lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "The dominant plant functional type (PFT) of an ecosystem is influenced by local climate. Climate is changing at its greatest historical rate from anthropogenic forcing, which leads to ecosystem redistribution. Climate-ecosystem empirical relationships or biogeography models are used to spatially map current ecosystem distribution and to predict redistribution from climate change. Though climate-ecosystem metrics produce maps that predict the final reorganization of species from climate change they do not generally account for time delay in establishment created by species competition, withdrawal, and invasion. Transition zones between ecosystem types, such as tundra-taiga and evergreen-deciduous, will experience a time delay to establishment from the withdrawal and invasion of species that affect the carbon balance. Dynamic global vegetation models can be used predict the future PFT distribution under different climate change, but to date have not taken a robust approach to the competition between species invasion and withdrawal that creates a delay to final ecosystem redistribution. Therefore, we validate the dominant PFT distribution under current climate conditions of an advanced ecosystem model that has competition and migration processes, against remote sensing data of PFT type across northern North America. The climate-ecosystem relationships in the model match remote sensing data of dominant PFT from current climate 76% of the time for the ~3000 half degree sites in the domain. A climate change scenario was then run and our results showed that ~50% of the domain will change dominant PFT by 2070, highlighting that species competition and invasion influences on carbon balance from climate change is important in predicting future carbon balance. A model experimental design was then run with varying migration rates, species composition and distribution, and disturbance patterns to obtain a range of potential future terrestrial carbon stock from climate change that incorporates the time delay to establishment. Our research highlights the importance of accounting for plant migration in predicting future carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Poster_Survey_2.pdf\nDIC export by streams and rivers is a major component of the global C cycle. However, many questions remain about the source and fate of aquatic DIC and CO2. Stable carbon isotope δ13C can provide information about the source and evolution of DIC and CO2 along hydrological networks. But the interpretation of δ13C values must be made with caution, since several biogeochemical processes affect the isotopic signal. In this study, we developed a systematic approach resolving these influences when interpreting large-scale patterns in δ13C-DIC and δ13C-CO2 values with regard to the source and fate of C in low order streams. We analyzed δ13C-DIC values in streams from four different regions of Sweden. Taken together they span large gradients in climate, geomorphology and lithology. The source of the DIC pool was predominantly biogenic in three of the regions (δ13C-DICsource = -17.4‰), but not the northernmost, where a clear geogenic input could be identified (δ13C-DICsource =-8.2 ‰). Our results suggest that soil respired CO2 is the main source of stream CO2 (δ13C-CO2source=-22.9‰) in all four regions, yet aquatic processes can also be a contributing component of the DIC pool in streams, with corresponding influence on the δ13C values. Once CO2 was in the stream, degassing was the primary control on its fate. However, there were indications that aquatic biological processes added CO2, (by DOC degradation) in the southernmost region, and that CO2 was removed (by photosynthesis) in the most central region. Correctly interpreted, the carbon stable isotope data can serve as a powerful tool for identifying the source and fate of stream DIC.",

In this work we improved the PATH(Particle Acceleration and Transport in the Heliosphere) model by initiating a 2D CME-driven shock to investigate particle acceleration at different locations of an oblique CME-drive shock, where the shock has different obliquity angle(θBN). Thus we can study problems like whether quasi-perpendicular or quasi-parallel shock is more efficient in particle acceleration.The PATH model is based on the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism. The core of the model consists of a 3D Zeus module, which computes numerically the background solar wind and the CME-drive shock as inputs; and a shell module where the convection and diffusion of accelerated particles within the shock complex are followed. The 2D CME-driven shock is generated by perturbing the boundary condition of a steady background solar wind in certain patterns.",

The MTVF comprises at least three regions containing contemporaneous (~3.7 to 1.26 Ma) Ne-normative volcanic rocks. The intermediate Mount Taylor (MT) strata-volcano contains early central and flanking mantle xenolith-bearing alkali basalts and hawaiites. The Rio Puerco (RP) volcanic necks contain mantle xenolith-bearing basanites and alkali basalts and no evolved lavas. Mesa Chivato (MC) contains an alkaline mafic to felsic suite with geochemical similarities to RP and MT lavas but no known mantle-xenoliths.\nThe MTVF xenoliths are diverse (e.g., Thomas et al., 2012, AGU Fall Meeting, V43A-2825) and suggest varying degrees of melt enrichment/fertilization. By LA-ICPMS, we are characterizing olivine trace element chemistry from the mantle xenoliths and basaltic (sensu lato) phenocrysts to test how much can be determined about likely source rocks by phenocryst olivine alone. This is part of a continuing project to investigate spatial trends in Laramide mantle melt metasomatism and its relation to post-Laramide magma compositions.\nWe have analyzed samples from a RP neck (lherzolite in alkali basalt); flows from the MT flank (websterite in alkali basalt) and from the MT amphitheater (wehrlite in hawaiite). Additionally, we analyzed olivine phenocrysts from three xenolith-free lavas: a MT basanite and MC alkali basalt and hawaiite.\n(1) As diverse as the xenoliths are, their olivine clusters together with regards to most trace elements, though the xenoliths can be discriminated from each other by Co abundances alone or in Cr-Al and Cr-Zn space.\n(2) Phenocrysts from xenolith-bearing alkali basalts cluster with the xenolith olivine, suggesting the melt was in equilibrium with a lithology of a similar trace element budget.\n(3) Phenocrysts from the xenolith-bearing MT hawaiite and most MC phenocrysts are depleted in incompatible elements (Zr, Ti, and Y) relative to the xenoliths and cluster together, suggesting another melt source (assuming the xenolith-bearing lava is near-primary). Some MC olivine rims and the MT basanite phenocrysts are enriched relative to the xenoliths and may represent fractionation or mixing.",

Several studies suggested a possible link between the Arctic Amplification and the change of weather pattern in the mid-latitude. However, the physical mechanism of this link is still under debate.

However, given the variable data quality and uneven data sampling associated with this type of model, it is essential that there be a means to calculate high-quality estimates of the path-dependent variance and covariance associated with the predicted travel times of ray paths through the model. In this paper, we describe a methodology for accomplishing this by exploiting the full model covariance matrix and show examples of path-dependent travel time prediction uncertainty computed from our latest tomographic model.\nTypical global 3D SALSA3D models have on the order of 1/2 million nodes, so the challenge in calculating the covariance matrix is formidable: 0.9 TB storage for 1/2 of a symmetric matrix, necessitating an Out-Of-Core (OOC) blocked matrix solution technique. With our approach the tomography matrix (G which includes a prior model covariance constraint) is multiplied by its transpose (GTG) and written in a blocked sub-matrix fashion. We employ a distributed parallel solution paradigm that solves for (GTG)-1 by assigning blocks to individual processing nodes for matrix decomposition update and scaling operations. We first find the Cholesky decomposition of GTG which is subsequently inverted. Next, we employ OOC matrix multiplication methods to calculate the model covariance matrix from (GTG)-1 and an assumed data covariance matrix. Given the model covariance matrix, we solve for the travel-time covariance associated with arbitrary ray-paths by summing the model covariance along both ray paths. Setting the paths equal and taking the square root yields the travel prediction uncertainty for the single path.",

Dragged along with it is a superconducting plasma of highly ionized gas that carries a “frozen-in” magnetic field. DSCOVR was recently launched and has joined Wind, ACE, and SOHO at L1 in order to make independent magnetic field measurements of the solar wind. These data, in conjunction with velocity measurements and the DSCOVR Faraday Cup ion spectra, can give us a sense of what shape the current sheets have as they pass through the spacecraft. Magnetic reconnection occurs as a result of the squeezing of opposing field lines to a cusp in a direction perpendicular to the direction of travel, and can continue to occur out to interplanetary distances due to the large amount of energy stored in ICME field lines. In particular, we are interested in high-density pile-up regions where the B-field components change sign during the June 22-23 ICME of this year. With at least three spacecraft, we are able to map the current sheet crossings in the solar wind at snapshots in time through planar timing calculations and minimum variance analysis. The advantages of multi-point and high time resolution plasma measurements will be assessed in determining large scale morphology, and for small scale dynamics of ICMEs, respectively.",

Only clear sky measurements of the outgoing radiance are used in the AIRS physical retrieval of temperature, water vapor, and certain trace gases. To overcome cloud contamination the clear sky radiance is estimated using an iterative procedure that combines an initial estimate of the clear state from a neural network along with a three by three grid of AIRS measurements. The radiance error estimate, a component critical to the AIRS physical retrieval, must include contributions from all assumed parameters input to the forward model on top of instrument noise and amplification from cloud clearing. When the error estimate is too large the AIRS physical retrieval becomes over-constrained to the first guess profile. Therefore quantifying the cloud cleared error estimate is essential to an effective physical retrieval.\nWe will validate the cloud-cleared radiances through the use of nearby clear ocean scenes and with comparisons to clear pixels from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS). AIRS cloud cleared radiances are spectrally convolved to MODIS channels for this comparison. This analysis quantifies error due to cloud-clearing and demonstrates that clear MODIS pixels can be used with the standard AIRS quality control procedure to improve identification poor retrievals.",

This is particularly the case in arid environments where evaporative effects are perhaps the most significant unknown variable when attempting to reconstruct regional-scale hydroclimate variations from tree ring isotope proxies. To quantify the effects of extreme aridity on α-cellulose δ18O values, we measured the oxygen isotope values of groundwater, xylem water, leaf water, and tree ring α-cellulose in an endemic species of drought-resistant trees (Prosopis tamarugo) from different microenvironments throughout the Atacama Desert of Northern Chile. Average annual precipitation is <5 mm/yr, and groundwater is the primary water source for P. tamarugo trees in the region. Groundwater δ18O values at the sample locations range from -6.7 to -9.7‰, and xylem water δ18O values record a systematic increase (ave. Δ18Ox-gw =+1.3‰; 2σ =1.0‰). Leaf waters are significantly affected by evaporative enrichment with a range of δ18O values from 7 to 23‰. This range most likely reflects a number of physiological and environmental conditions including tree size, canopy development, and sample time (i.e. morning vs. evening). However, despite the large variation in leaf water δ18O values, the average difference between the α-cellulose and groundwater is very consistent (Δ18Oc-gw = +39.7‰; 2σ =1.3‰). P. tamarugo samples were collected in austral spring, when tree growth was at its maximum; therefore, any seasonal variations in plant physiology not captured with this dataset will have a limited impact on cellulose production. These data demonstrate that despite the variable evaporative enrichment of 18O in the leaf water, the α-cellulose δ18O values provide a remarkably consistent record of variations in groundwater δ18O values in this extremely arid environment.",

The region is also very diverse in terms of oilfield operators, who use extraction techniques including conventional, enhanced oil recovery (EOR), and fracking. As regulators and operators need more knowledge about emission patterns locally, we undertook comprehensive mapping and characterization of leak sources at the regional scale using vehicle-based data collection, together with computational techniques. We measured the presence and source of fugitive emissions from infrastructure and oilfield activities in eight 100 km2 survey domains. These included two controls with no oil and gas activity, and otherwise the domains were selected to capture the diversity of development; targeting primarily conventional and EOR activities in the Weyburn-Midale beds, and unconventional activities in the Bakken play. A total of 25 unique operators fell within the survey domains. Each domain was surveyed multiple times for CO2, CH4, and H2S, allowing us to identify persistent leaks and to screen out one-time events. The multiple gas targets also provided opportunities for discriminating one type of fugitive emission from another (i.e. flares from storage tanks) using ratios of excess (above ambient) concentrations, after correcting for natural background variability with a signal-processing routine. Fugitive emissions were commonly observed in all study domains. Most emissions were associated with oil and gas infrastructure, as opposed to drilling and other short-term activities. There were obvious emissions at many well pads, storage tanks, and flares. We also observed high geochemical variability around flares, with some being very effective in combusting toxic gases, and others less so. Almost all observed concentrations fell below regulatory limits, but have a cumulative impact in this region of high oilfield density. The low-level leaks are potentially also indicative of localized and/or future problems, which may be of interest to local operators.",

            "abstract": "The Karonga area of northern Malawi is in the hanging wall of the Livingstone border fault. While most of the strain is accommodated along the border fault, recent seismicity and remote sensing studies indicate there is strain accommodation in the hanging wall area. Gravity data were collected along two West-East transects (one in the north and the other in the south) in this region to explore this strain accommodation, locate faults, determine the thickness of sediments on the hanging wall block of the Karonga fault, and to determine the geometry of a Karoo depositional basin. Both profiles extended from the uplifted basements into the rift basin; the northern profile is approximately 30 km in length while the southern profile is 70 km. Both gravity profiles were acquired with a Scintrex CG-5 Autograv using station spacings ranging between 0.5 – 2 km. These gravity transects place constraints on the structural interpretations of the area based on previous fieldwork and remote sensing. This project uses 2.5D forward gravity modeling to test the possibility of the Karonga fault being a single fault in the north while breaking up into multiple faults further south as it responds to the weaknesses created by preexisting structures.",

            "abstract": "The Baja-BC hypothesis is at the center of a great earth sciences controversy. It stems from paleomagnetic observations that require large-scale displacements of continental crust from low latitudes (Baja, California) to moderate latitudes (British Columbia). Many geologists dispute the scale of the displacements due to a lack of corroborating geological evidence. We provide a robust, geological dataset that confirms the paleomagnetic observations.\nDetrital zircons from Cretaceous to Paleocene sandstone of the Nanaimo Group, which crops out in western Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands of southwest British Columbia, are analyzed. The data show a clear transition from local <300 Ma western Coast Plutonic Complex sources in the Campanian, to sources that include a significant component of >300 Ma grains in the Maastrichtian–Paleogene. An identical pattern is observed in detrital zircon datasets from southern California forearc basin deposits, and schists interpreted as the subducted remnants of forearc deposits. With a high-n dataset (n=3041) we are able to rule out possible >300 Ma source regions in Canada and the northern United States, and uniquely tie Nanaimo Group rocks to the Mojave-Sonora region of SW United States. This implies that at the end of the Cretaceous, Vancouver Island and western mainland BC were adjacent to southern California and northwestern Mexico, requiring 1900 km of displacement during the latest Cretaceous and Paleocene, consistent with paleomagnetic results. An implication of this result is that the western Coast Batholith of southwest BC was positioned between the northern Peninsular Ranges and southern Sierra Nevada batholiths in the late Cretaceous, and likely represents a displaced segment of a once continuous Cordilleran arc batholith. These results have broad implications for our understanding of episodic arc magmatism in the Cordillera, the tectonic evolution of western North America, Laramide orogenesis, the development and extent of the Nevadaplano, and the onset of Basin and Range extension.",

            "abstract": "Savannas are the most fire prone ecosystems in the world accounting for more than 75% of annual global fires. Wildfires in savannas consume large quantities of biomass releasing CO2 and aerosols while leaving ash and char residues. The residues form black-grey patches on the soil surface, and together with newly exposed bare soil patches, they play a significant role in altering surface reflectance and vegetation condition. We investigated the impact of fire on savanna albedo and vegetation greenness (from Enhanced Vegetation Index, EVI) from 2000-2014 using data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) for Africa south of the Equator. Preliminary results indicate that more mesic savannas near the Equator have the highest fire frequencies, with fire frequency generally decreasing with aridity. Immediately after fires, the average change in albedo and EVI is -5% and -10%, respectively, with the magnitude of the change increasing with aridity. The time for albedo to recover to values similar to unburned areas varied by latitude, with more mesic savannas recovering much faster (24 days vs. 65 days for dry savannas). The time for vegetation condition to recover did not vary strongly by latitude (about 65 days). The upward shortwave energy in burnt areas in mesic savannas is 53 W m-2 compared to 95 W m-2 for unburnt areas, indicating a positive forcing of about 42 W m-2 associated with mesic savanna fires locally. Approximately 7% of the (primarily savanna) land in southern Africa burns each year, suggesting an overall forcing in Africa south of the Equator of ~1-2 W m-2 associated with savanna fires. This large forcing indicates clearly the important interplay between ecosystem processes (fire) and climate (radiative forcing) in this region. With changing climate, this region is expected to become significantly drier, suggesting that the forcing due to fire might decrease in the coming decades and indicating that fire-induced albedo changes potentially serve as a negative feedback on climate warming.",

            "abstract": "Desertification is one of the global threatening problems in respect of society, economy, and environment, and the assessment of desertification is essential for land planning and management. However desertification is a process that encompasses various factors in various aspects, having difficulties to assess qualitatively. The main purpose of the research is to qualitatively assess sensitivity of land to desertification, and detect the most vulnerable land to desertification in Mongolia and Myanmar using the Mediterranean Desertification and Land Use (MEDALUS) approach. MEDALUS approach aims to provide a manual on key indicators of desertification and mapping environmentally sensitive areas to desertification in the Mediterranean countries. However in this research, MEDALUS approach is implemented and reviewed on the countries located in the Middle Asia; Mongolia and Myanmar. MEDALUS approach identifies regions with the highest risk of desertification with 4 quality index; climate, soil, vegetation, management. Within the four quality index are several regional scale indicators for Mongolia and Myanmar, which gives effect with increasing or decreasing risk of desertification. MODIS satellite images, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and climatic and geographical data were used to calculate the indicators. The weighting of each indicator ranged from 1 to 2; the higher weight the more vulnerable to desertification. The weighted indicators were allocated to 4 quality index, and the four quality index was summed to calculate Environmentally Sensitive Area Index (ESAI) representing the vulnerability of land degradation to desertification. As a result, the Middle East region of Mongolia showed the highest sensitivity, thus the most vulnerable to desertification. Based on the result of this study, it is useful to identify the current state of affairs and the necessity of land planning in Mongolia and Myanmar, one tool that can be utilized for combating desertification. The result of the study is expected to be used as base material in combating desertification and land degradation, and for establishing policies.",

As an energetically costly process, by which each N2 molecule is fixed to a cost of 16ATP molecules, N2 fixation might be P limited process. In this study we tested whether moss P and N concentrations, and N:P ratios could explain N2 fixation in the top 6cm photosynthetically active Sphagnum moss across eight ombrotrophic bogs along south-north geographical gradient in Ontario and Quebec. Under constant environmental conditions, we incubated subsamples of the surface Sphagnum mosses by using both, acetylene reduction assays (ARA) and 15N2 enriched method to measure N2 fixation rates. Same subsamples were later analyzed for N and P concentrations. Our preliminary data show that the increase of P concentration within moss capitula is related to a significant linear increase of ARA rates (R2=0.18, p<0.0001, N=150). N:P ratios showed a significant negative linear relationship with ARA (R2=0.34, p<0.0001, N=150) indicating that P limitation in the photosynthetically active part of mosses in bogs may also indicate P limitation on microbial N2 fixation",

            "abstract": "Tracer testing is one of the most effective methods used to study groundwater flow, reservoir characteristics and subsurface properties in geohydrology. Hydrological tracer tests were conducted with the basic assumption that the tracer is chemically inert and non-reactive. However, not all tracers behave non-reactive at different pH conditions, the particular tracer may interact with mineral surfaces in the reservoir. In order to study the geochemical behavior of some common hydrological tracers flow-through column experiments were conducted at 25°C. Six common hydrological tracers were investigated, amino G acid, fluorescein, napthionic acid, pyranine, rhodamine B and rhodamine G in porous rocks consisting of basaltic glass, quartz or rhyolite at pH 3, 6.5 and 9. Homogenous porous material of fixed grain size 45-125μm were dry packed in the column to conduct flow through column experiments. Tracers were pumped at fixed flow rates for 20 minutes and switched back to experimental blank solution and the tracer concentration monitored at the outlet. The measured break-through tracer curves were compared to theoretical 1-D reactive transport simulations calculated using the PHREEQC program (Parkhurst and Appelo, 1999). The data obtained from the breakthrough curves suggest that the tracers may be reactive, non-reactive and partially reactive depending on the rock type and solution pH. The tracers that were observed to be reactive showed the influence of adsorption and desorption. The results suggest that some tracers commonly used in ground water hydrology are not suitable under all conditions as they may react with the rocks of the groundwater system.",

            "abstract": "Previous radio frequency (RF) observations of volcanic lightning have revealed that electrical activity frequently occurs concurrent with the onset of an explosive volcanic event. Typically, a myriad of electrical impulses originating from directly above the vent are observed first and the ensemble has durations of several seconds. The impulses are distinct from those produced by typical types of thunderstorm lightning, and have earned the moniker “continuous RF” due to their high rate and long-lasting nature . Several seconds after the onset of these impulses, small (100s of meters to several kilometers) lightning discharges occur in the plume and near the vent, and have electrical signatures similar to typical thunderstorm lightning. In eruptions with plume heights reaching 8-10 km or more, large scale (10s of kilometers) lightning discharges are observed throughout the plume several minutes after the onset of an explosive event.\nIn May 2015, a campaign began to study the various types of small-scale electrical activity, including continuous RF, during explosive eruptions of Sakurajima volcano in Kyushu, Japan. The volcano was instrumented with two seismometers, two infrasound arrays, a high sensitivity video camera, an infrared camera, two high speed video cameras, still cameras, a 10-station Lightning Mapping Array, slow and fast electric field change sensors, and a broadband very high frequency (VHF) antenna. With these instruments, a robust data set of both the volcanic activity and electrical activity was collected. The preliminary data have revealed brief (1-2 seconds) bursts of continuous RF simultaneous with the onset of the more energetic explosions. Occurrence of continuous RF may be linked to mass eruption rate, explosivity, or grain size. Due to its unique nature, detection of continuous RF is an unambiguous indicator of explosive volcanic activity and is therefore useful for real-time volcano monitoring.",

            "abstract": "Carbon-nutrient interactions play important roles in regulating terrestrial carbon cycle responses to atmospheric and climatic change. None of the CMIP5 models has included routines to represent the phosphorus (P) cycle, although P is commonly considered to be the most limiting nutrient in highly productive, lowland tropical forests. Model simulations with the Community Land Model (CLM-CNP) show that inclusion of P coupling leads to a smaller CO2 fertilization effect and warming-induced CO2 release from tropical ecosystems, but there are important uncertainties in the P model, and improvements are limited by a dearth of data. Sensitivity analysis identifies the relative importance of P cycle parameters in determining P availability and P limitation, and thereby helps to define the critical measurements to make in field campaigns and manipulative experiments. To improve estimates of P supply, parameters that describe maximum amount of labile P in soil and sorption-desorption processes are necessary for modeling the amount of P available for plant uptake. Biochemical mineralization is poorly constrained in the model and will be improved through field observations that link root traits to mycorrhizal activity, phosphatase activity, and root depth distribution. Model representation of P demand by vegetation, which currently is set by fixed stoichiometry and allometric constants, requires a different set of data. Accurate carbon cycle modeling requires accurate parameterization of the photosynthetic machinery: Vc,max and Jmax. Relationships between the photosynthesis parameters and foliar nutrient (N and P) content are being developed, and by including analysis of covariation with other plant traits (e.g., specific leaf area, wood density), we can provide a basis for more dynamic, trait-enabled modeling. With this strong guidance from model sensitivity and uncertainty analysis, field studies are underway in Puerto Rico and Panama to collect model-relevant data on P supply and demand functions. New FACE and soil warming experiments in P-limited ecosystems in subtropical Australia, and tropical Brazil, Puerto Rico, and Panama will provide important benchmarks for the performance of P-enabled models under future conditions.",

As star pairs are being compressed during descent through the atmospheric limb, refraction angle change is computed for deducing density profile, which in turn by inversion allows getting stratospheric temperature and pressure profiles.\nThis instrument is intended to be a new source of global high altitude temperature fields, providing global coverage from cloud-top (tropopause ≈8–17 km) to 45 km at a horizontal resolution better than 100 km. Such a system works with standard visible cameras, not requiring complex cooled detectors. Moreover, refractive angle resolution is not limited by the optical resolution of the instrument, and by using orbital mechanics, accurate computation can be done without precise spacecraft attitude knowledge.\nThis technically simple, compact, and low cost hardware will also provide a valuable data set for improving weather forecasting. This concept has just completed the conceptual phase and feasibility analysis. The next step is to form key collaborations for developing a demonstration sensor. In due course, as few as a dozen of nanosatellites could get the Earth covered.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - poster_landscape.pdf\nRemote sensing instruments operating in the near-infrared spectrum usually provide the necessary information for further dust aerosol spectral analysis using statistical or machine learning algorithms. Such algorithms have proven to be effective in analyzing very specific case studies or dust events. However, very few make the analysis open to the public on a regular basis, fewer are designed specifically to operate in near real-time to higher resolutions, and almost none give a global daily coverage. In this research we investigated a large-scale approach to a machine learning algorithm called “support vector regression”. The algorithm uses four near-infrared spectral bands from NASA MODIS instrument: B20 (3.66–3.84μm), B29 (8.40–8.70μm), B31 (10.78–11.28μm), and B32 (11.77–12.27μm). The algorithm is presented with ground truth from more than 30 distinct reported dust events, from different geographical regions, at different seasons, both over land and sea cover, in the presence of clouds and clear sky, and in the presence of fires. The purpose of our algorithm is to learn to distinguish the dust aerosols spectral signature from other spectral signatures, providing as output an estimate of the probability of a data point being consistent with dust aerosol signatures. During modeling with ground truth, our algorithm achieved more than 90% of accuracy, and the current live performance of the algorithm is remarkable. Moreover, our algorithm is currently operating in near real-time using NASA’s Land, Atmosphere Near real-time Capability for EOS (LANCE) servers, providing a high resolution global overview including 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, and 1km. The near real-time analysis of our algorithm is now available to the general public at\nhttp://dust.reev.us\nand archives of the results starting from 2012 are available upon request.",

            "abstract": "Interest in extreme flood vulnerability in the Northeastern U.S. has increased significantly since Hurricane Sandy caused more than $50 billion dollars in damages. Despite increased focus there is still no overall consensus regarding the true return period in the region for flood events of Sandy’s magnitude. The application of Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) theory to water level data is one of the most common techniques for estimating the return period for these rare events. Here we assess the skill of this popular technique by combining modeled, instrumental and sedimentologically derived records of flooding for the region. We show that GEV derived return periods greatly and consistently underappreciate risk for sites from New York City east to southern Cape Cod. This is in part because at these locations maximum annual flood data represents a mixture of two very different populations of storms, i.e. tropically derived disturbances and extratropical Nor’easters. Nor’easters comprise a majority of floods with 10-yr return periods and shorter, hurricanes for 100-yr floods or longer, and a combination in between. In contrast, the GEV technique functions better in estimating the 100-yr flood for points north of Cape Cod including Boston. At these locations flooding occurs more often from just one type of disturbance, i.e. Nor’easters. However, modeled and sedimentary reconstructions of storms indicate hurricanes likely still dominate flood distribution at northern location like Boston for 500 yr or greater events. Results stress the need for separating storm populations before applying the GEV technique, especially where flood behavior can vary depending on the type of disturbance.",

            "abstract": "Uncertainties in land parameters could have important impacts on simulated water and energy fluxes and land surface states, which will consequently affect atmospheric and biogeochemical processes. Therefore, quantification of such parameter uncertainties using a land surface model is the first step towards better understanding of predictive uncertainty in Earth system models. In this study, we applied a random-sampling, high-dimensional model representation (RS-HDMR) method to analyze the sensitivity of simulated photosynthesis, surface energy fluxes and surface hydrological components to selected land parameters in version 4.5 of the Community Land Model (CLM4.5). Because of the large computational expense of conducting ensembles of global gridded model simulations, we used the results of a previous cluster analysis to select one thousand representative land grid cells for simulation. Plant functional type (PFT)-specific uniform prior ranges for land parameters were determined using expert opinion and literature survey, and samples were generated with a quasi-Monte Carlo approach-Sobol sequence. Preliminary analysis of 1024 simulations suggested that four PFT-dependent parameters (including slope of the conductance-photosynthesis relationship, specific leaf area at canopy top, leaf C:N ratio and fraction of leaf N in RuBisco) are the dominant sensitive parameters for photosynthesis, surface energy and water fluxes across most PFTs, but with varying importance rankings. On the other hand, for surface ans sub-surface runoff, PFT-independent parameters, such as the depth-dependent decay factors for runoff, play more important roles than the previous four PFT-dependent parameters. Further analysis by conditioning the results on different seasons and years are being conducted to provide guidance on how climate variability and change might affect such sensitivity. This is the first step toward coupled simulations including biogeochemical processes, atmospheric processes or both to determine the full range of sensitivity of Earth system modeling to land-surface parameters. This can facilitate sampling strategies in measurement campaigns targeted at reduction of climate modeling uncertainties and can also provide guidance on land parameter calibration for simulation optimization.",

Due to their spatial and temporal coverage, satellite observations of total column aerosol optical depth (AOD) have increasingly been used to estimate surface concentrations of PM. While techniques for using satellite observations of AOD to predict surface concentrations of PM2.5 have been established, predicting surface concentrations of different particle sizes and species is more challenging. The Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument has the unique capability of estimating both total column AOD as well as total column size fractionated (small, medium and large) AOD. Using MISR AOD and AOD size fractionated products derived from high-resolution (275 m) observations reported at a spatial scale of 4.4 km in combination with national Air Quality System (AQS) monitoring data over the 2008-2009 period, we examine the association between size-fractionated MISR AOD and surface measurements of PM at different sizes (PM2.5 and PM10) and PM2.5 species (EC, OC, SO42-, NH4+) over the greater Los Angeles area. While there was a limited sample size of speciated PM data, the strongest univariate association found was between AOD and PM2.5 SO42- (R2=0.76). Incorporating meteorological data from weather stations in the area resulted in improvements to the models associating AOD with PM2.5 and PM10 mass. We found that PM2.5 was best predicted by a spatio-temporal model of AOD that also included dew point temperature and wind speed (R2=0.61), and that PM10 was best predicted by a spatio-temporal model of large fraction AOD that also included atmospheric pressure and wind speed (R2=0.65). These flexibly specified spatio-temporal models enabled reliable predictions of surface PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations at a 4.4km resolution over the study region from MISR AOD and large fraction AOD, respectively.",

            "abstract": "With average elevations of about 3.7 km the Altiplano-Puna Plateau of the southern central Andes constitutes the world’s second largest orogenic plateau. The plateau generally consists of internally drained, partly coalesced sedimentary basins bordered by reverse-fault bounded ranges, >5 km high. In the Puna, the Argentine sector of the plateau, active tectonism has been interpreted to be characterized by a low level of strike-slip and normal faulting associated with mafic volcanism. In contrast, the eastern plateau margins and the adjacent foreland record a higher level of seismicity and ongoing contraction. Despite ubiquitous Plio-Pleistocene normal faulting along the eastern plateau margins, our new observations record contraction in the plateau interior. Fanning of E-dipping Miocene sedimentary strata involved in the formation of an anticline in the Pocitos Basin of the central Puna interior indicates growth, which must have begun after 7 Ma; 1.5-m.y.-old lacustrine strata as well as tilted Pleistocene lacustrine shorelines associated with this structure indicate sustained uplift into the Quaternary. Corresponding observations along the eastern border of the Pocitos Basin show that <3.5-m.y.-old strata are involved in contractile deformation and basin compartmentalization. Shortening in the central Puna is compatible with Plio-Pleistocene shortening in the low-elevation Salar de Atacama farther west, and may indicate that low-elevation sectors of the plateau have not yet reached a critical elevation that is conducive to normal faulting as observed elsewhere. The onset of extensional deformation in the Puna is thus highly disparate in space and time.

            "abstract": "Evaporation is the main process for water vapor exchange between the land surface and the atmosphere. Evaporation from shallow groundwater tables is important in arid zones and is influenced by the water table depth and by the soil’s hydrodynamic characteristics. Measuring evaporation, however, is still challenging. Thus, it is important to develop new measuring techniques that can better determine evaporation fluxes. The aim of this work is to investigate the feasibility of using distributed-temperature-sensing (DTS) to study the processes that control evaporation from soils with shallow water tables. To achieve this objective, an experimental column was instrumented with traditional temperature probes, time-domain-reflectometry probes, and an armored fiber-optic cable that allowed the application of heat pulses to estimate the soil moisture profile. The experimental setup also allowed to fix the water table at different depths and to measure evaporation rates at the daily scale.\nExperiments with different groundwater table depths were carried out. For each experiment, the evaporation rates were measured and the moisture profile was determined using heat pulses all through the DTS cable. These pulses allowed estimation of the moisture content with errors smaller than 0.045 m3/m3 and with a spatial resolution of ~6.5 mm. The high spatial resolution of the moisture profile combined with mathematical modeling permitted to investigate the processes that control evaporation from bare soils with shallow groundwater tables.",

While strong statistical relationships have been identified in some locations, these relationships are susceptible to breaking down during extreme conditions such as droughts or extremely wet years. The Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) is a program where airplane mounted lidar is used to create snow-on and snow-off DEMs, yielding distributed estimates of snow water equivalent at the catchment scale. These estimates allow us, for the first time, to compare basin wide snow water equivalent to seasonal streamflow volumes. At the Tuolumne River basin in Yosemite National Park, Sierra Nevada Mountains, California, the ASO estimates of basin wide SWE are shown to be tightly correlated to seasonal streamflow volumes. These estimates are further improved when combined with precipitation measurements. These estimates appear to be more robust than traditional statistical methods, and have been used to improve predictions of inflows at the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, the primary water source for the City and County of San Francisco and surrounding areas.

The effect of known changes in water in artificial reservoirs is removed, allowing changes in the total of snow, soil moisture, and mountain fracture groundwater to be inferred from GPS.\nIn this study water changes inferred from GPS are placed into the context of complementary InSAR and GRACE data. The southern Central Valley (the San Joaquin Valley and Tulare Basin) is subsiding at spectacular rates of 0.01 m/yr to 0.2 m/yr in response to groundwater management. We construct an elastic model of groundwater change of the southern Central Valley, using GRACE as the basis of total groundwater loss and InSAR to infer the lateral distribution of that groundwater loss. This elastic model of Central Valley groundwater loss is removed from the GPS displacements.\nBecause snow in California is insignificant in October, and because changes in soil moisture between successive autumns are small, we can infer changes in Sierra Nevada mountain fracture groundwater to be: –19 km3 during drought from 2006 to 2009, +35 km3 during heavy precipitation from 2009 to 2011, and –38 km3 during drought from 2011 to 2014 (start and end times are all in October). We infer changes in Sierra Nevada mountain groundwater to be playing an important role in modulating Central Valley groundwater loss. Total water in the Sierra Nevada recovered by 16 km3 from October 2014 to April 2015, but water is being lost again in summer 2015.",

            "abstract": "There is a clear need to better understand and predict future climate change, so that science can more confidently inform climate policy, including adaptation planning and future mitigation strategies. Understanding carbon cycle feedbacks, and the relationship between emissions (fossil and land use) and the resulting atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) concentrations in a changing climate has been recognized as an important goal by the IPCC. The existing surface greenhouse gas observing networks provide accurate and precise measurements of background values, but they are not configured to target the extended, complex and dynamic regions of the carbon budget. Space Agencies around the globe are committed to CO2 and CH4 observations: GOSAT-1/2, OCO-2/3, MERLin, TanSat, and CarbonSat. In addition to these Low Earth Orbit (LEO) missions, a new mission in Geostationary Orbit (GEO), geoCARB, which would provide mapping-like measurements of carbon dioxide, methane, and carbon monoxide concentrations over major land areas, has been recently proposed to the NASA Venture Program. These pioneering missions do not provide the spatial/temporal coverage to answer the key carbon-climate questions at process relevant scales nor do they address the distribution and quantification of anthropogenic sources at urban scales. They do demonstrate, however, that a well-planned future system of system integrating space-based LEO and GEO missions with extensive in situ observations could provide the accuracy, spatial resolution, and coverage needed to address critical open issues in the carbon-climate system. Dr. Diana Wickland devoted enormous energy in developing a comprehensive apprioach to understand the global carbon cycle; she understood well that an integrated, coordinated, international approach is needed. This shines through in her recent contribution in co-chairing the team that produced the “CEOS Strategy for Carbon Observations from Space.” A NASA-funded community workshop in March 2015 addressed issues and prioritzed a set of research and observational needs in the study of the Carbon-Climate System. This paper will refect upon the past 30 plus years of carbon research supported by NASA and Dr. Wickland’s role, and it will conclude with the findings of the March 2015 Workshop.",

Accurate quantification of greenhouse gas mitigation efforts is central to the clean technology sector. Very soon professionals of all kinds (business people, accountants, lawyers) will need to understand carbon accounting and crediting. Over the next few decades food production is expected to double and energy production must triple in order to meet growing global demands; sustainable management of land use and agricultural systems will be critical. The food and energy supply challenges are inextricably linked to the challenge of limiting anthropogenic impacts on climate by reducing the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere. To avoid serious disruption of the climate system and stabilize GHG concentrations, society must move aggressively to avoid emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O and to actively draw down CO2 already in the atmosphere. A new cadre of technically adept professionals is needed to meet these challenges.\nWe describe a new professional Masters degree in greenhouse gas management and accounting at Colorado State University.

Controlling water contamination is therefore challenging.\nIdeally, to control contamination in a flow network, one needs to design a management approach whereby the level of contamination can be controlled everywhere at all times, by controlling it at certain locations in the network. This can be viewed as a control problem in which we aim to efficiently drive the system to a desired state by manipulating few input variables. Such problems reduce to i) finding the best control locations in the network that would impact the whole system; and ii) choosing the time-variant inputs at the control locations to achieve the desired state of the system. In this study, we aim to answer questions like “How controllable is microbial contamination in a watershed flow network?” and “Given the network topology, geometry and environmental drivers, what are the best control locations?”.",

Like most PdP studies, we fail to image the 660 km discontinuity so we focus on the 410, and 520. It is believed that the 410 and 520 km discontinuities are the result of exothermic phase changes in the Olivine mineral system at pressure and temperatures consistent with the indicated depths. Because these boundaries are hypothesized to be exothermic, we expect them to be deeper in hot regions and shallow in cool. Modeling of these boundaries by mineral physicists suggest the 410 occurs over a 10 km interval and the 520 over about 30 km. Our observed amplitudes of P410P as a function of frequency compared to waveform modeling indicate that the 410 phase change must occur over less 6 km. Our observations of a strong 520 km discontinuity at 0.75 Hz also suggests that this velocity contrast occurs over less than 10 km rather than the hypothesized 30 km. We found that the average depth to the 410 km discontinuity across our study area to be 420 km to 425km. The 520 km discontinuity appears to be strongest around Hawaii and north of the Aleutian trench. The depths of the P410P and P520P phases appear to be correlated in most areas where they occur together; deepest the north of the Aleutian trench and southwestern Alaska; and shallowest south of the westernmost Aleutian trench. One of the more surprising observations was that the P520P phase appears to be the smallest or not observable in regions with the strongest P410P phase. SdS observations will be added to this study for the AGU meeting.",

Such changes in extreme events are expected to affect agricultural production and food supplies. This study focuses on the State of Texas, which has the largest farm area and the highest value of livestock production in the U.S. The objectives are two-fold: First, to investigate the climatic impact on the occurrence of future hydrologic extreme events; and second, to evaluate the effects of the future extremes on agricultural production. The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model, which is calibrated and validated over Texas river basins during the historical period, is employed for this study. The VIC model is forced by the statistically downscaled climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) model ensembles at a spatial resolution of 1/8°. The CMIP5 projections contain four different scenarios in terms of Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) (i.e. 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 w/m2). To carry out the analysis, VIC outputs forced by the CMIP5 model scenarios over three 30-year periods (1970-1999, 2020-2049 and 2070-2099) are first evaluated to identify how the frequency and the extent of the extreme events will be altered in the ten Texas major river basins. The results suggest that a significant increase in the number of extreme events will occur starting in the first half of the 21st century in Texas. Then, the effects of the predicted hydrologic extreme events on the irrigation water demand are investigated. It is found that future changes in water demand vary by crop type and location, with an east-to-west gradient. The results are expected to contribute to future water management and planning in Texas.",

Established vegetation indices, like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), are typically not effective in reliably differentiating between trees and other vegetation. Previous research in tree mapping has included integration of hyperspectral imagery (HSI) and LiDAR for tree detection and species identification, as well as the use of MSI to distinguish tree crowns from non-vegetated features. This project developed a straightforward method to model and also mask out trees from eight-band WorldView-2 (1.85 meter x 1.85 meter resolution at nadir) satellite imagery at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center in Beltsville, MD spanning 2012 - 2015. The study site included tree cover, a range of agricultural and vegetative cover types, and urban features. The modeling method exploits the product of the red and red edge bands and defines accurate thresholds between trees and other land covers. Results show this method outperforms established vegetation indices including the NDVI, Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index, Normalized Difference Water Index, Simple Ratio, and Normalized Difference Red Edge Index in correctly masking trees while preserving the other information in the imagery. This method is useful when HSI and LiDAR collection are not possible or when using archived MSI.",

The emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) from the different tillage systems in this system remain unclear. We conducted a 3-year field experiment in a wheat–rice cropping system in a silt clay loam soil to investigate the effects of the type of tillage employed during the wheat-growing season (no-tillage (NT), reduced tillage (RT) or conventional tillage (CT)) on the emissions of N2O and CH4 using the static chamber method over three annual rotation cycles from the 2008 wheat season to the 2011 rice season. The results revealed that the adoption of an NT system during the wheat-growing season significantly increased CH4 emissions during both the wheat-growing season and the following rice-growing season. Over the three annual rotation cycles studied, the annual N2O emissions from the NT (2.24 kg N2O-N ha–1) and CT (2.01 kg N2O-N ha–1) treatments were similar to each other and significantly higher than those from the RT treatment (1.73 kg N2O-N ha–1); the annual CH4 emissions were significantly higher from the NT (100.1 kg CH4-C ha–1) than the CT (83.7 kg CH4-C ha–1) and RT (73.9 kg CH4-C ha–1) systems. The overall results regarding the net global warming potential associated with annual N2O and CH4 emissions indicate that the conversion of conventional tillage to no-tillage systems during the wheat-growing season would intensify the radiative forcing in wheat–rice cropping systems in China.",

Here, we employ the permafrost module of the Alaska Integrated Ecosystem Model (AIEM) and establish several high spatial resolution (1km x 1km) and very high resolution (30m x 30m) scenarios of changes in permafrost characteristics in the Alaskan Arctic in response to projected climate change. Impact of these changes in permafrost on northern Alaskan ecosystems and infrastructure are assessed and regional maps of the possible impacts are developed.\nThe GIPL-2 numerically simulates soil temperature dynamics and the depth of seasonal freezing and thawing by solving the 1-D non-linear heat equation with phase change. In this model the processes of soil freezing and thawing are occurring in accordance with the volumetric unfrozen water content curve and soil thermal properties. The snow temperature and thickness dynamics are simulated assuming the snow accumulation, compaction and phase change processes. We validate our model simulations by comparing with available active layer, permafrost temperature and snow depth records from existing permafrost observatories operated by USGS and the Geophysical Institute of UAF in the North Slope region. Properties of surface vegetation, soil type, layering and moisture content are up-scaled using the Ecosystems of Northern Alaska map (Jorgenson and Heiner, 2003).",

Weather variability, including storms, as a function of spatial scale can be succinctly summarized through the use of horizontal energy spectra. In this paper, we first show that non-uniform spherical Fourier methods can be used to estimate horizontal energy spectra from weather station observations with an arbitrary network configuration. Using this new tool, we demonstrate that weather variability across the entire synoptic and mesoscales has decreased monotonically since the 1970s by as much as 50-60% in global reanalysis data and station observations. Future climate projections using a very-high resolution climate model suggest a continuation of these trends, resulting in an additional reduction of about 20% by 2090. Reanalysis data and projections for the Southern Hemisphere also suggest decreases in kinetic energy, but cannot be validated with ground-truth observations.",

Its occurrence also provides constraints on the shock release path. Shock-release and shock duration are important parameters in estimating the size of impactors that generate the observed shock metamorphic record. Thus, it is timely to examine if bridgmanite can be synthesized in dynamic compression experiments with the goal of establishing a correlation between shock duration and grainsize. Up to now only one high pressure polymorph of an Mg-silicate has been synthesized AND recovered in a shock experiment (wadsleyite). Therefore, it is not given that shock synthesis of bridgmanite is possible. This project started recently, so we present an outline of shock experiment designs and potentially results from the first experiments.\nFUNDING ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nUNLV HiPSEC:\nThis research was sponsored (or sponsored in part) by the National Nuclear Security Administration under the Stewardship Science Academic Alliances program through DOE Cooperative Agreement #DE-NA0001982.\nHPCAT:\n\"[Portions of this work were]/[This work was] performed at HPCAT (Sector 16), Advanced Photon Source (APS), Argonne National Laboratory.

A case study of these observations were compared to the OVATION Prime model of aurora, run by the NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC). The observations were comprised of positive and negative sightings directly reported to Aurorasaurus, along with verified tweets, which are positive sightings reported on Twitter and verified by Aurorasaurus users. The observations were collected during March and April 2015, a period spanning three large geomagnetic storms, and covered a wide range of latitudes. The observations demonstrated that, during these events, over 60% of the positive aurora observations (which includes those reported directly to Aurorasaurus and the verified tweets) occurred at latitudes equatorward of the SWPC predicted \"view line\". New scaling parameters were determined from the relationship of the differences in latitude between the positive observations and the view line, and the maximum probability of visible aurora. Future work testing these scaling parameters and using them in the Aurorasaurus real-time alert system will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic twist in solar active regions (ARs) has been found to have a hemispheric preference in sign (hemisphere rule): negative in the northern hemisphere and positive in the southern. The preference reported in previous studies ranges greatly, from ~ 58% to 82%. In this study, we examine this hemispheric preference with ARs in Solar Cycle 24 using vector magnetic field data taken by Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and find that 75% ± 7% of 151 ARs studied obey the hemisphere rule, well within the preference range in previous studies. If the sample is divided into two groups: ARs having magnetic twist and writhe of the same sign (group-same) and having opposite signs (group-opposite), the strength of the hemispheric preference differs substantially: 64% ± 11% for group-same and 87% ± 8% for group-opposite. This difference becomes even more significant in a sub-sample of 82 ARs having a simple bipole magnetic configuration: 56% ± 16% for the ARs in group-same, and 93% with lower and upper confidence bounds of 80% and 98% for the ARs in group-opposite. This may suggest that, prior to emergence of magnetic tubes, either the sign of twist does not have a hemispheric preference or the twist is relatively weak.\nEmerging ARs show an even greater difference between the two groups. In a sample of 116 emerging ARs, it is found that 84% of ARs in group-opposite follows the hemispheric rule, whereas only 34% of ARs in group-same follows the rule. A sample without emerging ARs (120 ARs) shows 88% in group-opposite and 71% of ARs in group-opposite that obey the rule. This suggests that surface dynamics plays a role in building-up magnetic twist in ARs after they emerge.",

            "abstract": "Gas analyzers traditionally used for eddy covariance method measure gas density. When fluxes are calculated, corrections are applied to account for the changes in gas density due to changing temperature and pressure (Ideal Gas Law) and changing water vapor density (Dalton’s Law). The new generation of gas analyzers with fast air temperature and pressure measurements in the sampling cell enables on-the-fly calculation of fast dry mole fraction. This significantly simplifies the flux processing because the WPL density terms are no longer required, and leads to the reduction in uncertainties associated with latent and sensible heat flux inputs into the density terms.\nTraditional closed-path instruments with long intake tubes often can effectively dampen the fast temperature fluctuations in the tube before reaching the measurement cell, thus reducing or eliminating the need for temperature correction for density-based fluxes. But in instruments with a short-tube design, most - but not all - of the temperature ﬂuctuations are attenuated, so calculating unbiased ﬂuxes using fast dry mole fraction requires high-speed precise temperature measurements of the air stream inside the cell. Fast pressure and water vapor content of the sampled air should also be measured in the cell and carefully aligned in time with gas density and sample temperature measurements.\nIn this study we examine the impact of fast-response air temperature measurements in the cell on the calculations of carbon dioxide and water vapor fluxes at different time scales from three different ecosystems. The fast cell air temperature data is filtered mathematically to obtain slower response cell temperature time series, which is used in the calculation of fluxes. This exercise is intended to simulate the use of thicker slower response thermocouples instead of fast response fine wire thermocouples for estimating cell temperature. The directly measured block temperature is also utilized to illustrate the importance of fast temperature measurements of the sampled air in order to arrive to correct flux values.",

At continental to global scale, energy availability measured by potential evapotranspiration (PET) (i.e. PET-only model) and related water-energy dynamics model (i.e. Wang’s model based on China’s woody plant richness) has been two primary determinants for species richness. We identified several issues in existing modeling approaches that 1) species richness are derived from species range map not a plot data, 2) they over-predicted richness in Florida peninsular at the cost of R square values for better overall model fit and 3) they lack thorough examination for spatial autocorrelation of residuals. The plot-level forest inventory and analysis (FIA) program data set (total 2,745,363 tally trees from 79,145 ground plots in the eastern US forest) used for species richness showed different pattern to range-map based richness. We applied Elastic-Net regularization for variable selections then used spatial Poisson Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and to handle spatial autocorrelations. Elastic-Net approach produced Frost frequency days (FRS), PET, AET, and seasonality of precipitation (PSN, defined as the coefficient of variation of monthly mean precipitation) as best explanatory variables and produced good model fit (R2 of 0.67) without over-prediction for Florida peninsular. Partial regression revealed that PSN successfully accounted for very low species richness in Florida. The seasonality of precipitation as climatic variability explained climatic stability permitted species specialization than greater seasonality. Also, we compared our best model with two other richness models (i.e. PET-only and Wang’s model) and demonstrated that spatial autocorrelation was highest for the use of just PET-only, intermediate for Wang's model, and lowest for ours.",

            "abstract": "There is a need in the ocean color community to discriminate among phytoplankton groups within the bulk chlorophyll pool to understand ocean biodiversity, to track energy flow through ecosystems, and to identify and monitor for harmful algal blooms. Imaging spectrometer measurements enable use of sophisticated spectroscopic algorithms for applications such as differentiating among coral species, evaluating iron stress of phytoplankton, and discriminating phytoplankton taxa. These advanced algorithms rely on the fine scale, subtle spectral shape of the atmospherically corrected remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) spectrum of the ocean surface. As a consequence, these algorithms are sensitive to inaccuracies in the retrieved Rrs spectrum that may be related to the presence of nearby clouds, inadequate sensor calibration, low sensor signal-to-noise ratio, glint correction, and atmospheric correction. For the HyspIRI Airborne Campaign, flight planning considered optimal weather conditions to avoid flights with significant cloud/fog cover. Although best suited for terrestrial targets, the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) has enough signal for some coastal chlorophyll algorithms and meets sufficient calibration requirements for most channels. However, the coastal marine environment has special atmospheric correction needs due to error that may be introduced by aerosols and terrestrially sourced atmospheric dust and riverine sediment plumes. For this HyspIRI campaign, careful attention has been given to the correction of AVIRIS imagery of the Monterey Bay to optimize ocean Rrs retrievals for use in estimating chlorophyll (OC3 algorithm) and phytoplankton functional type (PHYDOTax algorithm) data products. This new correction method has been applied to several image collection dates during two oceanographic seasons – upwelling and the warm, stratified oceanic period for 2013 and 2014. These two periods are dominated by either diatom blooms (occasionally toxic) or red tides. Results presented include chlorophyll and phytoplankton community structure and in-water validation data for these dates during these two seasons.",

            "abstract": "Six Apollo missions landed on the Moon from 1969-72, returning to Earth 382 kg of lunar rock, soil, and core samples—among the best documented and preserved samples on Earth that have supported a robust research program for 45 years. From mission planning through sample collection, preliminary examination, and subsequent research, strict protocols and procedures are followed for handling and allocating Apollo subsamples. Even today, 100s of samples are allocated for research each year, building on the science foundation laid down by the early Apollo sample studies and combining new data from today’s instrumentation, lunar remote sensing missions and lunar meteorites. Today’s research includes advances in our understanding of lunar volatiles, lunar formation and evolution, and the origin of evolved lunar lithologies.\nMuch sample information is available to researchers at curator.jsc.nasa.gov. Decades of analyses on lunar samples are published in LPSC proceedings volumes and other peer-reviewed journals, and tabulated in lunar sample compendia entries. However, for much of the 1969-1995 period, the processing documentation, individual and consortia analyses, and unpublished results exist only in analog forms or primitive digital formats that are either inaccessible or at risk of being lost forever because critical data from early investigators remain unpublished. We have initiated several new efforts to rescue some of the early Apollo data, including unpublished analytical data. We are scanning NASA documentation that is related to the Apollo missions and sample processing, and we are collaborating with IEDA to establish a geochemical database called Moon DB. To populate this database, we are working with prominent lunar PIs to organize and transcribe years of both published and unpublished data. Other initiatives include micro-CT scanning of complex lunar samples to document their interior structure (e.g. clasts, vesicles); linking high-resolution scans of Apollo film products to samples; and new procedures for systematic high resolution photography of samples before additional processing, enabling detailed 3D reconstructions of the samples. All of these efforts will provide comprehensive access to Apollo samples and support better curation of the samples for decades to come.",

(ARI) Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsols (FIGAERO) collector module is an add-on for Chemical Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (CI-TOFMS) instruments. The FIGAERO enables simultaneous real-time chemical analysis of trace gases and particles in ambient air. The collector module described here is modelled after the University of Washington (UW) design of Lopez-Hilfikeret al., 2014. The collector module mounts directly to the front of the CI-TOFMS ion molecule reactor, replacing the standard gas phase inlet. Automated operation follows a two-step sequence alternating between gas and particle sampling. Gas and particle flows are sampled through separate inlet lines. Software provides automated control of the ARI FIGAERO and determines which inlet line is sampled into ion molecule reaction region. While in the gas phase measuring position particles are separately collected on a filter. After sufficient particle collection, heated clean nitrogen is passed over the filter to desorb the particles on the filter. The thermally desorbed material is then measured with the CI-TOFMS. Though conceptually similar, the ARI FIGAERO is mechanically different enough from the UW design that it requires its own performance assessment. Presented here is the characterization of the ARI FIGAERO collector module. The FIGAERO performance is assessed by using laboratory, chamber, and field data collected using iodide as the reagent ion to examine detection sensitivity, quantification limits, and time response.\nLopez-Hilfiker et al., “A novel method for online analysis of gas and particle composition: description and evaluation of a Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsols (FIGAERO)”, Atmos.

            "abstract": "The formation of ice in clouds depends on the availability of ice forming nuclei (IFN). Dust aerosol particles are considered the most important source of IFN at a global scale. Recent laboratory studies have demonstrated that the mineral feldspar provides the most efficient dust IFN for immersion freezing and together with kaolinite for deposition ice nucleation, and that the phyllosilicates illite and montmorillonite (a member of the smectite group) are of secondary importance.\nA few studies have applied global models that simulate mineral specific dust to predict the number and geographical distribution of IFN. These studies have been based on the simple assumption that the mineral composition of soil as provided in data sets from the literature translates directly into the mineral composition of the dust aerosols. However, these tables are based on measurements of wet-sieved soil where dust aggregates are destroyed to a large degree. In consequence, the size distribution of dust is shifted to smaller sizes, and phyllosilicates like illite, kaolinite, and smectite are only found in the size range <2 μm. In contrast, in measurements of the mineral composition of dust aerosols, the largest mass fraction of these phyllosilicates is found in the size range >2 μm as part of dust aggregates. Conversely, the mass fraction of feldspar is smaller in this size range, varying with the geographical location. This may have a significant effect on the predicted IFN number and its geographical distribution.\nAn improved mineral specific dust aerosol module has been recently implemented in the NASA GISS Earth System ModelE2. The dust module takes into consideration the disaggregated state of wet-sieved soil, on which the tables of soil mineral fractions are based. To simulate the atmospheric cycle of the minerals, the mass size distribution of each mineral in aggregates that are emitted from undispersed parent soil is reconstructed. In the current study, we test the null-hypothesis that simulating the presence of a large mass fraction of phyllosilicates in dust aerosols in the size range >2 μm, in comparison to a simple model assumption where this is neglected, does not yield a significant effect on the magnitude and geographical distribution of the predicted IFN number. Results from sensitivity experiments are presented as well.",

            "abstract": "In Ocean Island Basalts (OIB), relationships between helium isotopes and heavy radiogenic isotopes, like 87Sr/86Sr, are often used to constrain the evolution of the mantle. In OIB, 87Sr/86Sr is often measured on whole rock powders, while 3He/4He is measured in olivine hosted melt inclusions. Comparing these values is robust so long as both reservoirs have the same 87Sr/86Sr. However, new evidence suggests significant 87Sr/86Sr disequilibrium can exist between OIB whole rocks and the olivines they host.\nThe data presented show 87Sr/86Sr can vary by ~2000 ppm between the whole rock (0.7089) and olivine hosted melt inclusions (0.7075) in fresh, zero-age Samoan basalts. Additionally, samples with the highest whole rock 87Sr/86Sr also show the greatest disequilibrium between whole rocks and olivines. Importantly, Sr is highly incompatible in the olivine lattice, thus melt inclusions host nearly all Sr in olivines; measuring pooled olivines provides an average 87Sr/86Sr for the melt inclusion population.\nThe origin of whole rock- olivine 87Sr/86Sr disequilibrium is not well understood. The assimilation of seawater derived components could produce this effect, but is inconsistent with Cl/K data collected on submarine glasses. Whole rock 87Sr/86Sr increases with silica content suggesting 87Sr/86Sr disequilibrium is the result of mixing magmas derived from heterogeneous mantle sources. If olivine crystalizes from a low 87Sr/86Sr reservoir, and later mixes with a higher 87Sr/ 86Sr magma, the signature of the initial magma would be captured in the melt inclusions.\nThis whole rock- olivine 87Sr/86Sr disequilibrium has the potential to revolutionize our understanding of the relationships between 3He/4He and 87Sr/86Sr in OIB. These relationships are central to chemical geodynamic models, and establishing a new method for measuring both He and Sr isotopes in olivine hosted melt inclusions will provide new frontiers for future research exploring the noble gas evolution of the mantle.",

Arctic tundra soils also serve as potential sinks for CH4 in response to warming temperature, which might be a key process in the global CH4 budget. Quantification of methane oxidation potential of Arctic tundra is an important component to constrain models assessing the Carbon-climate feedback from high latitude soils.\nThe signature polygonal ground of Arctic tundra generates high level of heterogeneity in soil hydrology and soil thermal regime. Thus, two distinct polygonal features were investigated in this study to evaluate CH4 oxidation potentials under multiple biogeochemical controls. The rates, drivers, and temperature sensitivity of methane oxidation were compared between High- and Flat-Centered Polygons (HCP and FCP, respectively). A significant lag period of CO2 production was observed in soil microcosms from HCP center, which might be attributed to microbial biomass limitations and the slow growth of anaerobic microbial populations that were sensitive to freezing. Prolonged thawing significantly accelerated carbon mineralization and CH4 oxidation rates measured via methane oxidation assays (MOA) from both active and permafrost organic layers of HCP. Soil microcosms from FCP showed higher CO2 production and CH4 oxidation rates in the active organic layer, but not permafrost layer, which might be explained by the anoxic/oxic interface identified by Fe(II) content in active layer. MOAs with temperature manipulation demonstrated high temperature dependence of methane oxidation activity, mediated primarily by soluble methane monooxygenase based upon metagenomic analysis and PCR quantification. Future work will identify key variables controlling methane oxidation rate and develop parameterization that can be incorporated into Arctic terrestrial ecosystem models.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s temperature is thought to be regulated by a negative feedback between atmospheric CO2 levels and chemical weathering of silicate rocks. However, direct evidence for the operation of this feedback over million-year timescales is difficult to obtain. For example, weathering fluxes over the last 20 million years of the Cenozoic Era, calculated using marine isotopic proxies (i.e. 87Sr/86Sr, δ7Li, and 187Os/188Os), appear inconsistent with past atmospheric CO2 levels and carbon mass balance. Similarly, observations from modern catchments suggest that chemical weathering fluxes are strongly correlated with erosion rates and only weakly correlated with temperature.\nAs an alternative approach to evaluating the operation of a negative feedback, we use the major surface reservoirs of carbon to determine the imbalance in the geologic carbon cycle and the required silicate weathering flux over the Cenozoic. A miniscule (0.5-1%) increase in silicate weathering is necessary to explain the long-term decline in CO2 levels over the Cenozoic, providing evidence for a strong negative feedback between silicate weathering and climate. Rather than an appreciable increase in the silicate weathering flux, the long-term decrease in CO2levels may be due to an increase in the strength of the silicate weathering feedback. To explain the observed variations in the strength of the weathering feedback during the Cenozoic, we present a model for silicate weathering where hydrologic processes regulate climatic and tectonic forcings due to the presence of a thermodynamic limit to weathering fluxes. Climate regulation by silicate weathering is thus strongest when global topography is elevated, similar to today, and lowest when global topography is more subdued, allowing planetary temperatures to vary depending on the global distribution of topography and mountain belts.\nThese results also motivate several key outstanding challenges in earth surface processes, including the need to understand the processes controlling marine isotopic weathering processes, the need to integrate solute and solid transport into Earth system models, and the need to understand the role of extreme physical and temporal heterogeneities in moderating geochemical fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Understanding impacts of hydrological and climatological functions under changing climate on regional floods, droughts as well as agricultural commodities remain a serious challenge in tropical agricultural basins. These “tropical agricultural basins” are regions where: (i) the understanding on hydrologic functions (such as precipitation, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, surface runoff, vegetation) are not well established; (ii) increasing population is at the convergence of rural and urban boundaries; (iii) resilience and sustainability of the water resources under different climatic conditions is unknown; and, (iv) agriculture is the primary occupation for majority of the population. More than 95% of the farmed lands in tropical regions are rainfed and 60% of total agricultural production in South Asia relying on seasonal rainfall. Tropical regions frequently suffer from unexpected droughts and sudden flash floods, resulting in massive losses in human lives and affecting regional economy. Prediction of frequency, intensity and magnitude of floods in tropical regions is still a subject of debate and research. A clear example is from the massive floods in the Eastern Indus River in July 2010 that submerged 17 million acre of fertile cropland. Yet, seasonal droughts, such as 2014 rain deficits in Indus Basin, had no effects on annual crop yields - thus creating a paradox. Large amounts of groundwater is being used to supplement water needs for crops during drought conditions, leading to oversubscription of natural aquifers. Key reason that rainfed agriculture is relying heavily on groundwater is because of the uncertainty in timing and distribution of precipitation in the tropical regions, where such data are not routinely collected as well as the basins are transnational, thus limiting sharing of data. Assessment of availability of water for agricultural purposes a serious challenge in tropical regions. This study will provide a framework for using multi-sensor satellite data and model products on computation of free usable water and associated uncertainty for rainfed agriculture.",

We find that the relatively drier basins with little snow or runoff and basins with relatively complex snow runoff dynamics have less potential for improvement using SWE DA.

Although ecohydrologic fluxes are being investigated at the Boreal Ecosystem Research and Monitoring Sites (BERMS) at the stand level, the ecohydrologic response of this ecotone to climate change is poorly understood. We use CTEM (the Canadian Terrestrial Ecosystem Model), coupled to CLASS (the Canadian Land Surface Scheme), to explore the structural and functional responses of the forest-grassland ecotone to climatic variability. The initial evaluations of CLASS-CTEM are being done using data from three mature forest sites (jack pine, aspen and black spruce) at BERMS and one grassland site. The model is forced with observed climate data between 1997 and 2010 by using each year, run repeatedly with a 400 year spin up, as one climatic scenario. Preliminary results show a sigmoidal response of annual gross primary production (GPP) to annual precipitation within each plant functional type, with limited GPP at low precipitation, higher but uniform GPP at high precipitation, and an intermediate precipitation range where GPP responds sensitively to increasing precipitation.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU-SHOC-2015-v4.pdf\nA novel unified representation of sub-grid scale (SGS) turbulence, cloudiness, and shallow convection is being implemented into the NOAA NCEP Global Forecasting System (GFS) general circulation model. The approach, known as Simplified High Order Closure (SHOC), is based on predicting a joint PDF of SGS thermodynamic variables and vertical velocity and using it to diagnose turbulent diffusion coefficients, SGS fluxes, condensation and cloudiness. Unlike other similar methods, only one new prognostic variable, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), needs to be intoduced, making the technique computationally efficient.\nSHOC code was adopted for a global model environment from its origins in a cloud resolving model, and incorporated into NCEP GFS. SHOC was first tested in a non-interactive mode, a configuration where SHOC receives inputs from the host model, but its outputs are not returned to the GFS. In this configuration: a) SGS TKE values produced by GFS SHOC are consistent with those produced by SHOC in a CRM, b) SGS TKE in GFS SHOC exhibits a well defined diurnal cycle, c) there's enhanced boundary layer turbulence in the subtropical stratocumulus and tropical transition-to-cumulus areas d) buoyancy flux diagnosed from the assumed PDF is consistent with independently calculated Brunt-Vaisala frequency in identifying stable and unstable regions.\nNext, SHOC was coupled to GFS, namely turbulent diffusion coefficients computed by SHOC are now used in place of those currently produced by the GFS boundary layer and shallow convection schemes (Han and Pan, 2011), as well as condensation and cloud fraction diagnosed from the SGS PDF replace those calculated in the current large-scale cloudines scheme (Zhao and Carr, 1997). Ongoing activities consist of debugging the fully coupled GFS/SHOC.\nFuture work will consist of evaluating model performance and tuning the physics if necessary, by performing medium-range NWP forecasts with prescribed initial conditions, and AMIP-type climate tests with prescribed SSTs. Depending on the results, the model will be tuned or parameterizations modified. Next, SHOC will be implemented in the NCEP CFS, and tuned and evaluated for climate applications – seasonal prediction and long coupled climate runs. Impact of new physics on ENSO, MJO, ISO, monsoon variability, etc will be examined.",

            "abstract": "The key process in the climate change fingerprinting is to attribute the averaged spectral variation in large space and time scales to different climate variables. Using ten years of satellite data, we generate a group of observation-based spectral kernels and a time series of monthly mean reflectance spectra in five large latitude regions and globe. Subsequently, these kernels and the interannual variation spectra are used to retrieve the interannual changes in the relevant climate parameters to test the concept of using fingerprinting approach for climate change attribution. Comparing the fingerprinting retrieval to the observational truth, the RMS differences between the two are less than 2σ of the variance for all variables in all regions. A large error usually corresponds to those variables with large nonlinear radiative response, such as the cloud optical depth and the ice cloud particle size. Taken into account the nonlinear radiative error in the kernels, the retrieval accuracy is significantly higher, so that the RMS errors are reduced to less than 1σ of the variance for nearly all parameters, indicating the profound impact of the nonlinear error on fingerprinting retrieval. Another important finding is that if the cloud fraction is known a priori, the retrieval accuracy in cloud optical depth would be improved substantially. The test results demonstrate that the concept of climate change fingerprinting based on the reflected solar benchmark spectra is viable.",

            "abstract": "High concentrations of NH4+ in the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary (SFE) have been shown to inhibit the growth of phytoplankton, which are an important food source to zooplankton at the base of the pelagic food web. Here we present results from a study which used a stable isotope mixing model to quantify the proportion of nitrogen assimilated as NH4+ by phytoplankton in situ in a portion of the Sacramento River where NH4+ concentration is elevated downstream of the Sacramento Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant (SRWTP). To determine the δ15N value of phytoplankton, a novel method was developed to isolate phytoplankton from bulk particulate organic matter using flow cytometry prior to isotopic analysis. Modifications were made to an elemental analyzer to allow measurement of the δ15N values of samples containing as little as 0.5 µg N with an analytical precision of 0.2‰ (determined from replicate analysis of standards). During fall and spring field campaigns, two parcels of Sacramento River water (one with wastewater effluent and one without) were tracked and sampled in a Lagrangian sampling scheme over ~80 hours of travel downstream of the SRWTP. Water samples were analyzed for nutrient and chlorophyll concentrations as well δ15N-NO3 and δ15N-NH4+. In addition, approximately ten million phytoplankton cells were sorted from each sample for analysis of δ15N-phytoplankton. In parcels of Sacramento River water without wastewater effluent, NH4+ concentrations remained low and trends in δ15N-phytoplankton followed trends in δ15N-NO3-. In contrast, in the parcels containing SRWTP effluent phytoplankton uptake of N as NH4+ gradually increased from 15% immediately downstream of the SRWTP to as high as 90% after 80 hours of downstream transit. Previous mesocosm incubation experiments have demonstrated depressed growth rates and a rapid switch from NO3- to NH4+ uptake downstream of the SRWTP, suggesting that the apparent gradual increase in the proportion of N uptake as NH4+ observed in this study may reflect the time required to overprint phytoplankton δ15N values at relatively low growth rates.",

In the Arctic, vapor dD decreased at 1.9‰/yr (p=0.041) from 2004 to at least 2009, and rE increased at 0.041 g kg–1/yr (p=0.065). The ratio of the two trends is -46‰/ g kg–1, comparable with the dD vs. rE regression slope of –29‰/ g kg–1 (p<0.0001). In low latitudes (15-40ºN) the dD trend is much smaller and opposite in sign, but statistically insignificant (+0.42‰/yr, p=0.64), while rE also has a positive but statistically insignificant trend of +0.037 g kg–1/yr (p=0.58). During this period, Arctic sea surface temperature (SST) increased slightly, so its positive effect on equilibrium fractionation is the wrong sign to explain the observed decrease of Arctic dD.\nMaking the preliminary assumption that these temporal variations in vapor are robust relative to TES data calibration, we investigate them using a marine boundary layer (MBL) model with isotopes. The model includes meteorological processes such as subsidence and convergence of air from the mid and upper troposphere, and height-dependent turbulent mixing in the MBL. The convergence component allows us to investigate the effect of the mixing ratio of air aloft (rE) on the isotopic composition of the MBL.\nModel results show that vapor δD in the MBL decreases as rE increases. This is because the admixture of isotopically depleted vapor from the upper atmosphere, which increases with rE, results in isotopic depletion near the surface. However, the sensitivity of dD to rE is strongly nonlinear; it is -30.33 ‰/g kg-1 in the Arctic, but only -5.25 ‰/g kg-1 in the subtropics. This explains both the negative trend of dD in the Arctic and lack of trend in the subtropics. In addition, the simulated Arctic sensitivity compares well with the observed values of -46 and –29‰/ g kg–1. The model also shows that the effects of other variables, such as SST and turbulent mixing rate, have minor influence during this period.\nThe recent gain in moisture of the Arctic upper troposphere, which has been both directly observed and inferred from the decrease of MBL δD, is most likely due to global warming or decreasing Arctic sea ice.",

In addition, recent studies suggest that disturbance rates may increase in the future under altered climate and land use scenarios. Thus understanding how vulnerable forested ecosystems are to potential changes in disturbance rates is of high importance. This study calculated the theoretical threshold rate of disturbance for which forest ecosystems could no longer be sustained (λ*) across the Coterminous U.S. using an advanced process based ecosystem model (ED). Published rates of disturbance (λ) in 50 study sites were obtained from the North American Forest Disturbance (NAFD) program. Disturbance distance (λ* - λ) was calculated for each site by differencing the model based threshold under current climate conditions and average observed rates of disturbance over the last quarter century. Preliminary results confirm all sample forest sites have current average rates of disturbance below λ*, but there were interesting patterns in the recorded disturbance distances. In general western sites had much smaller disturbance distances, suggesting higher vulnerability to change, while eastern sites showed larger buffers. Ongoing work is being conducted to assess the vulnerability of these sites in the context of potential future changes by propagating scenarios of future climate and land-use change through the analysis.",

The offshore St. Elias fold-thrust belt records the complex interaction between collisional tectonics and glacial climate variability, providing insight for models of orogenesis and the evolution of glacial depocenters. Glacial erosion and deposition have provided sediment that constructed the upper continental shelf, much of which has been reincorporated into the orogenic wedge through offshore faulting and folding. We integrate core and downhole logging data from IODP Expedition 341 (Sites U1420 and U1421) drilled on the Yakutat shelf and slope with high-resolution and regional seismic profiles to investigate the coupled structural and stratigraphic evolution of the St. Elias margin. Site U1420 lies on the Yakutat shelf within the Bering Trough, a shelf-crossing trough that is within primary depocenter for Bering Glacier sediments. Two faults underlie the glacial packages and have been rendered inactive as the depositional environment has evolved, while faulting elsewhere on the shelf has initiated. Site U1421 lies on the current continental slope, within the backlimb of an active thrust that forms part of the modern YAK-NA deformation front. At each of these sites, we recovered glacigenic diamict (at depths up to ~1015 m at Site U1420), much of which is younger than 0.3 Ma. Age models within the trough indicated that initiation of active deformation away from the Bering Trough depocenter likely occurred since 0.3 Ma, suggesting that possible tectonic reorganization due to mass redistribution by glacial processes can occur at time scales on the order of 100kyr-1Myr.",

As determined by wavelet analysis, the summer and winter rainfall indices exhibit three significant timescales of variability over the century: interdecadal (15–28 year), quasi-decadal (8–13 year) and interannual (2–8 year). Teleconnections with global sea-surface temperature and atmospheric circulation anomalies are established here, but are different for each timescale. El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the main driver of summer rainfall variability, even at the decadal timescale through its forcing on the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and its collinearity with the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation. This ENSO influence leads to shifts in the Walker circulation, which, at the regional scale, impacts the position of the Southern Indian Convergence Zone modulating the development of deep-convection and the synoptic-scale rain bearing systems over the northeastern regions of Southern Africa. Summer rainfall variability is also related to latitudinal shifts in the subtropical atmospheric circulation, which are, for instance, generating an anomalous low-level easterly moisture flux. Winter rainfall variability, however, is more influenced by the mid-latitude atmospheric variability, in particular the Southern Annular Mode, but interactions with ENSO remain, especially in the subtropics. Asymmetrical changes in the mid-latitude westerlies between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans are thus impacting preferentially the southwestern regions of Southern Africa.",

The location of the outer boundary, the magnetopause, is mainly controlled by a pressure balance between the solar wind pressure outside and magnetic pressure inside, but during times of intense dayside reconnection the stand-off distance may be reduced due to erosion. For the Hermean magnetosphere, different erosion mechanisms such as direct flux transport, neutral current sheet enhancement, field-aligned currents and interplanetary magnetic field penetration are compared. As any of these erosion mechanisms change the external field experienced by the planet, currents are induced within the electrically conductive planetary interior. Secondary magnetic fields from these induced currents counteract their source by temporarily increasing the planetary magnetic moment. We conclude with an estimate of the induced magnetic field range possible for various internal conductivity structures.",

In this study we investigate the impacts of water management activities on soil moisture storage and runoff in global basins during the past 60 years. Over 200 basins, which account for 80% of global land area, are simulated using a large scale water management model. About 660 reservoirs with a total storage capacity nearly 70% of the global reservoir capacity are simulated. Irrigation is represented by a soil moisture deficit-based irrigation scheme within the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macro-scale hydrological model with time-varying cropland areas extracted from HYDE 3.1 and MIRCA datasets. We compare monthly soil moisture and runoff estimates from simulations with and without irrigation and dam regulations over the simulated basins. The comparison suggests that in some highly populated basins the water management activities significantly alter trends in soil moisture and runoff.",

TechDemoSat-1 (TDS-1), a technology demonstration satellite launched in July of 2014, with an instrument to collect GPS reflections from 4 GPS satellites simultaneously, provide the first extensive data that allows for validation and evaluation of GPS reflectometry from space against more established techniques. TDS-1 uses a high gain (~13 dBi) L1 antenna pointing 6 degrees off nadir with a 60ohalf-beam width. Reflected GPS L1 signals are processed into Delay Doppler Maps (DDMs) inside the receiver and made available (through Level-1b) along with metadata describing the bistatic geometry, antenna gain, etc., on a second-by-second basis for each of the 4 GPS tracks recorded at any given time.\nIn this paper we examine level-1b data from TDS-1 for thousands of tracks collected over the span of Jan.-Feb., 2015. This data corresponds to reflections from various types of surfaces throughout the globe including ice, deserts, forests, oceans, lakes, wetlands, etc. Our analysis will consider how the surface type manifests itself in the DDMs (e.g., coherence vs. non-coherence reflection) and derivable physical quantities. We will consider questions regarding footprint resolution, waveform rise time and corresponding bistatic range accuracy, and level of precision for altimetry (sea surface height) and scatterometry (significant wave height and sea surface wind). Tracks from TDS-1 that coincide with Jason-1 or 2 tracks will be analyzed, where the latter can be used as truth for comparison and validation. Where coincidences are found, vertical delay introduced by the media as measured by Jason will be mapped to bistatic propagation path to correct for neutral atmospheric and ionospheric delays.",

            "abstract": "In elastic rebound theory, hazard increases as interseismic strain rebuilds after rupture. This model is challenged by the temporal variation in the pacing of major earthquakes that is both predicted by mechanical models and suggested by some long paleoseismic records (e.g., 1-3). However, the extent of such behavior remains unclear due to a lack of long (5-25 ky) records of fault slip. Using Monte Carlo analysis of 11 offset landforms, we determined a 16-ky record of fault slip for the active, left-lateral Altyn Tagh fault, which bounds the NW margin of the Tibetan Plateau. This history reveals a pulse of accelerated slip between 6.4 and 6.0 ka, during which the fault slipped 9 +14/-2 m at a rate of 23 +35/-5 mm/y, or ~3x the 16 ky average of 8.1 +1.2/-0.9mm/y.\nThese two modes of earthquake behavior suggest temporal variation in the rates of stress storage and release. The simplest explanation for the pulse is a cluster of 2-8 Mw > 7.5 earthquakes. Such supercyclicity has been reported for the Sunda (4) and Cascadia (3) megathrusts, but contrasts with steady slip along the strike-slip Alpine fault (5), for example. A second possibility is that the pulse reflects a single, unusually large rupture. However, this Black Swan event is unlikely: empirical scaling relationships require a Mw 8.2 rupture of the entire 1200-km-long ATF to produce 7 m of average slip. Likewise, Coulomb stress change from rupture on the adjacent North Altyn fault is of modest magnitude and overlap with the ATF. Poor temporal correlation between precipitation and the slip pulse argues against climatically modulated changes in surface loading (lakes/ice) or pore-fluid pressure. \"Paleoslip” studies such as this sacrifice the single-event resolution of paleoseismology in exchange for long records that quantify both the timing and magnitude of fault slip averaged over multiple ruptures, and are essential for documenting temporal variations in fault slip as we begin to use calibrated physical models of the earthquake cycle to forecast time-dependent earthquake hazard (e.g., 6,7).\n1.

Multistation template matching is utilized to increase the number of events analyzed by lowering the magnitude of detection. In cases where local deployments are available, we demonstrate that the FMD obtained through template matching using regional data are comparable to those obtained from traditional detection using the local deployment. Since deployments usually occur after seismicity has already been identified, catalogs constructed with regional data offer the advantage of providing a more complete history of the seismicity. We find two primary groups of FMDs for induced sequences: those that generally follow the Gutenberg-Richter power-law and those that generally do not. All of the induced sequences are typically characterized by swarm-like behavior, but the non-power-law FMDs are also characterized by a clustering of events at low magnitudes and particularly low aftershock productivity for a continental interior. Each of the observations in the non-power law FMD cases is predicted by numerical simulations of a seismogenic zone governed by a viscoelastic damage rheology with low effective viscosity in the fault zone. Such a reduction in effective viscosity is expected if fluid injection increases fluid pressures in the fault zone to the point that the fault zone begins to dilate.",

Iron sulfides, specifically pyrite (FeS2), can explain the observed high reflectivity. However, several studies suggest that pyrite is not stable under Venusian conditions and is destroyed on geologic timescales. To test the stability of pyrite on the Venusian surface, pyrite was heated in the Venus simulation chamber at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center to average Venusian surface conditions, and separately to highland conditions under an atmosphere of pure CO2 and separately under an atmosphere of 96.5% CO2, 3.5% N2 and 150 ppm SO2. After each run, the samples were weighed and analyzed using X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) to identify possible phase changes and determine the stability of pyrite under Venusian surface conditions.\nUnder a pure CO2 atmosphere, the Fe in pyrite oxidizes to form hematite which is more stable at higher temperatures corresponding to the Venusian lowlands. Magnetite is the primary iron oxide that forms at lower temperatures corresponding to the radar-bright highlands. Our experiments also showed that the presence of atmospheric SO2 inhibits the oxidation of pyrite, increasing its stability under Venusian conditions, especially those corresponding to the highlands. This indicates that the relatively high level of SO2 in the Venusian atmosphere is key to the stability of pyrite, making it a possible candidate for the bright radar signal in the Venusian highlands.",

Understanding of fundamental fracture growth mechanisms is essential for understanding fracture formation and cementation in chemically reactive systems with implications for seismic and aseismic fault and fracture processes, migration of hydrocarbons, long-term CO2 storage, and geothermal energy production. A recent study on crack-seal veins in deeply buried sandstone of east Texas provided evidence for non-linear fracture growth, which is indicated by non-elliptical kinematic fracture aperture profiles. We hypothesize that similar non-linear fracture growth also occurs in other geologic settings, including under higher temperature where solution-precipitation reactions are kinetically favored. To test this hypothesis, we investigate processes of fracture growth in quartzitic sandstone of the Campito Formation, eastern California, by combining field structural observations, thin section petrography, and fluid inclusion microthermometry. Fracture aperture profile measurements of cemented opening-mode fractures show both elliptical and non-elliptical kinematic aperture profiles. In general, fractures that contain fibrous crack-seal cement have elliptical aperture profiles. Fractures filled with blocky cement have linear aperture profiles. Elliptical fracture aperture profiles are consistent with linear-elastic or plastic fracture mechanics. Linear aperture profiles may reflect aperture growth controlled by solution-precipitation creep, with the aperture distribution controlled by solution-precipitation kinetics. We hypothesize that synkinematic crack-seal cement preserves the elliptical aperture profiles of elastic fracture opening increments. Blocky cement, on the other hand, may form postkinematically relative to fracture opening, with fracture opening accommodated by continuous solution-precipitation creep.",

            "abstract": "Many organisms use oxygen through cellular respiration in order to gain energy. For this reason, oxygen has a significant influence on organism size and growth. The amount of oxygen an organism needs depends on its metabolic demand, which is partially a function organism size (i.e., mass). The Santa Monica Basin (SMB) is an oxygen minimum zone located off the southern coast of California that maintains a steep oxygen gradient and is thus an ideal location for conducting research on how oxygen influences organism size. Here we use benthic foraminifera, widespread single-celled protists that produce shells (tests), to study the controls of oxygen on organism size. Because cell mass and cell volume are correlated, we study trends in the log test volume of four abundant species from SMB: Uvigerina peregrina, Bolivina spissa, B. argentea, Loxostomum pseudobeyrichi. These foraminifera make multi-chambered tests, thus we also count the number of chambers per specimen in order to further assess their growth under varying oxygen concentrations. We analyzed the data using quantile regressions to determine trends in not only median values of the log test volume and number of chambers as a function of oxygen concentrations, but also in the 10th, 25th, 75th, and 90th percentiles because oxygen availability often constrains the maximum and minimum size of organisms. Our results show a positive correlation between oxygen concentration and the maximum log test volumes of L. pseudobeyrichi and B. argentea, supporting our hypothesis. However, we observed a negative correlation between oxygen concentration and the maximum percentiles of log test volume in U. peregrina. Nevertheless, U. peregrina still displays a positive correlation between chamber number and oxygen concentrations in line with our hypothesis. The preponderance of trends supporting a direct correlation between log test volume or chamber number and oxygen concentration suggest that oxygen limits the maximum obtainable size of benthic foraminifera through its effects on test volume or chamber growth. This study is important because it holds a glimpse into how changes in oxygen levels can affect organisms given current fluctuations in oxygen level around the world due to man-made climate change.",

Coupling terrain analysis with an existing hydrologic classification system provides an opportunity to extend the range of such geomorphic predictive models across spatially-explicit hydrologic classes via a hydrologically stratified sampling campaign to reduce field data requirements. Furthermore, terrain indices can serve as proxies for ﬁeld measurements, providing first-order predictions of reach-scale geomorphic setting and associated aquatic and riparian habitat to extend the range of the model.

Its depocenter region, with a maximum estimated depth of just over 7000 m, was crossed by three magnetotelluric - MT profiles proposed by the Brazilian Petroleum Agency (ANP) aimed at better characterizing its geological structure, as the seismic images are very poor. The data include about 350 MT broadband soundings spanning from 1000 Hz down to 2,000 s.\nThe MT data were processed using robust techniques and remote reference. Static shift observed in some stations were corrected based on Transient Electromagnetic – TEM measurements at each site. These models were integrated to existent gravity, magnetic and seismic data for a more comprehensive interpretation of the region.\nA pilot 3D model has also been constructed on a crustal scale covering the study area using four frequencies per decade in the 3D inversion scheme proposed by Siripunvaraporn et al. (2005). The inversion scheme produced a reliable model and the observations were adequately reproduced, with observed fitting particularly better for the deeper structures related to basement compared to the 2D results. The main features in the conductivity model correspond to known geological features. These included the conductivity structures obtained for the upper crust, i.e. the sedimentary sequences, underlain by more resistive material, assumed to be basement. Local resistive features in the near-surface are associated to volcanic basalts covering the sediments. Some highly resistivity horizontal and vertical bodies were associated to volcanic intrusion like dikes and sills. We observed depressions on basement consistent with half-graben structures possibly filled with sandstones.",

However, there is not yet a clear understanding amongst researchers and educators of what authentic practice looks like in a classroom and how this can be accomplished. This study explores these questions by examining interactions between scientists and students on a social media platform during two pilot enactments of a project-based curriculum focusing on the ecological impacts of climate change. During this unit, scientists provided feedback to students on infographics, visual representations of scientific information meant to communicate to an audience about climate change. We conceptualize the feedback and student work as boundary objects co-created by students and scientists moving between the school and scientific contexts, and analyze the structure and content of the scientists' feedback. We find that when giving feedback on a particular practice (e.g. argumentation), scientists would provide avenues, critiques and questions that incorporated many other practices (e.g. data analysis, visual communication); thus, scientists encouraged students to participate systemically in practices instead of isolating one particular practice. In addition, scientists drew attention to particular habits of mind that are valued in the scientific community and noted when students' work aligned with scientific values. In this way, scientists positioned students as capable of participating \"scientifically.\" While traditionally, incorporating scientific inquiry in a classroom has emphasized student experimentation and data generation, in this work, we found that engaging with scientists around established scientific texts and data sets provided students with a platform for developing expertise in other important scientific practices during argment construction.",

The utility of this proxy hinges on the production of robust species-specific δ11B-pH calibrations; yet, challenges remain in the interpretation of boron isotope data due to biases introduced by physiological, environmental, and analytical factors. The shallow hydrothermal vents in the Maug Islands caldera (Marianas Islands) and the adjacent coral reefs exhibit a localized gradient > 1 pH unit. This gradient was used as a natural laboratory to assess the efficacy of using skeletal δ11B in a variety of corals (Porites spp., Pocillipora spp., Acropora spp.) and calcified algae (Halimeda spp. and Corallinales) as biosensors of seawater pH. Three sites were selected representing oceanic background, intermediate, and low pH zones, and direct seawater pH measurements were recorded for 3 months using SeaFETs. Corals and algae growing naturally in situ were collected from these 3 sites. In addition, corals and algae collected from a background location were stained and transplanted to these sites and allowed to grow for 3 months. Measurements of δ11B in skeletal material made by multi-collector inductively coupled mass spectrometry are compared to direct seawater pH measurements to assess the sensitivity and robustness of the δ11B proxy in these candidate biosensors in predicting ambient pH in the field. These data will inform ongoing efforts by the Archive of Coral Ecosystem Specimens (ACES) to collect marine carbonates for analysis and archival in the Marine Environmental Specimen Bank for broad-scale, long-term monitoring of ocean acidification and the associated impacts to coral reefs. Concurrent analyses of other trace elements, heavy metals, and isotopes in these samples will also be performed to assess their utility as biosensors for additional water chemistry parameters on coral reefs.",

Estimates for the Arctic tundra’s contribution to the global wetland CH4 emissions range from 15-27 TgCH4 y-1 (8-14% of total). However, these estimates are largely based on data from the growing season, or from boreal systems underlain by discontinuous permafrost with different physical, hydrological, and biogeochemical dynamics than continuous permafrost zones. Recent data from a transect of eddy covariance flux towers across the North Slope of Alaska revealed the importance of cold season emissions to the annual CH4 budget, which may not correlate with summer flux patterns. However, understanding of the controls and inter-annual variability in fluxes at these different sites is lacking. Here, we present data from ~3 years at 5 tundra ecosystems along this Arctic transect to show the influence of earlier and deeper spring active layer thaw on timing and magnitude of CH4 fluxes. This year’s warm spring led to significantly greater thaw depths and lower water tables than the previous year. Substantial CH4 emissions in 2015 were recorded at the wettest sites >20 days earlier than in the more meteorologically normal previous year. Since the soil remained saturated despite a lowered water table, total spring CH4 emissions more than doubled at these wet sites. At the drier sites, soil moisture declined with water table during the warmer spring, resulting in similar emissions to the previous year. However, deeper thaw depths prolonged fall and early winter emissions during the ‘zero-curtain’ soil temperature freezing phase, particularly at the drier site. In general, warmer spring temperatures in the Arctic may result in large increases in early season CH4 losses at wet sites and prolonged steady losses at the upland sites, enhancing the feedback between changing climate and tundra CH4 emissions at all sites.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU Pollen poster edit Final.pdf\nThe global incidence of hay fever has been rising for decades, however, the underlying reasons behind this rise remain unclear. It is hypothesized that exposure of pollen to common gas phase pollutants, such as nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3), increases the allergenicity of the pollen and thus increases hay fever incidence. Since atmospheric pollutants tend to have greater concentrations within urban areas (in particular NO2) the hypothesis suggests that greater allergenicity should occur in urban areas. Indeed, several studies do suggest higher hay fever incidence within urban areas compared to rural areas.\nPrevious published work suggests a link between increased allergies with changes in the chemical composition of the pollen protein via posttranslational modification of the protein. This study investigates the posttranslational modification of two highly allergenic pollen species (Birch and Ragweed) that are common in Europe. Within the laboratory, we expose pollen grains to atmospherically relevant exposures of gas phase NO2, O3 and other common gas phase oxidants under a range of environmentally relevant conditions. The effects of the environmentally relevant exposures on the biochemistry of the pollen grains were probed using a proteomic approach (liquid chromatography coupled ultra-high resolution spectrometer).\nOur findings indicate the interaction between gas phase pollutants and pollen cause protein specific modifications; in particular, nitration occurs upon tyrosine residues and nitrosylation on cysteine residues. Possibly, these modifications may affect the immune response of the pollen protein, which may suggest a possible reason for increased allergies in reaction to such biologically altered protein. The laboratory-derived results will be supported with a time series analysis of asthma incidence rates for the London area, which take into account the pollen count, and pollutant concentrations. The implications of the results will be discussed in terms of better planning of city infrastructure. In particular, the relevance of the results upon urban tree planting schemes will be put into context.",

Here we studied the indirect, long-term effects of fire on ecosystem C cycling via changes in stand density, organic layer and thaw depth in, in Siberian larch (Larix cajanderi) forests, underlain by continuous permafrost, near Chersky, Russia. Understory net ecosystem exchange (NEE), ecosystem respiration (Reco) and thaw depth were measured for 3 growing seasons from density plots (related to fire severity) found within a 75-yr burn scar and from experimental burn plots. In 2015, Reco was partitioned, using a dual-isotope approach, to determine how fire severity alters the contribution of autotrophic and heterotrophic respiration. Reco gas samples were collected from static chambers, and at the density gradient we also collected carbon dioxide (CO2) from Reco sources (organic and mineral layer soils, above and belowground vegetation). We expect that differences in thaw depth, vegetation and organic layer related to stand density, will impact the contribution of old C sources to Reco. In the experimental burn plots, the severity of the burn and thaw depth were positively correlated, and promoted loss of old C. Following the fires in 2012, higher intensity burns decreased Reco, but 3 years later, Reco was similar across burn treatments. In the 75-yr burn, stand density significantly impacted both thaw depth and understory CO2 exchange, where higher density stands, had lower thaw depths, higher understory NEE, and C loss from young C sources that have assimilated since the fire. Decades after fire, permafrost vulnerability and C accumulation are driven by stand density, where higher-density stands have higher rates of NEE, but C loss from relatively young C.",

Frustratingly, however, many soil microorganisms resist cultivation and soil communities are astoundingly complex. This makes soil microbiology difficult to study and without a solid understanding of soil microbial ecology, models of soil C feedbacks to climate change are under-informed. Stable isotope probing (SIP) is a useful approach for establishing identity-function connections in microbial communities but has been challenging to employ in soil due to the inadequate resolution of microbial community fingerprinting techniques. High throughput DNA sequencing improves SIP resolving power transforming it into a powerful tool for studying the soil C cycle. We conducted a DNA-SIP experiment to track flow of xylose-C, a labile component of plant biomass, and cellulose-C, the most abundant global biopolymer, through a soil microbial community. We could track 13C into microbial DNA even when added 13C amounted to less than 5% of native C and found Spartobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes taxa were among those that assimilated 13C cellulose. These lineages are cosmopolitan in soil but little is known of their ecophysiology. By profiling SSU rRNA genes across entire DNA-SIP density gradients, we assessed relative DNA atom % 13C per taxon in 13C treatments and found cellulose degraders exhibited signal consistent with a specialist lifestyle with respect to C preference. Further, DNA-SIP enriches DNA of targeted microorganisms (Verrucomicrobia cellulose degraders were enriched by nearly two orders of magnitude) and this enriched DNA can serve as template for community genomics. We produced draft genomes from soil cellulose degraders including microorganisms belonging to Verrucomicrobia, Chloroflexi, and Planctomycetes from SIP enriched DNA. This study demonstrates how DNA-SIP can be used to study microbial ecology and target guilds of microorganisms for community genomics. Improving our fundamental understanding of ecophysiology relevant to terrestrial C cycling is essential for tuning global C models.",

Past studies have shown that changes in land-cover will be associated with changes in vegetation, primarily tree line migration and shrubification. These changes in vegetation can feedback to climate through the balance of plant carbon uptake due to increased availability of nitrogen and release of carbon to the atmosphere from increased decomposition. In addition to the carbon cycle feedbacks, changes in vegetation can also change the surface energy and water balances through modifications in land surface albedo and evapotranspiration. However there is a lack of studies that attempt to understand how vegetation changes in the future interacts with permafrost degradation and deep soil carbon that can subsequently change the terrestrial carbon balance and surface energy balance in the coming century.

            "abstract": "ePoster - Source Tracers AGU 2015_Ransom.pdf\nGroundwater quality is a concern in alluvial aquifers that underlie agricultural areas, such as in the San Joaquin Valley of California. Nitrate from fertilizers and animal waste can leach to groundwater and contaminate drinking water resources. Dairy manure and synthetic fertilizers are prevailing sources of nitrate in groundwater for the San Joaquin Valley with septic waste contributing as a major source in some areas. The rural population in the San Joaquin Valley relies almost exclusively on shallow domestic wells (less than 150 m deep), of which many have been affected by nitrate. Knowledge of the proportion of each of the three main nitrate sources (manure, synthetic fertilizer, and septic waste) contributing to individual well nitrate can aid future regulatory decisions. Mixing models quantify the proportional contributions of sources to a mixture by using the concentration of conservative tracers within each source as a source signature. Deterministic mixing models are common, but do not allow for variability in the tracer source concentration or overlap of tracer concentrations between sources. In contrast, Bayesian mixing models treat source contributions probabilistically, building statistical variation into the inferences for each well. The authors developed a Bayesian mixing model on a pilot network of 56 private domestic wells in the San Joaquin Valley for which nitrogen, oxygen, and boron isotopes as well as nitrate and iodine were measured. Nitrogen, oxygen, and boron isotopes as well as iodine can be used as tracers to differentiate between manure, fertilizers, septic waste, and natural sources of nitrate (which can contribute nitrate in concentrations up to 4 mg/L). In this work, the isotopic and elemental tracers were used to estimate the proportional contribution of manure, fertilizers, septic waste, and natural sources to overall groundwater nitrate concentration in individual wells. Prior distributions for the four tracers for each of the four sources were estimated based on end member measurements, literature, or as a part of our previous work. The Bayesian method produces estimates of the fractional source contributions to each well, which can be compared to surrounding landuse types. Estimated source contributions were broadly consistent with nearby landuse types in this sample.",

            "abstract": "As the coastal population continues to grow in size and wealth, increased hurricane frequency and intensity present a growing threat of property damage and loss of life. Recent reconstructions of past intense-hurricane landfalls from sediment cores in southeastern New England identify a series of active intervals over the past 2,000 years, with the last few centuries among the most quiescent intervals. The frequency of intense-hurricane landfalls in southeastern New England is well constrained, but the intensity of these storms, particularly prehistoric events, is not. This study analyzes the grain sizes of major storm event beds along a transect of sediment cores in Salt Pond, Falmouth, MA. Several prehistoric events contain more coarse material than any of the deposits from the historical interval, suggesting that landfalling hurricanes in the northeastern United States may have been more intense than the historically encountered category 2 and 3 storms. The intensity of major storm events is estimated using grain-size analysis with a digital image processing, size, and shape analyzer. Since event deposits in Salt Pond result from a combination of coastal inundation and wave action, a large population of both historical and synthetic storms is used to assess the storm characteristics that could result in the wave heights inversely modeled from grain size trends. Intense-hurricane activity may be closely tied to warming in sea surface temperature. As such, the prehistoric intervals of increased frequency and intensity provide potential analogs for current and future hurricane risk in the northeastern United States.",

            "abstract": "Tropospheric ozone is regulated by the US EPA to protect human health and welfare. Because the precursors to ozone formation largely come from transportation and industrial activity, ozone has typically been thought of as an urban pollution problem. However, there is growing concern about increased ozone concentrations in rural areas. Surprisingly high ozone concentrations have been measured in the high elevation Rocky Mountain ecosystems in the Front Range of Colorado. The annual median ozone mixing ratios over the past decade at three high elevation monitoring stations ranged from 47 to 53 ppbv. The hourly ozone mixing ratio typically exceeds 100 ppbv at some point every year at these sites. The number of days where the ozone mixing ratio exceeded the current 8 hour US EPA National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 75 ppb has ranged from 0 to 25 since 1987 at the monitoring site in Rocky Mountain National Park. A comparison with lower elevation sites suggests that ozone mixing ratios generally increase with elevation. In addition, the diurnal and seasonal variability of ozone decreases with elevation. Along an elevational gradient from the plains to the tundra, the tundra site had the highest median values and the least variability of any site. The seasonal pattern at these high elevation sites is also distinct as the maximum mixing ratios occur in the spring in contrast to the summer maximum typically observed in urban areas. While there have been relatively small changes in concentration in the measured data record going back a few decades, modeling suggests that ozone mixing ratios have almost doubled over the last one hundred years in Colorado. A plethora of studies has shown that elevated ozone damages foliage, with sensitive species showing effect at levels exceeding 35-40 ppbv. Since ozone levels in these high elevation ecosystems are clearly above that, we believe that they have been and will continue to be severely affected by elevated ozone. It is not well established which high elevation species are most sensitive to ozone, but the historical changes in ozone may have already altered ecosystem structure and function, such as species composition and carbon and nutrient cycling.",

            "abstract": "A longstanding question concerns the nature of the melts forming in the subarc mantle and giving rise to arc magmatism. The global array of primitive arc melts (1180 volcanic rocks in 25 arcs extracted from the georoc database, calculated to be in equilibrium with mantle olivine) yields five principal melt types: calc-alkaline basalts and high-Mg andesites, tholeiitic basalts and high-Mg andesites, and shoshonitic or alkaline arc melts; many arcs have more than one type.\nPrimitive calc-alkaline basalts occur in 11 arcs but most strikingly, 8 continental arcs (incl. Aleutians, Cascades, Japan, Mexico, Kamtschatka) have a continuous range of calc-alkaline basalts to high-Mg andesites with mostly 48-58 wt% SiO2. In each arc, these are spatially congruent, trace element patterns overlap, and major elements form a continuum. Their Ca-Mg-Si systematics suggests saturation in olivine+opx+cpx. We hence interpret the large majority of high-Mg andesites as derived from primitive calc-alkaline basalts through fractionation and reaction in the shallower mantle. Removal of anhydrous mantle phases at lower pressures increases SiO2 and H2O-contents while Mg# and Ni remain buffered to mantle values.\nPrimitive tholeiitic basalts (Cascades, Kermadec, Marianas, Izu-Bonin, Japan, Palau, Sunda) have a much lesser subduction signal (e.g. in LILE) than the calc-alkaline suite. These tholeiites have been interpreted to form through decompression melting, but also characterize young intraoceanic arcs. In the two continental arcs with both tholeiitic and calc-alkaline primitive basalts (clearly distinct in trace patterns), there is no clear spatial segregation (Casacades, Japan).\nThree intraoceanic arcs (Marianas, Izu-Bonin, Tonga) have primitive tholeiitic, highly depleted high-Mg andesites (boninites) with HFSE and HREE slightly above primitive mantle values. These deviate in majors from the array formed by the basalts and calc-alkaline andesites suggesting that only these formed from a harzburgitic residue. Primitive high-K shoshonitic or low-Si alkaline arc melts occur in Sulawesi, Sunda, Mago, and Mexico (2 types), spatially mostly very much limited. We interpret these as derived from limited volumes of metasomatized mantle either residing in the subarc lithosphere or entrained into the mantle wedge.",

The test site selected is BERMS Old Aspen Flux (OAS) field station in central Saskatchewan, Canada. The selection of different parameterization schemes for each process within the current Noah-MP model significantly affected the simulation results. The best combination options without incorporating organic soil is referred as the control experiment (CTL). By including an organic-soil parameterization within the Noah-MP model for the first time, the verification results (OGN) against site show significantly improved performance of the model in surface energy fluxes and hydrology simulation due to the lower thermal conductivity and greater porosity of the organic soil. The effects of including an organic soil layer on soil temperature are not uniform throughout the soil depth and year, and those effects are more prominent in summer and in deep soils. For drought years, the OGN simulation substantially modified the partition between direct soil evaporation and vegetation transpiration. For wet years, the OGN simulated latent heat fluxes are similar to CTL except for spring season where OGN produced less evaporation. The impact of the organic soil on sub-surface runoff is substantive with much higher runoff throughout the season.",

            "abstract": "The significant expansion of juniper (Juniperus spp.) woodlands throughout the western U.S. during the last two centuries has disrupted important ecological functions and hydrologic processes. The relationships between water and vegetation distribution are highly impacted by the ongoing shift from shrub steppe and grassland to woodland-dominated landscapes. We investigated vegetation dynamics and hydrologic processes occurring in two distinct juniper landscapes with different precipitation regimes in the Intermountain West region: A winter snow-dominated (Oregon) and a summer rain-dominated with some winter precipitation (New Mexico) landscape. Results from the Oregon site showed marginal differences (1-2%) in soil moisture in treated vs untreated watersheds throughout the dry and wet seasons. In general, soil moisture was greater in the treated watershed in both seasons. Canopy cover affected soil moisture over time. Perennial grass cover was positively correlated with changes in soil moisture, whereas juniper cover was negatively correlated with changes in soil moisture. Shallow groundwater response observed in upland and valley monitoring wells indicate there are temporary hydrologic connections between upland and valley locations during the winter precipitation season. Results from the New Mexico site provided valuable information regarding timing and intensity of monsoon-driven precipitation and the rainfall threshold (5 mm/15 min) that triggers runoff. Long-term vegetation dynamics and hydrologic processes were evaluated based on pre- and post-juniper removal (70%) in three watersheds. In general, less runoff and greater forage response was observed in the treated watersheds. During rainfall events, soil moisture was less under juniper canopy compared with inter-canopy; this difference in soil moisture was intensified during high intensity, short duration rainstorms in the summer months. We found that winter snow precipitation helped recharge soil moisture prior to plant growth in the springtime, but it did not generate streamflow. Study results provide valuable information towards understanding ecohydrologic differences and similarities of woody vegetation expansion in semiarid areas on both sides of the continental divide in the Intermountain West.",

After the Great Oxidation Event (GOE) about 2.4 billion years ago, or perhaps even before the GOE, oxygen became the most widespread and efficient terminal electron acceptor and was accompanied by the evolution of a number of redox proteins that could deliver electrons to reduce oxygen to water. Where did these proteins come from? One hypothesis is that they evolved by the neofunctionalization of previously existing redox proteins that had been used in anaerobic conditions as terminal electron donors to reduce compounds such as perchlorate, nitric oxide or iron.\nWe have used a number of bioinformatic tools to explore a large number of genomes looking for discernable signals of such redeployment of function. A Perl pipeline was designed to detect sequence similarity, conserved gene context, remote homology detection, identification of domains and functional evolution of electron carrier proteins from extreme acidophiles, including the small blue copper protein rusticyanin (involved in FeII oxidation), cytochrome oxidase subunit II and quinol-dependent nitric oxide reductase (qNOR). The protein folds and copper binding sites of rusticyanin are conserved in cytochrome oxidase aa3 subunit II, a protein complex that is responsible for the final passage of electrons to reduce oxygen. Therefore, we hypothesize that rusticyanin, cytochrome oxidase II and qNOR are evolutionarily related.\nAcknowledgments: Fondecyt 1130683.",

The suite of B-vitamins (B1, B2, B6, B7, B12) are essential across all domains of life for both primary and secondary metabolism. Therefore, studying sediment concentrations of B-vitamins can provide a biochemical link between microbial processes and sediment geochemistry. Here we present B-vitamin pore water concentrations from suboxic sediment cores collected in September 2014 from San Pedro Basin, a silled, low oxygen, ~900 m deep coastal basin in the California Borderlands. We compare the B-vitamin concentrations (measured via LCMS) to a set of geochemical profiles including dissolved Fe (65-160 µM), dissolved Mn (30-300 nM), TCO2, solid phase organic carbon, and δ13C. Our results show high concentrations (0.8-3nM) of biotin (B7), commonly used for CO2 fixation as a cofactor in carboxylase enzymes. Thiamin (B1) concentrations were elevated (20-700nM), consistent with previous pore water measurements showing sediments could be a source of B1 to the ocean. Cobalamin (B12), a cofactor required for methyl transfers in methanogens, was also detected in pore waters (~4-40pM). The flavins (riboflavin [B2] and flavin mononucleotide[FMN]), molecules utilized in external electron transfer, showed a distinct increase with depth (10-90nM). Interestingly, the flavin profiles showed an inverse trend to dissolved Fe (Fe decreases with depth) providing a potential link to culture experiments which have shown extracellular flavin release to be a common trait in some metal reducers. As some of the first B-vitamin measurements made in marine sediments, these results illustrate the complex interaction between the microbial community and surrounding geochemical environment and provide exciting avenues for future research.",

However, these units are absent on Maria Magdalena island which is positioned between the other islands. Here, instead, oceanic lithosphere with pillow lavas and gabbroic sills, intercalated with sandstones form the dominant outcrops. Their geochemical and isotopic characteristics are similar to N-MORB with epsilon Nd values around +10 and 87Sr/86Sr of 0.70290. The gabbros are not older than 22 Ma. Magdalena island was obviously uplifted separately from the other islands of the archipelago, probably along a now hidden transform fault system along the East Pacific Rise. Metamorphic and igneous rocks of the other islands can be correlated to lithologically similar units in the Los Cabos Block, Baja California, or to the continental margin units in Sinaloa, Nayarit and Jalisco states when looking at their geochemical and geochronological signatures.

In this work we use observations from the Van Allen Probes, combined with global MHD/particle simulations of the dynamic solar wind-magnetospheric interaction, to examine the distribution of temperature anisotropies in the inner magnetosphere, with an emphasis on understanding the relative roles of radial transport and drift orbit bifurcation in the evolving temperature profiles. We focus on recent storm events, including the October 2, 2013 and March 17, 2015 geomagnetic storms, which were characterized by significant radial transport and wave activity. Implications for the acceleration and loss of radiation belt particles as a result of this wave activity are discussed.",

The characteristics of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in these water bodies provide insights into the biogeochemical processes undergoing at the source, during transport and in the water bodies. Land use and land cover plays not only a significant role in controlling the quantity of the exported DOM, but also influences the quality of DOM via various biogeochemical and biodegradation processes. We investigated the characteristics and spatial distribution of DOM in five major lakes - Sardis, Enid, Grenada, Okatibbee, and Ross Barnett Reservoir (RBR), an estuary, the Lower Pearl River (LPR) Estuary, and a coastal region, Grand Bay, in the state of Mississippi, USA. Water samples from the lakes and Grand Bay were collected during the summer of 2012-2014 while samples from LPR were collected during winter 2014 and spring 2015. We employed absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy including excitation emission matrix (EEM) combined with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) modeling techniques to determine optical properties of DOM and its characteristics in these study sites. A site-specific PARAFAC model was developed to evaluate DOM characteristics, which resulted in five diverse DOM compositions including two terrestrial humic-like, two microbial humic-like, and one protein-like DOM. The lakes and Grand Bay region showed high concentrations of microbial humic-like or protein-like DOM fluorescence signatures while the samples from LPR Estuary and the RBR showed relatively high concentration of terrestrial humic-like DOM. Moreover, we also observed strong correlations between microbial humic-like DOM (PARAFAC derived) and DOM indices such as biological/freshness and fluorescence indices (EEM based). DOM in the lakes indicated autochthonous characteristics predominantly probably because of photochemical degradation while the LPR Estuary and the RBR samples showed mainly allochthonous DOM of terrestrial origin. Preliminary analysis showed that forests, wetlands, agriculture, and urban areas are the major land use and land covers affecting DOM quality. We intend to investigate the influence of other land uses and land covers on DOM characteristics based on our nutrient measurements in all our study sites.",

Recently, we have developed a hybrid-3D (h3D)\nhillslope hydrological model that couples a 1D vertical soil column model with a lateral pseudo-2D\nsaturated zone and overland flow model. The h3D model gives similar results as the CATchment\nHYdrological model (CATHY), which simulates the subsurface movement of water with the 3D Richards\nequation, though the runtime efficiency of the h3D model is about 2-3 orders of magnitude faster.\nIn the current work, the ability of the h3D model to predict real-world hydrological dynamics is\nassessed using a number of recharge-drainage experiments within the Landscape Evolution\nObservatory (LEO) at the Biosphere 2 near Tucson, Arizona, USA. LEO offers accurate and high-\nresolution (both temporally and spatially) observations of the inputs, outputs and storage dynamics of\nseveral hillslopes. The level of detail of these observations is generally not possible with real-world\nhillslope studies. Therefore, LEO offers an optimal environment to test the h3D model.\nThe h3D model captures the observed storage, baseflow, and overland flow dynamics of both a larger\nand a smaller hillslope. Furthermore, it simulates overland flow better than CATHY. The h3D model\nhas difficulties correctly representing the height of the saturated zone close to the seepage face of the\nsmaller hillslope, though. There is a gravel layer near this seepage face, and the numerical boundary\ncondition of the h3D model is insufficient to capture the hydrological dynamics within this region.\nIn addition, the h3D model is used to test the hypothesis that model parameters change through time\ndue to the migration of soil particles during the recharge-drainage experiments. An in depth calibration\nof the h3D model parameters reveals that the best results are obtained by applying an event-based\noptimization procedure as compared to using a single parameter set for all events. However no clear\ntemporal evolution of the model parameters is observed between events.",

Here we investigated the vertical distributions of various functional groups in five sediment cores retrieved from Arctic Mid-Ocean Ridge (AMOR), with emphasis on the nitrifiers, denitrifiers and anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria (anammox). We observed the clear geochemical zonation associated with organic matter diagenesis in the sediments based on the pore water profiles of oxygen, nitrate, ammonium, manganese and sulfate, with distinct geochemical transition zones at the boundaries of geochemical zones, including oxic-anoxic transition zone (OATZ) and nitrate-manganese reduction zone (NMTZ). Nitrate was produced in surface oxygenated sediments and nitrate consumption mainly took place at the NMTZ, splitted between re-oxidation of ammonium and manganese (II). Abundances of ammonia oxidizers, nitrite oxidizers, and denitrifiers, estimated through quantitative PCR targeting their respective functional genes, generally decrease with depth, but constantly elevated around the OATZ, NMTZ, and manganese-reduction zone as well. Anammox bacteria were only detected around the NMTZ where both nitrate/nitrite and ammonium are available. These depth profiles of functional groups were also confirmed by the community structure profiling by prokaryotic 16S rRNA gene tag pyrosequencing. Cell-specific rates of nitrification and denitrification, calculated from the bulk net reaction rates divided by functional group abundances, were similar to those values from oligotrophic sediments like North Pond and thus suggested that nitrifiers and denitirifiers populations were in maintenance state. This study illustrated the microbial nitrogen transformation accompanying the early diagenesis of organic matter in marine sediments, which scenario might be occurring in a wide range of stratified environments on Earth.",

We have previously used lower frequency MT data to construct 1D and 2D resistivity profiles in this area and confirmed the presence of a low-resistivity region at depths of about 2 km. One of our drill holes in PTA had previously encountered temperatures of 150 C at a similar depth. However, our 1D and 2D models were unable to fit features of the data that we suspected were due to 3D variations in subsurface resistivity. For the 3D modeling, we reprocessed the higher frequency data (1 kHz sampling rate) which were available at all 20 sites. We were then able to obtain complex impedances at frequencies of 0.5-500 Hz to use for the 3D inversion. We used Siripunvaraporn's 3D inversion method to obtain resistivities in a rectangular array of 0.5x0.5x0.25 km blocks spanning the areal extent of the stations down to a depth of 2.5 km. The results confirmed that much of the anomalous data could be explained by near-surface 3D variations in resistivity. The underlying conductor of 5-10 ohm-m at 2 km depth now appears to extend over the entire survey area.",

Numerous observational and model based approaches have investigated biogeochemical tradeoffs, such as increased carbon sequestration and increased water use, associated with growing cellulosic feedstocks. A less understood aspect is the biogeophysical changes associated with the difference in albedo (α), which could alter the local energy balance and cause local to regional cooling several times larger than that associated with offsetting carbon. Here, we established paired fields of Miscanthus × giganteus (miscanthus) and Panicum virgatum (switchgrass), two of the leading perennial cellulosic feedstock candidates, and traditional annual row crops in the highly productive “Corn-belt”. Our results show that miscanthus did and switchgrass did not have an overall higher α than current row crops but a strong seasonal pattern existed. Both perennials had consistently higher growing season α than row crops and winter α did not differ. The lack of observed differences in winter α, however, masked an interaction between snow cover and species differences, with the perennial species, compared with the row crops, having a higher α when snow was absent and a much lower α when snow was present. Overall, these changes resulted in an average net reduction in annual absorbed energy of about 5 W/m2 for switchgrass and about 8 W/m2 for miscanthus relative to annual crops. Therefore, the conversion from annual row to perennial crops alters the radiative balance of the surface via changes in α and could lead to regional cooling.",

The height measurements on repeat tracks are initially interpolated to uniform along-track reference points (every 172 m) and times (ti) giving the h(xi,ti) used in the RTA solutions. The xi are the cross-track spacings from the reference track and i is the laser campaign index. The adjusted elevation measurements at the along-track reference points are hr(ti) = h(xi,ti) – xi tan(αc) - h0. The hr(ti) time series are averaged over 50 km cells creating H(ti) series and further averaged (weighted by cell area) to H(t) time series over drainage systems (DS), elevation bands, regions, and the entire ice sheet. Temperature-driven changes in the rate of firn compaction, CT(t), are calculated for 50 km cells with our firn-compaction model giving I(t) = H(t) - CT(t) - B(t) where B(t) is the vertical motion of the bedrock. During 2003 to 2009, the average dCT(t)/dt in the accumulation zone is -5 cm/yr, which amounts to a -75 km3/yr correction to ice volume change estimates. The I(t) are especially useful for studying the seasonal cycle of mass gains and losses and interannual variations. The H(t) for the ablation zone are fitted with a multi-variate function with a linear component describing the upward component of ice flow plus winter accumulation (fall through spring) and a portion of a sine function describing the superimposed summer melting. During fall to spring the H(t) indicate that the upward motion of the ice flow is at a rate of 1 m/yr, giving an annual mass gain of 180 Gt/yr in the ablation zone. The summer loss from surface melting in the high-melt summer of 2005 is 350 Gt/yr, giving a net surface loss of 170 Gt/yr from the ablation zone for 2005. During 2003-2008, the H(t) for the ablation zone show accelerations of the mass losses in the northwest DS8 and in the west-central DS7 (including Jacobshavn glacier) and offsetting decelerations of the mass losses in the east-central DS3 and southeast DS4, much of which occurred in 2008 possibly due to an eastward shift in the surface mass balance.",

This study will focus on design and test fit-for-purpose cement formulations. The goals of this project are as follows: 1) perform preliminary study of dispersing nanomaterial admixtures in Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) mixes, 2) characterize the cement-rock interface, and 3) identify potential high-performance cement additives that can improve sorption behavior, chemical durability, bond strength, and interfacial fracture toughness, as appropriate to specific subsurface operational needs.\nThe work presented here focuses on a study of cement-shale interfaces to better understand failure mechanisms, with particular attention to measuring bond strength at the cement-shale interface. Both experimental testing and computational modeling were conducted to determine the mechanical behavior at the interface representing the interaction of cement and shale of a typical wellbore environment. Cohesive zone elements are used in the finite element method to computationally simulate the interface of the cement and rock materials with varying properties. Understanding the bond strength and mechanical performance of the cement-formation interface is critical to wellbore applications such as sequestration, oil and gas production and exploration and nuclear waste disposal. Improved shear bond strength is an indication of the capability of the interface to ensure zonal isolation and prevent zonal communication, two crucial goals in preserving wellbore integrity. Understanding shear bond strength development and interface mechanics will provide an idea as to how the cement-formation interface can be altered under environmental changes (temperature, pressure, chemical degradation, etc.) so that the previously described objectives can be achieved.\n Sandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.

            "abstract": "We develop a theoretical model using relative abundances and fractionations of 13CH3D and CH2D2, the doubly substituted mass-18 isotopologues of methane, to quantitatively track the sources and the sinks of atmospheric methane. The goal is a better determination of the methane budget in the atmosphere. Different methane sources have different isotope ratios because of variations in substrates, formation reactions, and temperatures. Isotope ratio measurements will provide useful constraints on source components and sink processes. However, bulk isotope ratios alone are unlikely to be diagnostic because of mixing of sources. Using recently published budgets (Whiticar and Schaefer 2007) and estimates of equilibration temperatures of various methane sources (Stolper et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015), including an assumption that biogenic methane sources are near-stochastic (Wang et al., 2015), we estimated the abundances in air of singly- and doubly-substituted isotopologues in terms of both bulk ratios and deviations from the stochastic distributions of multiply-substituted species. δ13CH3D and δCH2D2 for the total atmospheric sources are predicted to be -493‰ and -330‰, whereas Δ13CH3D, and ΔCH2D2, enrichments relative to stochastic, are predicted to be +4.7‰ and +21.5‰. The composition of atmospheric methane will also be influenced by sink reactions. The main sink reactions with OH• and Cl• have been modeled with first-principles transition state theory, using simplified corrections for tunneling (Wigner 1932). Our model predicts that the main sink reactions in the atmosphere generate distinct signatures of lower Δ13CH3D and ΔCH2D2 relative to the source composition, while at the same time increasing δ13CH3D and δCH2D2. Measurements of both Δ13CH3D and ΔCH2D2 are now possible with the new large-geometry gas-source mass spectrometer at UCLA permitting testing of these predictions.",

Capillary imbibition causes fracturing fluids to flow from fractures into the rock matrix where the fluids are sequestered for geologically long periods of time. Imbibition could explain the low amount of flowback water observed in the field (5-50% of the injected volume) and reduce the chance of fracturing fluid migrating out of formation towards overlying aquifers. We present calculations of spontaneous capillary imbibition in the form of an “imbibition rate parameter” (A) based on the only known exact analytical solution for spontaneous capillary imbibition. A depends on the hydraulic and capillary properties of the reservoir rock, the initial water saturation, and the viscosities of the wetting and nonwetting fluids. Imbibed volumes can be large for a high permeability shale gas reservoir (up to 95% of the injected volume) or quite small for a low permeability shale oil reservoir (as low as 3% of the injected volume). We also present a nondimensionalization of the imbibition rate parameter, which facilitates the calculation of A and clarifies the relation of A to initial saturation, porous medium properties, and fluid properties. Over the range of initial water saturations reported for the Marcellus shale (0.05-0.6), A varies by less than factors of ~1.8 and ~3.4 for gas and oil nonwetting phases respectively. However, A decreases significantly for larger initial water saturations. A is most sensitive to the intrinsic permeability of the reservoir rock and the viscosity of the fluids.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost ecosystems contain about 50% of the global soil carbon. As these northern ecosystems experience warmer temperature, permafrost thaws and may result in an increase in atmospheric methane. We examined a thawing and discontinuous permafrost boundary at Stordalen Mire, in Northern Sweden, in an effort to better understand methane emissions. Stable isotope analysis of methane in peatland porewater can give insights into the pathway of methane production. By measuring δ13CH4 we can predict whether a system is dominated by either hydrogenotrophic or acetaclastic methane production. Currently, it is a challenge to scale these isotopic patterns, thus, atmospheric inversion models simply assume that acetoclastic production dominates. We analyzed porewater samples collected across a range of vegetation cover types for δ13CH4 using a QCL (Quantum Cascade Laser Spectrometer) in conjunction with highly accurate GPS (3-10cm) measurements and high-resolution UAV imaging. We found δ13CH4 values ranging from -88‰ to -41‰, with averages based on cover type and other vegetation features showing differences of up to -15‰. We then used a computer neural network to predict cover types across Stordalen Mire from UAV imagery based on field-based plot measurements and training samples.. This prediction map was used to scale methane flux and isotope measurements. Our results suggest that the current values used in atmospheric inversion studies may oversimplify the relationship between plant and microbial communities in complex permafrost landscapes. As we gain a deeper understanding of how vegetation relates to methanogenic communities, understanding the spatial component of ecosystem methane metabolism and distribution will be increasingly valuable.",

Low-oxygen areas are important not only for macroorganisms that cannot survive in oxygen-poor conditions, but also because of special biogeochemical processes occurring at low oxygen concentrations. In particular, a large fraction of oceanic nitrogen-loss occurs in these areas via anaerobic microbial processes. These include denitrification and axammox that both lead to a net loss of fixed nitrogen once oxygen concentrations have fallen below some threshold of a few umol/l. Recently it has been found that eddies may act as nitrogen-loss hotspots, possibly by shielding enclosed water parcels from lateral mixing with better ventilated oxygen-richer waters outside the eddies. Here we used a regional coupled biogeochemical model to investigate the relationship between eddies and the nitrogen-loss. We also investigate the mechanisms responsible for the generation of eddies and for possible modulations of eddy activity on interannual timescales, in particular during cold and warm phases of the El Nino Southern Oscillation.",

Previous studies indicate the former drives E-W divergence a with minimal role of basal shear. In addition to E-W extension, an increasing number of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) stations within the deforming zones of the EARS detect an along-rift component of motion that is inconsistent with our current understanding of the EARS. In this work we investigate the kinematics and dynamics of these along-rift motions. We first calculate a strain rate and velocity field by fitting bi-cubic Bessel splines to new and existing GNSS observations. We resolve regions of localized compression and transtension within individual rifts that are corroborated by independent seismic and geologic observations. In a second step we test the competing roles of shallow topographic stresses and sub-lithospheric basal shear stresses acting beneath individual rifts where we observe along-rift surface motions using the finite element code ASPECT to solve for Stokes flow in a 3D regional geodynamic model. We compare predicted surface motions and mantle flow directions from our geodynamic simulations with our new continuous deformation model based on GNSS observations. Our work indicates topside driven upper mantle flow directions correspond with anomalous along-rift surface motions in several key locations, but our modeled rheological structure impedes basal shear stresses (<1-3 MPa) from driving surface deformation where we observe along-rift surface motions. This work suggests along-rift surface motions are decoupled from asthenospheric flow.",

            "abstract": "Benthic activity within marine sediments can alter the physical properties of the sediment as well as indicate nutrient flux and ocean temperatures. We examine burrowing features in sediment cores from the western Arctic Ocean collected during the 2005 Healy-Oden TransArctic Expedition (HOTRAX) and from the Gulf of Mexico Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 308. While traditional methods for studying bioturbation require physical dissection of the cores, we assess burrowing using an X-ray computed tomography (XCT) scanner. XCT noninvasively images the sediment cores in three dimensions and produces density sensitive images suitable for quantitative analysis. XCT units are recorded as Hounsfield Units (HU), where -999 is air, 0 is water, and 4000-5000 would be a higher density mineral, such as pyrite.\nWe rely on the fundamental assumption that sediments are deposited horizontally, and we analyze the variance over each flat-lying slice. The variance describes the spread of pixel values over a slice. When sediments are reworked, drawing higher and lower density matrix into a layer, the variance increases. Examples of this can be seen in two slices in core 19H-3A from Site U1324 of IODP Expedition 308. The first slice, located 165.6 meters below sea floor consists of relatively undisturbed sediment. Because of this, the majority of the sediment values fall between 1406 and 1497 HU, thus giving the slice a comparatively small variance of 819.7. The second slice, located 166.1 meters below sea floor, features a lower density sediment matrix disturbed by burrow tubes and the inclusion of a high density mineral. As a result, the Hounsfield Units have a larger variance of 1,197.5, which is a result of sediment matrix values that range from 1220 to 1260 HU, the high-density mineral value of 1920 HU and the burrow tubes that range from 1300 to 1410 HU. Analyzing this variance allows us to observe changes in the sediment matrix and more specifically capture where, and to what extent, the burrow tubes deviate from the sediment matrix. Future research will correlate changes in variance due to bioturbation to other features indicating ocean temperatures and nutrient flux, such as foraminifera counts and oxygen isotope data.",

These forests account for more than 1/3 (~12 Pg C) of the conterminous US forest C stocks and sequester 76 Tg C annually, equivalent to 13% of the regions greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, these forests store a substantial amount of soil organic carbon (SOC), commonly exceeding twice the carbon measured in above ground biomass. However, due to the spatial-variation of SOC, these estimates have a large degree of uncertainty.\nCurrent projections for the region indicate a likely warmer and dryer future climate. As such, typical recurring questions are: “How vulnerable are these carbon stocks to altered climate conditions?” and “How will we measure this change without accurate baseline estimates?”\nTo answer these questions, PINEMAP (Pine Integrated Network: Education, Mitigation, and Adaptation Project) established a multi-tiered monitoring network to provide baseline measurements for carbon, water, and nutrient storage and fluxes in forested ecosystems across the Southeastern US. Here, we present preliminary findings from a region-wide modeling approach in an attempt to understand how various scenarios of climate change may affect carbon stocks in these ecosystems. To achieve this, the DayCent biogeochemical model was parameterized and calibrated with site-specific data from the PINEMAP Tier 3 network. Preliminary results indicate the model performed well, with an R2 = 0.86 for simulated vs observed SOC and R2 = 0.97 for simulated vs observed net primary productivity (NPP). The model is currently being scaled up to the Tier 2 network, which consists of 324 plots, to provide more representative estimates across the entire Southeastern US. The results of this transdisciplinary research project will be used to improve decisions regarding management and carbon sequestration strategies.",

It provides the epistemic basis that allows us to predict the preservation potential of input signals to sedimentary systems, and gives us a null hypothesis of sorts against which real stratigraphic sequences can be compared. Stratigraphic completeness essentially sets the resolution of a seismic section. However, despite the importance of stratigraphic completeness, significant gaps remain in our understanding, especially as regards the mechanistic underpinnings of how real geomorphic and transport processes influence completeness.\nHere we use a suite of reduced complexity numerical models of a delta to investigate what degree of realism in representation of surface processes is required to match measured completeness-timescale relationships in real systems. Target data is drawn from experimental deltas, where input variables are known and well constrained. We explore the extent to which surface processes – in particular, expressed as the spatial restriction of and correlation between loci of erosion and deposition on the delta top and front – control completeness, independent of the forcing parameters of sediment input and base level. We illustrate the importance of data resolution in controlling measured completeness, and demonstrate that these resolution effects can combine with trends driven by process localization on the delta top. We discuss the extent to which these two effects can or cannot be distinguished in real data. We argue that signals of localized erosion on the delta top and localized deposition on the delta front are key drivers of completeness-timescale trends, even for simple Gilbert-style deltas under elementary experimental boundary conditions.",

Sensitivity of data sampling and fuzzy linear discriminant analysis are discussed. Although fuzzy K-mean may not improve current retrieval algorithm, it could help us to better understand which parameters are key for atmospheric feature discriminations and which drive the ambiguous classifications. Fuzzy clustering could be further used for the classification of atmospheric features with combined A-Train observations in the future and could be a guide for the design of better new instruments.",

            "abstract": "In June and July 2015 an intensive flight campaign was conducted over the south west of France to test the sensitivity of Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) to the geophysical parameters of continental surfaces. Namely, the parameters of interest were soil moisture, soil roughness, plant water content, forest biomass and level of inland water bodies and rivers. We used the GLORI polarimetric GNSS-R instrument, collecting raw 10MSPS 2-bit IQ direct (RHCP, zenith) and reflected (RHCP and LHCP, nadir) signals at GPS L1 frequency aboard the ATR-42 aircraft of the SAFIRE fleet. Simultaneous measurement of aircraft attitude and position were recorded. The flight plan included flyovers of several areas of interests, with collocated ground truth measurements of soil moisture, soil roughness, cultivated biomass, and forest biomass. Also flyovers of ponds, lakes and river were included for power calibration and altimetry retrievals. In total, 6 flights were performed between June 19th and July 6th, representing more than 15 hours of raw data. A conventional GNSS-R processing of the data was performed in order to compute the direct and reflected complex waveforms. A preliminary data analysis based on the variations of the ratio of reflected maximum correlation amplitude in the LHCP antenna to direct maximum correlated amplitude shows measurements sensitivity to soil type, land use and incidence angle. Also, first altimetric retrievals using phase-delay techniques shows very promising results over calm waters. Current work is ongoing in order to fit the observed polarimetric measurements with innovative bistatic scattering models capable of taking into account complex geometries and land use configurations.",

For very large events (Mw > 8 or so), magnitude and location alone are sufficient to warrant an alert. However, for events of smaller magnitude (e.g., Mw ~ 7.5), particularly for so-called \"tsunami earthquakes\", magnitude alone is insufficient to issue an alert and other measurements must be rapidly made and used to assess tsunamigenic potential.\nThe Tsunami Information technology Modernization (TIM) is a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) project to update and standardize the earthquake and tsunami monitoring systems currently employed at the U.S. Tsunami Warning Centers in Ewa Beach, Hawaii (PTWC) and Palmer, Alaska (NTWC). We (ISTI) are responsible for implementing the seismic monitoring components in this new system, including real-time seismic data collection and seismic processing. The seismic data processor includes a variety of methods aimed at real-time discrimination of tsunamigenic events, including: Mwp, Me, slowness (Theta), W-phase, mantle magnitude (Mm), array processing and finite-fault inversion. In addition, it contains the ability to designate earthquake scenarios and play the resulting synthetic seismograms through the processing system. Thus, it is also a convenient tool that integrates research and monitoring and may be used to calibrate and tune the real-time monitoring system.\nHere we show results of the automated processing system for a large dataset of subduction zone earthquakes containing recent tsunami earthquakes and we examine the accuracy of the various discrimation methods and discuss issues related to their successful real-time application.",

            "abstract": "Though coastal wetlands occupy a small fraction of the Earth’s surface, they are extremely active ecosystems and play a significant role in the global carbon budget. However, coastal wetlands are still poorly understood, especially when compared to open-ocean and terrestrial ecosystems. This is partly due to the limited in situ observations in these areas. One of the ways around the limited in situ data is to use remote sensing products. Here we present the first evaluation of the MOD17 remote sensing algorithm of gross primary productivity (GPP) in a mangrove forest using data from a flux tower in the Florida Everglades. MOD17 utilizes remote sensing products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer and meteorological fields from the NCEP/DOE Reanalysis 2. MOD17 is found to capture the long-term mean and seasonal amplitude of GPP but has significant errors describing the interannual variability, intramonthly variability, and the phasing of the annual cycle in GPP. Regarding the latter, MOD17 overestimates GPP when salinity is high and underestimates it when it is low, consistent with the fact that MOD17 ignores salinity and salinity tends to decrease GPP. Including salinity in the algorithm would then most likely improve its accuracy. MOD17 also assumes that GPP is linear with respect to PAR (photosynthetically active radiation), which does not hold true in the mangroves. Finally, the estimated PAR and air temperature inputs to MOD17 were found to be significantly lower than observed. In summary, while MOD17 captures some aspects of GPP variability at this mangrove site, it appears to be doing so for the wrong reasons.",

As 67P is not a particularly active comet, coma densities have mainly been too low to efficiently cool the electrons emitted by ionization of neutrals, keeping the electron temperature well into the eV range and driving the spacecraft to a potential often below -10 V. The plasma density has evolved from tens of cm-3 at the early stage to hundreds and thousands of cm-3 during the approach to perihelion. In addition to the large scale structures and slow evolution, the data also show a multitude of transient features of which we will also provide some examples.",

            "abstract": "Active Data Archive Product Tracking (ADAPT) is a collection of software routines that permits one to generate XML metadata files to describe and register data products in support of the NASA Heliophysics Virtual Observatory VxO effort. ADAPT is also a philosophy. The ADAPT concept is to use any and all available metadata associated with scientific data to produce XML metadata descriptions in a consistent, uniform, and organized fashion to provide blanket access to the full complement of data stored on a targeted data server. In this poster, we present an application of ADAPT to describe all of the data products that are stored by using the Common Data File (CDF) format served out by the CDAWEB and SPDF data servers hosted at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. These data servers are the primary repositories for NASA Heliophysics data. For this purpose, the ADAPT routines have been used to generate data resource descriptions by using an XML schema named Space Physics Archive, Search, and Extract (SPASE). SPASE is the designated standard for documenting Heliophysics data products, as adopted by the Heliophysics Data and Model Consortium. The set of SPASE XML resource descriptions produced by ADAPT includes high-level descriptions of numerical data products, display data products, or catalogs and also includes low-level \"Granule\" descriptions. A SPASE Granule is effectively a universal access metadata resource; a Granule associates an individual data file (e.g. a CDF file) with a “parent” high-level data resource description, assigns a resource identifier to the file, and lists the corresponding assess URL(s). The CDAWEB and SPDF file systems were queried to provide the input required by the ADAPT software to create an initial set of SPASE metadata resource descriptions. Then, the CDAWEB and SPDF data repositories were queried subsequently on a nightly basis and the CDF file lists were checked for any changes such as the occurrence of new, modified, or deleted files, or the addition of new or the deletion of old data products. Next, ADAPT routines analyzed the query results and issued updates to the metadata stored in the UCLA CDAWEB and SPDF metadata registries. In this way, the SPASE metadata registries generated by ADAPT can be relied on to provide up to date and complete access to Heliophysics CDF data resources on a daily basis.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater outflows into headwater streams play an important role in controlling local stream temperature and maintaining habitat for cool and cold water fisheries. Because of the ecological and economic importance of these fisheries, there is significant concern about the impacts of climate change on these habitats. Many studies of stream temperature changes under climate change assume that groundwater outflows will vary with long-term mean air temperature, perhaps with a temporal lag to account for the relatively slow rate of heat diffusion through soils.\nThis assumption, however, ignores the fact that climate change will also impact the temporal patterns of recharge in some regions. In Southern Wisconsin, much of the annual recharge comes from the spring snowmelt event, as a large amount of meltwater is released onto saturated soils with little to no active transpiration. Using the Simultaneous Heat and Water (SHAW) model populated with climate date from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP), we show that the temperature of water passing below the rooting zone in a simulated corn planting in Southern Wisconsin will change significantly less than the air temperature by midcentury.\nThis finding highlights the importance of understanding the variability of heat flow mechanisms in the subsurface while assessing climate change impacts on surface water resources. In landscapes such as Wisconsin’s driftless area, where deep aquifers feed numerous localized headwater streams, meltwater-driven recharge may provide a buffer against rising air temperatures for some time into the future. Fully understanding this dynamic will allow for targeted conservation efforts in those streams that are likely to show higher than average resilience to rising temperatures, but which remain vulnerable to development, stormwater runoff, agricultural pollution and other ecological threats. In a world with dwindling coldwater resources, identifying and protecting streams that can serve as ecological refuges is paramount in preserving biological diversity.",

This includes both the sensor itself, as well as any onboard radiometric calibration systems. Typical methods include ground-based in situ measurements, cross calibration, lunar observations, and pseudo-invariant sites. The Remote Sensing Group at the University of Arizona has traditionally used the reflectance-based approach for the in-flight calibration of Earth-observing sensors. This requires personnel to be at a test site for a given overpass, and the increasing number of satellites on orbit make it difficult and expensive to deploy teams to collect field data. In response to this, an automated site has been developed to collect data during all clear-sky conditions. The Radiometric Calibration Test Site (RadCaTS) is located at Railroad Valley, Nevada, and it is currently being used to calibrate and validate the surface reflectance products of such sensors as Landsat 7 ETM+, Landsat 8 OLI, Terra and Aqua MODIS, Suomi NPP VIIRS, the RapidEye constellation of satellites, and more recently, Sentinel-2A MSI. An effort is also underway to create a network of instrumented test sites, and RadCaTS is currently one of four sites used in the Radiometric Calibration Network (RadCalNet) working group. This work presents the evolution of RadCaTS, current vicarious calibration results, and insight into the efforts to create a global network of instrumented sites.",

Drawdown contour maps provide us with a tool to evaluate anisotropy and help predict the spatial variation in expected level of water so that better strategies for utilizing groundwater resources can be developed. The magnitude of drawdown depths are also important for understanding many other site-specific issues such as, probability of capturing undesirable elements in extracted water. A two-dimensional discrete fracture network (DFN) simulation provides the basis for investigating how complex patterns of connectivity and variations in fracture attributes produces irregular patterns of drawdown when fractured rock aquifers are subjected to pumping and climatic perturbations. The pattern and expanse of drawdown maps are found to be highly sensitive to multi-scale heterogeneity in the network arising from the geometric configuration of interconnected, discontinuous fractures of varying length scales, orientation, transmissivity and local density.",

The device performs in situ pressure calibrations every 10 days by applying a time-invariant reference pressure from a piston gauge (also known as a deadweight calibrator) to continuously recording quartz pressure gauges through a hydraulic valve. The reference pressure measurements are then used to estimate and correct for the inherent drift in the quartz resonant seafloor pressure gauges. Pressure data are collected at 100 s integration intervals. A small subset of a year-long data set was recovered via an acoustic modem in August 2014. Using three epoch measurements, the pressure rate of change from September 2013 to August 2014 was -4.1 to -4.2 kPa/year, equivalent to uplift of 41- 42 cm/year. Other pressure time series and micro-bathymetric repeat surveys are in rough agreement with this SCPR rate. The instrument is scheduled for recovery in August 2015; the anticipated data collection interval spans the eruption on April 24, 2015. We present the drift-corrected pressure series and constraints estimated for magma supply rates during the inflation, eruption, and post-eruptive phases.",

            "abstract": "River bedforms represent the unstable interface between fluid flow and the granular channel bed, and these features play an important role for modifying flow resistance and sediment transport rates, and thus influencing river morphology. Although widely observed in natural rivers, bedforms are difficult to measure quantitatively and are rarely connected to other fluvial morphological processes. This study presents high-resolution channel bathymetric data from the tidally influenced, lowermost Yellow River, China, collected using a multibeam swath profiler. Repeat surveys were conducted over rising and flood discharge conditions, which is the first such kind of survey in Yellow River. The bathymetry data show that for all water discharges, a flat bed, devoid of a thalweg or dunes, persists within straight-reach segments near the bends of the Yellow River, despite the bed consisting of fine sand. Interestingly, in bend segments, the channel deepens, and linear dunes develop. Moreover, as the water discharge increases over time, the edge of dune field contained in the bend segments propagates into the adjacent upstream and downstream straight-reach segments. In contrasting case study, Nittrouer et al. (2008) reported persistent dune field in the straight reaches of the tidally influenced Mississippi River; however these dunes disappear in neighboring river bends. Based on the two cases of the Yellow and Mississippi Rivers, which have fundamentally different conditions of water-to-sediment discharge ratios, the threshold condition of bedform formation and stability are evaluated, and connected to local conditions of river bend morphology. This work improves the understanding of the co-evolution of bedforms and flow conditions in river bends, which are intertwined and important morphological processes that affect fluvial-deltaic sediment transport dynamics. In addition, the straight-bend structure is a basic element of river morphology, and so the results of this study are extendable to other lowland, meandering river systems.",

            "abstract": "The Early to mid-Miocene is a compelling interval to study Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) sensitivity. Circulation patterns in the southern hemisphere were broadly similar to present and reconstructed atmospheric CO2 concentrations were analogous to those projected for the next several decades. Geologic records from locations proximal to the AIS are required to examine ice sheet response to climate variability during this time. Coastal and offshore drill core records recovered by ANDRILL and IODP provide information regarding ice sheet variability along and beyond the coastal margin but they cannot constrain the extent of inland retreat. Additional environmental data from the continental interior is required to constrain the magnitude of ice sheet variability and inform numerical ice sheet models. The only well-dated terrestrial deposits that register early to mid-Miocene interior ice extent and climate are in the Friis Hills, 80 km inland. The deposits record multiple glacial-interglacial cycles and fossiliferous non-glacial beds show that interglacial climate was warm enough for a diverse biota. Drifts are preserved in a shallow valley with the oldest beds exposed along the edges where they terminate at sharp erosional margins. These margins reveal drifts in short stratigraphic sections but none is more than 13 m thick. A 34 m-thick composite stratigraphic sequence has been produced from exposed drift sequences but correlating beds in scattered exposures is problematic. Moreover, much of the sequence is buried and inaccessible in the basin center. New seismic data collected during 2014 reveal a sequence of sediments at least 50 m thick. This stratigraphic package likely preserves a detailed and more complete sedimentary sequence for the Friis Hills that can be used to refine and augment the outcrop-based composite stratigraphy. We aim to drill through this sequence using a helicopter-transportable diamond coring system. These new cores will allow us to obtain continuous measurements on unweathered material through the terrestrial sequence. Beds of tephra are exposed in outcrop and we expect to encounter these key age markers in the cored sequence. These new high quality, well-dated terrestrial data will be directly compared to marine cores to provide environmental data across a broad onshore-offshore transect.",

            "abstract": "Methane gas is formed within the sediments of accretionary prisms by the biological and thermal degradation of organic matter. Some of this methane is trapped as solid-phase methane hydrate, the stability of which is temperature and pressure-dependent. Past fluctuations in global temperatures have resulted in the decomposition of continental margin gas hydrate reservoirs and subsequent emissions of methane, creating a positive feedback to global warming with additional impacts on the marine environment. Temperature data collected over the past four decades show that bottom water on the upper slope of the Washington State continental margin has undergone systematic warming. Thermal models of this heat propagation into the sediments indicate a 40 meter deepening of the methane hydrate stability depth (MHDS) that if correct, would suggest a preferential release of methane into the water column from these depths on the Cascadia margin.\nLocation data for over 100 active methane seeps on the Cascadia margin were compiled from a variety of sources including research cruises, published literature, and local fishermen. Emission site locations show anomalous plume densities at depths associated with the MHDS, which lies at approximately 500 meters water depth in the NE Pacific. This supports the hypothesis that warming of seawater at intermediate depths due to contemporary climate change has begun to destabilize the Cascadia margin gas hydrate reservoir. While relatively small sample size and incomplete coverage due to the ad-hoc nature of data acquisition limit confidence in any conclusions drawn from this dataset, this study provides a framework for future analysis of methane plume distributions and supports the need for a comprehensive and systematic geophysical and geochemical examination of the Cascadia margin.",

            "abstract": "Over the last 20 years, we have seen the evolution of multicomponent reactive transport modeling and the expanding range and increasing complexity of subsurface environmental applications it is being used to address. Reactive transport modeling is being asked to provide accurate assessments of engineering performance and risk for important issues with far-reaching consequences. As a result, the complexity and detail of subsurface processes, properties, and conditions that can be simulated have significantly expanded. Closed form solutions are necessary and useful, but limited to situations that are far simpler than typical applications that combine many physical and chemical processes, in many cases in coupled form. In the absence of closed form and yet realistic solutions for complex applications, numerical benchmark problems with an accepted set of results will be indispensable to qualifying codes for various environmental applications. The intent of this benchmarking exercise, now underway for more than five years, is to develop and publish a set of well-described benchmark problems that can be used to demonstrate simulator conformance with norms established by the subsurface science and engineering community. The objective is not to verify this or that specific code--the reactive transport codes play a supporting role in this regard—but rather to use the codes to verify that a common solution of the problem can be achieved. Thus, the objective of each of the manuscripts is to present an environmentally-relevant benchmark problem that tests the conceptual model capabilities, numerical implementation, process coupling, and accuracy. The benchmark problems developed to date include 1) microbially-mediated reactions, 2) isotopes, 3) multi-component diffusion, 4) uranium fate and transport, 5) metal mobility in mining affected systems, and 6) waste repositories and related aspects.",

It is a clean burning fuel with lower emissions than that of coal or oil. Studies show that methane (CH4) leaks from natural gas infrastructure vary widely. A broader question is whether leak rates of methane might offset the benefits of combustion of natural gas. Excess methane (CH4) is a major greenhouse gas with a radiative forcing constant of 25 times that of CO2 when projected over a 100-year period.   An extensive field study of 250 wells in the Marcellus Shale conducted in July 2015 examined the emission rates of this region and identifed super-emitters. Spud production data will provide information as to whether older infrastructure is responsible for more of the emissions. Quantifying the emission rate was determined by extrapolating methane releases at a distance from private well pads using an inverse Gaussian plume model. Wells studied were selected by prevailing winds, distance from public roads, and topographical information using commercial (ARCGIS and Google Earth), non-profit (drillinginfo), and government (State of PA) databases. Data were collected from the mobile sensing lab (CH4, CO2 and H2O sensors), as well as from a stationary tower. Emission rates from well pads will be compared to their original production (spud dates) to evaluate whether infrastructure age and total production correlates with the observed leak rates. Very preliminary results show no statistical correlation between well pad production rates and observed leak rates.",

We present an overview of the evolution of sediment routing on this margin from integration of seismic images, updated age models and core-log-seismic correlations from IODP Expedition 341 drilling sites, and mapping efforts from shelf, slope, and fan. We focus on the three dominant glacial systems during the climatically important intensification of Northern Hemisphere glaciation at the Plio-Pleistocene transition and the further intensification of glaciation since the mid-Pleistocene transition. Along strike, sediment delivery to deepwater from the three glacial systems varied according to Pleistocene shelf accommodation space. The Alsek crossed a narrower shelf with a bedrock high near the shelf edge; the Malaspina-Hubbard system crossed an undeformed, ~1 km deep shelf; the Bering-Bagley system crossed a several km deep shelf deforming as an active fold and thrust belt. The Malaspina and Bering catchments exhibit high exhumation rates onshore due to the Yakutat collision and upon reaching the shelf edge these glaciers generate trough mouth fans (TMFs) on the adjacent continental slope but only after first filling the available accommodation with glacigenic sediment and lowering the slope gradient through progradation. The Alsek crosses the shelf earliest but never with sufficient sediment flux to generate a TMF. An east-west transition in adjacent deepwater submarine channels that feed and generate the Surveyor Fan suggests that shelf accommodation and sediment flux are primary controls on sediment routing from orogen to submarine fan. Both of these parameters are in turn a function of initial tectonic architecture and ongoing orogen dynamics.",

One of the last TWG in the area to retreat from its Little Ice Age (LIA) moraine, Columbia has lost about half its ice volume as its terminus receded 22 km behind the LIA maximum position. At this time the glacier has split into two branches, with termini thought to be located near the heads of the submarine parts of the fjord, and may be nearing the end of its retreat phase. Seasonal variations in speed near the termini on both branches are large (~90%), with late summer speeds as low as a few meters per day. We deployed a terrestrial radar interferometer in October 2014 to observe short-term variations in speed during the slowest part of the seasonal cycle. Initial observations showed very slow speeds, with both termini exhibiting strong tidal modulation; however, significant rainfall from Tropical Storm Phanfone produced pronounced accelerations. We measured strong responses along both branches, with the largest increase (300%) occurring a few kilometers behind the calving fronts and lasted for several days. The large responses of the glacier’s termini to this precipitation event, to tidal variations, and also the large seasonal variations in speed, suggest that Columbia’s termini are not strongly grounded, are subject to large variations in sliding over short time periods, and may not yet have reached a more stable configuration in their retreats. The stability of Columbia’s termini, based on our observations and bed models that suggest that a deep bed continues upfjord of the calving fronts for several kilometers, imply that Columbia’s >30 year retreat may still be ongoing.",

            "abstract": "Large areas within the dune fields that mantle the equatorial regions of Saturn's moon, Titan appear to be sand availability-limited. These areas occur at dune field margins and in the inferred lee-side of topographic obstacles within the dune fields. Viewed with Cassini radar, these areas are lighter-toned than radar dark dunes, which implies radar scattering off of a rough surface. Otherwise, these areas have no geomorphologic structure visible at the spatial resolution of the Cassini radar. Within dune environments rough, sediment-availability limited surfaces can occur as pebble or cobble lag, surface crusts, evaporite polygons, dessication cracks and dune-cross-stratification. This study aims to better understand radar-response to a range of sediment availability-limited surfaces in dune environments using terrestrial spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) acquisitions. We primarily target playas and interdune-areas in western North America, southern Africa and the Middle East. As a means for multi-temporal comparison between satellite platform acquisitions, the SAR backscatter coefficient, σ0, has been used as a measure of the radar return intensity (brightness) and the surface roughness. SAR systems measure the ratio between the power of the pulse transmitted and that of the echo received as projected into the slant-range geometry. Geometric and radiometric calibration of the backscatter values are necessary for inter-comparison of radar images acquired with different sensors, or even of images obtained by the same sensor if acquired in different modes and look geometries. In light of this, this investigation has considered and fused a number of SAR datasets from SRTM SIR-C/X-SAR, ERS-1/2, Envisat, and Radarsat as a means for spatial and temporal variation of σ0. Preliminary statistical analysis of the backscatter coefficient shows decadal and seasonal trends in the variation of surface roughness over the temporal range of the data sets. Further, differences in the backscatter coefficient depend strongly on the geomorphic setting, such as between playas, interdune areas and dunes. Determining spatial and temporal variability in sediment availability-limited areas on Earth can provide insight into the availability-limited regions within Titan’s equatorial dune fields.",

            "abstract": "Time-dependent rock failure is an important aspect in the analysis of long-term rock stability for slopes, dam and bridge foundations, and underground storage facilities. An on-going project at the University of Arizona is using Kartchner Caverns in Benson, Arizona as a natural analog to study such failure by reconstructing the process of natural cave breakdown with subcritical crack growth modeling. Breakdown is thought to occur along joints through the time-dependent failure of rock bridges: sections of intact rock separating discontinuities in a rock mass. The Escabrosa limestone composing the caverns ranges from a more homogenous, even-grained texture to a more heterogeneous texture consisting of coarse-grained veins and solution cavities set in a fine-grained matrix. To determine if the veined regions are more susceptible to fracturing and act as the nuclei of rock bridge failure, fracture toughness tests were conducted for both textures. The subcritical crack growth parameters were calculated using the constant stress-rate method. Results indicate that the more heterogeneous limestone has a higher fracture strength, fracture toughness, and subcritical crack growth index n than the more homogeneous limestone. This is in agreement with previous studies which found that a more complex and heterogeneous microstructure produces a larger microcrack process zone, leading to higher fracture energies and lower susceptibility to subcritical crack growth. Thus, despite their solution cavities, the calcite veins do not localize failure or act as planes of weakness; instead, rock bridges fail through the more homogeneous limestone matrix.",

            "abstract": "The increased horizontal resolution of climate models aims to improve the simulations accuracy and to understand the non-linear processes during interactions between different spatial scales within the climate system. Up to this moment, these interactions did not have a good representation on low horizontal resolution GCMs. The variations of extreme climatic events had been described and analyzed in the scientific literature. In a scenario of global warming it is necessary understanding and explaining extreme events and to know if global models may represent these events. The purpose of this study was to understand the impact of the horizontal resolution in high resolution coupled and atmospheric global models of HiGEM project in simulating atmospheric patterns and processes of interaction between spatial scales. Moreover, evaluate the performance of coupled and uncoupled versions of the High-Resolution Global Environmental Model in capturing the signal of interannual and intraseasonal variability of precipitation over Amazon region. The results indicated that the grid refinement and ocean-atmosphere coupling contributes to a better representation of seasonal patterns, both precipitation and temperature, on the Amazon region. Besides, the climatic models analyzed represent better than other models (regional and global) the climatic characteristics of this region. This indicates a breakthrough in the development of high resolution climate models. Both coupled and uncoupled models capture the observed signal of the ENSO and MJO oscillations, although with reversed phase in some cases. The interannual variability analysis showed that coupled simulations intensify the impact of the ENSO in the Amazon. In the intraseasonal scale, although the simulations intensify this signal, the coupled models present larger similarities with observations than the atmospheric models for the extremes of precipitation. The simulation of ENSO in GCMs can be attributed to their high resolution, mainly in the oceanic component, which contributes to the better solution of the small scale vortices in the ocean. This implies in improvements in the forecasting of sea surface temperature (SST) and as consequence in the ability of atmosphere to respond to this feature.",

To fully understand the mechanism of bedload transport, it is critical to know the motion characteristics and the interaction between bedload particles and turbulent structures. However, the motion of bedload particles can rarely be measured accurately because of experimental difficulties. In this work, a model of bedload transport in open channel flows is built by combining large eddy simulation (LES) with discrete element model (DEM) using a momentum coupling method. For the particles, a four-way coupling approach is utilized. Numerical experiments are conducted and post processed by statistic and quadrant threshold analysis. The characteristics of the kinematics and dynamics of the bedload particles are of particular interest during the analysis. The particle trajectory, velocity distribution and force condition are processed for further analysis. The model is validated by flow field and bedload transport rate data. The model produces an exponential form of the velocity statistics, which have been confirmed by experiments in the literature. The quadrant analysis also reveals rich information about the interaction between the particle and the flow. Among many things, it is found that the ejection events are influenced more than the sweep event. It is because the sweep event is more controlled by the outer flow. The size of the near wall coherent structure is smaller and their occurrence is less frequent when the particles are in motion.",

Visual pattern recognition is the bridge between human intuition and understanding, and the quantitative content of the data and the relationships present there (correlations, outliers, clustering, etc.). We are developing a novel platform for visualization of complex, multi-dimensional data, using immersive virtual reality (VR), that leverages the recent rapid developments in the availability of commodity hardware and development software. VR immersion has been shown to significantly increase the effective visual perception and intuition, compared to the traditional flat-screen tools. This allows to more easily perceive higher dimensional spaces, with an advantage for a visual exploration of complex data compared to the traditional visualization methods. Immersive VR also offers a natural way for a collaborative visual exploration of data, with multiple users interacting with each other and with their data in the same perceptive data space.",

            "abstract": "Documenting glaciers that exhibit surge type behavior is crucial, especially as we attempt to use evidence of ice front fluctuations for reconstructing past climate oscillations. Controversy exists regarding the relationship between surge activity and climatic processes such as mass balance. This project identifies undocumented surge type glaciers in Svalbard based on the presence of crevasse fill ridges (CFRs) visible in glacier forelands. Although it is acknowledged that many Svalbard outlet glaciers surge, estimates vary greatly as to the actual number of surge- type glaciers in Svalbard, and their distribution pattern is not well understood. A detailed survey of recent (2008-2011), high resolution imagery from Toposvalbard, provided by the Norwegian Polar Institute, allowed for a rapid analysis of Svalbard outlet glaciers. Using CFRs as indicators of surge behavior has almost doubled the amount of potential surge-type glaciers in central Spitsbergen. This method also highlights numerous other glaciers of potential surge type behavior throughout the archipelago. Limits to the CFR identification method are discussed. Additionally as the forelands of previously reported surge type glaciers were analyzed for CFRs, it was evident that the surge indicators were only present in approximately half of the forelands. Numerous factors control the formation and preservation of CFRs including; glacier size, bedrock lithology, subglacial sediments and clast size as well as glacial fluvial run-off. This poster focuses on the controlling factors for CFR formation and preservation as well as other potential methods for effectively identifying surge behavior.",

            "abstract": "Rivers cover only a small part of the Earth`s surface, yet they transfer sediment in globally significant quantities. In mountainous regions, the majority of the total channel length occurs in headwater streams. Those mountain channels are influenced in terms of sediment connectivity by processes on the slopes. For example in such a sediment routing system, sediment originating from debris flows on the slopes is delivered along sediment pathways to the channel system and can be transported further downstream as solid load. Interruption of instream coarse sediment connectivity is closely related to the existence of channel blocking barriers which also can be formed by biota. By storing sediment large wood (LW) log jams disrupt in-channel sediment connectivity. We present a study design in order to decipher the short to long term effects (c. 10-2-102 years) of sediment (dis)connectivity effects of large wood. The study areas are two basins in mountain ranges in Germany and Austria. In Austria the drainage area of the river Fugnitz was chosen which is located in the National Park Thayatal. The other drainage area of the river Sieber in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, is located in the Harz National Park.\nSince studies on LW and its geomorphological effects in Central European rivers are still rare the main goals of the project are:\n•to identify important triggers for LW transport from slopes into the channels\n•to examine the spatial distribution and characterization of LW in main and slope channels by mapping and dGPS measurements\n•to determine the effects of LW on channel hydraulic parameters (e.g. slope, width, grains size composition, roughness) by field measurements of channel long profiles and cross section with dGPS and Wolman particle counts\n•to quantify the direct effects of LW on discharge and bed load transport by measuring flow velocity with an Ott-Nautilus current meter and to measure bed load up- and downstream of log jams using a portable Helley-Smith bed load sampler\n•to quantify the sediment volume stored by LW and monitoring of those accumulations using terrestrial laserscanning or structure from motion\n•to quantify the in-channel stored and deposited LW and to date at least the key logs by dendrochronology in order to get information on the maximum longevity of sediment storage\nLarge wood in the Fugnitz River:",

            "abstract": "In 2007, high mercury (Hg) concentrations were measured in various waterfowl species residing at the Great Salt Lake (GSL), Utah. During this time high monomethylmercury (MMHg, the toxic bioaccumulative form of Hg) concentrations were also determined in the anoxic deep brine layer (DBL) of the GSL, ranging from 0.8 to >30 ng-L-1. The DBL is therefore suspected as a source of MMHg to the surrounding ecosystem; however, the pathways by which MMHg is able to propagate from the DBL upward into the higher trophic levels of the GSL ecosystem is unknown. The DBL has recently retreated from the southernmost basin of the GSL following the closure of culverts in the causeway separating the north and south arms of the lake. Anoxic, reductive conditions and high dissolved organic matter (DOM) content in the DBL allow the persistence of MMHg, thus the retreat of the DBL could affect total mercury (THg) and MMHg concentrations in brine and sediment, as well as the Hg burdens in invertebrates and waterfowl. Because the extent of the DBL depends on flux of north arm brine through causeway openings, this temporary closing of flow provides a unique opportunity to monitor the response of Hg concentrations in the DBL, sediment, and biota during this transient. Waterfowl and invertebrate tissues, plant, sediment, and brine samples were collected before and after the culvert closure. Biota and sediment samples were digested, and all samples were analyzed using cold vapor adsorption atomic fluorescence spectroscopy (CVAFS). The samples from pre- and post-closure will be compared and described in order to deduce the role of the DBL as a potential reservoir of MMHg in the GSL.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Kayla_AGUPoster_2015_v4.pdf\nSince the 1940s, the High Plains Aquifer (HPA) has been pivotal for irrigation over the Central High Plains (CHP), a region spanning parts of five states in the central U.S.. Today after decades of over-pumping, many areas of the CHP are no longer able to irrigate due to localized depletion of the HPA. With a range of global climate models predicting an increase in temperature and decrease in growing-season precipitation for the CHP, demand for irrigation is likely to increase and exacerbate drawdown and depletion of the aquifer. Here we apply the Landscape Hydrology Model (LHM) coupled with the crop simulation model SALUS to simulate irrigation water use in response to historical climate and land use. This model is validated using historical groundwater levels. We then simulate future climate scenarios to predict how irrigation demand and water availability will alter the hydrology of the CHP. This study provides a predictive relationship of future irrigation demand linked to both climate change and agricultural management, and presents a modeling approach to answer two questions: How will future climate change affect irrigation demand? How will climate change and irrigation demand affect groundwater availability for the future? Different climate scenarios based on the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) are used to simulate the impact of different projected future climate conditions through the year 2100. By examining predicted groundwater levels along with saturated thickness we analyze where irrigation is likely to be viable in the future and compare this to current irrigation extent.",

HS3 is a multiyear campaign aimed at helping scientists understand the physical processes that contribute to hurricane intensification. For in-depth analysis, HS3 encompasses not only airborne data but also variety of in-situ, satellite, simulation, and flight report data. Thus, HS3 provides a unique challenge in information system design. The GHRC team is experienced with previous airborne campaigns to handle such challenge.\nMany supplementary information and reports collected during the mission include information rich contents that provide mission snapshots. In particular, flight information, instrument status, weather reports, and summary statistics offer vital knowledge about the corresponding science data. Furthermore, such information help narrow the science data of interest. Therefore, the GHRC team is building HS3 information system that augments the current GHRC data management framework to support search and discover of airborne science data with interactive visual exploration. Specifically, the HS3 information system is developing a tool to visually playback mission flights along with other traditional search and discover interfaces. This playback capability allows the users to follow the flight in time and visualize collected data. The flight summary and analyzed information are also presented during the playback. If the observed data is of interest, then they can order the data from GHRC using the interface. The users will be able to order just the data for the part of the flight that they are interested in. This presentation will demonstrate use of visual exploration to data download along with other components that comprise the HS3 information system.",

It is the Third Pole and the World Water Tower, owing to its vast ice reservoir with the largest number of glaciers in the world, and covered by a large (1.3 to 1.6 million km2) layer of discontinuous and sporadic alpine permafrost. The thawing over Tibetan Plateau permafrost regions is thought to be more severe compared with other high latitude permafrost regions by the fact that the permafrost is warm. During the past few decades, 82% of Tibetan Plateau glaciers have retreated and 10% permafrost has degraded. The overall mean active layer depth (ALD) rate increase over the Plateau is 1.4 cm yr–1, 1980–2001, based on model studies and comparison with in situ borehole data.

The tower supports meteorological instruments at three different heights (2, 26, and 37 meters) and two air sampling inlets located above the canopy. The inlets draw air samples into a climate-controlled shed where precursor gas concentrations (ozone, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides) are determined by gas analyzers. Aerosol size distributions between 10 and 470 nm were measured by a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), and between 0.3 and 10 μm by an Optical Particle Sizer (OPS) every three minutes. For this study, aerosol size distributions from July 2014 through August 2015 were analyzed along with HYSPLIT backwards trajectories, meteorological measurements, and gas concentrations to investigate controls on new particle formation (NPF). Results indicate a strong dependence of NPF occurrence on parent air mass, with higher probabilities of occurrence in air masses with low relative humidity and abundant insolation. Proxy sulfuric acid concentration and ozone concentration also varied significantly between NPF event types.",

            "abstract": "Injection of large volumes of CO2 into geologic formations can help reduce the atmospheric CO2 concentration and lower the impact of burning fossil fuels. However, the injection of CO2 into the subsurface shifts the chemical equilibrium between the mineral assemblage and the pore fluid. This shift will situationally facilitate dissolution and reprecipitation of mineral phases, in particular intergranular cements, and can potentially affect the long term mechanical stability of the host formation. The study of these coupled chemical-mechanical reservoir rock responses can help identify and control unexpected emergent behavior associated with geological CO2 storage.\nExperiments show that micro-mechanical methods are useful in capturing a variety of mechanical parameters, including Young’s modulus, hardness and fracture toughness. In particular, micro-mechanical measurements are well-suited for examining thin altered layers on the surfaces of rock specimens, as well as capturing variability on the scale of lithofacies.\nWe performed indentation and scratching tests on sandstone and siltstone rocks altered in natural CO2-brine environments, as well as on analogous samples altered under high pressure, temperature, and dissolved CO2 conditions in a controlled laboratory experiment. We performed geochemical modeling to support the experimental observations, in particular to gain the insight into mineral dissolution/precipitation as a result of the rock-water-CO2reactions.\nThe comparison of scratch measurements performed on specimens both unaltered and altered by CO2 over geologic time scales results in statistically different values for fracture toughness and scratch hardness, indicating that long term exposure to CO2 caused mechanical degradation of the reservoir rock. Geochemical modeling indicates that major geochemical change caused by CO2 invasion of Entrada sandstone is dissolution of hematite cement, and its replacement with siderite and dolomite during the alteration process.",

Although this increase in SOC turnover rate due to priming might have important consequences for SOC dynamics, there are large uncertainties in the sign and magnitude of priming, as well as large challenges in identifying underlying mechanisms. Current SOC models, mostly based on first-order decomposition representations, do no represent many important biotic and abiotic processes, including the priming effect. The incorporation of explicit biotic and abiotic interactions in modeling SOC decomposition may improve our ability to accurately predict SOC dynamics.\nIn this study, we (1) develop a microbe-explicit SOC decomposition model to simulate SOC turnovers and priming and (2) test the model with a soil incubation experiment with 14C-labeled glucose addition. We report (1) the evolutions of modeled carbon pools, (2) the fate of 14C labeled glucose addition, (3) the model performance compared to observations, (4) the transient behavior of priming components, and (5) an analysis of the effects of carbon input magnitudes and frequencies on the priming effect.\nHere are some findings from our model-experiment analyses: (1) the inclusion of an extracellular oxidative metabolism (EXOMET) in addition to intracellular microbial respiration helps improve the model performance; (2) priming is dominated by intracellular microbial respiration at the beginning of incubation (~ first 5 days) but later on dominated by EXOMET, which explains observed long-term sustaining priming; (3) the varying magnitudes of glucose addition do not change the magnitude of priming per unit addition; (4) the varying frequencies of glucose addition change the magnitude of priming per unit addition, but with contrast changing patterns for non-steady-state and steady state simulations; (5) constant annual total glucose addition shift the system to another steady state (saturated priming), while rising annual addition supports a long-term sustaining priming; (6) priming per unit glucose addition in non-steady-state simulations is much larger than that in steady-state simulations.",

            "abstract": "The role of magmatism in continental rupturing and in the birth of a new ocean is not well understood. Continental rupture can take place with intense and voluminous volcanism, as in the Southern Red Sea or in a relatively amagmatic mode, as in the Northern Red Sea. Mantle upwelling and melting may be affected by the south to north decreasing opening rate of the Red Sea and by the influence of the Afar plume, also decreasing from south to north. The tholeiitic basalts of the Red Sea spreading system contrast with the extensive Cenozoic basaltic lava fields of the western part of the Arabian peninsula that form one of the largest alkali basalt provinces in the world. In order to establish possible relationship between the Red Sea rift evolution and the western Saudi Arabia intraplate alkali volcanism, field work was carried out on Lunayyir, Ishara, al Kura and Khaybar volcanic fields. Collected samples cover a wide range of chemical diversity (from olivine basalt to trachyte) and span over a 20 Ma interval. We attempt a comparison of the geochemistry of igneous rocks from western Arabia dykes and volcanic fields with those from the Red Sea axis and from the islands of Zabargad and Brothers in the northern Red Sea, that represent basaltic melts injected into the thinned continental crust before continental rupturing and initiation of seafloor spreading. Gabbros drilled in the western Red Sea and exposed on the Brothers islands suggest that continental break up in the northern Red Sea, a relatively non-volcanic rift, is preceded by intrusion of oceanic-type basaltic melts that crystallize at progressively shallower crustal depths as rifting progresses towards continental break-up. A seismic reflection profile running across the central part of the southern Thetis basin shows a ~5 km wide reflector that marks the roof of a magma chamber located ~3.5 km below seafloor. The presence of a few kilometers deep subrift magma chamber soon after the initiation of oceanic spreading implies the crystallization of lower oceanic crust intrusives as a last step in a sequence of basaltic melt intrusion from pre-oceanic continental rifting to oceanic spreading. Thus oceanic crust accretion in the Red Sea rift starts at depth before continental break up, emplacement of oceanic basalt at the sea floor, and development of Vine-Matthews magnetic anomalies.",

            "abstract": "The atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is the lowest part of the atmosphere that directly interacts with the planet’s surface. The development of the ABL plays a vital role, as it affects the transport of atmospheric constituents such as air pollutants, water vapor, and greenhouse gases. Measurements of the processes in the ABL have been difficult due to the limitations in the spatial and temporal resolutions of the equipment as well as the height of the traditional flux tower. Recent advances in the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and distributed temperature sensing (DTS) technologies have provided us with new tools to study the complex processes in ABL. We conducted a series of pioneering experiments in Eastern Oregon using a platform that combines UAV and DTS to collect data during morning and evening transitions in the ABL. The major components of this platform consists of a quad-copter, a DTS computer unit, and a set of customized fiber optic cables. A total of 75 flights were completed to investigate: (1) the capability of a duplexed fiber optic cable to reduce noise in the high spatial and temporal temperature measurements taken during the morning transition; (2) the possibility of using fiber optic cable as “wet bulb” thermometer to calculate relative humidity in the ABL at high spatial and temporal resolution. The preliminary results showed that using a fiber optic cable in a duplexed configuration with the UAV-DTS platform can effectively reduce noise level during the morning transition data collection. The customized “wet bulb” fiber optic cable is capable of providing information for the calculation of relative humidity in the ABL at unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions. From this study, the UAV-DTS platform demonstrated great potential in collecting temperature data in the ABL and with the development of atmospheric sensor technologies, it will have more applications in the future.",

            "abstract": "Hurricanes pose a threat to human lives and can cause significant destruction of coastal areas. This threat has become more pronounced with recent rises in sea level and coastal populations. Currently, there is a large degree of uncertainty surrounding future changes in tropical cyclone activity. This is due to the limitations of climate models as well as the scarcity and unreliability of the current observational record. With so much uncertainty surrounding the current projections of hurricane activity, it is crucial to establish a longer and more accurate historical record. This study uses sediment cores extracted from blueholes in the Bahamas to develop a record of intense hurricane landfalls in the region dating back more than a millennia. The collected cores were sectioned, split, and scanned on an X-ray fluorescence scanner to obtain a high resolution core profile of the sediments’ elemental composition and to identify potential sedimentary structures. Age control of the samples was determined using radiocarbon dating, coarse fraction was measured every centimeter, and hurricane event bed frequency was established for each core. We assess the statistical significance of the patterns observed in the sedimentary record using a coupled ocean-atmosphere hurricane model to simulate storms representative of modern climatology. Cores extracted from two blue holes near South Andros Island provide approximately a 1600 year and a 600 year record respectively, with sedimentation rates exceeding 1 cm/year. Both records contain coarse grained event deposits that correlate with known historical intense hurricane strikes in the Bahamas within age uncertainties. The 1600 year record confirms previous hurricane reconstructions from the Caribbean indicating higher tropical cyclone activity from 500 to 1400 CE. In addition, these new high-resolution records indicate elevated intense hurricane activity in the 17th and 18th centuries CE, when activity is also elevated in lower resolution records from Abaco, Bahamas and Vieques, Puerto Rico. However, records from the northeast United States and Gulf of Mexico are relatively inactive. This spatial variability in intense hurricane landfalls suggests significant regional controls on hurricane activity.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the effects of interannual to multidecadal climate variability on groundwater resources by exploring the physical processes in the vadose zone that partially control transient infiltration and recharge fluxes. The vadose zone connects climate variability modes to groundwater systems by influencing infiltration events. Infiltration events become time-varying water flux through the vadose zone and are controlled by highly nonlinear, complex interactions between mean infiltration flux, infiltration period, soil textures, and depth to water table. We focus on the behavior and damping depth of water flux in the vadose zone. The damping depth is defined as the depth that the flux variation damps to 5% of the land surface variation. When the damping depth is above the water table, recharge may be considered steady; when the damping depth is below the water table, recharge may be considered transient. Previous work shows that the damping depth is sensitive to the frequency of the infiltration pattern and the unsaturated hydraulic properties of the media. We examine controls on the damping depth by modeling transient water fluxes at the land surface using the Gardner-Kozeny soil model for diffuse unsaturated flow in HYDRUS 1-D. Results for homogeneous profiles show that shorter-period oscillations, smaller mean fluxes, and finer-grained soil textures generally produce damping depths closer to land surface. Modeling layered soil textures indicates similar, but more complicated responses in the damping depth. Model results indicate that finer-textured layers in a coarser soil profile generally result in damping depths closer to land surface, while coarser-textured layers in a coarser soil profile result in damping depths deeper in the vadose zone. Findings from this study will enhance understanding of the vadose zone’s influence on transient water flux and improve the simulation of recharge processes and climate variability effects in groundwater models.",

            "abstract": "In the Inner California Borderlands (ICB), offshore of Southern California, modern dextral strike-slip faulting overprints a prominent system of basins and ridges formed during plate boundary reorganization 30-15 Ma. Geodetic data indicate faults in the ICB accommodate 6-8 mm/yr of Pacific-North American plate boundary deformation; however, the hazard posed by the ICB faults is poorly understood due to unknown fault geometry and loosely constrained slip rates.\nWe present observations from high-resolution and reprocessed legacy 2D multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection datasets and multibeam bathymetry to constrain the modern fault architecture and tectonic evolution of the ICB. We use a sequence stratigraphy approach to identify discrete episodes of deformation in the MCS data and present the results of our mapping in a regional fault model that distinguishes active faults from relict structures.\nSignificant differences exist between our model of modern ICB deformation and existing models. From east to west, the major active faults are the Newport-Inglewood/Rose Canyon, Palos Verdes, San Diego Trough, and San Clemente fault zones. Localized deformation on the continental slope along the San Mateo, San Onofre, and Carlsbad trends results from geometrical complexities in the dextral fault system. Undeformed early to mid-Pleistocene age sediments onlap and overlie deformation associated with the northern Coronado Bank fault (CBF) and the breakaway zone of the purported Oceanside Blind Thrust. Therefore, we interpret the northern CBF to be inactive, and slip rate estimates based on linkage with the Holocene active Palos Verdes fault are unwarranted. In the western ICB, the San Diego Trough fault (SDTF) and San Clemente fault have robust linear geomorphic expression, which suggests that these faults may accommodate a significant portion of modern ICB slip in a westward temporal migration of slip. The SDTF offsets young sediments between the US/Mexico border and the eastern margin of Avalon Knoll, where the fault is spatially coincident and potentially linked with the San Pedro Basin fault (SPBF). Kinematic linkage between the SDTF and the SPBF increases the potential rupture length for earthquakes on either fault and may allow events nucleating on the SDTF to propagate much closer to the LA Basin.",

            "abstract": "Urban heat island (UHI) is defined as the temperature difference between the urbanized areas and their surroundings due to local surface energy balance since urban materials and build up structures modify the heating and cooling rates of the ambient air. Istanbul is the largest city of Turkey with the population over 14 million inhabitants and the urbanization is drastically expanded since 1965 due to the population increase from 2 million to 14 million. In this study we investigate impacts of urban expansion on meteorological variables in relation to the UHI effect in Istanbul. To estimate the strength of UHI, temperature differences between urban and suburban stations are calculated by using temperature observations from 6 stations for 1960-2012 years, and 34 stations for 2007–2012. The results show that, the UHI intensity is stronger during summer season and Kartal experiences intensified UHI effect more than the others. The daytime(nighttime) UHI intensity defined with respect to Şile (suburban) varies between 0.41 and 3.01oC (1.02 and 2.18oC).\nThe atmospheric UHI usually reaches its highest intensity on summer nights, and under calm air and a cloudless sky. Therefore, the total of 127 dry days which have cloudiness less than 2/8 and wind speed less than 2 m/s are selected to estimate the strength of UHI in Istanbul. The hourly temperature differences between a selected urban station (Pendik) and a rural station (Terkos), are calculated as 5oC for daytime and 8oC for the nighttime.\nThe relationship between urbanization and long-term modification of the urban climate of Istanbul is investigated by modeling the present-day spatial distribution of the urban heat load. Geographical data of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality and CORINE Land Cover Raster Data are used to generate the land use distribution. Furthermore, the new urban land use types are defined by considering the spatial coverage and the average height of the buildings. Effects of change in land use on daytime and nighttime urban heat island (UHI) of Istanbul is examined using the local–scale atmospheric model MUKLIMO_3. The model is applied to simulate the local scale circulation based on high-resolution topography and land use data for Istanbul. A set of mitigation strategies is tested. Results confirm the importance of green areas and Bosphorus.",

NOAA’s Hazard Mapping System smoke data are used to ensure smoke. After identification, CALIPSO smoke-filled aerosol data are used to initialize air parcels in the LaTM. Then, the trajectory model is run backwards in time until there is a coincidence with MODIS fire detection data and smoke-filled air parcels. Our focus will be on the Tripod fire, one of the largest fires in the lower 48 in recent US history (burned July-August 2006).

One of the more surprising discoveries in the MARSIS data has been the presence of transient layer-like structure in the Martian ionosphere at altitudes near and above 200 km. While the presence of these layers has now been known for years, the addition of the MAVEN spacecraft has provided the first opportunity to advance the understanding of their origin and variation. The combination of MAVEN’s instrument suite and its elliptical orbit allow a variety of factors to be considered. When MAVEN is far from the planet, the SWEA/SWIA package can be combined with the MARSIS observations to correlate variations in the solar wind with their effects on the density and visibility of these layers. On the other hand, when MAVEN is at low altitudes, its Langmuir Probe (LPW) and mass spectrometer (NGIMS) can directly reveal the source of the structures observed from above by MARSIS by measuring the individual densities of the component ions. Periods where the orbits of the two spacecraft cross at close intervals will be particularly useful in comparing these findings. As many of these close-crossings are just beginning to take place, early results of this study will be presented.",

            "abstract": "The “June 27th” flow, named for the date on which it started, threatened communities on the lower East Rift Zone (ERZ) of Kīlauea Volcano, Hawaii, for several months during 2014–2015. The flow encroached on Pāhoa, threatening to cross the main street and sever Highway 130, which serves the rural communities on Kīlauea's south and east flanks.\nThe rate of flow advance was influenced greatly by magma supply from the summit. Increases in ERZ discharge, presaged by inflationary summit tilt, resulted in flow advance of up to several hundred meters per day. When summit tilt switched to deflation, discharge waned and the flow slowed and often stalled, repeatedly stopping short of destroying critical infrastructure. When activity resumed, it typically did so as many small breakouts as far as a few km behind the flow front, which then had to resurface previously covered ground to extend the overall length of the flow.\nAt the same time, lava near the flow front had a very spiny texture and was noticeably less fluid than lava closer to the vent, leading to speculation that physiochemical changes along the flow were limiting its length. In December 2014, we collected a suite of lava samples along the flow from near Pu`u `Ō`ō to its distal end (3 km to 18 km) to better understand the physiochemical changes along its length. The magma flux on that day was calculated at 90,000– 100,000 m3/day (~1 m3/s).\nPreliminary analyses of the samples reveal a down-flow decrease in lava vesicularity and temperature and a corresponding increase in density and microcrystallinity. We propose that the lava flow could only attain a length of ~21 km because of the changes in its apparent viscosity, for the calculated magma flux. The flows could not overcome the increasing downstream yield strength, and breakouts from the flow margins farther upslope were easier to achieve than forcing the front forward. These upslope breakouts were themselves limited in length by the same factors.",

            "abstract": "There is compelling evidence that moderate-magnitude seismicity in the central and eastern US is on the rise. Many of these earthquakes are attributable to anthropogenic injection of fluids into deep formations resulting in incidents where state regulators have even intervened. Earthquakes occur when a high-pressure fluid (water or CO2) enters a fault, reducing its resistance to shear failure and causing runaway sliding. However, induced seismicity does not manifest as a solitary event, but rather as a sequence of earthquakes evolving in time and space. Additionally, one needs to consider the changes in the permeability due to slip within a fault and the subsequent effects on fluid transport and pressure build-up. A modeling framework that addresses the complex two-way coupling between seismicity and fluid-flow is thus needed. In this work, a new parallel physics-based coupled framework for induced seismicity that couples the slip in faults and fluid flow is presented. The framework couples the highly parallel subsurface flow code PFLOTRAN (www.pflotran.org) and a fast Fourier transform based earthquake simulator QK3. Stresses in the fault are evaluated using Biot’s formulation in PFLOTRAN and is used to calculate slip in QK3. Permeability is updated based on the slip in the fault which in turn influences flow. Application of the framework to synthetic examples and datasets from Colorado and Oklahoma will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Climate change models for the north­ern Rocky Mountains predict warming and changes in water availability that may alter vegetation. Changes to vegetation may include timing of plant life-history events, or phenology, such as green-up, flower­ing, and senescence. These changes could make forage available earlier in the growing season, but shifts in phenol­ogy may also result in earlier senescence (die-off or dormancy) and reduced overall production. Greenness indices such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are regularly used to quantify greenness over large areas using remotely sensed reflectance data. The timing and scale of current satellite data, however, may be insufficient to capture fine-scale differences in phenology that are important indicators of habitat quality. The Wyoming Range Mule Deer herd is one of the largest in the west but it declined precipitously in the early 1990s and has not recovered. Accurate measurement of greenness over space and time would allow managers to better understand the role of plant phenology and productivity in mule deer population dynamics, for example. To connect spatial and temporal patterns of plant productivity with habitat quality, we compare greenness patterns (MODIS data) with migratory mule deer movement (GPS collars). Sagebrush systems provide winter habitat for mule deer. To understand sagebrush phenology as an indicator of productivity, we constructed NDVI time series and compared dates of phenological stages and magnitudes of greenness from three perspectives: at-surface/species-specific (mantis sensors: downward looking, <1m above vegetation); near surface/site-specific (PhenoCam: oblique, 2m); and satellite/landscape-scale (varied platforms). Greenness indices from these sensors contribute unique insights to understanding vegetation phenology, snow cover and reflectance. Understanding phenology and productivity at multiple scales can help guide resource management decisions related to habitat quality, and evaluate what remotely sensed phenology measurements mean on the ground. Monitoring changes in phenology and productivity over the long-term can provide insight into ecosystem responses to climate change.",

            "abstract": "Flooding is a major concern in the Plata Basin. In particular, Paraná River has a long and wide floodplain, which has been settled and cultivated. Losses due to floods in Argentina during the 1983, 1992, 1998, 2007 and 2009-2010 floodings exceeded US$1 billion each. Therefore, providing information about the basin hydrologic condition in a systematic way is critical to the regional economies and society. In particular, monitoring basin fluvial wetlands’ flood-drought cycles is of extreme importance. These ecosystems extend along the Paraná-Paraguay axis and have highly dynamic exchanges of water with the river, with large annual and interannual variations. Thus, both floodplain water level and flooded area become relevant proxies for the total volume of water inside the floodplain. Moreover, the dynamics of these variables will be a raw indicator of floodplain overall hydrological behavior. Therefore, estimating these variables in a systematic way using remote sensing data, it is possible to constrain the outputs of hydrological forecast models.\nThe aim of this work is to construct an equivalent topography schema that can be incorporated to forecast and alert models of the basin. This is approached in three successive steps. First, we implement a methodology to estimate flooded area and water level inside the floodplain, based on active and passive microwave satellite data and a surface emissivity model. Then, we study the behavior of the flooding and low water phases through the analysis of the relationship between flooded area fraction and water level inside the floodplain obtained in the first step and between flooded area fraction and water level in adjacent water bodies obtained from hydrometric gauges and microwave altimetry. Finally, from the observed dynamics and a topographic simulation model we propose a schematic equivalent topography of the floodplain that represents the simplest topography that can explain the water dynamics observed during flooding events (See Figure 1).\nIn summary, the approach used on this work allows for the analysis of current hydrological condition in terms of its location in the flooded area vs water level diagram, and the posing of different possible future flooding scenarios, which would be useful for flooding forecast and alert.",

            "abstract": "Fire is a key agent of change in the African savannas, which are shaped through the complex interactions between trees, C4 grasses, rainfall, temperature, CO2 and fire. These fires and their emitted smoke can have numerous direct and indirect effects on the environment, water resources, air quality, and climate. For instance, veld fires in southern Africa cause large financial losses to agriculture, livestock production and forestry on an annual basis. This study contributes to our understanding of the implications of projected surface temperature evolution in Africa for fire risk, human health and agriculture over the coming decades. We use an ensemble of high-resolution regional climate model simulations of African climate for the 21st century. Regional dowscalings and recent global circulation model projections obtained for Africa indicate that African temperatures are likely to rise at 1.5 times the global rate of temperature increase in the tropics, and at almost twice the global rate of increase in the subtropics. Warming is projected to occur during the 21st century, with increases of 4-6 °C over the subtropics and 3-5 °C over the tropics plausible by the end of the century relative to present-day climate under the A2 (low mitigation) scenario. We explore the significance of the projected warming by documenting increases in projected high fire danger days and heat-wave days. General drying is projected across the continent, even for areas (e.g. tropical Africa) where an increase in rainfall is plausible. This is due to the drastic increases in temperature that are projected, which leads to drier soils (through enhanced evaporation) despite the rainfall increases. This will likely impact negatively on crop yield, particularly on the maize crop that is of crucial importance in terms of African food security.",

            "abstract": "Neutrals play an important role in the evolution of the weakly ionized solar chromosphere where the number density of neutrals can vastly exceed the number density of protons. Therefore modeling the neutral-ion interactions and studying the effect of neutrals on the ambient plasma properties is an important task for better understanding the observed emission lines and the propagation of disturbances from the photosphere to the transition region and the corona. To pursue this goal we have developed two-fluid and three-fluid simulation setups to study the interaction between electrons, ions and neutrals in a reactive gravitationally stratified collisional media. The model considers the electrons and ions within the resistive MHD approach with Coulomb collisions and anisotropic heat flux determined by Braginskii’s transport coefficients. The electromagnetic fields are evolved according to the full Maxwell equations, allowing for propagation of higher frequency waves neglected by the standard MHD approximation. Separate mass, momentum and energy conservation equations are considered for the neutrals and the interaction between the different fluids is determined by the chemical reactions, such as impact ionization, radiative recombination and charge exchange, provided as additional source terms. To initialize the system we consider an ideal gas equation of state with equal initial temperatures for the electrons, ions and the neutrals and different density profiles. The initial temperature and density profiles are height-dependent and follow VAL C atmospheric model for the solar chromosphere. We have searched for a chemical and collisional equilibrium between the ions and the neutrals in the hydrostatic case to avoid unphysical outflows and artificial heating induced by initial pressure imbalances. Next we consider ion-neutral interactions in magnetized plasma with an initial magnetic profile, corresponding to emerging magnetic funnel. Finally we include an external driver to simulate the propagation of MHD waves in the partially ionized gravitationally stratified system.",

Spectroscopic measurements of coronal ions indicate that these uneven temperatures emerge within tenths of solar radii from the surface of the Sun. It is possible that preferential heating occurs closer to the surface of the Sun, but only at these heights are Coulomb collision rates sufficiently low that different temperatures can persist long enough to be observed. Solar wind ions in interplanetary space are also often seen to have unequal temperatures, but are these differences due to ongoing preferential heating or a signature of a process that occurred much closer to the Sun? This presentation will demonstrate a new technique that uses interplanetary solar wind observations from the Wind spacecraft and a model for the effects of Coulomb collisions to solve for the typical outer boundary of preferential ion heating. We will compare our results with theoretical models of solar wind heating, and make predictions for the upcoming Solar Probe Plus and Solar Orbiter missions to the inner heliosphere.",

The scalar measure reveals that the nongyrotropy lies in bands that straddle the electron diffusion region and the separatrices, in the same regions where there are parallel electric fields. Analysis of electron distributions and fields shows that the nongyrotropy along the inflow and outflow separatrices emerges as a result of multiple populations of electrons influenced differently by large and small-scale parallel electric fields and by gradients in the electric field. Some of the electron populations are also demagnetized along the separatrices as a result of their interactions with the nonideal electric field. The relevant parallel electric fields include large-scale potential ramps emanating from the x-line and sub-ion inertial scale bipolar electron holes. Particle tracing of electrons from nongyrotropic populations along the inflows and outflows shows that the striated structure of nongyrotropy corresponds to electrons arriving from different source regions. We also show that the relevant parallel electric fields receive important contributions not only from the nongyrotropic portion of the electron pressure tensor, but from electron spatial and temporal inertial terms as well.",

The measured signal demonstrates a minimum at dawn and a maximum in the mid to late afternoon. The pattern is consistent with neutron flux suppression at dawn due to a maximum water concentration in the upper one meter of regolith. The present work expands on this earlier low-latitude effort by investigating specific regions of interest: the nearside Maria, the farside lunar highlands, and the farside South Pole-Aitken Basin region, as well as investigating how latitude affects the measurable diurnal variability.

We have developed the Community Firn Model (CFM) that allows users to run firn-densification physics from a suite of published models. Here, we use the CFM to compare model-predicted firn depth-density profiles and compaction rates with observed profiles and compaction rates collected from a network of in situ strain gauges at eight different sites in Greenland. Additionally, we use regional-climate-model output to force the CFM and compare the depth-density profiles and compaction rates predicted by the different models. Many of the models were developed using a steady-state assumption and were tuned for the dry-snow zone. Our results demonstrate the challenges of using these models to simulate firn density in Greenland’s expanding wet firn and percolation zones, and they help quantify the uncertainty in firn-density model predictions. Next-generation firn models are incorporating more physics (e.g. meltwater percolation and grain growth), and field measurements are essential to inform continuing development of these new models.",

Understanding patterns of mortality and plant response to severe drought is important to resource managers, given the frequency of these events are expected to increase in the future. Remote sensing studies have documented changes in forest properties due to direct and indirect effects of drought; however, few have addressed this at local scales needed to characterize highly heterogeneous ecosystems in the forest-shrubland ecotone. We analyzed a 22-year Landsat time series (1985-2012) to determine changes in forest that experienced a relatively dry decade punctuated by two years of extreme drought. We assessed the relationship between vegetation indices and field measures, applied the index to trend analysis to uncover the location, direction and timing of change, and assessed the interaction of climate on topography. The Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) had the strongest correlation with plant area index (R2 = 0.64) and canopy gap fraction (R2 = 0.65). During the study period, 25% of the forested area experienced a significant (p < 0.05) negative trend in NDMI, compared to less than 10% in a positive trend. Trends were not consistent across forest type as a larger amount of coniferous forest was impacted by negative trends than deciduous forest. Southern aspects were least likely to exhibit a negative trend and north aspects were most prevalent. Field plots with a negative trend had a lower live density, and higher amounts of standing dead and down trees compared to plots with no trend. Our analysis identifies spatially explicit patterns of long-term trends anchored with ground based evidence to highlight areas of forest that are resistant, persistent and vulnerable to severe drought. The results provide a long-term perspective for the resource management of this area and can be applied to similar ecosystems throughout western North America.",

As AirNow’s core data processing engine, DMS ingests, QCs, and stores real-time data from over 30,000 active sensors at over 5,280 air quality and meteorological sites from over 130 air quality agencies across the United States. As part of the AirNow-I program, several instances of DMS are deployed in China, Mexico, and Taiwan. The U.S. Department of State’s StateAir Program also uses DMS for five regions in China and plans to expand to other countries in the future.\nRecent development has begun to migrate DMS from an onsite desktop application to WebDMS, a web-based application designed to take advantage of cloud hosting and computing services to increase scalability and lower costs. WebDMS will continue to provide easy-to-use data analysis tools, such as time-series graphs, scatterplots, and wind- or pollution-rose diagrams, as well as allowing data to be exported to external systems such as the EPA’s Air Quality System (AQS). WebDMS will also provide new GIS analysis features and a suite of web services through a RESTful web API. These changes will better meet air agency needs and allow for broader national and international use (for example, by the AirNow-I partners).\nWe will talk about the challenges and advantages of migrating DMS to the web, modernizing the DMS user interface, and making it more cost-effective to enhance and maintain over time.",

T-phases arrive late at seismic stations or hydrophones as they travel as an acoustic wave through the SOFAR channel for much of their propagation paths. Attenuation of T-phases along continental paths can be high, but by stacking seismograms from many earthquakes we can enhance weak arrivals. To further increase the visibility of the phase arrivals in stacks, we apply STA/LTA filtering to individual traces before stacking. Our stacks show that the T-phase can clearly be observed at stations up to 4° inland from the coast. We also demonstrate that a change in apparent velocity of the T-phase can be observed in the stacks if we select data depending on the continental path length on the receiver side, and how these changes agree with the theory of acoustic to seismic coupling of energy at continents. In addition, analysis of the spatial distribution of energy in the stacks shows clearly that mostly oceanic paths have large amplitudes in the T-phase window. We are attempting to include more stations from regional arrays in order to analyze areas of T-phase blockage and amplitude variability with propagation paths in more detail in order to increase understanding of T-phase generation and propagation processes.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU 2015 Poster.pdf\nClimate-based studies require large amounts of data in order to produce accurate and reliable results. Many of these studies have used 30-plus year data sets in order to produce stable and high-quality results, and as a result, many such data sets are available, generally in the form of global reanalyses. While the analysis of these data lead to high-fidelity results, its processing can be very computationally expensive. This computational burden prevents the utilization of these data sets for certain applications, e.g., when rapid response is needed in crisis management and disaster planning scenarios resulting from release of toxic material in the atmosphere.\nWe have developed a methodology to reduce large climate datasets to more manageable sizes while retaining statistically similar results when used to produce ensembles of possible outcomes. We do this by employing a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) algorithm to analyze general patterns of meteorological fields over a regional domain of interest to produce a small set of “typical days” with which to generate the model ensemble. The SOM algorithm takes as input a set of vectors and generates a 2D map of representative vectors deemed most similar to the input set and to each other. Input predictors are selected that are correlated with the model output, which in our case is an Atmospheric Transport and Dispersion (T&D) model that is highly dependent on surface winds and boundary layer depth. To choose a subset of “typical days,” each input day is assigned to its closest SOM map node vector and then ranked by distance. Each node vector is treated as a distribution and days are sampled from them by percentile.\nUsing a 30-node SOM, with sampling every 20th percentile, we have been able to reduce 30 years of the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR) data for the month of October to 150 “typical days.” To estimate the skill of this approach, the “Measure of Effectiveness” (MOE) metric is used to compare area and overlap of statistical exceedance between the reduced data set and the full 30-year CFSR dataset. Using the MOE, we find that our SOM-derived climate subset produces statistics that fall within 85-90% overlap with the full set while using only 15% of the total data length, and consequently, 15% of the computational time required to run the T&D model for the full period.",

Antarctic temperatures show a lagged and out-of-phase response, suggesting that these climate anomalies were propagated to the Southern Hemisphere high latitudes through changes in ocean circulation. Large changes in atmospheric circulation in the tropics accompanied abrupt North Atlantic climate change and modeling studies have predicted an atmospheric teleconnection between the tropics and the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds. However, consistent paleoclimate evidence for this tropical-high southern latitude atmospheric teleconnection has been lacking. Here we use a new high-resolution deuterium excess record from West Antarctica to show that moisture sources for Antarctic precipitation changed in phase with abrupt shifts in Northern Hemisphere climate, significantly before Antarctic temperature change. These results suggest that Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude storm tracks and westerly winds migrated north- and southwards within decades of rapid North Atlantic warming and cooling, respectively, and in parallel with the well-established migrations of the intertropical convergence zone. Both ocean and atmospheric processes, operating on different timescales, are critical to the global expression of abrupt climate change and this atmospheric link between the hemispheres may be important to the underlying dynamics.",

X4 is a 300-km-long array of 26 broadband seismic stations deployed from Matagorda Island across the GCP, ending near the center of the Llano uplift (LU). The study found an 80-100 km wide “lithosphere-asthenosphere transition zone” (LATZ). While a negative Sp phase at ~110 km depth could be interpreted as a shallow LAB, several negative Sp phases were also found in the 110-180 km depth interval and this set of negative Sp phases is bounded by a positive Sp phase at 180-200 km depth that is semi-continuous across the length of the array. We interpret the depth interval’s negative anomalies to be the results of partial melt and shearing in a softened or underdeveloped lithosphere, thus the term LATZ. The GCP was also found to have large SKS splitting delay times, which we believe is due to seismic anisotropy in the LATZ (the zone of assumed shearing). Body wave tomography found slightly high Vp but unusually low Vs beneath the GCP; Vs is more sensitive to partial melt and anisotropy than Vp, further supporting the LATZ hypothesis.\nPs and Sp Moho phases are observed at ~35 km beneath the LU but both Sp and Ps RFs fail to image a Moho beneath the Balcones Fault zone (BFZ). The Moho may be undetectable due to serpentinization of the upper mantle from water leaking through the BFZ, a possibility supported by the existence of a low velocity anomaly in the upper mantle beneath the BFZ found by surface wave modeling. Ps and Sp RFs also found evidence for a low velocity zone in the 50-70 km depth interval near the shoreline of the GCP. Ps RF imaging suggests this LVZ may be a piece of subducted lower crust emplaced during the Ouachita orogeny with a trapped mantle wedge above it. These observations are supported by gravity modeling.",

One potential source of INPs to the atmosphere is biomass combustion, such as wildfires, prescribed burning and agricultural burning, which emits large quantities of particulate matter into the atmosphere and is a major source of black carbon (BC) aerosol. To better understand and constrain INP emissions from biomass combustion, globally relevant fuels were used in a series of burns during a study called FLAME 4 at the USFS Fire Sciences Laboratory in Missoula, MT. Concentrations of immersion mode INPs were measured using a Colorado State University Continuous Flow Diffusion Chamber (CFDC). During the first part of the study, emissions were measured in real time as fires progressed from ignition to flaming and smoldering phases. INP emissions were observed predominately during periods of intensely flaming combustion. Roughly 75% of measured burns produced detectable INP concentrations and these had, on average, higher combustion efficiencies and higher BC emissions. During the second half of FLAME 4, we directly measured the contribution of refractory black carbon (rBC) to INP concentrations by selectively removing these particles via laser-induced incandescence (LII) using a Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2; Droplet Measurement Technologies). The SP2 uses a 1064 nm Na:YAG laser to heat rBC aerosol to their vaporization temperatures, thus removing them from the sampled aerosol. By passing combustion aerosol through the SP2 with the laser on and off while measuring the remaining aerosol with the CFDC, we were able to determine the contribution of rBC to the INP population. Reductions in INPs of 0 – 70% were observed when removing rBC from the combustion aerosol, indicating the importance of rBC particles to INP concentrations for some burn scenarios.",

The increasing population, amplified by people’s increasing consumption of animal products will create a massive demand for food and feed from grain production. As such, global food security will remain a worldwide concern for the next half century. Addressing the food security issue requires data and information support, including research and operational programs for crop monitoring, modeling and yield forecasting. Satellite observations, owing to their synoptic and repetitive nature, have the unique advantage of providing timely information on crop growth at regional to global scales. However, it remains a challenge to accurately identify crop type, estimate areal extent and forecast crop yield with satellite data. Here we employ a stratified random sampling framework for estimating soybean area and yield in the conterminous United States using satellite data collected by the MODIS and Landsat sensors. Complementing each other, the temporally-rich MODIS data are used to capture rapid phenological transitions of soybean crops, whereas the moderate-resolution Landsat data are used to delineate more spatial details for accurate area estimation. For every sample, we derive generic phenological metrics from MODIS and Landsat data and employ machine learning algorithms to identify soybean pixels with reference data generated from RapidEye images and verified by extensive field visits. We also characterize empirical relationships between satellite metrics and soybean yield compiled by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS). Preliminary results suggest that MODIS data alone underestimate soybean area considerably, whereas Landsat data can provide accurate estimate on soybean area. However, soybean yield can be predicted using MODIS-based reflectance metrics. Our sample depict well the spatial variation of soybean yield over the conterminous United States. In addition, the area-weighted national soybean yield derived from the sample can also capture the year-to-year variation in national yield as compared with NASS’s yearly, survey-based yield estimates. These results indicate that the stratified random sampling approach is efficient and accurate for soybean area and yield estimation at national scales.",

            "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET) is an important component of the hydrological cycle and is one of the most difficult to quantify. ET can be measured at the surface directly using the eddy covariance method which provides continuous measurements but is limited in representing ET over areas larger than a few square kilometers. To obtain ET data over a large region satellite data can be utilized. While ET can be calculated from daily satellite imagery daily images can have missing data due to conditions such as cloud cover. To obtain a complete image of ET multiple day composites are constructed. The composited images offer a more complete picture but may induce bias in the surface radiometric temperature, thus biasing flux estimates. Here, methods for obtaining composite satellite images of ET in the grasslands of the United States are compared. The approach for obtaining ET will be based on the Priestly Taylor (PT) equation. The advantage of using the PT equation is that the only input is net radiation (Rn) and the soil heat flux (G). In addition to the inputs of Rn and G the PT equation also incorporates a dimensionless parameter α that accounts for aerodynamic resistance. The surface temperature – vegetation index (Ts-VI) triangle method is also used to estimate α using daily surface temperature and 16 day NDVI images from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrotadiometer (MODIS) aboard the Aqua satellite. Fluxes are computed daily and compared with eddy covariance observations in the region. In order to investigate the bias induced by temporal compositing, α is calculated from surface temperature data composited at the 2, 4, 6, 8, 16 and 32 day scales. Flux estimates are computed at each scale and compared to daily flux estimates aggregated to the same time scale. Differences in the seasonal and spatial trends of the methods are presented focusing on the impacts of climate anomalies such as drought. Implications for using composite images are discussed. ",

At the same time, policy-makers and Arctic communities need decision-support tools and synthesized information to respond and adapt to the “new Arctic”. There are enormous challenges, however, in collaboration among the disparate groups of people needed for such efforts. A carefully planned strategic approach is required to bridge the scientific disciplinary and organizational boundaries, foster cooperation between local communities and science programs, and effectively communicate between scientists and policy-makers. Efforts must draw on bodies of knowledge from project management, strategic planning, organizational development, and group dynamics.\nThis poster presentation will discuss best practices of building and sustaining networks of people to catalyze successful cross-disciplinary activities. Specific examples and case studies – both successes and failures -- will be presented that draw on several projects at the Arctic Research Consortium of the U.S. (ARCUS; www.arcus.org), a nonprofit membership organization composed of universities and institutions that have a substantial commitment to research in the Arctic.",

            "abstract": "The bivalve Etheria elliptica occurs abundantly in (sub)tropical African river basins. We investigate its potential use for the reconstruction of ambient water chemistry and climate by means of stable oxygen isotope ratios in specimens from the Congo river (Kisangani), the Oubangui river (Bangui) and the Victoria Nile (Jinja). Unlike other common African bivalve species, E. elliptica contains distinct organic-rich growth increments, previously suggested to correlate with lunar periodicity. However, cavities in the shell complicate age reading and little is known about the exact timing and continuity of these growth increments. We set up a comparative study between different techniques to visualize and enhance growth features, and find that staining with Mutvei’s solution and confocal fluorescence microscopy perform equally well. Despite the presence of cavities, growth lines can generally be followed from umbo to shell margin. Moreover, preliminary δ18O results of two micro-sampled specimens from the Oubangui river show that 12-13 growth lines occur within one year of growth. This corroborates that these increments can be used as temporal anchor points, providing a moon-monthly time frame for sequential microchemistry. In two Congo river specimens, δ18Oshell values vary between -1.9 and -3.8 ‰ (VPDB), in line with a predicted range of -2.1 to -4.1 ‰ based on fortnightly δ18Owater and T monitoring. Reconstructed intra-annual δ18Owater variability from δ18Oshell values and observed T correlates with discharge, reflecting rainfall and runoff variability in the upstream catchment area. In two Victoria Nile specimens, collected 20 km downstream from Lake Victoria, δ18Oshell values are high and relatively constant, varying between +1.8 and +3.2 ‰. Enrichment of 18Oshell is consistent with isotopically heavy rainfall signatures and elevated surface evaporation in Lake Victoria. These first results suggest that E. elliptica is well-suited for the reconstruction of African climate and hydrology at a continental scale.",

Molecular CO2 has doubly bonded O=C=O units but high pressure-high temperature (HP-HT) studies have recently shown its transformation into a three-dimensional network of corner-linked [CO4] units analogous to the silica mineral polymorphs, through intermediate non-molecular phases. Here, we report P-V-T data on CO2-IV ice from time-of-flight neutron diffraction experiments, which allow determining the compressibility and thermal expansivity of this intermediate molecular-to-non-molecular phase.1 Aditionally, we have explored the SiO2-CO2 phase diagram and the potential formation of silicon carbonate compounds. New data obtained by laser-heating diamond-anvil experiments in CO2-filled microporous silica polymorphs will be shown. In particular, these HP-HT experiments explore the existence of potential CO2/SiO2 compounds with tetrahedrally-coordinated C/Si atoms by oxygens, which are predicted to be stable (or metastable) by state-of-the-art ab initio simulations.2,3 These theoretical predictions were supported by a recent study that reports the formation of a cristobalite-type Si0.4C0.6O2 solid solution at high-pressures and temperatures, which can be retained as a metastable solid down to ambient conditions.4 Entirely new families of structures could exist based on [CO4]4- units in various degrees of polymerisation, giving rise to a range of chain, sheet and framework solids like those found in silicate chemistry.\n",

            "abstract": "The role of rivers in releasing or trapping As (Arsenic) in aquifer sediments has not been widely explored. In large deltas with flat topography, transient water levels, changes in flow directions, and redox conditions in riverbank aquifers are often observed. This creates a unique condition that may promote As release and trapping. Extremely high As concentrations in solid phase have been found in the sediments lining the Meghna River, Bangladesh. We hypothesize that this enrichment is the result of gaining river conditions; the originally high concentration of As present in groundwater sorbs to FeOOH as it comes into contact with oxic river sediments. The objective of the present study is to model the transport and geochemistry of groundwater and surface water within the riverbank aquifer under the influence of extensive local irrigation pumping using high-frequency water levels and water chemistry. Two years of hydraulic head observations from shallow monitoring wells within 100m from the river on both the west and east sides indicate the Meghna River is gaining throughout the year in this part of the delta. Under non-irrigation pumping times, lateral hydraulic gradients varied from 0 to 0.045 towards the river. Hydraulic gradients trending away from the river were only observed during short term irrigation pumping and varied from 0 to 0.053. Using hydraulic conductivities derived from slug tests these hydraulic gradients correspond to groundwater moving 0 to 1.53±0.10 m/d towards the river during non-irrigation pumping conditions, and 0 to 1.80±0.12 m/d away from the river during irrigation pumping. Water chemistry was analyzed on samples taken from the wells and the River. As concentrations range from 0 to 366 ppb in the shallow wells for the pre-irrigation sampling. Elevated chloride and specific conductivity in the riverbank aquifer inland were used to identify the mixing zone across the aquifer. A two-dimensional flow and reactive transport riverbank aquifer model was developed using COMSOL Multiphysics. This study has important implications on the potential risk of As concentration seasonally rising in shallow aquifers adjacent to rivers. Furthermore, our model helps understand redox processes in riverbank aquifers affected by natural and anthropogenic processes that affect groundwater quality.",

            "abstract": "Claypans are a sub-soil horizon of smectitic mineralogy that impedes percolation and promotes surface runoff. These soils, which encompass 33,000 km2 in portions of Missouri and Illinois, have long been thought to restrict contaminant transport into/from groundwater. However, recent studies have shown that claypan watersheds are vulnerable to the loss of agricultural chemicals, particularly nitrate. The purpose of our study was to understand the role of groundwater in regulating stream water quantity and quality in Goodwater Creek Experimental Watershed (GCEW) in northern central Missouri. Samples have been collected since 2011 from precipitation, stream water at three locations along the main stream, groundwater from twenty five wells with depths ranging from 3 to 15 m, and soil water from seven piezometers above the claypan. Mean nitrate concentrations were 4.1 ppm in stream water at the watershed outlet, 1.0 ppm in precipitation, 3.2 ppm in soil water at piezometers, and 18.9 ppm in groundwater. Using diagnostic tools of mixing model and end-member mixing analysis, three natural tracers were determined to be conservative – electric conductivity (EC), Mg2+ and Na+ and three end-members were identified to control stream water – surface runoff (chemically characterized by precipitation), interflow above the claypan (characterized by soil water in piezometers), and groundwater. Interflow and groundwater contributed, on average, 26% and 12% of stream flow at the watershed outlet, respectively. During low flows, however, the contribution of groundwater increased to 30-40%. Also, the mean contribution of groundwater increased to 16% at middle course and 19% at the headwaters. Nitrate concentrations in stream water were dominated by the contributions from groundwater during low flows, ranging from 50 to 90% at all stream sampling locations. This study highlights the vulnerability of groundwater to nitrate contamination, even in runoff-prone watersheds, and demonstrated its importance in regulating stream water quantity and quality in claypan watersheds.",

            "abstract": "Global distributions of greenhouse gas (GHG) sources and sinks, principally CO2 and CH4, and characterization of the processes that control them, comprise a key uncertainty in projections of future climate. A broad spectrum of tools is currently used to characterize these processes. Top-down inversions of orbital GHG column observations (e.g. ACOS/GOSAT and OCO-2) provide a global perspective, but little information is available to validate these estimates. Indirect (boundary-layer budget) or direct (tower-based eddy covariance) surface flux measurements can provide bottom-up constraints, but the former is typically focused on large point and area emission sources while the latter relies on sparse networks with limited spatial coverage.\nAircraft are an ideal platform to bridge the flux representation scale from kilometers (as measured from towers) to the tens or hundreds of kilometers relevant to satellite observations and global models. In light of current measurement gaps and the emerging need for direct validation of GHG surface flux estimates, NASA is developing a sophisticated facility for airborne eddy covariance observations of carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor and other trace gases. Three components comprise the core measurement system: i) the NASA Wallops Sherpa, which is ideal for airborne eddy covariance due to its substantial payload and the ability to fly low and slow, ii) commercial GHG sensors optimized for airborne flux measurements, and iii) a custom gust-probe system for high-fidelity measurements of vertical wind velocity. These systems will be discussed in detail, along with future plans for deployment and application of measurements to improving GHG flux estimates on local, regional and global scales.",

            "abstract": "Despite the ocean's importance in global biogeochemical feedbacks and heat storage, there is still a paucity of decadally-resolved sea surface temperature (SST) records to complement lacustrine and dendrological records of recent paleoclimate. Natural climate variability on multidecadal timescales is dominated by internal ocean circulation dynamics and feedbacks, and it is therefore imperative to employ marine proxies to reconstruct high resolution climate change. The timescales of this ocean-induced natural climate variability can be broken down into a few characteristic climate modes. Pressing questions about these modes include their stationarity in frequency and amplitude over time, in addition to the hypothesis that anthropogenic climate change has altered their behavior in comparison to natural variability. To pursue these questions, we must discern and analyze suitable climate archives in regions where modes of interest dominate modern climate variability. The region of Baja California, Mexico exhibits exceptional teleconnection to the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). Local, dramatic effects of ENSO and PDO on the marine biology and economy underline the importance of regional paleoclimate records from the Baja peninsula.\nHere, we present a high-resolution alkenone-derived SST reconstruction from the Industrial Revolution through the year 2000 by analysis of laminated box and Kasten sediment cores at Site PCM 00-78 (25.18°N, 112.66°W) in the subtropical eastern Pacific at a depth of 540 meters. Our SST record corresponds with NOAA extended reconstructed sea surface temperature, providing a robust basis for organic geochemical marine climatic reconstructions on timescales usually accessible only through speleothems, coral density bands, tree rings, and the like. Accordingly, based on this comparison to the historical data we expect our SST record may provide a more robust record of inter and multidecadal eastern Pacific variability than far-flung teleconnected terrestrial paleoclimatic proxies, Indeed, our alkenone-reconstructed SST record is positively correlated to the PDO index. However, correlation with indices representing ENSO appears weaker, perhaps as a result of proxy limitations. ",

To this end, we study the impact of the Green Ninja Energy Tracker curriculum, which uses students’ home energy data in the classroom to promote engagement in climate change and conservation behaviors. Data is drawn from class observations, a focus group, and pre- and post- surveys of a pilot implementation of this curriculum in a diverse 12th-grade Earth Science classroom at an alternative school. We investigate what factors contributed to student engagement in learning about and participating in energy conservation behaviors. We found that students were engaged by the immediacy of tracking their energy use in near-real time, and were motivated by the economic benefits experienced as a direct result of changing their behaviors. In addition, students reported discussing and problem-solving energy use with their families, and surfaced considerations that informed which energy behaviors were implemented and why. Students also reported high levels of personal agency in taking action on climate change, but were pessimistic about the likelihood of society as a whole taking action. We suggest that this pilot demonstrates that potential power of connecting students’ home and school lives through energy tracker software as a catalyst for developing scientific expertise and engagement, and supporting energy conservation behaviors.",

            "abstract": "Advances over the last decade in regional numerical models of metamorphism and models of mineral nucleation and growth at the hand specimen scale allow quantitative estimates of how metamorphism behaves at the kilometer (km) and centimeter (cm) scale in both time and space. Integration of these two methodologies provides a holistic approach that allows predictions of km-scale regional thermal models to be linked to cm-scale hand specimen textures throughout the spatial domain and over the duration of a metamorphic event. To illustrate this concept, models of conductive and advective transport of heat around intrusions in the middle crust display the complex variation of thermal fields at the km scale in space and time for regional-contact metamorphic terranes. The results of these regional scale calculations show that rocks in different locations that have reached the same peak conditions (Tmax,PTmax) attained Tmax, PTmax at different times (tTmax) during the metamorphic event, cross key pelitic isograds at different times (tGrt in, tSt in, t Al-sil in) and have different rates of reaction overstepping when an isograd is crossed (dΔGrxn Grt in/dt, dΔGrxn St in/dt, dΔGrxn Al-sil in/dt). The variation in these parameters in the 3-D spatial domain around the intrusion causes index minerals to have different nucleation and growth histories depending on their location. Linking the evolution of metamorphic textures to the specific local P-T-t path from the regional thermal models using a local equilibrium, diffusion-controlled nucleation/mineral growth model allows simulation of the evolution of rock textures at various locations as metamorphism progresses. The results of the textural modelling demonstrate that there are subtle differences in crystal size distributions and other textural features in metamorphic rocks that allow a careful petrologist to distinguish their different thermal histories, even though traditional methods using thermobarometry or pseudosections would imply thermal histories were all the same.",

            "abstract": "China is currently the largest producer and consumer of ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) which are regulated by the Montreal Protocol (MP). Many ODSs are also powerful greenhouse gases (GHGs). The Multilateral Fund has subsidized ~1 billion US dollars for the ODS phase out in China, and thus the return on this investment is of great interest. This study gives a comprehensive emission inventory in China from 1980 to 2013 of halocarbons including ODSs and their alternatives, the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) that are also greenhouse gases. We then project these emissions up to 2050 according to the MP and several policy options. Total emissions of ODS and HFCs were estimated to be ~500 CO2-eq Tg/yr in 2013 which are equivalent to ~5% of total GHG emissions in China including fossil fuel CO2 emissions. Our estimate shows that China has succeeded in substantially reducing CFC-11-equivalent emissions (to protect the ozone layer), and CO2-equivalent emissions (to protect climate) of ODSs since the mid-1990s when their phase out started in China in compliance with the MP. Furthermore, the avoided CO2-eq emissions due to compliance with the MP are even greater compared to the reduced emissions, for example net cumulative avoided emissions during 19 year period between 1995–2013 are comparable to the current one year CO2 emissions from fossil fuels in China. We find that HFC CO2-eq emissions increased rapidly in last decade, which make up ~2% in 2005 to ~20% of total halocarbon CO2-eq emissions in 2013. Under a baseline scenario in which HFCs are used as alternatives in the ongoing phase out of HCFCs in China, emissions of HFCs are predicted to be important components of both China’s and global future GHG emissions. However, potential exists for minimizing China’s HFC emissions under mitigation scenarios. Our conclusions about China’s past and future ODS and HFC emission trajectories are likely to apply to other developing countries, with important implications for mitigating global GHG emissions.",

In the context of geologic carbon sequestration, this wettability will impact capillary pressure, residual trapping, and a variety of other key parameters of interest. While the wettability of CO2 on pure mineral and real rock sample have been studied a great deal over the past few year, very little is known about how the wettability of these rocks could change over long time horizons as CO2 interacts with species in the brine and on the mineral surface. In this work we sought to explore the role that dilute inorganic and organic species that are likely to exist in connate brines might have on a suite of mineral species. High-pressure contact angle experiments were carried out on a suite of polished mineral surfaces. Both static captive bubble and advancing/receding contact angle measurements were carried out. The effect of ionic strength, and in particular the valence of the dominant ions in the brine are found to have an important impact on the wettability which cannot be explained solely based on the shifts in the interfacial tension between the CO2 and brine. More significantly, three organic species, formate, acetate, and oxalate, all three of which are representative species commonly encountered in the saline aquifers that are considered target repositories for carbon sequestration. All three organic species show impacts on wettability, with the organics generally increasing the CO2 wetting of the mineral surface. Not all pure minerals respond the same to the presence of organics, with micas showing a more pronounced influence than quartz. Sandstone and limestone samples aged with different kinds of hydrocarbons, a surrogate for oil-bearing rocks, are generally more CO2-wet, with larger contact angles in the CO2/brine system. Over multiple days, the contact angle decreases, which could be attributed to partitioning of oil films off of the surface and into the CO2 phase, which drives the wettability towards the original water-wet state. This effect could be particularly important for organic rich repositories like depleted oil and gas fields or fractured shale formations where organic species could be presented both on mineral surfaces and in the aqueous phase.",

            "abstract": "Over the last several decades, Acropora cervicornis has seen a massive die-off in the Caribbean. (Aronson and Precht 2001; Gardner et al., 2003; Greer et al., 2009). The potential causes of decline in A. cervicornis in the Caribbean include: extremes in sea surface temperatures (SST), ocean acidification, eutrophication, white-band disease, storm disturbances, and other anthropogenic disturbances. Contrary to the regional decline in A. cervicornis, Coral Gardens on the Belize Barrier Reef has an Acropora sp. population that appears to be thriving. Through a combination of sclerochronology, stable isotope analysis, and in situ sensor data, this work capitilizes on the opportunity to study reef conditions in a site where micro-environmental conditions appear to be favorable for healthy A. cervicornis coral growth. We use cores from two Orbicella faveolata colonies located within Acropora stands, as A. cervicornis does not reveal annual banding. We compare two cores from one O. faveolata colony at Coral Gardens, first cored in 2011 and again in 2014, to one O. faveolata core at near-by Rocky Point, where A. cervicornis is much less abundant. These cores were x-radiographed in order to expose the annual banding and sampled for stable oxygen and carbon isotope analysis (10-15 samples/cm). We show that, although there are no significant differences in the range of the δ18O and δ13C signature between Rocky Point and Coral Gardens, there is a clear difference in the stress histories at these locations as inferred from linear extension rates (LER’s) and annual banding patterns. Rocky Point averages a LER of 10.5±1.4 mm/year (n = 29) over a 30 year record and Coral Gardens averages 9.1±1.2 mm/year (n = 70) from ~1953 – 2001, and averages 6.2±1.6 mm/year (n = 36) from coral years 2001-2014 after an inferred stress-banding event. This is in contrast to the observed overall health of A. cervicornis at the two locations. The inferred stress-banding event is currently unidentified but is most likely due to either SST stresses during the 1998 El Niño summer or damage as a result of Hurricane Keith in 2000. Finally, we show that there may be a long-term trend in declining LER’s (-4.4 mm/year, R² = 0.29) at Coral Gardens prior to the inferred stress-banding event consistent with work on the Great Barrier Reef (De’ath et al., 2009).",

Likewise, high resolution ground-based magnetic surveys have the potential to reveal significant features not exposed at the surface, especially in the case of small-volume basaltic volcanoes. Here we present the results of geophysical studies to investigate the eruptive history of deposits surrounding phreatomagmatic eruption sites, and why some may become magnetized.\nMagnetic surveys undertaken at basaltic phreatomagmatic sites suggest that some tuff rings carry no discernable magnetic signature, while others reveal slight to significant magnetic anomalies. Material deposited in the tephra ring could become magnetized through Thermal Remanent Magnetization – emplacement of magnetically susceptible material above 560° C. In this case tephra layers would need to be deposited in sufficient thickness to retain high temperatures long enough for the magnetic material to orient itself to the magnetic field.\nTo test this hypothesis we examine GPR data collected at Rattlesnake Maar in the San Francisco Volcanic Field, Arizona, and we will collect GPR data at two other tephra rings in the same volcanic field. The first site, Sugarloaf Mountain, is an active quarry with excellent exposures of tephra ring stratigraphy. Although this site is rhyolitic in composition and not suitable for magnetic study, it is an excellent site to determine how well GPR reflectors correlate with actual stratigraphy. The second site, an un-named phreatomagmatic ring nearby, will then be studied by GPR and walking magnetic survey.\nGPR reflectors will be compared to depositional patterns defined in previous studies and correlated with magnetic survey results to determine if a correlation can be made – little to no magnetization where only thin units are recorded by GPR, and positive magnetization where thick units are recorded.",

            "abstract": "There now exists a plethora of information attesting to the reality of our changing climate and its impacts on both human and natural systems. There also exists a growing literature linking climate change impacts and transportation infrastructure (highways, bridges, tunnels, railway, shipping ports, etc.) which largely agrees that the nation’s transportation systems are vulnerable. To assess this vulnerability along the coast, flooding due to sea level rise and storm surge has most commonly been evaluated by simply increasing the water surface elevation and then estimating flood depth by comparing the new water surface elevation with the topographic elevations of the land surface. While this rudimentary “bathtub” approach may provide a first order identification of potential areas of vulnerability, accurate assessment requires a high resolution, physically-based hydrodynamic model that can simulate inundation due to the combined effects of sea level rise, storm surge, tides and wave action for site-specific locations. Furthermore, neither the “bathtub” approach nor other scenario-based approaches can quantify the probability of flooding due to these impacts. We developed a high resolution coupled ocean circulation-wave model (ADCIRC/SWAN) that utilizes a Monte Carlo approach for predicting the depths and associated exceedance probabilities of flooding due to both tropical (hurricanes) and extra-tropical storms under current and future climate conditions. This required the development of an entirely new database of meteorological forcing (e.g. pressure, wind speed, etc.) for historical Nor’easters in the North Atlantic basin. Flooding due to hurricanes and Nor’easters was simulated separately and then composite flood probability distributions were developed. Model results were used to assess the vulnerability of the Central Artery/Tunnel system in Boston, Massachusetts to coastal flooding now and in the future. Local and regional adaptation strategies were recommended and associated costs were estimated. A summary of this study will be presented.",

            "abstract": "New 2-dimensional multi-channel seismic data acquired offshore east coast U.S.A in autumn 2014 provide high-resolution insight into the post-rift evolution of the margin by dynamic, interrelated processes of sediment transport, slope failure, salt diapirism, and gas hydrate formation and dissociation. This area contains some of the largest slope failure complexes in the North Atlantic and on-going salt tectonics and large-scale growth faulting continue to shape the margin. In addition, there is strong evidence for the existence of gas hydrate via bottom-simulating reflectors. The best example of where salt diapirism, hydrates, and landslides are affecting near-surface sediments is the Cape Fear Slide Complex in which two salt diapirs are surrounded by the 120-meter tall amphitheater-shaped lower headwall of the Cape Fear landslide, which occurred approximately 24-42 kya. One of the diapirs currently stands above the present-day seafloor. Previous interpretations propose that the Cape Fear landslide was triggered by the rising salt diaper. We test this by integrating our geophysical observations with cores from Ocean Drilling Program Leg 172 and an analytical model that solves for the upward velocity of salt diapirs based on regional basin sediment thickness and diapir diameter. We find that the rate of salt rise is 4-15 m/My. This indicates less than 1 meter post-landslide rise has occurred and thus that the present-day morphology as imaged in seismic data represents the geometry at the time of the Cape Fear landslide. Current sediment angles on the flanks of the diapir are a maximum of 7°, which are statically stable at hydrostatic pore pressure. This suggests that simple oversteepening is not enough to explain the landslide. The hydraulic conductivity of sediments is estimated from nearby ODP sites to be an order of magnitude greater than the upward salt velocity, which suggests that overpressure in the roof sediments was unlikely. We tentatively propose that hydrate dissociation during salt rise may have been an important factor in triggering the landslide. Salt, has a higher thermal conductivity than sediment. Therefore it is expected that while the salt was rising, warming of the surrounding hydrate-bearing sediment may have resulted in overpressure that allowed landsliding at low angles.­",

In this study, a new formulation of time-variable TTD theory is combined with simple water balance models to elucidate the influence of individual hydrogeomorphic units and the hydrologic processes operating within them on the integrated catchment TTD. This new theory allows one to decompose a TTD into a part that depends on the time variability and partitioning of hydrologic inputs and a part that depends on the way water of a given age is sampled by discharge. This age-sampling is defined by a probability density function of the age-ranked storage, known as the relative StorAge Selection (rSAS) function. The form of the rSAS function for a given hydrogeomorphic unit is theorized to be controlled by hydrologic processes operating within that unit, while the TTD of the entire catchment represents an integration of the rSAS functions of these individual units.\nStable water isotope samples and discharge data are used to calculate the rSAS functions of hillslope and riparian hydrogeomorphic units contained within a 37 hectare watershed of the Piedmont Physiographic Province. The rSAS function and corresponding TTD of the 37 ha watershed are estimated. Water balances for the hillslope and riparian units are calculated along with the overall watershed water balance. Diurnal fluctuations in riparian water level are used to independently estimate evapotranspiration from the riparian area, rates of groundwater flux, and changes in riparian storage. Gaged springs are used to estimate changes in hillslope storage as well as discharge. The rSAS functions of the hillslope and riparian units are then weighted and combined and compared to the overall catchment TTD to elucidate the influence of each unit on the overall time-variable TTD.",

            "abstract": "Geoscience faculty at the University of South Florida (USF), Florida Gulf Coast University (FCGU), Valencia College (VC) and Florida International University (FIU) have teamed to construct, test and disseminate geoscience curricula in which microbeam analytical instruments are operated by undergraduates, with data gathered in the classroom in real-time over the internet. Activities have been developed for courses Physical Geology, Oceanography, Earth Materials, Mineralogy/Petrology and Stratigraphy using the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and Electron Probe Microanalyzer (EPMA) housed in the Florida Center for Analytical Electron Microscopy (FCAEM;\nhttps://fcaem.fiu.edu\n) at FIU. Students and faculty send research materials such as polished rock sections and microfossil mounts to FCAEM to be examined during their scheduled class and lab periods. Student control of both decision-making and selection of analytical targets is encouraged. The objective of these activities is to move students from passive learning to active, self-directed inquiry at an early stage in their undergraduate career, while providing access to advanced instruments that are not available at USF, FGCU and VC. These strategies strongly facilitate student interest in undergraduate research making use of these instruments and one positive outcome to date is an increased number of students undertaking independent research projects. Prior research by USF PI Jeff Ryan indicated that various barriers related to instrument access and use hindered interested geoscience faculty in making use of these tools and strategies. In the current project, post-doctoral researcher Dr. Sven Holbik acts as a facilitator, working directly with faculty from other institutions one-on-one to provide initial training and support, including on-site visits to field check classroom technology when needed. Several new educators and institutions will initiate classroom activities using FCAEM instrumentation this Fall.",

Current graphical separation methods are limited in that they rely solely on streamflow records, whereas chemical methods are expensive and involve intense data collection. Graphical hydrograph separation methods are applicable to perennial and gaining streams but result in large uncertainty when applied to ephemeral or losing streams that are typical of dry climates.\nA new method planned for development will consist of multivariate analysis to determine which spatial and temporal variables are the controlling factors for base flow. Data used in the development of this methodology will include geologic, hydrologic, climatic, land surface, and remotely sensed data that are widely available to the public. Factors considered will include geologic media, flow-duration curves, temporal variability of streamflow, stream type, precipitation, drought-severity index, land-surface slope, and vegetation. This research will examine differences in variables controlling base flow between dry and humid climates, perennial and ephemeral streams, and gaining and losing stream reaches. Although the accuracy of each variable will vary, the use of multivariate analyses will help compensate for those variables with low accuracy.\nBase-flow estimates were previously calculated for all streams with streamflow data located in the Williston and Powder River structural basins using the U.S. Geological Survey hydrograph separation software, PART; these streams, in addition to streams not previously analyzed, will be evaluated by using the method that is being developed. The study area for this research will include the Heart River basin in southwestern North Dakota, the White River basin in southwestern South Dakota, and the Niobrara River basin in northern Nebraska.",

We perform simple laboratory experiments to better understand the collective phenomena involved in granular electrification. We confine granular particles in an oscillating cylindrical chamber which is enclosed and sealed by two conducting plates. The primary measurement is the voltage difference between the two plates. We find that collective effects occurring in the bulk of the material play a significant role in the electrification process. We extend that by addition of photodetection capabilities to the experimental chamber to detect electrical discharges between the particles and each other and the plates.

            "abstract": "The Anatolian plate (Turkey) was formed during the late Miocene-Pliocene transition from contractional strain in central and eastern Anatolia (collision) to localized strike-slip faulting along inherited collisional structures (escape tectonics). Structural inheritance undoubtedly played a role in this major plate boundary reorganization, although its significance is not well understood. Considerable uncertainty also exists regarding the timing and kinematics of Tauride-Eurasia collision, initial Arabia-Eurasia collision, and the terminal closure of the Neotethys Ocean.\nThe Sivas Basin is a ~E-W-elongate collisional forearc basin located between the Tauride micro-continent in the south and the Pontide Arc along the southern Eurasian margin in the north. Well-exposed contractional structures in Paleocene-Eocene marine strata of the Southern Sivas fold and thrust belt (SSFTB) provide an excellent opportunity to investigate the timing and kinematics of both Tauride and Arabian collisions and their potential roles in localizing strain and facilitating tectonic escape. We use detailed geologic mapping, structural analysis and detrital geo/thermochronology to investigate the magnitude, style, and timing of collision-related crustal shortening across the SSFTB.\nThe structural geology of the SSFTB is characterized by ENE- to ESE-trending, gently plunging fault propagation folds with slight asymmetry towards the north. Vergence on thrust faults is mainly towards the north, although a few previously unmapped faults are south-vergent. Detrital apatite fission track data from Paleocene-Eocene strata reveal a single phase of rapid exhumation ca. ~36-31 Ma, which may be related to either Tauride or initial Arabian collision. We propose that structural growth of the SSFTB at this time played a major role in marine basin isolation and early Oligocene evaporite deposition. In the central and northern Sivas Basin where salt was likely thickest, salt tectonics was initiated by northward-tilting of the basin and nonmarine sediment loading from sources in the growing orogenic wedge of the SSFTB to the south.",

            "abstract": "The oxidation state of the Earth’s mantle during formation remains an unresolved question, whether it was constant throughout planetary accretion [1], transitioned from reduced to oxidized [2,3,4], or from oxidized to reduced [1,5]. We investigate the stability of Fe3+ at depth, in order to constrain processes (water, late accretion, dissociation of FeO) which may reduce or oxidize the Earth’s mantle.\nExperiments of more mafic compositions and at higher pressures commonly form a polyphase quench intergrowth composed primarily of pyroxenes, with interstitial glass which hosts nearly all of the more volatile minor elements.\nIn our previous experiments on shergottite compositions, variable fO2, T, and P <4 GPa, Fe3+/ΣFe decreased slightly with increasing P, similar to terrestrial basalt [6,7,8]. For oxidizing experiments < 7GPa, Fe3+/ΣFe decreased as well [9], but it’s unclear from previous modelling whether the deeper mantle could retain significant Fe3+ [1,10]. Our current experiments expand our pressure range deeper into the Earth’s mantle and focus on compositions and conditions relevant to the early Earth. Experiments with Knippa basalt as the starting composition were conducted at 1-8 GPa and 1800 °C, using a molybdenum capsule to set the fO2 near IW, by buffering with Mo-MoO3. TEM and EELS analyses revealed the run products from 7-8 GPa quenched to polycrystalline phases, with the major phase pyroxene containing approximately equal Fe3+/2+.\nA number of different approaches have been employed to produce glassy samples that can be measured by EELS and XANES. A more intermediate andesite was used in one experiment, and decompression during quenching was attempted after [11], but both resulted in a finer grained polyphase texture. Experiments are currently underway to test how different capsule materials may affect quench texture. A preliminary experiment using liquid nitrogen to greatly enhance the rate of cooling of the assembly has also been attempted and this technique will be refined in further experiments.\n[1]Righter and Ghiorso, 2012; [2]Rubie et al., 2011; [3]Wood et al., 2006; [4]Wänke and Dreibus, 1988; [5]Siebert et al., 2013; [6] Righter et al., 2013; [7] O’Neill, et al., 2006; [8] Kress and Carmichael, 1991; [9] Zhang et al., 2013; [10] Hirschmann, 2012 [11] Elkins et al., 2000.",

While GIS software offers higher-level analytical capability, it comes with a steep learning curve and complex interface that is not easy for the novice, and in many cases the instructor, to negotiate. In contrast, the intuitive interface of GE makes it easy for students to quickly become proficient in manipulating the globe and independently exploring relationships between multiple data sets at a wide range of scales. Inquiry-based, data-rich exercises have been developed for both introductory and upper-level activities including: exploration of plate boundary characteristics and relative motion across plate boundaries; determination and comparison of short-term and long-term average plate velocities; crustal strain analysis (modeled after the UNAVCO activity); and determining earthquake epicenters, body-wave magnitudes, and focal plane solutions. Used successfully in undergraduate course settings, for TA training and for professional development programs for middle and high school teachers, the exercises use the following GE data sets (with sources) that have been collected/compiled by the author and are freely available for non-commercial use: 1) tectonic plate boundaries and plate names (Bird, 2003 model); 2) real-time earthquakes (USGS); 3) 30 years of M>=5.0 earthquakes, plotted by depth (USGS); 4) seafloor age (Mueller et al., 1997, 2008); 5) location and age data for hot spot tracks (published literature); 6) Holocene volcanoes (Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program); 7) GPS station locations with links to times series (JPL, NASA, UNAVCO); 8) short-term motion vectors derived from GPS times series; 9) long-term average motion vectors derived from plate motion models (UNAVCO plate motion calculator); 10) earthquake data sets consisting of seismic station locations and links to relevant seismograms (Rapid Earthquake Viewer, USC/IRIS/DELESE).",

            "abstract": "The potential research, policy and management applications of satellite products place a high priority on providing statements about their accuracy. A number of NASA, ESA and EU funded global and continental burned area products have been developed using coarse spatial resolution satellite data, and have the potential to become part of a long-term fire Climate Data Record. These products have usually been validated by comparison with reference burned area maps derived by visual interpretation of Landsat or similar spatial resolution data selected on an ad hoc basis. More optimally, a design-based validation method should be adopted that is characterized by the selection of reference data via a probability sampling that can subsequently be used to compute accuracy metrics, taking into account the sampling probability. Design based techniques have been used for annual land cover and land cover change product validation, but have not been widely used for burned area products, or for the validation of global products that are highly variable in time and space (e.g. snow, floods or other non-permanent phenomena). This has been due to the challenge of designing an appropriate sampling strategy, and to the cost of collecting independent reference data.\nWe propose a tri-dimensional sampling grid that allows for probability sampling of Landsat data in time and in space. To sample the globe in the spatial domain with non-overlapping sampling units, the Thiessen Scene Area (TSA) tessellation of the Landsat WRS path/rows is used. The TSA grid is then combined with the 16-day Landsat acquisition calendar to provide tri-dimensonal elements (voxels). This allows the implementation of a sampling design where not only the location but also the time interval of the reference data is explicitly drawn by probability sampling. The proposed sampling design is a stratified random sampling, with two-level stratification of the voxels based on biomes and fire activity (Figure 1).\nThe novel validation approach, used for the validation of the MODIS and forthcoming VIIRS global burned area products, is a general one, and could be used for the validation of other global products that are highly variable in space and time and is required to assess the accuracy of climate records. The approach is demonstrated using a 1 year dataset of MODIS fire products.",

            "abstract": "Organic carbon-rich sediments from high latitude, shallow lakes and ponds are significant sources of methane throughout the Arctic. The origin and evolution of these lakes and ponds, however, is often not the same. Several lake types have been identified based on (1) hydrological conditions (melt-water fed, rain water fed, groundwater influenced, evaporation dominated, drained) (2) permafrost condition (thermokarst), and (3) time of origin (glacial or post-glacial). Given sufficient time (100’s to 1000’s years) many of these lake types may morph into others. In sub-Arctic Sweden, near Abisko and within the zone of discontinuous permafrost, the elongate glacial lake Torneträsk is fed by several streams draining the surrounding highlands. Lake Tornetrask is one of several NW-SE trending glacial lakes common in the landscape throughout northern and western Sweden. Between and alongside these glacial lakes, several small (<1 km across) lakes and ponds exist in low-lying mires. Sediment cores from the lakes in the Stordalen Mire are characterized by high total organic carbon (TOC) content (10-50 wt. %) in the uppermost ~50 cm and commonly underlain by glaciofluvial derived sediments with lower TOC (<10 wt. %). High TOC intervals are coincident with the highest measured methane concentrations in several lakes and C/N ratios suggest the TOC is primarily derived from in situ aquatic vegetation or submerged peats. Methane emissions from several of these lakes has also been measured and is driven by heat input. Coincident young ages of carbon in the sediments and in methane indicate in situ production. A published record from Lake Torneträsk shows sediments there contain significantly less TOC (1-2.5 wt. %) that is derived primarily from old, terrestrial organic carbon delivered via rivers to the lake. Although the larger and deeper glacial lakes currently occupy much of the landscape it is becoming clear that as the Arctic warms TOC preservation and methane production in the smaller lakes and ponds play a more significant, immediate role in emission of methane to the atmosphere. With continued warming in the Arctic, terrestrial TOC will be relinquished from highland watersheds to glacial lakes, but the methane derived from this potentially increasing TOC flux, albeit less labile, will not be produced until sometime in the future.",

            "abstract": "Hydroclimate changes are an important aspect of arctic climate variability and are coupled to other components of the Arctic system, such as sea ice extent and modes of atmospheric circulation. Here we examine past hydroclimate change on Svalbard, where regional climate is associated with northern North Atlantic oceanic and atmospheric circulation dynamics. We measured the hydrogen isotopic composition of leaf waxes from a lake sediment core collected from NW Svalbard (Amsterdamøya; 79.77°N, 10.76°E). δD values were measured at sub-centennial scale resolution spanning the last 2,000 years on long-chain n-alkanes (n-C29, n-C31). δD of n-C29 and n-C31 range from -180 to -194‰ and -173 to -195‰, respectively, and are strongly correlated. There is little variability in the δD from AD 100-1250. However starting at c. AD 1250, there is a gradual increasing trend that continues until c. AD 1800. After c. AD 1800 values increase sharply and are more variable up to the present. In many Arctic regions, temperature appears to be the primary control on precipitation isotopes. On Svalbard, previous studies have shown that regional precipitation isotopes can also be influenced by the delivery of moisture from the south. If the trends in our data were interpreted as a response to temperature, the records would suggest increasing temperatures starting at AD 1250, which is at odds with regional air and sea-surface temperature reconstructions that generally show cooling associated with the Little Ice Age. Therefore, the increase in δD at these sites more likely reflects changes in either the seasonality of precipitation, or a change in the trajectory of air masses delivering precipitation to the region. We examine the possibility for these changes by assessing trends in local water isotopes from modern observations and from isotope-enabled GCM output for the region.",

We present metamorphic P-T conditions of three schists from successive thrust sheets related to generation of the Himalayan orogen, based on mineral assemblage thermobarometry and pseudosection phase diagrams. Use of the garnet-muscovite-biotite-plagioclase thermobarometer and Ti-in-biotite thermometer yield peak conditions of 676 ± 78°C and 10.6 ± 1.3 kbar for schist (PH-1-8-13-26) thrust atop metavolcanics, mafic schist, and ultramafics of the Indus-Ysangpo suture zone (IYSZ). Within this sample, quartz is recrystallized along grain boundaries and garnets contain no significant compositional zoning. Pseudosections constructed from bulk-rock composition and equilibrium mineral assemblages yield a clockwise P-T path with similar peak garnet amphibolite conditions. At structurally lower levels, garnet chlorite schist (PH-1-8-13-8) from a thrust klippe of the IYSZ record peak temperatures below 650°C. Garnets display growth zoning, with increasing Mn and decreasing Fe and Mg from rim to core. Application of the Ti-in-biotite thermometer to a mafic schist (PH-1-3-13-1B) within the klippe near a southwestward-directed thrust yields a peak temperature of 679 ± 24°C. Our study reveals a complex metamorphic history throughout the northern Indo-Burman mélange zone that likely records metamorphism at deep crustal levels during thrust motion and growth of the Himalayan orogen around the northeastern corner of India.",

This provides a means to assess surface level NO2 spatial variability over a broader area than what can be monitored from ground stations. The characterization of surface level NO2 variability is important to understand air quality in urban areas, emissions, health impacts, photochemistry, and to evaluate the performance of chemical transport models. Using data from the NASA DISCOVER-AQ campaign in Baltimore/Washington we calculate NO2 mixing ratios from the Airborne Compact Atmospheric Mapper (ACAM), through four different methods to derive surface concentration from column measurements. High spectral resolution lidar (HSRL) mixed layer heights, vertical P3B profiles, and CMAQ vertical profiles are used to scale ACAM vertical column densities. The derived NO2 mixing ratios are compared to EPA ground measurements taken at Padonia and Edgewood. We find similar results from scaling with HSRL mixed layer heights and normalized P3B vertical profiles. The HSRL mixed layer heights are then used to scale ACAM vertical column densities across the DISCOVER-AQ flight pattern to assess spatial variability of NO2 over the area. This work will help define the measurement requirements for future satellite instruments.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing is an important tool to increase the productivity of wells used for oil and gas production, water resources, and environmental remediation. Currently there are relatively few tools available to monitor the distribution of proppants within a hydraulic fracture, or the propagation of the fracture itself. We have been developing techniques for monitoring hydraulic fractures by injecting electrically conductive, dielectric, or magnetically permeable proppants. We then use the resulting contrast with the enveloping rock to image the proppants using geophysical methods.\nBased on coupled laboratory and numerical modeling studies, three types of proppants were selected for field evaluation. Eight hydraulic fractures were created near Clemson, SC in May of 2015 by injecting specialized proppants at a depth of 1.5 m. The injections created shallow sub-horizontal fractures extending several meters from the injection point.\nEach cell had a dense array of electrodes and magnetic sensors on the surface and four shallow vertical electrode arrays that were used to obtain data before and after hydraulic fracturing. Net vertical displacement and transient tilts were also measured. Cores from 130 boreholes were used to characterize the general geometries, and trenching was used to characterize the forms of two of the fractures in detail.\nHydraulic fracture geometries were estimated by inverting pre- and post-injection geophysical data. Data from cores and trenching show that the hydraulic fractures were saucer-shaped with a preferred propagation direction. The geophysical inversions generated images that were remarkably similar in form, size, and location to the ground truth from direct observation. Displacement and tilt data appear promising as a constraint on fracture geometry.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - poster_ademe.pdf\nThe Seismological Observatory of the North-East of France (ObSNEF) is developing its monitoring network within the framework of several projects. Among these project, RESIF (Réseau sismologique et géodésique français) allows the instrumentation of broad-band seismic stations, separated by 50-100 km. With the recent and future development of geothermal industrial projects in the Alsace region, the ObSNEF is responsible for designing, building and operating a dense regional seismic network in order to detect and localize earthquakes with both a completeness magnitude of 1.5 and no clipping for M6.0. The realization of the project has to be done prior to the summer 2016\nSeveral complex technical and financial constraints constitute such a projet. First, most of the Alsace Région (150x150 km2), particularly the whole Upper Rhine Graben, is a soft-soil plain where seismic signals are dominated by a high frequency noise level. Second, all the signals have to be transmitted in near real-time. And finally, the total cost of the project must not exceed $450,000.\nRegarding the noise level in Alsace, in order to make a reduction of 40 dB for frequencies above 1Hz, we program to instrument into 50m deep well with post-hole sensor for 5 stations out of 8 plane new stations. The 3 remaining would be located on bedrock along the Vosges piedmont. In order to be sensitive to low-magnitude regional events, we plan to install a low-noise short-period post-hole velocimeter. In order to avoid saturation for high potentiel local events (M6.0 at 10km), this velocimeter will be coupled with a surface strong-motion sensor. Regarding the connectivity, these stations will have no wired network, which reduces linking costs and delays. We will therefore use solar panels and a 3G/GPRS network. The infrastructure will be minimal and reduced to an outdoor box on a secured parcel of land. In addition to the data-logger, we will use a 12V ruggedized computer, hosting a seed-link server for near real-time transmission and a rsync daemon for delayed-time transmission.\nWe plan to install and validate our first pilot station during the fall of 2015, and have an effective network by the summer of 2016.",

Model comprehension of these systems is in it’s infancy, particularly with regard to the sensitivities of model output to the representation of hydraulic strategies in tropical forest systems. Here we use data from the ongoing 14 year old Caxiuana through-fall exclusion experiment, in Eastern Brazil, to filter a set of representations of the costs and benefits of alternative hydraulic strategies. In representations where there is a high resource cost to hydraulic resilience, the trait filtering CLM4.5(ED) model selects vegetation types that are sensitive to drought. Conversely, where drought tolerance is inexpensive, a more robust ecosystem emerges from the vegetation dynamic prediction. Thus, there is an impact of trait trade-off relationships on rainforest drought tolerance. It is possible to constrain the more realistic scenarios using outputs from the drought experiments. Better prediction would likely result from a more comprehensive understanding of the costs and benefits of alternative plant strategies.",

Oxygen isotope analysis of bivalve shell yields information on the temperature of the water in which the organism grew. However, in coastal environments, variations in δ18Owater may complicate the interpretation of shell isotope profiles. Measuring and comparing the length of seasonal shell growth in select species of bivalves may complement isotopic analysis, together providing a more precise paleoclimate reconstruction. This project aims to determine the reliability of sclerochronological analysis of bivalves in reconstructing seasonality along the Northwest Coast of North America. To compare bivalves growing at different seasonal temperature conditions, samples of Saxidomus gigantea were collected from southern Alaska and northern British Columbia. Winter cessation lines were identified using oxygen isotope (δ18O) peaks from a profile of variation over the life of the clam, which was sampled sequentially from a section of its shell. Shell growth stops below ~4-5°C and so each winter cessation indicates temperatures lower than this threshold. Lunar-daily growth lines were counted between these winter growth cessation breaks, which quantitatively measure the length of the growing season. The resulting data were compared between habitats to assess if this is a useful method of determining the length of the growing season. If this method of assessing seasonality appears valid, it can be applied to ancient shells abundant in archaeological shell middens to make inferences about past seawater conditions and potentially indicate the presence or absence of the conditions necessary for sea ice accumulation.",

It is responsible for some of Earth’s most dangerous natural hazards including earthquakes and volcanic eruptions but also produced the continental crust and important mineral deposits. A range of geoscientific efforts including NSF MARGINS and GeoPRISMS initiatives have advanced our understanding of subduction zone processes. In spite the importance of subduction zones and our advancing understanding of how these function, there are few animations that clearly explain the subduction process to non-expert audiences. This deficiency reflects the disparate expertises between geoscientists who know the science but have weak animation skills and digital artists and animators who have strong skills in showing objects in motion but are not experts in natural processes like plate tectonics. This transdisciplinary gap can and should be bridged. With a small grant from NSF (DUE-1444954) we set about to generate a realistic subduction zone animation aimed at the university undergraduate audience by first working within our university to rough out a draft animation and then contract a professional to use this to construct the final version. UTD Geosciences faculty (Stern) and graduate student (Lieu) teamed up with faculty from UTD School of Arts, Technology, and Emerging Communication (ATEC)(Farrar, Fechter, and McComber) to identify and recruit talented ATEC undergraduate students (Mantey, Ward) to work on the project. Geoscientists assembled a storyboard and met weekly with ATEC undergraduates to generate a first draft of the animation, which guided development of an accompanying narrative. The draft animation with voice-over was then handed off to professional animator Windler (Archistration CG) to generate the final animation. We plan to show both the student-generated draft version and the final animation during our presentation. The final animation will be freely available via the internet and will also be used as a supplement for McGraw-Hill textbooks in oceanography, physical geology, Earth science, geography, historical geology, natural hazards, and natural resources.",

We present results from our ongoing work at the Arapahoe Basin and Aspen Highlands ski areas in Colorado, USA, and from a new collaboration with the Colorado Department of Transportation. At Arapahoe Basin we have tested rapid snow depth product generation for use in planning placement of explosives for artificial avalanche triggering.

            "abstract": "The relationship between the onset of tropical deep convection, column water vapor (CWV) and other measures of conditional instability is analyzed in 16 months of radiosonde, radiometer, and surface meteorological data collected from the mobile Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) site in Manaus, BR as part of the GOAmazon campaign. Important features seen previously in observations of the tropical western Pacific (TWP) are also found consistently for this tropical continental region. These features include precipitation conditionally averaged as a function of CWV exhibiting a sharp \"pick-up\" at high values of CWV, as well as the overall shape of the probability distribution of CWV for precipitating points. Similarly, there is a strong association between rainfall and moisture variability in the free troposphere at both locations; an association with boundary layer moisture variability is also observed, although the relationship is less pronounced. As in the TWP, local increases in CWV associated with heavy precipitation at Manaus often result from both a larger-scale and mesoscale moistening of the environment. The CWV is a proxy for the effect of free tropospheric moisture on conditional instability as indicated by entraining plume calculations. For several different mixing schemes, higher CWV at Manaus generally results in progressively greater plume buoyancies, which are consistent with the respective increases in precipitation observed. These buoyancy calculations also suggest that deep convective onset over tropical land may be highly sensitive to microphysics, particularly in the upper troposphere. Overall, leading aspects of the relationship between deep convective onset and CWV are largely consistent over both tropical land and ocean, and important differences in the continental versus oceanic case are seen as departures from these.",

            "abstract": "Clouds are omnipresent in earth's atmosphere and constitute an important role in regulating the radiative budget of the planet. However, the response of clouds to climate change remains uncertain, in particular, with respect to aerosol-cloud interactions and feedback mechanisms between the biosphere and atmosphere. Aerosol-cloud interactions and their feedbacks are the main themes of the European project FP7 BACCHUS (Impact of Biogenic versus Anthropogenic Emissions on Clouds and Climate: towards a Holistic Understanding).\nThe National Center for Meteorological Research (CNRM-GAME, Toulouse, France) conducted airborne experiments in Cyprus and Ireland in March and August 2015 respectively to link ground-based and satellite observations. Multiple RPAS (remotely piloted aircraft systems) were instrumented for a specific scientific focus to characterize the vertical distribution of aerosol, cloud microphysical properties, radiative fluxes, 3D wind vectors and meteorological state parameters. Flights below and within clouds were coordinated with satellite overpasses to perform 'top-down' closure of cloud micro-physical properties. Measurements of cloud condensation nuclei spectra at the ground-based site have been used to determine cloud microphyical properties using wind vectors and meteorological parameters mesured by the RPAS at cloud base. These derived cloud properties have been validated by in-situ RPAS measurements in the cloud and compared to those derived by the Suomi-NPP satellite. In addition, RPAS profiles in Cyprus observed the layers of dust originating from the Arabian Peninsula and the Sahara Desert. These profiles generally show a well-mixed boundary layer and compare well with ground-based LIDAR observations.",

However, the relatively short half-life of T (12.3 years) limits its effective age dating range. Compounding this limitation is the decrease in atmospheric T content by over two orders of magnitude (from 1000-2000 TU in 1962 to < 10 TU currently) since the cessation of above ground nuclear testing in the 1960’s. We are developing sample preparation methods coupled to direct counting of T via ultra-low background proportional counters which, when combined, offer improved T measurement sensitivity (~4.5 mmoles of H2 equivalent) and will help expand the application of T age dating to smaller sample sizes linked to persistent environmental questions despite the limitations above. For instance, this approach can be used to T date ~ 2.2 mmoles of CH4 collected from sample-limited systems including microbial communities, soils, or subsurface aquifers and can be combined with radiocarbon dating to distinguish the methane’s formation age from C age in a system. This approach can also expand investigations into soil organic C where the improved sensitivity will permit resolution of soil C into more descriptive fractions and provide direct assessments of the stability of specific classes of organic matter in soils environments.\nWe are employing a multiple step sample preparation system whereby organic samples are first combusted with resulting CO2 and H2O being used as a feedstock to synthesize CH4. This CH4 is mixed with Ar and loaded directly into an ultra-low background proportional counter for measurement of T β decay in a shallow underground laboratory. Analysis of water samples requires only the addition of geologic CO2 feedstock with the sample for methane synthesis. The chemical nature of the preparation techniques enable high sample throughput with only the final measurement requiring T decay with total sample analysis time ranging from 2 -5 weeks depending on T content.",

Notwithstanding the related significant efforts at modeling hydrological entities, there remain unresolved questions about some core entities that impact the design of hydro schemas, ontologies, and similar knowledge models. One such central entity is the water body, which is represented quite heterogeneously in such models, potentially challenging their interoperability. To meet this challenge, we carry out an ontological analysis of the water body entity and propose a new ontological representation for it, as part of a wider initiative into foundational hydro ontology. The representation exhibits the surprising result that a water body is a mereological entity that is essentially grounded in two types of whole-part relations. The nuanced nature of this result has the potential to inform the design of other hydro knowledge models, as well as to foster interoperability between them.",

It serves as a nursery for fish, a coastal buffer in storms, a repository of native wetland species unique to the Hudson, and a paleoenvironmental archive. At risk for disappearance due to rising sea level, we assess the present carbon stores and their spatial and temporal variability through time. Determining the depth of peat in transects throughout Piermont Marsh (41°N, 73°55’W), is one step in reconstructing the stores of carbon in the marsh and how they have shifted over millennia. Through the last decade, we have focused field efforts on probing the depths of the marsh through a series of transects and in acquiring sediment cores from which we establish sedimentation rates and carbon storage through time. AMS C-14 dating, XRF fluorescence, pollen analysis, and Cesium-137 provide chronological control for the sedimentation rates, pollution history, and an understanding of the regional and local shifts in vegetation. C-13 and pollen measurements in selected cores indicate major shifts in local vegetation with coastal eutrophication as the marsh has been invaded, first by Typha angustifolia in the nineteenth century and then by Phragmites australis in the twentieth century up to the present. N-15 measurements indicate a large shift in nitrogen as humans have impacted the marsh. We present a comprehensive, three-dimensional view of the effects of climate, vegetation, and human impact on the carbon storage of Piermont Marsh. This project provided a site for a place- and project-based learning through Lamont-Doherty's Secondary School Field Research Program. Many of the field samples were collected by young investigators from schools in New York City and towns near Piermont.",

Better insight into the flow physics has the potential to reduce wind farm energy losses by up to 20%, to reduce annual operational costs by hundreds of millions of dollars, and to improve project financing terms to more closely resemble traditional capital projects. The Data Archive and Portal (DAP) is a key capability of the A2e initiative. The DAP is a cloud-based distributed system known as the ‘Wind Cloud’ that functions as a repository for all A2e data. This data includes numerous historic and on-going field studies involving in situ and remote sensing instruments, simulations, and scientific analysis. Significantly it is the integration and sharing of these diverse data sets through the DAP that is key to meeting the goals of A2e. This cloud will be accessible via an open and easy-to navigate user interface that facilitates community data access, interaction, and collaboration. DAP management is working with the community, industry, and international standards bodies to develop standards for wind data and to capture important characteristics of all data in the Wind Cloud. Security will be provided to facilitate storage of proprietary data alongside publicly accessible data in the Wind Cloud, and the capability to generate anonymized data will be provided to facilitate using private data by non-privileged users (when appropriate). Finally, limited computing capabilities will be provided to facilitate co-located data analysis, validation, and generation of derived products in support of A2e science.",

Calibrated measurements of ClNO2, Cl2, HCl, N2O5, HNO3, HONO, among several other compounds, were made at 2Hz on all 13 research flights. ClNO2 and HCl were often the dominant forms of reactive gas-phase chlorine compounds, with ClNO2 routinely reaching >1.5 ppb in the polluted outflow of the eastern U.S. urban corridor. ClNO2 often becomes a substantial fraction (~30%) of NOz (NOz = NOy – NOx) in these plumes at night. Preliminary analyses suggests that ClNO2 production is most efficient in the polluted marine boundary layer, with yields approaching unity and the evolution of nighttime ClNO2 highly correlated with that of HNO3 and particulate nitrate. However, ClNO2 production was observed throughout the region and a significant source of reactive chlorine from coal-fired power plants was directly confirmed with measurements of HCl strongly correlated with SO2. In addition, there is some evidence that biomass or biofuel combustion is a source of reactive chlorine that can lead to ClNO2 production. Examples of the nocturnal and diel evolution of reactive chlorine species are given, and we show to our knowledge the first measurements of chlorine nitrate (ClONO2) in the polluted mid-latitude marine boundary layer.",

Samples were collected under baseflow conditions, five different times over the year 2014. We analyzed dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, DOM optical properties (i.e. ultraviolet-visible and fluorescence spectrophotometry), and DOM bioreactivity over the course of 22 d incubation. We found that air temperature and antecedent precipitation intensity (API) were two major factors positively controlling DOC concentrations. High DOC concentrations were associated with high fluorescence index values, low percent contributions from terrestrially derived humic-like DOM fluorescence component (C1), and high percent contributions from microbially derived humic-like DOM fluorescence component (C3). We suggest that elevated microbial DOM production under high temperature and API was the primary reason for DOC enrichment in stream water. Percentage agricultural land was the secondary predictor of DOM characteristics. The percentages of forest land use within watersheds positively correlated with percent protein-like DOM fluorescence component (C4). DOC concentrations and relative abundance of humic-like DOM fluorescence components (C1, C2 and C3) were higher in agricultural streams than in forested streams, which could be attributed to flow path differences between agricultural and forested watersheds.

            "abstract": "The migration of the lithofacies boundary recorded in the sedimentary record is key to interpreting changes in depositional environments. Change in grain size in the stratigraphic record is one of the most recognizable physical lithological features. Advance and retreat of the lithofacies boundary (gravel-sand transition) is attributed to external control variation, e.g., climate variation, sea-level change, and tectonic subsidence. While most models focus on predicting the response of the fluviodeltaic shoreline to these forcings, none have thoroughly incorporated the migration of grain-size transitions (GST) that coevolve within the fluviodeltaic system. We present a delta evolution model that treats the shoreline and GST as moving boundaries to provide quantitative understanding of the dynamic interaction between the external boundary (shoreline) and the internal lithofacies boundaries (GSTs) under relative sea-level rise. We tested a range of relative sea-level rise rates in the model. The shoreline and GST gradually reduced their progradation rates and eventually retreated landward as the fluviodeltaic topset and foreset elongated. However, their timings of retreats were different, resulting in a counterintuitive case for a quicker retreat of GST while the shoreline still continued to advance. A series of scaled flume experiments with a sand and crushed walnut sediment mixture captured the same behaviors of these two moving boundaries. We found that GST experienced higher relative sea-level rise rates that scale with the downstream river slope and the shoreline progradation rate, which caused earlier GST retreat timing in comparison to the shoreline. Time series data from the experiments show higher natural variability in migration rate of GST compared to that of the shoreline. Therefore, final recorded stratigraphy displayed a GST trajectory as a shazam line that shows zigzag fluctuations. This study investigates autogenic processes acting on the fluviodeltaic surface and tests their stratigraphic architecture recorded in the trajectories. The fundamental understanding of migration of both the lithofacies transition and shoreline in fluviodeltaic systems from this study will aid in accurately assessing the trajectories of GST in sedimentary strata as a proxy for environmental change.",

            "abstract": "Semiarid, mountainous watersheds are particularly susceptible to wildfires due to their dense forests and dry conditions. These watersheds are critically important sources of water and habitat for human and ecological communities in an otherwise water-scarce environment. Forest fires severely impact these watersheds through loss of vegetation, increases in erosion, decreases in water quality, and decreases in recharge. In addition, soil hydrophobicity, overland runoff, and erosion in post-fire watersheds create conditions where it is difficult for burned areas to re-vegetate within the months following a wildfire. What role do perennial springs play in post-fire re-vegetation? We hypothesize that revegetation originates around perennial springs since the springs and spring-runs are continual sources of water where new seeds can sprout and where burned vegetation can recover. We test this hypothesis in a snow-dominated, semiarid, mountainous watershed in the Chuska Mountains, located on the Navajo Nation in New Mexico and Arizona, following a wildfire that occurred in June 2014. NDVI was estimated in the watershed before and after the June 2014 fire using remotely sensed data. Photographs from digital trail cameras were used to capture the growth of vegetation/absence of growth on burned slopes with/without springs following the fire. The remote sensing data and trail camera photos indicate that revegetation is concentrated around springs. Springs act as “fountains” for regrowth of vegetation in the watershed following wildfires since they are dependable sources of clean water in a post-fire landscape commonly characterized by decreased infiltration and decreased water quality. An improved understanding of the role of springs in post-wildfire revegetation may enhance and prioritize watershed restoration and protection practices following a wildfire.",

            "abstract": "The DOI Advisory Committee on Climate Change and Natural Resource Science (ACCCNRS) has recommended that co-production of actionable science be the core programmatic focus of the Climate Science Center enterprise. Efforts by the Southeast Climate Science Center suggest that the complexity of many climate adaptation decision problems (many stakeholders that can influence implementation of a decision; the problems that can be viewed at many scales in space and time; dynamic objectives with competing values; complex, non-linear systems) complicates development of research-based information that scientists and non-scientists view as comprehensible, trustworthy, legitimate, and accurate.\nGoing forward, organizers of actionable science efforts should consider inclusion of a broad set of stakeholders, beyond formal decisionmakers, and ensure that sufficient resources are available to explore the interests and values of this broader group. Co-produced research endeavors should foster agency and collaboration across a wide range of stakeholders. We recognize that stakeholder agency may be constrained by scientific or political power structures that limit the ability to initiate discussion, make claims, and call things into question. Co-production efforts may need to be preceded by more descriptive assessments that summarize existing climate science in ways that stakeholders can understand and link with their concerns. Such efforts can build rapport and trust among scientists and non-scientists, and may help stakeholders and scientists alike to frame adaptation decision problems amenable to a co-production effort. Finally, university and government researchers operate within an evaluation structure that rewards researcher-driven science that, at the extreme, “throws information over the fence” in the hope that information users will make better decisions. Research evaluation processes must reward more consultative, collaborative, and collegial research approaches if researchers are to widely adopt co-production methods",

            "abstract": "Engineers must take a leading role in addressing the challenges of mitigating climate change and adapting to the inevitable changes that our world is facing. Yet climate change classes targeting engineering students are scarce. Technical education must focus on the problem formulation and solutions that consider multiple, complex interactions between engineered systems and the Earth’s climate system and recognize that transformation raises societal challenges, including trade-offs among benefits, costs, and risks. Moreover, improving engineering students’ climate science literacy will require strategies that also inspire students’ motivation to work toward their solution.\nA climate science course for engineers has been taught 5 semesters as part of a NASA Innovations in Climate Education program grant (NNXlOAB57A). The basic premise of this project was that effective instruction must incorporate scientifically-based knowledge and observations and foster critical thinking, problem solving, and decision-making skills. Lecture, in-class cooperative and computer-based learning and a semester project provide the basis for engaging students in evaluating effective mitigation and adaptation solutions. Policy and social issues are integrated throughout many of the units.\nThe objective of this presentation is to highlight the content and pedagogical approach used in this class that helped to contribute to significant gains in engineering students’ climate literacy and critical thinking competencies. A total of 89 students fully participated in a pre/post climate literacy questionnaire. As a whole, students demonstrated significant gains in climate-related content knowledge (p<0.001), affect (p<0.001), and behavior (p=0.002). Mean post scores were above a ‘passing’ cutoff (70%) for all three subscales. Assessment of semester project reports with a critical thinking rubric showed that the students did an excellent job of formulating problem statements and solutions in a manner that incorporated a multidimensional systems perspective. These skills are sometimes foreign to technically focused, number crunching engineering students, but are critical for using their engineering skills and profession to address climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.",

            "abstract": "Natural resource managers and infrastructure planners face increasingly complex challenges, given competing demands for resources and changing conditions due to climate and land use change. These pressures create demand for high-quality, timely data; for both one-time decision support and long-term monitoring; and for techniques to articulate the value of resources in monetary and nonmonetary terms. To meet the need for data, the U.S. government invests several billion dollars per year in Earth observations collected from satellite, airborne, terrestrial, and ocean-based systems. Earth observation-based decision support is coming of age; user surveys show that these data are used in an increasing variety of analyses. For example, since the U.S. Department of the Interior/U.S. Geological Survey’s (USGS) 2008 free and open data policy for the Landsat satellites, downloads from the USGS archive have increased from 20,000 Landsat scenes per year to 10 million per year and climbing, with strong growth in both research and decision support fields. However, Earth observation-based decision support still poses users a number of challenges. Many of those Landsat downloads support a specialized community of remote sensing scientists, though new technologies promise to increase the usability of remotely sensed data for the larger GIS community supporting planning and resource management. Serving this larger community also requires supporting the development of increasingly interpretive products, and of new approaches to host and update products. For example, automating updates will add value to new essential climate variable products such as surface water extent and wildfire burned area extent. Projections of future urbanization in the southeastern U.S. are most useful when long-term land cover trends are integrated with street-level community data and planning tools. The USGS assessment of biological carbon sequestration in vegetation and shallow soils required a significant research investment in satellite and in situ measurements and biogeochemical and climate modeling, and is already providing decision support at a variety of scales; once operationalized, it will be a tool for adaptive management from field-scale soil and wetland conservation projects to national-scale policy.",

            "abstract": "Understanding river-floodplain hydraulic processes is fundamental to promote comprehension of related water paths, biogeochemicalcyclesand ecosystems. Large river basins around the globe present enormous developed floodplains, which strongly affect flood waves and water dynamics. Since most of these river-floodplain interactions are not monitored, it is interesting to develop strategies to understand such processes through characteristic hydrological signatures, e.g. hydrographs. We studied observed hydrographs from large South American rivers and found that in several cases rivers with extensive wetlands present a particular hydrograph shape, with slower rising limb in relation to the receding one, due to storage effects and the associated decrease of wave celerity with stage. A negative asymmetry in the hydrograph is generated, which is higher when more water flows through floodplains upstream of the observed point. Finally, we studied the Amazon basin using gauged information and simulation results from the MGB-IPH regional hydrological model. Major rivers with larger wetland areas (e.g. Purus, Madeira and Juruá) were identified with higher negative asymmetry in their hydrographs. The hydrodynamic model was run in scenarios with and without floodplains, and results supported that floodplain storage affects hydrographs in creating a negative asymmetry, besides attenuating peaks, increasing hydrograph smoothness and increasing minimum flows. Finally, different wetland types could be distinguished with hydrograph shape, e.g. differing wetlands fed by local rainfall from wetlands due to overbank flow (floodplains). These metrics and concepts on hydrograph features have great potential to infer about river-floodplain processes from large rivers and wetland systems.",

Surface reservoir age is generally assumed to be constant at the preindustrial value, but evidence suggests it has varied through time by up to 1000 years. In this study we use tephrochronology, a method of correlating tephras across different environments, to identify equivalent strata, as a tool to quantify reservoir age in the Bering Sea during the transition between the Oldest Dryas and Bolling-Allerod (14.7 kcal BP). With frequent volcanic eruptions that allow for possibility of high-resolution reservoir age reconstructions, the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands region is uniquely positioned to provide insight into the hypothesis that dense water formed in the North Pacific during the last deglaciation. We compare a massive tephra found in three deep-sea sediment cores from Umnak Plateau in the southeast Bering Sea (HLY02-02-55JPC, HLY-02-02-51JPC, and IODP Site U1339) to a tephra dated to 14.8 kcal BP from Deep Lake, Sanak Island in the Eastern Aleutians. For both the Umnak and Sanak tephras, volcanic glass shards are geochemically matched using major and trace elements from electron microprobe and laser-ablation inductively-coupled-plasma mass spectrometry. We compare 14C ages of foraminiferal species Uvigerina peregrina and Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sinistral) from just above the tephra in HLY-02-02-51JPC (1467 m) to 14C age of the corresponding tephra at Sanak Island from terrestrial plant macrofossils. The surface reservoir age found (930 ± 160 14C y) is similar to the average preindustrial value in the region (790 ± 130 14C y). Benthic-atmosphere age difference (1860 ± 200 14C y) is also comparable to the preindustrial value (2030 ± 60 14C y). These results and future work on additional tephras from these cores could have implications for evaluating the accuracy of radiocarbon reconstructions of Pacific circulation that assume a constant preindustrial surface reservoir age.",

            "abstract": "Application of land surface/hydrologic models within an operational flood forecasting system can provide probable time of occurrence and magnitude of streamflow at specific locations along a stream. Creating time-varying spatial extent of flood inundation and depth requires the use of a hydraulic or hydrodynamic model. Models differ in representing river geometry and surface roughness which can lead to different output depending on the particular model being used. The result from a single hydraulic model provides just one possible realization of the flood extent without capturing the uncertainty associated with the input or the model parameters. The objective of this study is to compare multiple hydraulic models toward generating ensemble flood inundation extents. Specifically, relative performances of four hydraulic models, including AutoRoute, HEC-RAS, HEC-RAS 2D, and LISFLOOD are evaluated under different geophysical conditions in several locations across the United States. By using streamflow output from the same hydrologic model (SWAT in this case), hydraulic simulations are conducted for three configurations: (i) hindcasting mode by using past observed weather data at daily time scale in which models are being calibrated against USGS streamflow observations, (ii) validation mode using near real-time weather data at sub-daily time scale, and (iii) design mode with extreme streamflow data having specific return periods. Model generated inundation maps for observed flood events both from hindcasting and validation modes are compared with remotely sensed images, whereas the design mode outcomes are compared with corresponding FEMA generated flood hazard maps. The comparisons presented here will give insights on probable model-specific nature of biases and their relative advantages/disadvantages as components of an operational flood forecasting system.",

We have completed the first version of catalog by JUICE project for the Japan Islands where the shallow (> 40 km) earthquakes up to M6.9 between years of 2001 and 2013. Events were relocated using the Double-Difference method for high-resolution earthquake location. NIED High-Sensitivity seismic observation (Hi-net) has been established in 2000 to observe micro-earthquakes in Japan. We take advantage of having such good and big data to revisit the problem in the past using these Hi-net data.\nWe collect NIED Hi-net hypocenter catalog, Hi-net P and S arrival data, and waveforms of magnitude up to M6.5 and down to depth of 40 km from year of 2001/Jan to 2013/Dec. Then we apply our data set to the double-difference algorithm (hypoDD) by Waldhauser and Ellsworth (2000) for high-resolution hypocenter locations.\nIt turns out to be that we relocate over 1,000,000 events for JUICE project and these events are now confined into appropriate clusters and lines. An example of applying this catalog by JUICE project is to estimate the cutoff depth where 90 % of earthquake occurred (D90) (Omuralieva et al., 2012). We now estimate the cutoff depth where 95 % of earthquake occurred (D95) by using the JUICE catalog. D95 is mainly around 15 km under the Japan Island while there the strong spatial variation throughout the Japan Island. However, some of these variations may be due to hypocenters being contaminated by intra and inner slab events and misleading a seismogenic zone for fault related events to be deeper. Since the new high-resolution catalog makes easier to distinguish hypocenters into different types, it gives shed to more detail studies. In our presentation, we will show the new JUICE catalog and its applications.",

            "abstract": "Chemical weathering mediates Earth’s carbon cycle and hence global climate over geological time-scales. Ca and Mg from silicate minerals are released to the solute phase during dissolution with carbonic acid and subsequenty buried as marine carbonate. This mechanism has provided the climatic feedback that has maintained Earth’s climate equable over geological history. Quantitative models of contemporary silicate weathering processes coupled to estimates of modern day carbon fluxes associated with silicate weathering are thus fundamental to understanding the feedbacks between the carbon cycle, climate and chemical weathering.\nEstimating the Ca and Mg released from silicate weathering is not straightforward because their fluxes are dominated by carbonate weathering. Instead, contemporary silicate weathering fluxes are typically quantified based on Na and K fluxes in river waters because these elements are considered to be derived from silicate weathering. Silicate Ca fluxes are based on the product of the Na flux and an average Ca/Na ratio of silicate rocks. This relies on the assumption that Na and K are predominantly released by silicate mineral dissolution.\nHowever, it has been proposed that Na-Ca exchange reactions with clay on mineral surfaces could account for 80% of the Na in rivers waters. At present, none of the methods to estimate silicate weathering fluxes and associated CO2 consumption account for cation-exchange reactions largely because physical and chemical weathering were assumed to be steady state processes implying that cation exchange has no net influence on weathering fluxes.\nIn tandem, there are numerous reports of stable isotope fractionation of the elements Mg and Li that are inferred to be induced by clay minerals. At present it is not clear whether this fractionation is associated with mineral surfaces (exchange) or structural incorporation into the clays. Here we will report Mg and Li isotope analyses on dissolved, exchangeable and structural Mg and Li from a series of large river systems to determine whether Mg and Li isotopes are fractionated by exchange processes and in turn whether they can help quantify the significance of exchange processes on controlling the chemistry of natural waters, and the apparent proportions of carbonate to silicate weathering.",

The question is how much smectite in the soil causes slope failures. A study of over 100 sites in north and south Louisiana, USA, compared slopes that failed during a major El Nino winter (heavy rainfall) in 1982-1983 to similar slopes that did not fail. Soils in the slopes were tested for per cent clay, liquid limits, plasticity indices and semi-quantitative clay mineralogy. Slopes with the High Risk for failure (85-90% chance of failure in 8-15 years after construction) contained soils with a liquid limit > 54%, a plasticity index over 29%, and clay contents > 47%. Slopes with an Intermediate Risk (55-50% chance of failure in 8-15 years) contained soils with a liquid limit between 36-54%, plasticity index between 16-19%, and clay content between 32-47%. Slopes with a Low Risk chance of failure (< 5% chance of failure in 8-15 years after construction) contained soils with a liquid limit < 36%, a plasticity index < 16%, and a clay content < 32%. These data show that if one is constructing embankments and one wants to prevent slope failure of the 3:1 slopes, check the above soil characteristics before construction. If the soils fall into the Low Risk classification, construct the embankment normally. If the soils fall into the High Risk classification, one will need to use lime stabilization or heat treatments to prevent failures. Soils in the Intermediate Risk class will have to be evaluated on a case by case basis.",

Deep snow with a high albedo and low thermal conductivity inhibits ice growth in winter and minimizes ice loss in summer. Very shallow or absent snow promotes ice growth in winter and ice loss in summer. The timing of snow ablation critically impacts summer sea ice mass balance. Here we assess the accuracy of various snow on sea ice data products from reanalysis and modeling comparing them with in situ measurements. The latter are based on the Warren et al. (1999) monthly climatology derived from snow ruler measurements between 1954-1991, and on daily snow depth retrievals from few drifting ice mass balance buoys (IMB) with sufficiently long observations spanning the summer season. These were compared with snow depth data from the National Center for Environmental Prediction Department of Energy Reanalysis 2 (NCEP), the Community Climate System Model 4 (CCSM4), and the Canadian Earth System Model 2 (CanESM2). Results are quite variable in different years and regions. However, there is often good agreement between CanESM2 and IMB snow depth during the winter accumulation and spring melt periods. Regional analyses show that over the western Arctic covered primarily with multiyear ice NCEP snow depths are in good agreement with the Warren climatology while CCSM4 overestimates snow depth. However, in the Eastern Arctic which is dominated by first-year ice the opposite behavior is observed. Compared to the Warren climatology CanESM2 underestimates snow depth in all regions. Differences between different snow depth products are as large as 10 to 20 cm, with large consequences for the sea ice mass balance. However, it is also very difficult to evaluate the accuracy of reanalysis and model snow depths due to a lack of extensive, continuous in situ measurements.",

            "abstract": "Sustainable energy policies in Europe have led to a growing market for bioenergy, and especially wood pellets, as a means to reduce fossil fuel emissions and the attendant socio-environmental consequences from climate change. However the introduction of this market has the potential to create significant negative ecological impacts whose costs are borne far from Europe. Because of its existing forest products infrastructure and resources, the Southeast US is viewed as an attractive supplier of wood pellets to Europe. Consequently, a new global telecoupling has developed between these two regions linking the natural capital of one region to the energy needs and greenhouse gas abatement policy of the other. Additionally, habitat for many important wildlife species in the Southeast lie within a rapidly urbanizing region characterized by low-density auto-dependent growth. Combined, these two forcings have the potential to rapidly degrade species-rich ecosystems. Here the ecological effects of increased European demand for wood pellets are examined in North Carolina. Future land use and vegetation change were projected using the results from linked urbanization, vegetation dynamics, life cycle analysis, and forest timber economics models. Ecological impacts as measured for 16 amphibian and avian species were evaluated under five bioenergy production scenarios and one urbanization-only scenario. Results indicate that highly vagile or upland species are able to take advantage of the increase in vegetated land cover, even if the majority of new habitat is in intensively managed forests. Conversely, more sessile and range-limited species, particularly those found in coastal plain systems such as bottomland hardwood forest, show steeper declines under the wood pellet scenarios than under the urbanization-only scenario. These results highlight the challenge of evaluating the sustainability of developing markets that seek to mitigate certain aspects of global environmental change but risk exacerbating others.",

            "abstract": "The environmental sciences are at the forefront of critical issues facing society in the coming decades. As a result, many graduates in the environmental sciences find themselves working with the public to help inform the democratic process of making reasonable public policies. In order to be successful, students need to be confronted with the same kinds of questions and problems that practicing scientists face when they are working at the intersection of science and public policy. Otherwise, they lack the skills and confidence needed to work effectively with the public—especially on hotly contested environmental issues when the skills are needed the most. As part of a new Professional Science Master’s (PSM) Program in Climate Science and Solutions at Northern Arizona University we have developed a three-semester course series focused on framing discussions on climate change mitigation and adaptation. Each semester, students use a deliberative model to design, frame, and facilitate a public discussion on a targeted issue of regional and local interest. The deliberative model is built around an approach to practical dilemmas that enables students to isolate and clarify the various sources of conflict around the issue. Working in an iterative manner, students learn to identify and untangling some of the sources of disagreement (e.g., policy, ethics and ideals, difference in scientific understanding) around and issue. As a result, students are in a much better position to clarify the key questions and sort through the competing solutions. The course series helps to improve the communication skills of students and promote productive public discourse with individuals from diverse backgrounds within the community. This type of experiential learning provides unique training to our students that not only broadens there understanding of complex issues surrounding climate change, but also provides them with professional skills that are transferrable to their careers.",

However, it was previously unclear whether trace element data from these corals were internally reproducible and could therefore be used as reliable climate proxies. This study tests the internal reproducibility of Ba/Ca in the calcite of nine bamboo corals to further develop a new proxy for dissolved Ba in seawater (BaSW). Trace element LA-ICP-MS data were collected along three replicate radii of varying lengths of the calcitic internodes of well-dated corals collected live from the Gulf of Alaska (720m and 643m) and the California Margin (870m, 1012m, 1295m, 1500m, 1521m, 1954m, and 2054m; samples from 1295-1521m are not yet dated). Data were aligned using visible bands measured with a petrographic microscope to account for irregular growth. Ba/Ca data filtered with a 50µm (1.5-2 year) moving average were reproducible within each coral to 2.9 ± 2.1% (n=3 radii/coral, 9 corals), suggesting that regional geochemical signals are recorded as reproducible Ba/Ca signals on >annual timescales. Coral Ba/Ca presents an excellent proxy for BaSW, which has been found to be correlated with refractory nutrients (e.g. silicate) and oxygen minima. Increasing BaSW with depth and increased variability near 1000m suggests that BaSW is not constant with depth or with time. Several factors, including barite saturation state, particulate organic carbon (POC) remineralization rate, and particle sinking time, may be involved in the observed changes in BaSW. Further examination of such mechanisms could provide new insights into modern changes in deep-sea biogeochemistry.",

            "abstract": "There is increasing demand from decision makers for fine scale climate information that is relevant and useful for regional and local adaptation planning. While global climate models (GCMs) are vital for understanding large-scale changes in global circulation patterns, the horizontal resolution of a typical GCM is too coarse for use in local impact studies. A number of methods have been implemented to translate coarse GCM climate projections down to the regional and local scale. These range from the simplest delta approach to complex dynamical downscaling models. With so many diverse methods of downscaling now available, there is a need to perform robust comparisons and evaluations of the different techniques. In this study we explore how the choice of downscaling method may influence the climate change response of important impacts related variables. Our goal is to identify the uncertainty in future climate change associated with different downscaling methods. We then examine how the uncertainty associated with downscaling can affect vulnerability assessments and adaptation planning.\nWe focus on the impact of climate change to extremes in three sectors: forest fire risk management, heat stress and human health, and energy consumption by buildings. For each sector, an impacts relevant index is used to assess current and future risk. The Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI) is used for fire, the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT) is used for heat stress, and heating and cooling degree-days are used for energy consumption. Local climate changes have been calculated for each sector using four downscaling techniques: the delta method, a bias correction method (KDDM), the statistical downscaling model (SDSM), and dynamical downscaling with NARCCAP. Climate response surfaces (e.g. response of KBDI to changes in temp. and precip.) are generated at four locations in the United States. Response surfaces are a useful tool to help decision makers estimate the vulnerability to climate change. The downscaled climate changes are then layered over each response surface to see how likely future projections are and if the downscaling methods result in different levels of uncertainty. Differences in downscaling method may be a critical source of uncertainty that is currently overlooked by decision makers.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture is a dynamic variable of great importance for water cycling and climate, as well as for ecosystems and societal sectors such as agriculture. Model representation of soil moisture and its temporal variability is, for instance, central for assessing the impacts of hydro-climatic change on drought and flood risks. However, our ability to assess such impacts and guide appropriate mitigation and adaptation measures is challenged by the need to link data and modeling across a range of spatiotemporal scales of relevance for the variability and change of soil moisture in long-term time series. This paper synthesizes recent advances for meeting this challenge by a relatively simple, analytical, data-driven approach to modeling the variability and change of large-scale soil moisture under long-term hydro-climatic change. Model application to two major Swedish drainage basins, and model-data comparison for ten study catchments across the United States shows the model ability to reproduce variability dynamics in long-term data series of the key soil-moisture variables: unsaturated water content and groundwater table position. The Swedish application shows that human-driven hydro-climatic shifts may imply increased risk for hydrological drought (runoff-related) and agricultural drought (soil moisture-related), even though meteorological drought risk (precipitation-related) is unchanged or lowered. The direct model-data comparison for ten U.S. catchments further shows good model representation of seasonal and longer-term fluctuation timings and frequencies for water content and groundwater level, along with physically reasonable model tendency to underestimate the local fluctuation magnitudes. Overall, the tested modeling approach can fulfill its main aim of screening long-term time series of large-scale hydro-climatic data (historic or projected for the future by climate modeling) for relatively simple, unexaggerated assessment of variability and change in key statistics of soil moisture over large spatiotemporal scales.",

            "abstract": "Over the last decades, cosmogenic exposure dating permitted major advances in Earth surface sciences, and particularly in paleoclimatology. Yet, exposure age calculation is a dense procedure. It requires numerous choices of parameterization and the use of an appropriate production rate. Nowadays, Earth surface scientists may either calculate exposure ages on their own or use the available programs. However, these programs do not offer the possibility to include all the most recent advances in Cosmic Ray Exposure (CRE) dating. Notably, they do not propose the most recent production rate datasets and they only offer few possibilities to test the impact of the atmosphere model and the geomagnetic model on the computed ages.\nWe present the CREp program, a Matlab © code that computes CRE ages for 3He and 10Be over the last 2 million years. The CREp program includes the scaling models of Lal-Stone in the \"Lal modified\" version (Balco et al., 2008; Lal, 1991; Stone, 2000) and the LSD model (Lifton et al., 2014). For any of these models, CREP allows choosing between the ERA-40 atmosphere model (Uppala et al., 2005) and the standard atmosphere (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 1976). Regarding the geomagnetic database, users can opt for one of the three proposed datasets: Muscheler et al. 2005, GLOPIS-75 (Laj et al. 2004) and the geomagnetic framework proposed in the LSD model (Lifton et al., 2014). They may also import their own geomagnetic database.\nImportantly, the reference production rate can be chosen among a large variety of possibilities. We made an effort to propose a wide and homogenous calibration database in order to promote the use of local calibration rates: CREp includes all the calibration data published until July 2015 and will be able to access an updated online database including all the newly published production rates. This is crucial for improving the ages accuracy. Users may also choose a global production rate or use their own data to either calibrate a production rate or directly input a Sea Level High Latitude value.\nThe program is fast to calculate a large number of ages and to export the final density probability function associated with each age into an Excel © spreadsheet format.",

            "abstract": "Leaf area index (LAI) is a key parameter in global ecosystem studies. LAI is considered a forcing variable in land surface processing models since ecosystem dynamics are highly correlated to LAI. In response to environmental limitations, plants in semiarid ecosystems have smaller leaf area, making accurate estimation of LAI by remote sensing a challenging issue. Optical remote sensing (400-2500 nm) techniques to estimate LAI are based either on radiative transfer models (RTMs) or statistical approaches. Considering the complex radiation field of dry ecosystems, simple 1-D RTMs lead to poor results, and on the other hand, inversion of more complex 3-D RTMs is a demanding task which requires the specification of many variables. A good alternative to physical approaches is using methods based on statistics. Similar to many natural phenomena, there is a non-linear relationship between LAI and top of canopy electromagnetic waves reflected to optical sensors. Non-linear regression models can better capture this relationship. However, considering the problem of a few numbers of observations in comparison to the feature space (n<p), these models will not necessarily outperform the more simple linear models.\nIn this study linear versus non-linear regression techniques were investigated to estimate LAI. Our study area is located in southwestern Idaho, Great Basin. Sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata spp) serves a critical role in maintaining the structure of this ecosystem. Using a leaf area meter (Accupar LP-80), LAI values were measured in the field. Linear Partial Least Square regression and non-linear, tree based Random Forest regression have been implemented to estimate the LAI of sagebrush from hyperspectral data (AVIRIS-ng) collected in late summer 2014. Cross validation of results indicate that PLS can provide comparable results to Random Forest.",

            "abstract": "Rootless cones form when degassed lava interacts explosively with water contained in the near-surface substrate, and represents an end-member system that can elucidate mechanisms of magma–water interactions due to the absence of primary degassing-induced fragmentation. The proportion of finely fragmented ejecta (i.e. ash), generated in rootless explosions, even if the volume is small relative to coarser ejecta, may contribute significantly to the explosion energy release. Explosive melt–water experiments indicate that the degree of melt–water mixing and energy release are proportional to the abundance of blocky grains, fragmented by brittle disintegration, which effectively contribute thermal energy to the explosive lava–water interaction. In order to determine the state of the lava at the point of ash-grade fragmentation in rootless explosions we examined grain morphology over the following size ranges: 0.5–0 ϕ (1.41–1 mm, very coarse ash), 1.5–2 ϕ (0.354–0.250 mm, medium ash), and 3.5–4 ϕ (0.088–0.062 mm, very fine ash). We found that rootless ash is composed of blocky, mossy, and fluidal grains with a minor component of aggregates (≤ 2%) and glassy shards (< 35%). Typically, (1) very coarse ash contains blocky (9–58%), mossy (8–36%) and fluidal (28–67%) grains only, (2) medium ash contains blocky (32-76%), mossy (9–39%) and fluidal (15–43%) grains with a minor abundance of glassy shards (≤ 8%), and (3) very fine ash is dominated by blocky clasts (53-80%), with lower shard (12–34%) and fluidal (4–24%) components. We observe that the abundance of fluidal grains decreases while the abundance of blocky grains increases with decreasing grain size. Also, the abundance of blocky grains decreases with increasing stratigraphic height, indicating that as rootless explosions progressed, brittle fragmentation of lava is less pronounced, suggesting that the efficiency of lava–water mixing dropped, most likely due to reduced availability of external water. However, we do not observe consistent correlation between the abundance of blocky grains and the proportion of ash or mean grain size of individual beds, both of which are a function of explosion energy. Therefore, future work could improve upon this work by taking into account the total bed mass, and provide estimates of the mass of different ash morphologies.",

            "abstract": "Mapping and quantifying the surface expression of geothermal heat flux in volcanic geothermal areas is important for establishing baseline thermal activity to better detect and understand any future changes that may be related to hydrothermal or volcanic processes, or human activities. Volcanic geothermal areas are often too large and inaccessible for only field-based thermal monitoring, so thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing tools are also used. High resolution (sub-meter) airborne TIR imagery can be used for detailed, quantitative analyses of small, subtle geothermal features. Airborne data acquisitions have the advantage of being able to be acquired under ideal conditions (e.g., predawn, cloud-free), but the disadvantage of high costs – thus precluding high-frequency monitoring. Satellite-based TIR data from the Landsat 8 platform are freely available and can be acquired regularly for change detection, but are acquired with coarser spatial resolution (e.g., 100-m pixels), and thus are not as sensitive to subtle thermal characteristics.\nTwo geothermal areas with clear, nighttime TIR data from nearly concurrent (within days) airborne and spaceborne instruments were investigated: Norris Geyser Basin in Yellowstone National Park, WY; and the Casa Diablo geothermal field, near Mammoth Lakes, CA. At Norris Geyser Basin, the area covered by high-resolution airborne TIR imagery is almost entirely geothermally heated ground, with hundreds of fumaroles, hot springs, and thermal drainages – although some non-geothermal background is exposed. With the coarser resolution Landsat 8 data, there are thermal variations within the smaller area covered by the airborne data, but the entire area appears to be thermally anomalous with respect to the non-geothermal background outside the basin. In the geothermal field around the Casa Diablo geothermal site, there are numerous, small areas of geothermal heating that are clearly distinguishable above the background by the high-resolution airborne nighttime TIR imaging. Most of the thermal radiance contrast in the Landsat 8 TIR image is due to slope, surface cover type, and albedo, but there are some very subtle variations in thermally emitted radiance that are spatially coincident with the thermally anomalous areas identified with the airborne data.",

            "abstract": "Over half of global soil organic carbon (SOC) is stored in subsurface soils (>30 cm), but little is known about the vulnerability of this deep SOC to climate change. Most soil warming experiments have only warmed surface soils, so the temperature sensitivity of deeper SOC and its potential to generate a positive feedback to climate change is undetermined. We are currently investigating how SOC down to 1 m deep responds to experimental in situ soil warming (+4°C). Our field site is a coniferous forest in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada in California, USA, whose soils are sandy, mixed, mesic Ultic Haploxeralfs. Our objectives are to understand (1) how the mechanisms controlling SOC turnover differ with depth and (2) how the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration differs by depth. Warming began in October 2013, and we have successfully warmed 1 m of the soil profile to 4°C (±0.5) above ambient temperatures at each depth and maintained this warming throughout different seasons. We have taken monthly surface CO2 flux measurements and monthly gas samples from stainless steel tubes at 15, 30, 50, 70, and 90 cm depths. We have collected soil water from tension lysimeters at 30 and 70 cm after large rain events. Warming has increased CO2 production at all depths of the warmed plots. Warming has also significantly increased soil respiration from the surface by 39% relative to the control and increased concentrations of dissolved organic carbon in soil water at both depths. The apparent Q10 of surface soil respiration and CO2 production at all depths is greater than 2, indicating that decomposition is similarly temperature sensitive at all depths. This study is one of the first to test whole-profile SOC responses to warming and shows that deep soil carbon is equally vulnerable to climate change in these upland mineral soils.",

            "abstract": "The structure of the North American Mid-Continent Rift Zone (MCRZ) is examined using Rayleigh waves from teleseismic earthquakes and ambient seismic noise recorded by the Superior Province Rifting EarthScope Experiment (SPREE). Eighty-four broadband seismometers were deployed during 2011-2013 in Minnesota and Wisconsin, USA, and Ontario, CA, along three lines; two across the rift axis and the third along the rift axis. These stations, together with the EarthScope Transportable Array, provided excellent coverage of the MCRZ. The 1.1 Ga Mesoproterozoic failed rift consists of two arms, buried under post-rifting sedimentary formations that meet at Lake Superior. We compare two array-based tomography methods using teleseismic fundamental mode Rayleigh waves phase and amplitude measurements: the two-plane wave method (TPWM, Forsyth, 1998) and the automated surface wave phase velocity measuring system (ASWMS, Jin and Gaherty, 2015). Both array methods and the ambient noise method give relatively similar results showing low velocity zones extending along the MCRZ arms. The teleseismic Rayleigh wave results from 18 - 180 s period are combined with short period phase velocity results (period 8-30 s) obtained from ambient noise by cross correlation. Phase velocities from the methods are very similar at periods of 18-30 where results overlap; in this period range we use the average of the noise and teleseismic results. Finally the combined phase velocity curve is inverted using a Monte-Carlo inversion method at each geographic point in the model. The results show low velocities at shallow depths (5-10 km) that are the result of very deep sedimentary fill within the MCRZ. Deeper-seated low velocity regions may correspond to mafic underplating of the rift zone.",

            "abstract": "Silicon is an important candidate for the light element in the outer core. Here we present new measurements of the equation-of-state, thermal expansion, melting temperature, and thermal conductivity of iron silicide (Fe5Si3) at high pressures and temperatures. We performed a series of X-ray diffraction experiments in the laser-heated diamond anvil cell on Fe5Si3 at ALS beamline 12.2.2. Diffraction patterns and temperature-versus-laser power curves were measured in situ at pressures up to 58 GPa and temperatures up to 2300 K. In one set of experiments both NaCl and Ne were used as the pressure transmitting, thermal insulator and pressure calibrant. In a second set of experiments, only NaCl was present and served those three purposes. The measurements yield a new thermoelastic equation of state for Fe5Si3, including bulk modulus, high-pressure thermal expansion, and the Grüneisen parameter. In addition, we have determined a lower bound on the melting behavior up to 58 GPa. This information helps constrain compositionally-sensitive models describing the density, compressibility, and dynamics of Earth’s core. The temperature-versus-laser power measurements provide information about the heat flow environment in the diamond anvil cell. A comparison of the temperature-versus-laser power measurements for pure iron and Fe5Si3 yields a measure of how the presence of Si influences the thermal conductivity of iron at high pressures and temperatures. Our measurements also show a jump in thermal conductivity of NaCl across the B1- B2 phase transition. This information is important for interpreting thermal conductivity values in the present work and also has broader implications for experimental design and data interpretation in laser-heated diamond anvil cell experiments.",

            "abstract": "Contemporary harvesting practices have been shown to reduce sediment transport rates relative to historic practices; however, it is not well understood how these practices interact with climate to influence sediment flux and source. We are currently studying sedimentation rates in Loon Lake, in the Oregon Coast Range. The watershed of Loon Lake is 80% privately owned, and is therefore an ideal system for examining the effect of policy affected management shifts on water quality and sediment transport. We analyzed one 690cm core that represents about 1500yrs of sedimentation in the lake. We measured accumulation by layer thickness and character by proxies of elemental analysis, magnetic susceptibility, particle size, and bulk density. Radionuclides and radiocarbon dates provide an age model with depth downcore. Our preliminary results show that there is some evidence that the sedimentation rate in the lake decreased around the time of passing of the Oregon Forest Practices Act when climate is taken into account; pre-OFPA, the estimated mean sedimentation rate was 1.0 cm/year, and post-OFPA, the estimated mean sedimentation rate was 0.76 cm/year. Both of these sedimentation rates appear to be different than pre-European settlement period which averaged about 0.40 cm/year; however, this conclusion is preliminary. In general, it seems there is some evidence that the Best Management Practices instituted with OFPA are associated with lower sedimentation rates. In our presentation we will discuss the role of forestry and climate in changing these sedimentation rates and compare these modern sedimentation rates with sedimentation in the pre-settlement period.",

            "abstract": "Climate change has crucial effects on cities and especially for informal settlements, urban poor and other vulnerable groups by influencing human health, assets and livelihoods. These impacts directly result from the variations in temperature and precipitation, and emergence of heat waves, droughts, floods and fires (IPCC, 2014). Summertime episodes with extremely high air temperatures which last for several days or longer are addressed to as heat waves and affect the weather and climate in the globe.\nThe aim of this study is to analyze the occurrence of heat waves in terms of quantity, duration and frequency and also to evaluate the accuracy of the COSMO-CLM (CCLM) model in reproducing the characteristics of heat waves in Istanbul. The summer maximum temperatures of six Turkish State Meteorological Service (TSMS) stations are selected between 1960 and 2014 to estimate the characteristics of heat waves in Istanbul. We define the heat wave if the maximum temperatures exceed a threshold value for at least three consecutive days. The threshold value is determined as 30.5 from the 90th percentile of all six station’s observations. Then it is used in the detection of the hot days, heat waves and their durations. The results show that not only the number of heat waves but also duration of heat waves increase towards the end of the study period. Especially, a significant increase in heat wave events is evident after 1990s. In 2012, the number of hot days reaches the maximum value in all stations and Kartal station located southern part of city, has the highest value of 60 hot days. Furthermore, Kartal as an urban area in the Asian side of the city, exhibits highest heat wave duration with 18 consecutive days in 1998.\nTo estimate the relationship between urban heat island intensity and the heat waves, we examined data at 43 stations collected by Disaster Coordination Center and TSMS between 2007 and 2012. Urban heat island phenomenon is found to be related to higher increasing rates of hot-day frequency at the urbanized areas. Beside these, in order to examine the performance of CCLM model in reproducing the characteristics of heat waves over Istanbul, simulations by CCLM forced by ERA-Interim reanalysis data between 2007 and 2012 are analyzed. Verifications are carried out in terms of the timing of the event, intensity, duration and spatial extent.",

Yet simulations of some fundamental aspects of\nclimate like precipitation or aerosol forcing remain highly uncertain\nand resistent to progress. Dust aerosol modeling of soil particles\nlofted by wind erosion has seen a similar conflict between increasing\nmodel sophistication and remaining uncertainty. Dust aerosols perturb\nthe energy and water cycles by scattering radiation and acting as ice\nnuclei, while mediating atmospheric chemistry and marine\nphotosynthesis (and thus the carbon cycle). These effects take place\nacross scales from the dimensions of an ice crystal to the\nplanetary-scale circulation that disperses dust far downwind of its\nparent soil. Representing this range leads to several modeling\nchallenges. Should we limit complexity in our model, which consumes\ncomputer resources and inhibits interpretation? How do we decide if a\nprocess involving dust is worthy of inclusion within our model? Can\nwe identify a minimal representation of a complex process that is\nefficient yet retains the physics relevant to climate? Answering\nthese questions about the appropriate degree of representation is\nguided by model evaluation, which presents several more challenges.\nHow do we proceed if the available observations do not directly\nconstrain our process of interest? (This could result from competing\nprocesses that influence the observed variable and obscure the\nsignature of our process of interest.)

We previously used volumetric strain data from during one of these explosions to elucidate the geometry of the shallow plumbing system and crustal mechanics at Montserrat for mechanically plausible depressurisation amplitudes. Our results from both forward and inverse 2D models found that it was necessary to incorporate a mechanically weak shallow crust and mechanically compliant halo of material around the highest part of the SHV magmatic system i.e. the conduit, in order to implement geologically realistic conditions of depressurisation and rock strength. However, this model lacks complexity that cannot be implemented in a 2D environment. Here, in the first study of its kind, we use Finite Element Analysis of volumetric strain data in a 3D domain incorporating topography and mechanical complexities as imaged by seismic and gravimetric data. Our model implements topography from a DEM covering the island and surrounding bathymetry and include the mechanically stiff extinct volcanic cores of the Silver Hills and the Centre Hills.

Unfortunately, constants like Manning's n in common parameterizations\nof bottom stress are not directly measurable, while in situ measurement of bathymetry can be expensive and impractical in many environments.\nThis leads to the need to solve one or more inverse problems to estimate depths and/or roughness parameters using available data, which may be limited to surface velocities and/or free-surface elevations. While a variety of techniques can be used to solve the resulting inverse problem, many involve a sampling step that can be expected to require a large number of forward simulations for real systems.\nHere, we consider model reduction for free-surface flows based on Galerkin projection on a global basis provided by Proper Orthogonal\nDecomposition (POD). To achieve realistic speedup, we evaluate alternative hyper-reduction methods for non-polynomial nonlinearities that arise in standard formulations. We evaluate the schemes' performance by considering their accuracy, robustness, and speed for a variety of hydrodynamic regimes in the context of both forward simulation and sampling strategies for inverse problems.",

Using two downscaled CMIP3 General Circulation Models (ECHAM5 and CCCMA) and a mid-range emissions scenario (A1B) at a 1 km2 resolution, we compared simulated tundra afforestation rates and flammability from four parameterizations of EMF effects on seedling establishment and growth from 2000-2100. Modeling predicted an 8.8-18.2% increase in forest cover from 2000 to 2100. Simulations that explicitly represented landscape variability in EMF inoculum potential showed up to a 2.8% reduction in afforestation due to low inoculum potential limiting seedling growth. This reduction limited fuel availability and thus, cumulative area burned. Regardless of inclusion of EMF effects in simulations, landscape flammability was lower for simulations driven by the wetter and cooler CCCMA model than the warmer and drier ECHAM5 model, while tundra conversion to forest was greater. Results suggest abiotic factors are the primary driver of tree migration. Simulations including EMF effects, a biotic factor, yielded more conservative estimates of landcover change across Alaska that better-matched empirical estimates from the previous century.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic unrest is often identified by increased rates of seismicity, deformation, or the release of volcanic gases. Deformation results when ascending magma accumulates in crustal reservoirs, creates new pathways to the surface, or drains from magma reservoirs to feed an eruption. This volcanic deformation is overprinted by deformation from tectonic processes. GNSS monitoring of volcanoes captures transient volcanic deformation and steady and transient tectonic deformation, and we use the TDEFNODE software to unravel these effects. We apply the technique on portions of the Cascades Volcanic arc in central Oregon and in southern Washington that include a deforming volcano. In central Oregon, the regional TDEFNODE model consists of several blocks that rotate and deform internally and a decaying inflationary volcanic pressure source to reproduce the crustal bulge centered ~5 km west of South Sister. We jointly invert 47 interferograms that cover the interval from 1992 to 2010, as well as 2001 to 2015 continuous GNSS (cGNSS) and survey-mode (sGNSS) time series from stations in and around the Three Sisters, Newberry, and Crater Lake areas. A single, smoothly-decaying ~5 km deep spherical or prolate spheroid volcanic pressure source activated around 1998 provides the best fit to the combined geodetic data. In southern Washington, GNSS displacement time-series track decaying deflation of a ~8 km deep magma reservoir that fed the 2004 to 2008 eruption of Mount St. Helens. That deformation reversed when it began to recharge after the eruption ended. Offsets from slow slip events on the Cascadia subduction zone punctuate the GNSS displacement time series, and we remove them by estimating source parameters for these events. This regional TDEFNODE model extends from Mount Rainier south to Mount Hood, and additional volcanic sources could be added if these volcanoes start deforming. Other TDEFNODE regional models are planned for northern Washington (Mount Baker and Glacier Peak), northern California (Mount Shasta, Medicine Lake, Lassen Peak), and Long Valley. These models take advantage of the data from dense GNSS networks, they provide source parameters for volcanic and tectonic transients, and can be used to discriminate possible short- and long-term volcano- tectonic interactions.",

            "abstract": "The mountain pine beetle (MPB), Dendroctonus ponderosae, has caused significant tree mortality within North America. Specifically, the MPB affects ponderosa pine and lodgepole pine forests within the Rocky Mountains with approximately 3.4 million acres of forest impacted over the past 20 years. The full impacts of such unprecedented tree mortality on hydrology and slope stability is not well understood. This work studies the affects of MPB infestation on slope instability. A large-scale statistical analysis of MPB and slope stability is combined with a more in-depth analysis of the factors that contribute to slope stability. These factors include: slope aspect, slope angle, root decay, regrowth and hydrologic properties, such as water table depth and soil moisture. Preliminary results show that MPB may affect a greater number of north- and east-facing slopes. This is in accordance with more water availability and a higher MPB impacted tree density on north-facing slopes which, in turn, could potentially increase the probability of slope failure. Root strength is predicted to decrease as the roots stop transpiring 3-4 years proceeding infestation. However, this effect on the hillslope is likely being counterbalanced by the regrowth of grasses, forbs, shrubs, and trees. In addition, the increase in water table height from the lack of transpiring trees is adding a driving force to the slopes. The combination of all these factors will be used in order to assess the effects of MPB tree mortality on slope stability.",

            "abstract": "It has been widely recognized that accurate and precise decay constants (λ) are critical to geochronology as highlighted by the EARTHTIME initiative, particularly the calibration benchmarks λ235U and λ238U.\n[1]\nAlpha counting experiments in 1971\n[2]\nmeasured λ235U and λ238U with ~0.1% precision, but have never been independently validated. We are embarking on new direct measurements of λ235U, λ238U, λ234Th, and λ234U using independent approaches for each nuclide. For the measurement of λ235U, highly enriched 235U samples will be chemically purified and analyzed for U concentration and isotopic composition by multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). Thin films will be electrodeposited from these solutions and the α activity will be measured in an α-γ coincidence counting apparatus, which allows reduced uncertainty in counting efficiency while achieving adequate counting statistics. For λ238U measurement we will measure ingrowth of 234Th in chemically purified, isotopically enriched 238U solutions, by quantitatively separating the Th and allowing complete decay to 234U. All of the measurements will be done using MC-ICP-MS aiming at 0.05% precision. This approach is expected to result in values of λ238U with less than 0.1% uncertainty, if combined with improved λ234Th measements. These will be achieved using direct decay measurements with an E-∆E charged particle telescope in coincidence with a gamma detector. This system allows measurement of 234Th β-decay and simultaneous detection and identification of α particles emitted by the 234U daughter, thus observing λ234U at the same time. The high-precision λ234U obtained by the direct activity measurements can independently verify the commonly used values obtained by indirect methods.\n[3]\nAn overarching goal of the project is to ensure the quality of results including metrological traceability in order to facilitate implementation across diverse disciplines.\n\n[1] T.M.

Baddeleyite-zircon concordia ages are 130.3 ± 0.5 Ma (all uncertainties reported at 2σ) and 131.3 ± 0.7 Ma, within the range of previously reported step-heating 40Ar/39Ar ages (133.1 ± 0.5 to 130.8 ± 0.4 Ma), confirming a good coherency between crystallization and cooling ages.\nThree distinct samples of the José Fernandes Gabbro were investigated (melagabbro, banded gabbro and quartz monzogabbro). Preliminary baddeleyite U-Pb ages obtained for a crust-contaminated quartz monzogabbro (52-56% SiO2; ~4% K2O; δ18O= +6.7 to +7.5‰; eNd(T)= -10) yielded a weighted mean 206Pb/238U data of 133.56 ± 0.31 Ma as the age for the intrusion.

            "abstract": "There is strong evidence that local, non-thermal heating of ions seen in the solar corona extends into interplanetary space, beyond the orbit of Earth. Even with detailed and long duration observations of solar wind thermal plasma and electromagnetic fields, major questions related to this heating remain unresolved. What is the physical process responsible for this heating? Is the same mechanism acting in the corona and in the solar wind? Are there multiple heating mechanisms that act at different levels depending on local conditions such as plasma beta? A large hurdle to date in resolving these questions is that the various candidate heating mechanisms produce similar results (i.e. radial temperature profiles, ion velocity distribution functions) as an end state, and thus are difficult to distinguish between. Here a new analysis technique is presented to identify the relative role of three common categories of local ion heating mechanisms: interaction with current sheets generated by turbulent dissipation, resonance with ion cyclotron waves, and interaction with kinetic Alfven waves. By correlating variations of ions at specific energies and magnetic fluctuations at varying spatial scales we can distinguish between different wave dispersion relations within the plasma, or identify the lack of a dispersive relation altogether. This technique is applicable to existing observations on the DSCOVR spacecraft, and to future missions such as Solar Probe Plus or THOR.",

Our approach allows for improved subsurface shear wave velocity estimates compared to established single component, multi-channel (MASW) methods. We show that the phase velocity vs. frequency relationship of the fundamental Rayleigh wave mode can become contaminated when higher mode Rayleigh waves interfere with the fundamental mode dispersion. Under many geological models, we observe higher mode contamination and these higher velocity modes can lead to low relative coherence along the fundamental mode dispersion path or an overestimation of shear wave velocities with depth. For a typical range of frequencies utilized in active source surface wave analysis (5-100 Hz), the fundamental mode propagates in retrograde motion at the surface. For many earth models, higher mode Rayleigh waves can propagate in prograde motion. By utilizing vertical and horizontal inline seismic components, we can measure particle motion direction and selectively remove the prograde higher mode Rayleigh wave signals via our polar mute approach. We show with numerical models and field results that by removing these higher modes, we can better isolate the fundamental Rayleigh wave dispersion to improve our confidence of shear wave velocity estimates with depth compared to a single channel approach.",

In NE Nevada, the Eocene Elko Formation represents ~10 Myr of high-elevation (up to 3.5 km) lacustrine deposition within a Paleogene orogenic plateau interior, prior to Neogene extensional collapse. Detrital zircon U-Pb and (U-Th)/He (ZHe) double dating from the Elko Formation constrains the timing and magnitude of tectonic-scale processes as well as the evolution of hinterland paleohydrology and magmatism. Eocene maximum depositional ages from detrital zircon are largely consistent with new single crystal sanidine 40Ar/39Ar ages for Elko Formation tuff beds.\nU-Pb-He double dating of Eocene sediments supports several phases of exhumation and surface uplift in the hinterland. ZHe ages, combined with U-Pb geochronology, clast assemblages, and paleocurrent analysis suggest a significant amount of detritus from the Roberts Mountain Allochthon (RMA) and back-arc plutons was transported to the Elko Basin during the middle Eocene. Detrital zircons sourced from the RMA record progressive unroofing and are characterized by Archean-Paleoproterozoic crystallization ages and Mesoproterozoic-Triassic cooling ages. The preponderance of Precambrian ZHe ages during the middle-late Eocene and the absence of reset ZHe ages throughout the basin imply that sediment burial did not exceed depths of >6 km during the Phanerozoic. Double dating of several grains from a sandstone below the base of the lacustrine section also confirms the presence of volcanic detritus derived from the Challis volcanic field of central Idaho 400 kilometers to the northeast.\nLag time analysis permits discrimination of syndepositional volcanic grains from grains derived from rapidly exhumed sources. Lag time analysis (excluding volcanic grains) indicates that several source areas west of the Elko Basin have undergone major exhumation during the late Eocene.",

            "abstract": "California State University, East Bay (CSUEB), located in Hayward, California, lies atop the San Leandro block (SLB) in the Hayward fault zone. The SLB is a J-K aged lithotectonic assemblage dominated by gabbro and intercalated with minor volcanics and sediments. It is bound by the subparallel northwest-trending western Hayward and eastern Chabot (CF) faults and pervasively cut by anastomosing secondary faults. The block itself is ~30 km along strike and 2-3 km wide. Previous studies suggest the block dips steeply to the northeast and extends to a depth of at least 7 km. In May of 2015, as part of an ongoing collaborative effort led by the USGS to create a 3D velocity model of the San Francisco Bay Area, researchers from CSUEB and the USGS conducted a seismic survey on the CSUEB campus. The primary goal of this pilot study was to locate the trace of the CF on the CSUEB campus and to determine bedrock depth. We deployed a 60-channel, 300m profile using 4.5Hz sensors spaced at 5m intervals. Active seismic sources were used at each geophone location. A 226kg accelerated weight-drop was used to generate P and Rayleigh waves for P-wave tomography and multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW), and a 3.5kg sledgehammer and block were used to generate S and Love waves for S-wave tomography and multichannel analysis of Love waves (MALW). Preliminary P-wave tomography, MASW, and MALW results from this pilot study suggest the location of an eastward-dipping CF as well as the presence of a high-velocity unit at about 20m depth, presumably an unmapped sliver of bedrock from the San Leandro block. Further studies planned for the fall of 2015 include additional seismic lines and surface mapping along the Chabot fault on and near the CSUEB campus. These new geophysical, GPS, and field geological data will be integrated with LiDAR imagery and existing geological, gravity and magnetic maps to create a 3-dimensional model of the portion of the SLB that contains the CSUEB campus.",

EarthCollab, a cross-institutional, EarthCube funded project partnering UCAR, Cornell University, and UNAVCO, is employing the open-source semantic web software, VIVO, as the underlying technology to connect the people and resources of virtual research communities. This study will present an analysis of survey responses from members of the two case study communities: (1) the Bering Sea Project, an interdisciplinary field program whose data archive is hosted by NCAR’s Earth Observing Laboratory (EOL), and (2) UNAVCO, a geodetic facility and consortium that supports diverse research projects informed by geodesy.\nThe survey results illustrate the types of research products that respondents indicate should be discoverable within a digital platform and the current methods used to find publications, data, personnel, tools, and instrumentation. The responses showed that scientists rely heavily on general purpose search engines, such as Google, to find information, but that data center websites and the published literature were also critical sources for finding collaborators, data, and research tools.The survey participants also identify additional features of interest for an information platform such as search engine indexing, connection to institutional web pages, generation of bibliographies and CVs, and outward linking to social media. Through the survey, the user communities prioritized the type of information that is most important to display and describe their work within a research profile. The analysis of this survey will inform our further development of a platform that will facilitate different types of information discovery strategies, and help researchers to find and use the associated resources of a research project.",

In this study, we continuously observed the hydrological and biogeochemical environment of the underlying sediments during high flow events to examine the dynamic nature of the hyporheic zone. Two study reaches were established where a series of steps was present in steep headwater streams. The two reaches had the same overall channel gradient of 0.09 m/m, but the number and sizes of steps in the reach were different. The vertical head gradients created by the steps were stable during precipitation events, despite the increase in lateral inflow. Contrast to hydrological environment, the biogeochemical environment fluctuated. Organic matters and suspended sediment concentrations of stream water increased during high flow, and, as a result, the nitrate, organic matter and fine sediment concentration in the downwelling zone of the hyporheic zone increased temporarily. The results of this study suggested that the hyporheic zone of a steep headwater streams may be hydrologically stable, however, in the downwelling zone, where the effects of stream water is strong, the biogeochemical environment is dynamic.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric methane has more than doubled since the industrial revolution, yet the sources and sinks are still poorly constrained. Though soil methane oxidation is the largest terrestrial methane sink, it is inadequately represented in current models. We have conducted laboratory analysis of mineral cryosol soils from Axel Heiberg Island in the Canadian high arctic. Microcosm experiments were carried out under varying environmental conditions and used to parameterize methane oxidation models. One-meter long intact soil cores were also obtained from Axel Heiberg Island and analyzed in the laboratory. A controlled core thawing experiment was carried out, and observed methane fluxes were compared to modeled methane fluxes. We find that accurate model simulation of methane fluxes needs to satisfy two requirements:(1) microbial biomass needs to be dynamically simulated, and (2) high-affinity methanotrophs need to be represented. With these 2 features, our model is able to reproduce observed temperature and soil moisture sensitivities of high affinity methanotrophs, which are twice as sensitive to temperature than the low affinity methanotrophs and are active under saturated moisture conditions. The model is also able to accurately reproduce the time rate of change of microbial oxidation of atmospheric methane. Finally, we discuss the remaining biases and uncertainties in the model, and the challenges of extending models from the laboratory scale to the landscape scale.",

This is an interesting region in Saturn’s magnetosphere containing the F and G rings and penetrated by the E-ring and the Enceladus neutral torus. This analysis will include a comparison of the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) plasma data, Radio and Plasma Wave Spectrometer (RPWS) plasma wave observations, RPWS Langmuir Probe (LP) observations and Cassini Dust Analyzer (CDA). The central focus will be on the dust plasma interactions. Specific attention will be paid to the SOI data for which there are considerable differences between the ion and electron densities (Elrod et al., 2012) while for other close flybys inside Mimas’ L shell such differences are less obvious but the electron data appear to be highly variable. Using previous identifications of nm particles (Jones et al., 2010) inferred from CAPS data and micron sized particles that can be detected by CDA (Kempf et al., 2006) and the RPWS plasma wave dust impact signatures (Kurth et al., 2006) we will attempt to infer the full particle size distribution between the A-ring and Mimas. These nm to micron sized particles can accumulate considerable charge and under certain circumstances could account for the radial trend in the ion density described in Elrod et al.

Current seismic hazard assessments risk the Charleston area significantly higher than the rest of the South Carolina Coastal Plain. However, reexamination of legacy seismic reflection data in South Carolina suggests that other basement faults may have experienced large magnitude Cenozoic seismicity. At least three locations in the South Carolina Coastal Plain show tens of meters of Cenozoic sediment deformation over basement faults. In addition, Cenozoic and Cretaceous sediments overlying active faults near Charleston have between 10 to 100 m of deformation, implying that seismic activity activity along these faults is either geologically recent or episodic. This analysis of Cenozoic fault displacement suggests that seismic hazard should be elevated more generally throughout the South Carolina Coastal Plain.",

Hillslope trenches may be one of the most direct ways to measure subsurface and overland flow during winter and spring seasons. In July 2014, a 10 meter long trench was constructed with hand tools through glacial till on a south facing hillslope in the Noname Watershed, Medicine Bow National Forest, Wyoming, where heavy equipment and motorized vehicles were restricted. This trench measures subsurface and overland flow for a 610 square meters catchment which has an average slope of 25 degrees. This water-collecting trench is equipped with 4 soil-moisture and temperature sensors to detect the presence of unsaturated flow. Field observations from the trench showed that diurnal oscillation of snowmelt seemed to control the overland flow between the snow and soil surface. The water inputs to the hillslope, including rainfall, evaporation, and snowmelt rates, were estimated from the energy balance computations using the observed meteorological data at the site. Using the water input data, the lateral flow component through the deeper soil or weathered bedrock layer was also quantified by the mass balance in the catchment.

Various physical processes that affect the energy input from the magnetosphere to ionosphere-thermosphere system are also implemented in the coupled global model including localized electromagnetic energy deposition, direct-entry cusp particle precipitation, broadband electron precipitation. The accuracy of modeling polar cap F-region thermospheric mass density during intense CME storms (kp>8) are estimated through event-based data-model comparisons (CHAMP/GRACE). These comparison studies are also used to investigate the relative importantce of various physical processes that relate to the coupling between the magnetosphere and high-latitude ionosphere-thermosphere.",

            "abstract": "To maximize the areal extent of Antarctic sedimentary records of past deglaciation, it is necessary to ensure more sediment cores can be adequately dated. Antarctic margin sediment is challenging to date due to the lack of preserved calcium carbonate, but the records contained in these sediments readily recount the history of deglaciation. Recent and continued development of new chronological methods for Antarctic margin sediments have allowed better use of the efforts of marine geological coring expeditions to the region. The development of Ramped PyrOx radiocarbon dating has allowed us to 1. improve dates in deglacial sediments where no carbonate is preserved, 2. date glacial sediments lying below the tills marking the last glaciation, and 3. compile core chronologies into a regional framework of ice shelf collapse that has eluded many marine geology campaigns over the last few decades. These advances in a fundamental aspect of geological sciences will put the U.S. and international community on a better foothold to interpret the past as it relates to our warming future. We will present these advances in chronology as well as the science that is enabled by them, while arguing that the future of Antarctic marine science also depends on investments in shore-based technologies that come at a relatively low cost.",

            "abstract": "Freshwater ecosystems across the United States are threatened by hydrologic change caused by water management operations and non-stationary climate trends. Nonstationary hydrology also threatens flood management systems’ performance. Ecosystem managers and flood risk managers need tools to design systems that achieve flood risk reduction objectives while sustaining ecosystem functions and services in an uncertain hydrologic future. Robust optimization is used in water resources engineering to guide system design under climate change uncertainty. Using principles introduced by Eco-Engineering Decision Scaling (EEDS), we extend robust optimization techniques to design flood management systems that meet both economic and ecological goals simultaneously across a broad range of future climate conditions. We use three alternative robustness indices to identify flood risk management solutions that preserve critical ecosystem functions in a case study from the Iowa River, where recent severe flooding has tested the limits of the existing flood management system. We seek design modifications to the system that both reduce expected cost of flood damage while increasing ecologically beneficial inundation of riparian floodplains across a wide range of plausible climate futures. The first robustness index measures robustness as the fraction of potential climate scenarios in which both engineering and ecological performance goals are met, implicitly weighting each climate scenario equally. The second index builds on the first by using climate projections to weight each climate scenario, prioritizing acceptable performance in climate scenarios most consistent with climate projections. The last index measures robustness as mean performance across all climate scenarios, but penalizes scenarios with worse performance than average, rewarding consistency. Results stemming from alternate robustness indices reflect implicit assumptions about attitudes toward risk and reveal the tradeoffs between using structural and non-structural flood management strategies to ensure economic and ecological robustness.",

Fortunately, some aspects of volcanic activity are predictable, or at least predictable enough that warning signs of impending activity can be used to warn the public about elevated levels of hazard. The study of and monitoring of active volcanoes is inherently multi-disciplinary, a microcosm of earth sciences. Many different types of data must be brought together to study active volcanic systems. A volcano observatory brings together experts in various disciplines to work on a common mission of providing accurate and timely warnings of potential future activity, notifications of ongoing activity, and assessments of hazards and impacts that may result if an eruption escalates. This requires using an array of data including seismic, geodetic, remote sensing, gas monitoring, thermal imaging, and visual observations. Effective communication of scientific information to the public is of critical importance. The Alaska Volcano Observatory pioneered the use of a simple green-yellow-orange-red color code to communicate the level of concern about activity at individual volcanoes, and this color code has been refined and adopted by all US volcano observatories. The use of an easily understood color code and other standard notifications makes for more effective communication with other agencies, emergency managers, and the public.",

SST information has been recently used in statistical models to create seasonal outlooks of fire season severity in South America and as the initial condition for dynamical model predictions of fire activity in Indonesia. However, the degree to which large-scale ocean-atmosphere interactions can influence burned area in other continental regions has not been systematically explored. Here we quantified the amount of global burned area that can be predicted using SSTs in 14 different oceans regions as statistical predictors. We first examined lagged correlations between GFED4s burned area and the 14 ocean climate indices (OCIs) individually. The maximum correlations from different OCIs were used to construct a global map of fire predictability. About half of the global burned area can be forecast by this approach 3 months before the peak burning month (with a Pearson’s r of 0.5 or higher), with the highest levels of predictability in Central America and Equatorial Asia. Several hotspots of predictability were identified using k-means cluster analysis. Within these regions, we tested the improvements of the forecast by using two OCIs from different oceans. Our forecast models were based on near-real-time SST data and may therefore support the development of new seasonal outlooks for fire activity that can aid the sustainable management of these fire-prone ecosystems.",

Guaymas basin in Gulf of California is one of the few known places in the world in which magmatic intrusions are intruding in rich-organic sediments.

            "abstract": "Research shows that areas with similar topography and climatic environment have comparable precipitation occurrences. Reproduction and realization of historical rainfall events provide foundations for frequency analysis and the advancement of meteorological studies. Stochastic Storm Transposition (SST) is a method for such a purpose and enables us to perform hydrologic frequency analyses by transposing observed historical storm events to the sites of interest. However, many previous studies in SST reveal drawbacks from simplified Probability Density Functions (PDFs) without considering restrictions for transposing rainfalls. The goal of this study is to stochastically examine the impacts of extreme events on all locations in a homogeneity zone. Since storms with the same probability of occurrence on homogenous areas do not have the identical hydrologic impacts, the authors utilize detailed precipitation parameters including the probability of occurrence of certain depth and the number of occurrence of extreme events, which are both incorporated into a joint probability function. The new approach can reduce the bias from uniformly transposing storms which erroneously increases the probability of occurrence of storms in areas with higher rainfall depths. This procedure is iterated to simulate storm events for one thousand years as the basis for updating frequency analysis curves such as IDF and FFA. The study area is the Upper Trinity River watershed including the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex with a total area of 6,500 mi2. It is the first time that SST method is examined in such a wide scale with 20 years of radar rainfall data.",

Velocity drop during the coseismic rupture has been explicitly observed in proximity to the epicenters of large earthquakes with different styles of faulting. The origin of such sudden perturbation in crustal properties is closely related to the damage and/or volumetric strain change influenced by seismic slip distribution. In this study, we apply a coda wave interferometry method to investigate potential velocity change in both space and time related to the moderate-sized (Mw6.3) 2010 Jiasian earthquake, which nucleated deeply in the crust (~23 km), ruptured and terminated around the depth of 10 km along a previously unidentified blind thrust fault near the lithotectonic boundary of the southern Taiwan orogenic belt. To decipher the surface and crustal response to this relatively deep rupture, we first measure relative time-lapse changes of coda between different short-term time frames spanning one year covering the pre- and post-seismic stages by using the Moving Window Cross Spectral Method. Rather than determining temporal velocity variations based on a long-term reference stack, we conduct a Bayesian least-squares inversion to obtain the optimal estimates by minimizing the inconsistency between the relative time-lapse shifts of individual short-term stacks.\nThe results show the statistically significant velocity reduction immediately after the mainshock, which is most pronounced at the pairs with the interstation paths traversing through the hanging-wall block of the ruptured fault. The sensitivity of surface wave coda arrivals mainly in the periods of 3-5 s to shear wave speed perturbation is confined within the depth of 10 km, where the crust mostly experienced extensional strain changes induced by the slip distribution from the finite-fault model. Compared with coseismic slip distribution from GPS data and finite-fault inversion, peak ground velocity, and static volumetric strain field following the earthquake, the velocity decrease observed in the hanging wall side of the shallow crust is most likely attributed to pervasive dilatational strain changes induced by the slip rupture on the underlying blind thrust.",

We investigate whether or not this is also the case for extreme precipitation simulated by a multi-model ensemble driven by four realistic emissions scenarios. In most models, the rate of increase of maximum annual daily rainfall per degree global warming in the multi-model ensemble is statistically indistinguishable across the four scenarios, whether this extreme precipitation is calculated globally, over all land, or over extra-tropical land. These results indicate that, in most models, extreme precipitation depends on the total amount of warming and does not depend on emissions scenario, in contrast to mean precipitation. ",

            "abstract": "Isotope profiles in freshwater mussel shells can be used to reconstruct climate, water source, and river discharge, but problems arise from variable water temperature and δ18O. To resolve this complexity and expand the application of isotope sclerochronology to the study of past river systems, we measured δ18O and Δ47 in two common freshwater mussel species from the Brazos River in Texas. To compare the environmental record with the shell record and develop a sclerochronology, weekly water temperature and δ18O data were collected from the Brazos River near College Station from January 2012 to August 2013. The river data reveal complex, irregular patterns for predicted aragonite δ18O. Comparing δ18O profiles from micromilled transects (70-200 µm increments) of coeval shell growth within and between shells yielded consistent patterns. Shell δ18O can be accurately matched to predicted δ18O, providing a chronology of shell growth. However, without a water temperature and δ18O record, interpreting a sclerochronology would be impossible. Shell Δ47 can potentially provide a seasonal chronology to verify the δ18O sclerochronology, which would be invaluable for the use of δ18O sclerochronology in historical and ancient shells. For Δ47 analyses, samples were taken at 0.5 mm resolution in presumed seasonal dark and light growth bands. Clumped temperatures range between 21 and 35 ± 4˚C (Henkes et al., 2013) and track the river temperature record, supporting the interpreted shell δ18O chronology. Shell Δ47-calculated water δ18O values range from -1.2 to 1.5 ± 0.9‰ and match river δ18O. High-resolution shell δ18O profiles combined with Δ47 temperatures can reconstruct a weekly history of water δ18O, and with the observed river discharge vs. water δ18O relation, produce a qualitative record of river discharge. These analytical techniques applied to a historical Brazos River mussel shell collected prior to dam construction reveal weekly records of natural environmental variability.",

            "abstract": "Evaluation of large public STEM events poses many challenges including data collection of moving crowds, representative sampling, and collecting sufficient data with available resources. International Observe the Moon Night (InOMN) is a yearly event held around the world on a single day coordinated by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter with support from partners around the globe. Each year hundreds of events are held across the United States and in over 50 countries across the world. This distributed event poses even more challenges in its evaluation due to the fact that events vary widely in their implementation and that it is impossible for evaluators to collect data at any more than a small fraction of the events.\nWe present findings of six years of evaluation at InOMN events that implemented varying data collection techniques, incentives, and target outcomes as the event has evolved. Through analysis of these years of data, we have found that InOMN events are hosted by a variety of public and private institutions all over the world including museums, planetaria, schools, universities, observatories, parks, and private businesses and families, over half of which have hosted events for more than one year. Telescopes are present at a majority of the events and lunar science and exploration is often highlighted. Visitors who have been surveyed or interviewed often report being regular attendees at science related events but many were new to InOMN. Many of those surveyed report that they attended with friends and family making their participation a social event. Visitors also reported an increase in knowledge and excitement to learn more about the Moon as a result of their participation in an event. Overall, InOMN events have met both organizers and facilitators’ goals. We will discuss the different data collection techniques, challenges encountered and overcome, and lessons learned through this ongoing evaluation effort.",

            "abstract": "The oxidation of ammonium (NH4+) under iron reducing conditions, referred to as Feammox, has been described in recent years by several investigators. The environmental characteristics in which the Feammox process occurs need to be understood in order to determine its contribution to the nitrogen cycle. In this study, a total of 66 locations were selected covering 4 different types of soils/sediments: wetland soils (W), river sediments (R), forest soils (F), and paddy soils (P) from several locations in central New Jersey, at Tims Branch at Savannah River in South Carolina, both in the Unities States, and at several locations in the Guangdong province in China. Though soil chemical analyses, serial culturing experiments, analysis of microbial communities, and using a canonical correspondence analysis, the occurrence of the Feammox reaction and the presence of Acidimicrobiaceae bacterium A6, which plays a key role in the Feammox process(1), were found in 17 samples. Analyses showed that the soil pH, as well as its Fe(III) and NH4+ content were the most important factors controlling the distribution of these Feammox microorganisms. Based on the results, soils in the subtropical forests and soils that are near agricultural areas could be Feammox hotspot.\nUnder the conditions that favor the presence and activity of Feammox microorganisms and their oxidation of NH4+, denitrification bacteria were also active. However, the presence of nitrous oxide (N2O) reducers was limited under these conditions, implying that at locations where the Feammox process is active, conditions are favoring a higher ratio of N2O: N2 as the nitrogen (N) end products.\nIncubations of soils where the presence of Acidimicrobiaceae bacterium A6 was detected, were conducted for 120 days under two different DO levels (DO < 0.02 mg/L and DO = 0.8~1.0 mg/L) showing comparable amounts of NH4+ oxidation. In the incubations with DO < 0.02 mg/L, the proportion of Acidimicrobiaceae bacteria increased and other NH4+ oxidation bacteria (aerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and anammox bacteria) decreased, while in the incubations with DO = 0.8~1.0 mg/L the opposite trend was observed.\n",

These pulses are suspected to be generated deep in the Earth’s crust, in and around the hypocentral volume, days or even weeks before earth quakes. Their extremely long wavelength allows them to pass through kilometers of rock. Interestingly, when the sources of these pulses are triangulated, the locations coincide with the epicenters of future earthquakes. We couple a drift-diffusion semiconductor model to a magnetic field in order to describe the electromagnetic effects associated with electrical currents flowing within rocks. The resulting system of equations is solved numerically and it is seen that a volume of rock may act as a diode that produces transient currents when it switches bias. These unidirectional currents are expected to produce transient unipolar magnetic pulses similar in form, amplitude, and duration to those observed before earthquakes, and this suggests that the pulses could be the result of geophysical semiconductor processes.",

            "abstract": "Over 80% of U.S. electricity generation uses a thermoelectric process, which requires significant quantities of water for power plant cooling. This water requirement exposes the electric sector to vulnerabilities related to shifts in water availability driven by climate change as well as reductions in power plant efficiencies. Electricity demand is also sensitive to climate change, which in most of the United States leads to warming temperatures that increase total cooling-degree days. The resulting demand increase is typically greater for peak demand periods. This work examines the sensitivity of the development and operations of the U.S. electric sector to the impacts of climate change using an electric sector capacity expansion model that endogenously represents seasonal and local water resource availability as well as climate impacts on water availability, electricity demand, and electricity system performance. Capacity expansion portfolios and water resource implications from 2010 to 2050 are shown at high spatial resolution under a series of climate scenarios. Results demonstrate the importance of water availability for future electric sector capacity planning and operations, especially under more extreme hotter and drier climate scenarios. In addition, region-specific changes in electricity demand and water resources require region-specific responses that depend on local renewable resource availability and electricity market conditions. Climate change and the associated impacts on water availability and temperature can affect the types of power plants that are built, their location, and their impact on regional water resources.",

            "abstract": "We present new results from a regional study of lithospheric structure along a swath from Missouri to central Kentucky crossing the Illinois Basin, a major intracratonic basin in the Central U.S. We analyzed 27501 receiver functions for a dense, 140-station Flexible Array of the EarthScope OIINK (Ozark, Illinois, INdiana and Kentucky) experiment, combined with 65 USArray Transportable Array stations, 8 Cooperative New Madrid Seismic Network stations, and station CCM of the Global Seismographic Network. We used Common Conversion Point (CCP) stacking and 3-D plane wave migration techniques to image lithospheric discontinuities across the southern Illinois basin. The results reveal features in crustal and uppermost mantle structures beneath the study area that have not been described previously. The Ste. Genevieve fault zone in southeastern Missouri and southwestern Illinois has been mapped from northern flank of the Ozark Plateau in southeastern Missouri to southwestern edge of the Illinois basin. Our results indicate that this fault zone might be the surface expression of a profound crustal velocity boundary. Crustal thickness changes across this boundary. The Moho lies at depths of about 50-55 km beneath the transition from the Ozark Plateau to the Illinois basin, and shallows eastward and westward to about 45 km. The anomalously deep Moho beneath the central and southwestern basin might be explained by a process of crustal thickening (e.g., magmatic addition or crustal flow), at some point during subsidence of the basin and uplift of the Ozark Plateau. A distinct mid-crustal layer is observed beneath the Ozark Plateau and the southwestern Illinois Basin, at depths from 10 km to 25 km, and the thickest part (~ 15 km thick) is located beneath the Ozark Plateau. This layer is absent beneath the central Illinois Basin. The spatial expansion of this middle-crustal layer may explain the contrasting tectonic histories between the plateau and the basin, which were uplifted and subsided, respectively. In addition, previous studies have shown that earthquakes in the Ste. Genevieve seismic zone around the Ste. Genevieve fault zone are constrained within the top 25 km within the crust. This is comparable with the inferred depth of base of the middle-crustal layer in this region, indicating that this layer is seismogenic.",

Much of our understanding of spicules has been obtained through filtergram observations and/or focused on the dynamics of spicules. Spectroscopic studies have been usually limited by spatial extent/resolution, temporal resolution, or variable seeing. In this work we make use of a unique time series of imaging spectroscopy at high spatial and temporal resolution, obtained with the Swedish Solar Telescope under excellent seeing and coordinated with the IRIS mission. With these data we characterize the evolution of spectra along quiet Sun fibrils and spicules, and discuss what makes them visible in filtergrams and sets them apart from other chromospheric fibrils. With combined H-alpha and Ca II H high-resolution observations we also discuss how spicules appear in these two lines, a long standing issue that has been interpreted in conflicting ways. Finally, using the wide range of IRIS diagnostics we put together the spectral evolution of spicules through the chromosphere and transition region.",

            "abstract": "Wet meadows are a vital component of arid and semi-arid environments. These valley spanning, seasonally inundated wetlands provide critical habitat and refugia for wildlife, and may potentially mediate catchment-scale hydrology in otherwise “water challenged” landscapes. In the last 150 years, these meadows have begun incising rapidly, causing the wetlands to drain and much of the ecological benefit to be lost. The mechanisms driving this incision are poorly understood, with proposed means ranging from cattle grazing to climate change, to the removal of beaver. There is considerable interest in identifying cost-effective strategies to restore the hydrologic and ecological conditions of these meadows at a meaningful scale, but effective process based restoration first requires a thorough understanding of the constructional history of these ubiquitous features.\nThere is emerging evidence to suggest that the North American beaver may have had a considerable role in shaping this landscape through the building of dams. This “beaver meadow complex hypothesis” posits that as beaver dams filled with fine-grained sediments, they became large wet meadows on which new dams, and new complexes, were formed, thereby aggrading valley bottoms. A pioneering study done in Yellowstone indicated that 32-50% of the alluvial sediment was deposited in ponded environments. The observed aggradation rates were highly heterogeneous, suggesting spatial variability in the depositional process – all consistent with the beaver meadow complex hypothesis (Polvi and Wohl, 2012).\nTo expand on this initial work, we have probed deeper into these meadow complexes using a combination of geophysical techniques, coring methods and numerical modeling to create a 3-dimensional representation of the subsurface environments. This imaging has given us a unique view into the patterns and processes responsible for the landforms, and may shed further light on the role of beaver in shaping these landscapes.",

Then, our recent results of numerical investigations via large-eddy simulation of coupled atmosphere-topography-fire phenomenology with the Los Alamos National Laboratory, HiGrad-Firetec model are presented as an example of the potential for increased understanding of these complex processes. This investigation focuses on the influence of downslope surface wind enhancement through stably stratified flow over an isolated hill, and the resulting dramatic changes in fire behavior including spread rate, and intensity.

            "abstract": "A test was conducted at a chlorinated-solvent contaminated site in Tucson, AZ, to evaluate the effectiveness of vapor-phase tomography (VPT) for characterizing the distribution of volatile organic contaminants (VOC) in the vadose zone. A soil vapor extraction (SVE) system has been in operation at the site since 2007. Vapor concentration and vacuum pressure were measured at four different depths in each of the four monitoring wells surrounding the extraction well. The test provided a 3D characterization of local vapor concentrations under induced-gradient conditions. Permeability data obtained from analysis of borehole logs were used along with pressure and the vapor-concentration data to determine VOC mass flux within the test domain. A region of higher mass flux was identified in the deepest interval of the S–SW section of the domain, indicating the possible location of a zone with greater contaminant mass. These results are consistent with the TCE-concentration distribution obtained from sediment coring conducted at the site. In contrast, the results of a standard soil gas survey did not indicate the presence of a zone with greater contaminant mass. These results indicate that the VPT test provided a robust characterization of VOC concentration and flux distribution at the site.",

A core element of WFIP2 is an 18 month field program located in the Pacific Northwest, focusing on the Columbia River Gorge and Basin in eastern Oregon and Washington states, with instrument deployment occurring in the summer and autumn of 2015. The approach taken is to collect an extensive set of new meteorological observations, especially within the atmospheric boundary layer, use these to observe and understand relevant atmospheric processes, develop and test new model physical parameterization schemes, and ultimately transfer these improved models to NOAA/NWS operations and to the wider meteorological community. Observing systems that will be deployed for WFIP2 include:\n11 wind profiling radars\n17 sodars\n5 wind profiling lidars\n4 scanning lidars\n4 radiometers\n10 microbarographs\nceilometer\n28 sonic anemometers\nNumerical models that are being used for WFIP2 are WRF-based models including the NOAA RAP (Rapid Refresh) and High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), as well as the NAM and GFS. Science issues that are being addressed include gap flow, mountain waves, mountain wakes, convective storm outflows, the mix-out of stable cold pools, and boundary layer turbulence profiling. An overview of WFIP2 will be given with an emphasis on the suite of instrumentation deployed and their observational capabilities.

            "abstract": "The Pacific GPS Facility and the Field Robotics Laboratory at the University of Hawaii have developed an approach to significantly reduce the costs of accurately measuring short-term vertical motions of the seafloor and maintaining a continuous long-term record of seafloor pressure. Traditional ship-based methods of acquiring these measurements are often prohibitively expensive. Our goal has been to reduce the primary barrier preventing us from acquiring the observations we need to understand geodetic processes, and the hazards they present, at subduction zones, submarine volcanoes, and subsea landslides.\nTo this end, we have designed a payload package for the University of Hawaii Wave Glider which incorporates an acoustic telemetry package, a dual frequency geodetic-grade Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, meteorological sensors, processing computer, and cellular communications. The Wave Glider is able to interrogate high accuracy pressure sensors on the seafloor to maintain a near-continuous stream of ocean bottom pressure and temperature data. The Wave Glider also functions as an integral part of the seafloor geodetic observing system, recording accurate sea surface elevations and barometric pressure; direct measurements of two of the primary sources of seafloor pressure change. The seafloor geodetic monument seats a sensor capable of recording pressure, temperature, and sound velocity for a deployment duration of over 5 years with an acoustic modem for communications, and an integral acoustic release for recovery and replacement of batteries. The design of the geodetic monument allows for precise repositioning of the sensor to extend the pressure record beyond a single 5+ year deployment, and includes the capability to install a mobile pressure recorder for calibration of the linear drift of the continuous pressure sensor.\nWe will present the results of our field tests and an assessment of our ability to determine cm-scale vertical seafloor motions by integrating our seafloor pressure measurements with the independent Wave Glider measurements of sea surface pressure and sea surface height. An overall summary of the performance and costs of making seafloor geodetic measurement with this system will be provided.",

            "abstract": "Laguna del Maule Volcanic Field is a large, restless, youthful rhyolitic system in the Southern Andes of Chile. We present a preliminary examination of ambient noise data at this site from 12 University of Wisconsin and 6 OVDAS (Southern Andean Volcano Observatory) broadband seismometers for a 3 month period. Ambient noise tomography seeks to correlate pairs of stations, with one station acting as a virtual source and the other a receiver, generating empirical Green’s functions between each pair. The noise correlation functions (NCFs) were computed for day-long and hour-long windows, then the final NCFs were obtained from stacking each time window set. The hour-long NCFs converged more rapidly, so this time window was chosen for use in later stages. This study used phase weighted stacking of the NCFs instead of linear stacking in order to achieve a better signal to noise ratio (SNR), although linearly stacked Green’s functions were also created to confirm the improvement. Phase weighted stacking can detect signals with weak amplitudes much more clearly than linear stacking by finding coherence of signals in multiple frequency bins and down-weighting the importance of amplitude for correlation (Schimmel and Gallart, 2007). The Frequency-Time Analysis Technique was utilized to measure group velocity, and initial results show it to be about 2 km/s on average. Fluctuations of the average velocity between different station pairs across this dense array will provide a preliminary indication of the location and size of the magma system. This study also applied seismic interferometry using ambient noise to determine temporal changes in seismic velocity occurring at Laguna del Maule. Initial results show temporal changes in seismic velocity correlated to seasonal changes in the hydrologic cycle (rain, snow pack, snow melt, etc.). Current work focuses on identifying changes in seismic velocity associated with ongoing volcanic processes.",

            "abstract": "The Valle de Azapa is located at the northern border of the Atacama Desert, which is considered the driest place on earth. Agriculture is the main economic activity of the valley and it is possible due to the exploitation of groundwater pumped from the aquifer of the area, which is replenished by sporadic rainfall that occurred at the Andes. The high demand on the aquifer has generated a situation that is considered as fragile or unsustainable for the future. This situation could be worsened by the forecasted climate change impact on the region, which would result in reductions in precipitation of up to 40% in the next 100 years. This was the main motivation to study the potential impact of climate change on the sustainability of the aquifer under different water demand scenarios through numerical simulations. We model the impact of climate change by generating stochastic precipitation series that consider reductions between 0 and 40% during the next 100 years. We use the precipitation series to estimate recharge rates through a previously calibrated correlation. For each recharge series we consider three different scenarios: reduction, no change and increase in the water demand. We then use a groundwater model to analyze the evolution of the storage and natural discharge of the aquifer. The main conclusion is that even though the aquifer storage is reduced at the end of the analyzed period, it is still significant in comparison to the extracted groundwater. However, the extraction of groundwater significantly reduces and, in some cases, completely eliminates natural discharge such as springs that exist in the area. This indicates that the system reaches a long-term operation state during the simulated period and that discharges from wells are mainly covered by reductions of the natural discharge of the system. We relate this last finding to the concept of the “Water Budget Myth” proposed by Bredehoeft & Papadopulus (1982). We finish by commenting on possible measures to mitigate the environmental impact of groundwater use and to ensure the sustainability of the aquifer development.",

            "abstract": "Tropical forest carbon budgets play a major role in global carbon dynamics, but the responses of tropical forests to current and future inter-annual climatic variation remains highly uncertain. Better predictions of future tropical forest carbon fluxes require an improved understanding of how different species of tropical trees respond to changes in climate at seasonal and inter-annual temporal scales.\nWe installed dendrometer bands on a size-stratified sample of 2000 trees in old growth forest on Barro Colorado Island, Panama, a moist lowland forest that experiences an annual dry season of approximately four months. Tree diameters were measured at the beginning and end of the rainy season since 2008. Additionally, we recorded the canopy illumination level, canopy intactness, and liana coverage of all trees during each census. We used linear mixed-effects models to evaluate how tree growth was related to seasonal and interannual variation in local climate, tree condition, and species identity, and how species identity effects related to tree functional traits. Climatic variables considered included precipitation, solar radiation, soil moisture, and climatological water deficit, and were all calculated from high-quality on-site measurements. Functional traits considered included wood density, maximum adult stature, deciduousness, and drought tolerance.\nWe found that annual wood production was positively related to water availability, with higher growth in wetter years. Species varied in their response to seasonal water availability, with some species showing more pronounced reduction of growth during the dry season when water availability is limited. Interspecific variation in seasonal and interannual growth patterns was related to life-history strategies and species functional traits.\nThe finding of higher growth in wetter years is consistent with previous tree ring studies conducted on a small subset of species with reliable annual rings. Together with previous findings that seed production at this site is higher in sunnier (and drier) years, this suggests strong climate-related shifts in allocation.\nThis study highlights the importance of considering forest species composition and potential allocational shifts when predicting carbon fluxes in response to local climate variation.",

            "abstract": "In order to simplify the complex hydrological variability of flow conditions, experiments modeling delta evolution are often conducted using a representative “channel-forming” flood flow and then relate results to field settings using an intermittency factor, defined as the fraction of total time at flood conditions. Although this intermittency factor makes it easier to investigate how variables, such as relative base level and/or sediment supply, affect delta dynamics, little is known about how this generalization to a single flow condition affects delta processes. We conducted a set of laboratory experiments with periodic flow conditions to determine the effects of intermittent discharges on delta evolution. During the experiment, flood with a set water discharge and sediment supply, cycles between periods of normal flow where the water flux is halved and the sediment discharge is turned off. For each run, the magnitude of the flood is held constant, but the duration is assigned differently, thus varying the intermittency between 1 and 0.2. We find that as the intermittency factor decreases (duration of each flood period decreases), the delta topset has a larger, more elongated area with a shallower slope as a result of reworking on the delta topset during normal flow conditions. During periods of normal flow, the system adjusts towards a new equilibrium state that then in turn acts as the initial condition for the subsequent flood period. Furthermore, the natural delta avulsion cycle becomes obscured by the flood cycles as the flood duration becomes shorter than the autogenic behavior. These results suggest that the adjustment timescale for differing flow conditions is a factor in determining the overall shape of the delta and behavior of the fluviodeltaic channels. We conclude, periods of normal flow when topset sediment is reworked, may be just as important to delta dynamics as periods of flood when sediment is supplied to the system.",

This study uses new petrographic, geochronological and geochemical observations on a new sample set collected along the margin to help understand the various types and relative timings of volcanic events along the margin. This new study has identified 3 main volcanic events that occur at ~100Ma (Sumbe event 1), 90-92Ma (Serra de Neve (SDN)-Elefantes event 2) and 80-81Ma (Namibe event 3), with the oldest event in the north of the margin and younging southwards. This is contrasting with the main Etendeka pulse in Namibia at around 130 Ma. There is a marked variety of igneous rocks along the margin with a grouping of evolved alkaline rocks in the central SDN-Elefantes section, basic submarine volcanics in the north, and basanite eruptions in the southern section. There is some overlap with geochemical types along the margin. The Sumbe event contains predominantly submarine volcanics and shallow Intrusions. SDN-Elefantes rocks have a mixed type but with a distinctive feldspar rich evolved alkali suite of rocks (nepheline syenites and variations around this composition) which occur as lava flows and shallow intrusions as well as making up the core of the SDN complex. The SDN complex itself is analogous in size to the main volcanic centres in Namibia (such as Messum, Brandberg etc.) and suggests that large volcanic feeding centres are still active along the margin as young as 90ma. These in turn will form large volcano-topographic features. In the south the Ponta Negra and Canico sites mainly contain basanites in the form of lava flows, invasive flows and shallow intrusions. At Canico one intrusive plug was sampled with a similar composition to the evolved SDN-Elefantes suite. In all three events it is clear that the volcanic systems have interacted with the sedimentary systems, in some cases dynamically, in others with regional implications for volcano-tectonic uplift. Specific thanks is given for Statoil and Sonangol for sponsorship and support in the field, and the Geological Survey of Namibia.",

Without the darkening, the increase in surface melting would be roughly half as large. A minority of the albedo decline signal may be from sensor degradation. So, in this study, MOD10A1 and MCD43 albedo products from MODIS are evaluated for sensor degradation and anisotropic reflectance errors. Errors are minimized through calibration to GC-Net and PROMICE Greenland snow and ice ground control data.

            "abstract": "The Azores archipelago is a set of nine volcanic islands in the middle of the North Atlantic, close to the triple junction between the North American, Eurasian and African plates. Due to their location, the islands are seismic and volcanically active, which makes them especially vulnerable to these types of hazards that could eventually trigger flank collapses, capable of generating destructive tsunamis. However, solid evidence of large-scale flank collapses has only been found recently in Pico Island (Costa et al., 2014; Quartau et al., 2015). This study investigates for the first time the tsunami effects of a flank collapse of the northeastern subaerial slope of Pico Island that occurred more than 70 ka ago. We first reconstructed the pre-event sub-aerial morphology of the island, and then numerically model the flank failure involving an estimated volume of ~8 km3, its flow toward and under the sea of ~14 km, and the subsequent tsunami generation and propagation. The modelling suggests that the collapse of Pico created a mega-tsunami that significantly impacted the coast of adjacent São Jorge Island only after 7 minutes after generation, with wave run-up reaching a maximum of 50 m at some coastlines. Most of the tsunami energy became trapped in the semi-enclosed basin between Pico and São Jorge Islands, with only relatively little energy escaping to neighboring islands.\nAcknowledgments\nThe author wishes to acknowledge the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) under grant agreement n° 603839 (Project ASTARTE - Assessment, Strategy and Risk Reduction for Tsunamis in Europe)\" for its major contribution for the success of this study.

Correspondingly dust fluxes in the eastern North Atlantic were much lower compared to modern. This period is considered an analogue for dust free conditions. It is uncertain whether dust acts as a positive or negative feedback on the hydrological cycle, and the underlying surface albedo has a strong impact on the shortwave dust radiative effect. Here we examine the roles of vegetation, surface albedo, and lake/wetland coverage on dust emissions and the resulting dust-climate feedbacks using a fully coupled climate model with an interactive dust model. Preliminary results show that the addition of lakes and wetlands reduces dust emissions over North Africa, and enhances evaporation and precipitation by more than 50%.",

            "abstract": "It is well established that groundwater pumping affects surface-water availability by intercepting water that would otherwise discharge to streams and/or by increasing seepage losses from stream channels. Conversely, surface-water management affects groundwater availability by altering the timing, location, and quantity of groundwater recharge and pumping. Analyses of climate change impacts on water resources, however, often fail to account for these interactions, in large part due to a lack of modeling tools capable of simulating interactions between surface-water and groundwater management and use.\nHere we use a modified version of the MODFLOW One Water Hydrologic Flow Model (MODFLOW-OWHM) to evaluate the role of feedbacks between surface-water and groundwater management and use in the context of climate change impact and adaptation studies. This modified version of MODFLOW-OWHM was developed by USBR and USGS by incorporating a fully-integrated surface-water operations module within MODFLOW-OWHM. We use a hypothetical) test case to compare direct and indirect effects of climate change on surface-water and groundwater resources. We define direct effects as changes in groundwater and surface-water conditions resulting from the hydrologic response to climate change (e.g., driven by changes in runoff, recharge, and demands resulting directly from climate change); we define indirect effects as changes arising from the anthropogenic response to direct effects (e.g., driven by changes in groundwater pumping in response to climate-driven changes in water demands or surface water supplies).\nResults demonstrate that indirect effects on groundwater from changes in demand can outweigh direct effects from changes in supply—viz., indirect effects of increased groundwater pumping due to decreasing surface water supplies can be greater than direct effects of decreasing groundwater recharge. Moreover, under some conditions, indirect effects from changes in groundwater use, and subsequent changes in baseflow and seepage, can significantly exacerbate the direct effects of climate change on surface water. These results, while limited to a simple test case, underscore the importance of accounting for the coupled response of surface-water and groundwater management in climate change analyses.",

Governance refers to structures and processes that enable policy decisions to be made and implemented, and is one key unresolved topic. Local governments will need to decide, quickly and with great latitude, how to create novel agencies with novel structures and challenging mandates. Sustainability is defined in physical terms in the Act, but because governance plays such a critical role in the potential for GSAs to achieve their goals, we argue that governance itself should also be viewed as an essential element of sustainability, and that it needs to be considered with nuance and rigor. We propose a framework to inform decisions about local groundwater governance. We suggest that local stakeholders and state agencies should evaluate plans and proposals from GSAs based on specific criteria that are necessary for the effective governance of such a complex, interconnected resource. These criteria include scale, capacity, funding, authority, independence, representation, participation, accountability, and transparency, each of which supports the overarching themes of fairness and efficacy. We discuss these concepts within the legal, regulatory, and geophysical contexts in which they must be explicitly situated for effective governance.",

            "abstract": "Global forests are undergoing increasing temperatures and major changes in precipitation, including drought and flooding. Current satellite technology is not designed to assess forest vulnerability and response to climate change, so new approaches are needed from space. Two key indicators of forest vulnerability and response to climate change are canopy water and non-structural carbohydrate (NSC) content. However, measurement of canopy water and NSC content is prohibitively labor intensive in the field, especially in forests where foliage is difficult to access, and where canopy properties vary enormously by species and across environments. Imaging spectroscopy may allow quantitative mapping the combination of canopy water and NSC, but this possibility remains largely unproven. We analyzed foliar water and NSC at leaf, canopy and stand levels using visible-to-shortwave infrared (VSWIR) spectroscopy. Leaf-level analyses demonstrated high precision and accuracy of water and NSC estimates in more than 10,000 live samples taken from thousands of forest canopy species worldwide. Airborne imaging spectroscopy from the Carnegie Airborne Observatory VSWIR spectrometer also provided high-accuracy canopy water and NSC estimates at the stand level. Spectral analyses indicated strong contributions of the shortwave-IR (1300-2500 nm) region to water and NSC determination at all scales. We conclude that canopy water and NSC can be remotely sensed, opening doors to monitor forest canopy physiological responses to environmental stress and climate change.",

Understanding the capabilities of climate models over the historical period is crucial to assessing our confidence in their predictive ability at regional scales.\nOur work fills this research gap by evaluating the performance of Coupled Model Intercomparison Phase 5 (CMIP5) models as compared to observational data using multiple heat metrics. Our metrics are targeted for the southwest United States, but our regional analysis covers the entire continental U.S. and Alaska using 7 of the regions delineated by the NCA. The heat metrics include heat wave and cold wave frequency, intensity, and duration, overnight low temperatures, onset and length of the hot season, and human heat stress. For the best performing models, we compute the same heat metrics for the RCP scenarios. In addition to presenting the results of our CMIP5 historical and RCP analyses, we also describe how our results may be applied to the benefit of our community in Southern Arizona as a case study. Our research will be used by NOAA's Climate Assessment for the Southwest (CLIMAS) and by an interdisciplinary collaborative team of researchers from the University of Arizona working with an electric utility to integrate climate information into their strategic planning.",

This crystallization force causes deformation of solids and is therefore particularly relevant for the comprehension of geological processes such as replacement and weathering [1]. In addition, these forces are relevant for the understanding of damages in porous building materials caused by crystallization, which is of great economical importance and fundamental for methods that can help to preserve our cultural heritage [2,3].\nHowever, the exact behavior of the growth and the dissolution process in close contact to an interface are still not known in detail. The crystallization, the dissolution and the transport of material is mediated by a nanoconfined water film.\nWe observe brittle NaClO3 crystals growing against a glass surface by optical methods such as reflective interference contrast microscopy (RICM) [4]. In order to carefully control the supersaturation of the fluid close to the crystal interface, a temperature regulated microfluidic system is used (fig. A). The interference based precision of RICM enables to resolve distance variations down to the sub nanometer range without any unwanted disturbances by the measuring method. The combination of RICM with a sensitive camera allows us to observe phenomena such as periodic, wavelike growth of atomic layers. These waves are particularly obvious when observing the difference between two consecutive images (fig. B).\nIn contradiction to some theoretical results, which predict a smooth interface, some recent experiments have shown that the nanoconfined growth surfaces are rough. In combination with theoretical studies and Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations we aim at providing more realistic descriptions of surface energies and energy barriers which are able to explain the discrepancies between experiments and current theory.\n",

The scale of modern mining operations has led to increasing use of steep slopes and submarine canyons for deposition of these wastes at depths of 2000m - 4000m. Current mine disposal operations in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea which use Deep Sea Tailings Placement (DSTP) release volumes between 5000 tpd and 160,000 tpd. Planning is underway by the\"Consortium,\" an industry and government group in Chile which would deposit mine waste of 1M tpd into the Humbolt Current Large Marine Ecosystem (HCLME) which provides nearly 20% of the fish biomass harvested on a sustainable basis worldwide. Underwater pipelines discharge tailings as a slurry to create a continuous artificial turbidity current with particle size distribtions (PSD's) ranging from sand to clay sized fractions. Potential problems arise from benthic smothering, angular particulate uptake by benthic organisms, and from the bioaccumulation of a complex of heavy metals by both benthic and pelagic species.\nWhile much is known about the binding of copper and other toxic heavy metals in a reducing environment, little has been done to consider the implications of ocean dumping where 1% of tailings discharged may consist of unrecovered heavy metals. Synergistic cumulative impacts to just the HCLME from the dumping of the more than 3M tpy of reactive metals in these tailings sediments remains unknown and poses substantial risks. DSTP assumes a stable deep sea depositional environment but upwelling currents and plume shear may make this hard to accomplish.",

            "abstract": "Communities and northern development depend on knowledge to support safe infrastructure design and to define appropriate environmental targets. Projected climate change is expected to have substantial impacts on permafrost through increased seasonal thaw. These changes will likely result in changing hydrological processes that will alter surface and subsurface water flow and quality. Similarly, in settings with ice-rich surficial materials, changing active layer depth and hydrological conditions can contribute to permafrost degradation and land instability. Predicting these impacts is an important need for sustainable development in permafrost regions.\nWe have investigated these processes through a long term integrated watershed program at the Cape Bounty Arctic Watershed Observatory (CBAWO) in the Canadian Arctic. Surface water discharge and quality has been assessed since 2005 and in particular, through a period of record summer temperatures that resulted in substantial active layer perturbation and resulted in widespread localized disturbance. Research has documented the impact and recovery from these permafrost changes and demonstrate several key linkages between changing hydrological conditions, quality, and landscape sensitivity to disturbance. Deeper active layer thaw appears to alter subsurface flow paths, resulting sustained changes to water quality through increased solute fluxes and changes to nutrients. These effects are widespread across the landscape, while physical disturbance due to permafrost slope failures are dispersed and generate impacts ranging from minimal to locally-significant increases in downstream sediment and solute transport. We note that this strong spatial contrast between “thermal” and “physical” perturbation of the shallow permafrost system represents a key impact in these settings. Further, subsurface water pressurization appears to be localized but linked to physical disturbance. Hence, results indicate the benefit of an integrated approach to investigating impacts to the permafrost system through both hydrological and geomorphic perspectives.",

            "abstract": "Regional to global carbon assessments include a variety of models, data sets, and conceptual structures. This includes strategies for representing the role and capacity of soils to sequester, release, and store carbon. Traditionally, many soil carbon data sets emerged from agricultural missions focused on mapping and classifying soils to enhance and protect production of food and fiber. More recently, soil carbon assessments have allowed for more strategic measurement to address the functional and spatially explicit role that soils play in land-atmosphere carbon exchange. While soil data sets are increasingly inter-comparable and increasingly sampled to accommodate global assessments, soils remain poorly constrained or understood with regard to their role in spatio-temporal variations in carbon exchange. A more deliberate approach to rapid improvement in our understanding involves a community-based activity than embraces both a nimble data repository and a dynamic structure for prioritization. Data input and output can be transparent and retrievable as data-derived products, while also being subjected to rigorous queries for merging and harmonization into a searchable, comprehensive, transparent database. Meanwhile, adaptive action groups can prioritize data and modeling needs that emerge through workshops, meta-data analyses or model testing. Our continual renewal of priorities should address soil processes, mechanisms, and feedbacks that significantly influence global C budgets and/or significantly impact the needs and services of regional soil resources that are impacted by C management. In order to refine the International Soil Carbon Network, we welcome suggestions for such groups to be led on topics such as but not limited to manipulation experiments, extreme climate events, post-disaster C management, past climate-soil interactions, or water-soil-carbon linkages. We also welcome ideas for a business model that can foster and promote idea and data sharing.",

            "abstract": "Observations suggest the Greenland ice sheet albedo has declined since 2001, even in the dry snow zone (DSZ). We seek to explain the apparent DSZ albedo decline. We analyze samples representing 2012-2014 snowfall across NW Greenland for absorbing impurities (black carbon and dust) and model their impacts on snow albedo. Albedo reductions due to absorbing impurities are small, averaging 0.003, with episodic enhancements resulting in reductions of 0.01-0.02. No significant increase in black carbon or dust concentrations relative to recent decades is indicated. Enhanced deposition of absorbing impurities is not, therefore, causing significant albedo reduction in the DSZ or driving recent melt events. Analysis of MODIS surface reflectance indicates that the decline and spectral shift in DSZ albedo seen in C5 MODIS data contains contributions from uncorrected Terra sensor degradation. The discrepancies between Terra and Aqua are generally below the stated accuracy of MODIS products (0.05), but since discussions of Greenland albedo trends below this level are common in the literature, the identification of these discrepancies likely requires revisiting conclusions about the trends and spectral signature of Greenland DSZ albedo after C6 data is released.",

            "abstract": "The Observations and Modeling of the Green Ocean Amazon (GoAmazon2014/5) campaign took place from January 2014 to December 2015 in the vicinity of Manaus, Brazil. One main objective of GoAmazon 2014/5 is to investigate the aerosol lifecycle under background conditions and the impact from the Manaus pollution plume and biomass burning. Here we present the diurnal variation of aerosol properties, including aerosol size distribution and CCN spectrum, observed at the T0a background site (Amazon Tall Tower Observatory, 150 km upwind of Manaus) and the T3 site (70 km downwind of Manaus). Also shown are vertical distributions of aerosol observed onboard the DOE Gulfstream-1 research aircraft. During the wet season, aerosol under background conditions often exhibited a bimodal size distribution with an average concentration of ~320 cm-3. The vertical profile of aerosol size distribution showed high concentrations of Aitken mode particles in the free troposphere, suggesting particle sources at high altitudes. The sources and sinks of the boundary layer aerosol particles under the wet season background conditions are examined. During the dry season, background aerosol concentration increased by a factor of ~5 to ~1500 cm-3, due to a combination of regional biomass burning emissions and other factors. Background aerosol size distribution was typically unimodal with the mode diameter between 100 and 200 nm. Nucleation and Aiken mode particle concentrations exhibited strong enhancements in the Manaus plume. As the plume traveled downwind, particle growth and higher CCN activation fraction were observed, and are attributed to condensation of secondary species and coagulation. The impact of the Manaus urban plume on aerosol size distribution, CCN spectrum, and optical properties are examined, and the results from wet and dry seasons are compared.",

            "abstract": "Many regions of the U.S. and elsewhere are experiencing increased salinization of freshwater due to the widespread application of road salts. Increased salinization has the potential to release stored nutrients from sediments, decrease biodiversity, and perturb water quality. We conducted laboratory experiments to investigate the potential effects of road salt (NaCl) on nutrient mobilization from sediments to stream water. Sediments and stream water were incubated from 2 urbanizing watersheds of the Chesapeake Bay in the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan area. Stream sediment was incubated from 11 routinely monitored streams exhibiting a land use gradient within the Baltimore Ecosystem Study Long-Term Ecological Research (BES LTER) site and Anacostia River watershed. Our results indicate that salinization increased the release of soluble reactive phosphorus and total dissolved nitrogen at all sites. The release of dissolved organic carbon and dissolved inorganic carbon varied between sites, and these differential responses may be due to: stream sediment composition, organic matter content, and ambient water quality. The magnitude and frequency of road salt application may be amplified in the near future due to the interactive effects of climate variability and urbanization, and our research suggests this can have water quality and ecological implications for freshwater ecosystems. Further research is necessary to elucidate driving mechanisms of changes in sediment biogeochemical cycles in response to salinization and the temporal response of freshwater ecosystems.",

Debate continues over which stage of production (drilling, flowback, normal production, transmission, etc.) is the most prevalent VOC source.\nIn this study, we quantify emissions from normal production on well pads by using the EPA-developed Other Test Method 33a. This methodology combines ground-based measurements of fugitive emissions with 3-D wind data to calculate the methane and VOC emission fluxes from a point source. VOC fluxes are traditionally estimated by gathering a canister of air during a methane flux measurement. The methane:VOC ratio of this canister is determined at a later time in the laboratory, and applied to the known methane flux. The University of Wyoming Mobile Laboratory platform is equipped with a Picarro methane analyzer and an Ionicon Proton Transfer Reaction-Time of Flight-Mass Spectrometer, which provide real-time methane and VOC data for each well pad. This independent measurement of methane and VOCs in situ reveals multiple emission sources on one well pad, with varying methane:VOC ratios.\nWell pad emission estimates of methane, benzene, toluene and xylene for the two basins will be presented. The different emission source VOC profiles and the limitations of real-time and traditional VOC measurement methods will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "The North-East Corridor project aims to use a top-down inversion method to quantify sources of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in the urban areas of Washington DC and Baltimore at approximately 1km2 resolutions. The aim of this project is to help establish reliable measurement methods for quantifying and validating GHG emissions independently of the inventory methods typically used to guide mitigation efforts. Since inversion methods depend on atmospheric observations of GHG, deploying a suitable network of ground-based measurement stations is a fundamental step in estimating emissions from the perspective of the atmosphere with reasonable levels of uncertainty.\nThe purpose of this work is to design a tower based network of measurement stations that can reduce the uncertainty in emissions by 50% in the central areas of DC and Baltimore. To this end, the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF-ARW) was used along with the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport model (STILT) to derive the sensitivity of hypothetical observations to surface emissions (footprints) for the months of February and July 2013. An iterative selection algorithm, based on k-means clustering method, was applied in order to minimize the similarities between the temporal response of each site and maximize the urban contribution. Afterwards, a synthetic inversion Kalman Filter was used to evaluate the performances of the observing system based on the merit of the retrieval over time and the amount of a priori uncertainty reduced by the network.\nWe present the performances of various measurement networks that consist of different number of towers and where the location of these towers vary. Results show that too compact networks lose spatial coverage whilst too spread networks lose capabilities of constraining uncertainties in the fluxes. In addition, we explore the possibility of using a very high density network of low-cost, low-accuracy sensors characterized by larger uncertainties and drift over time. The convergence to the true values is faster with a large number of towers, reducing the response time of the filter. Larger uncertainties in the observations implies lower values of uncertainty reduction. On the other hand, the drift is a BIAS in nature, which is added to the observations and, therefore, biasing the retrieved fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Two types of decisions face society with respect to anthropogenic climate change: (1) whether to enact a global greenhouse gas abatement policy, and (2) how to adapt to the local consequences of current and future climatic changes. The practice of downscaling global climate models (GCMs) is often used to address (2) because GCMs do not resolve key features that will mediate global climate change at the local scale. In response, the development of downscaling techniques and models has accelerated to aid decision makers seeking adaptation guidance. However, quantifiable estimates of the value of information are difficult to obtain, particularly in decision contexts characterized by deep uncertainty and low system-controllability. Here we demonstrate a method to quantify the additional value that decision makers could expect if research investments are directed towards developing new downscaled climate projections. As a proof of concept we focus on a real-world management problem: whether to undertake assisted migration for an endangered tropical avian species. We also take advantage of recently published multivariate methods that account for three vexing issues in climate impacts modeling: maximizing climate model quality information, accounting for model dependence in ensembles of opportunity, and deriving probabilistic projections. We expand on these global methods by including regional (Caribbean Basin) and local (Puerto Rico) domains. In the local domain, we test whether a high resolution (2km) dynamically downscaled GCM reduces the multivariate error estimate compared to the original coarse-scale GCM. Initial tests show little difference between the downscaled and original GCM multivariate error. When propagated through to a species population model, the Value of Information analysis indicates that the expected utility that would accrue to the manager (and species) if this downscaling were completed may not justify the cost compared to alternative actions.",

The goal of this study was to characterize seasonal variability in daily transpiration activity (DTA) and timing of winter transpiration dormancy release among eight study sites across an elevation gradient. We defined DTA as the daily coefficient of determination (i.e. R2) of linear regressions between 30-minute measurements of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and tree sapflow. Transpiration dormancy date (EOD) was defined as the day that DTA became consistently > 0.3. Across sites, DTA was low (i.e. < 0.15) in winter, higher in the spring reaching a peak in early summer, indicating VPD and transpiration decouple in the winter but are coupled transiently in the spring. Lower elevation sites had more days with high DTA (i.e. > 0.3) than higher sites (82% and 49% respectively). Among sites, DTA was significantly correlated with air temperature and soil temperature (p < 0.05 for both). Site EODs were also significantly correlated with site elevation (p < 0.05); with the lower elevation sites experiencing EODs > 40 days earlier than higher elevation sites in 2013 and 2014 but only by 25 days earlier in 2015 due to cooler temperatures in May and above-average precipitation. Correlations between EOD and meteorological and edaphic conditions were inconsistent among study sites, requiring further study. However, in fall/winter of water year 2015 there were two distinct warm periods (20-Nov to 9-Dec and 5-Jan to 10-Feb) that temporarily initiated transpiration activity – the magnitude of which was correlated with site elevation. This study highlights the need for understanding of seasonal variability in forest transpiration that, if left unaccounted for, may skew representations of forest transpiration. Moreover, understanding the cues that end dormancy provides insight into how upper montane forests will react to shifts in future climate and snow melt dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s sedimentary carapace contains the largest surface-accessible reservoir of biogeochemically sensitive elements and contains several times more water than all of the present-day ice caps and glaciers combined. It is, therefore, widely recognized that on timescales of ~1 Myr, one of the most important factors governing the evolution of many Earth systems is the exchange of materials into and out of the sedimentary shell. Although it is rarely assumed that these rates of exchange are invariant, it is generally presumed that the sedimentary reservoir as a whole behaves as a single large, slowly cycling system in which erosion and sediment storage are balanced; hence the expectation that there is no net change in sediment volume. Here, using the Macrostrat database, which consists of surface and subsurface data for 1,474 locations as well as more than 700K geologic map-based polygons, we show that the sedimentary reservoir is best conceived of as multiple reservoirs with different intrinsic cycling rates determined by tectonic and environmental contexts of deposition. We also show that the volume of sediment stored on presently subaerially exposed North America has increased markedly during the Phanerozoic. Initiation of growth in the size of this epicontinental sedimentary reservoir is well recorded by the Great Unconformity, which separates predominately Precambrian-aged, low porosity crystalline and metamorphic basement rocks from overlying, more porous Cambrian and younger sedimentary deposits. Geologic map-based data from Eurasia and Australia suggest similar overall patterns globally. Thus, after burial of the subaerially exposed Great Unconformity surface by Cambrian-Ordovician sediments, the groundwater storage capacity of the continents increased by more than 15 million cubic km (~1% of present ocean volume). Subsequent burial by younger sedimentary deposits further increased epicontinental groundwater storage capacity to the ~130 million cubic km it contains today. Nearly monotonic growth in groundwater storage capacity may have accentuated tectonically-forced changes in sea level, may account for some of the observed long-term decline in the percentage of continental crust covered by shallow seas, and could have contributed to long-term trends in some related geochemical records.",

We present a survey of temperature, salinity, O2, pH, and currents at intermediate depths (defined here as 50–500 m) in the summer (June 30 to July 10) and winter (December 8 to 15) of 2012 in the southern region of the Southern California Bight. Observations of temperature, salinity, and currents reveal that local bathymetry and small gyres play an important role in the flow path of the California Undercurrent (CU). Using spiciness (π) as a tracer, we observe a 10% increase of Pacific Equatorial Water (PEW) in the core of the CU during the summer versus the winter. This is associated with an increase in π of 0.2, and a decrease in O2 and pH of 30 µmol kg-1 and 0.022, respectively; the change in pH is driven by increased CO2, while total alkalinity remains unchanged. The high-π, low-O2, low-pH waters during the summer are not distributed uniformly in the study region. Moreover, mooring observations at the edge of the continental shelf reveal intermittent intrusions of PEW onto the shelf with concomitant decreases in O2 and pH. We estimate that increased advection of PEW in the CU could account for approximately 50% of the observed decrease in O2, and between 49 and 73% of the decrease in pH, over the past three decades.

            "abstract": "How might climate change and the resulting sea level rise (SLR) affect coastal facilities? The changing frequency of nuisance flooding events will likely lead to increases in costs and may require changes to the management of assets. While a significant literature exists for climate change and extreme event impacts, there is a gap in the literature for impacts from nuisance events. This presentation explores methods for analyzing the changing frequency and spatial distribution of flooding events through a case study at the United States Naval Academy located in Annapolis, Maryland. We show that `nuisance events' -- not infrequent but low impact events, will become more frequent as a result of climate change and the resultant sea level rise. An increase in nuisance flooding events could lead to negative effects on day-to-day operations. For example, a vulnerable building on the campus currently averages 0.25 flood events per year at a cost of between 2,500 - 3,700 USD (deployment of flood protection measures). By 2055 the same building in an average year would need to deploy flood protection measures 33 times at a cost of between 300,000 - 500,000 USD (assuming constant costs). The costs for the entire installation could be much higher given the number of buildings located in vulnerable areas, in addition to the risk adverse nature of operations managers. This case study identifies a need to better understand the local relationship between operations costs, thresholds, and changes in locally important climate variables.",

            "abstract": "Gas hydrates have been considered as a new source of natural gases. For the gas hydrate production, the gas hydrate reservoir should be depressurized below the equilibrium pressure of gas hydrates. Therefore, it is important to predict the equilibrium of gas hydrates in the reservoir conditions because it can be affected by the pore size of the host sediments due to the capillary effect. In this study, gas hydrates were synthesized in fine-grained sediment samples including a pure silt sample and a natural clayey silt sample cored from a hydrate occurrence region in Ulleung Basin, East Sea, offshore Korea. Pore size distributions of the samples were obtained by the nitrogen adsorption and desorption test and the mercury intrusion porosimetry. The equilibrium curve of gas hydrates in the fine-grained sediments were found to be significantly influenced by the clay fraction and the corresponding small pores (>50 nm in diameter). For the clayey silt sample, the equilibrium pressure was higher by ~1.4 MPa than the bulk equilibrium pressure. In most cases of oceanic gas hydrate reservoirs, sandy layers are found interbedded with fine-grained sediment layers while gas hydrates are intensively accumulated in the sandy layers. Our experiment results reveal the inhibition effect of fine-grained sediments against gas hydrate formation, in which greater driving forces (e.g., higher pressure or lower temperature) are required during natural gas migration. Therefore, gas hydrate distribution in interbedded layers of sandy and fine-grained sediments can be explained by such capillary effect induced by the pore size distribution of host sediments.",

Our modern economy now depends heavily on large-scale, energy-intensive technologies. A transition to low carbon, renewable sources of energy is needed. We will develop a procedure for designing and analyzing renewable energy systems based on the magnitude, distribution, temporal characteristics, reliability and costs of the various renewable resources (including biomass waste streams) in combination with various measures to control the magnitude and timing of energy demand. The southern Canadian prairies are an ideal location for developing renewable energy networks. The region is blessed with steady, westerly winds and bright sunshine for more hours annually than Houston Texas. Extensive irrigation agriculture provides huge waste streams that can be processed biologically and chemically to create a range of biofuels. The first stage involves mapping existing energy and waste flows on a neighbourhood, municipal, and regional level. Optimal sites and combinations of sites for solar and wind electrical generation, such as ridges, rooftops and valley walls, will be identified. Geomatics based site and grid analyses will identify best locations for energy production based on efficient production and connectivity to regional grids.",

Better quantifying these emissions is crucial to establish an accurate methane budget for the United States. One obstacle is that these emissions often occur in areas near livestock facilities where biogenic methane abounds. Measuring ethane, which has no biogenic source, along with methane can tease these sources apart. However, ethane is typically measured by taking whole-air samples. This tactic has lower spatial resolution than making in situ measurements and requires the measurer to anticipate the location of emission plumes. This leaves unexpected plumes uncharacterized. Using Re-injection Mirror Integrated Cavity Output Spectroscopy (RIM-ICOS), we can measure both methane and ethane in flight, allowing us to establish more accurate fugitive emissions data that can more readily distinguish between different sources of this greenhouse gas.",

Incident photons are converted to visible light using a sealed tube UV converter. The converter output is coupled to the CCD active area using a bonded fiber optic taper. The CCD (Teledyne DALSA FTT1010M) is a 1024x1024 frame transfer architecture. The camera readout electronics provide video imagery to the spacecraft over a 21 bit serialized LVDS interface, nominally at 10 frames per second and in 512x512 format (2x2 pixel binning). The CCD and primary electronics assembly reside in separate thermal zones, to minimize dark current without active cooling.\nEngineering and flight camera systems have been assembled, integrated, and tested under both ambient pressure and thermal vacuum environments. The CCD cameras have been fully characterized with both visible light (prior to integration with the UV converter) and UV photons (following system integration). Measured parameters include camera dark current, dark signal non-uniformity, read noise, linearity, gain, pulse height distribution, dynamic range, charge transfer efficiency, resolution, relative efficiency, quantum efficiency, and full well capacity. UV characterization of the camera systems over a range of microchannel plate (MCP) voltages during thermal vacuum testing demonstrates that camera performance will meet the critical on-orbit FUV dynamic range requirements. Flight camera integration with the FUV instrument and sensor calibration is planned for Fall 2015. Camera design and full performance data for the engineering and flight model cameras will be presented.",

            "abstract": "We explored injection-induced earthquake behavior in geologic settings where basement faults are connected hydraulically to overlying saline aquifers targeted for wastewater disposal. Understanding how the interaction between natural geology and injection well operations affects the behavior of injection-induced earthquake sequences has important implications for characterizing seismic hazard risk. Numerical experiments were performed to investigate the extent to which seismicity is influenced by the migration of pressure perturbations along fault zones. Two distinct behaviors were observed: a) earthquake ruptures that were confined to the pressurized region of the fault and b) sustained earthquake ruptures that propagated far beyond the pressure front. These two faulting mechanisms have important implications for assessing the manner in which seismicity can be expected respond to injection well operations.\nBased upon observations from the numerical experiments, we developed a criterion that can be used to classify the expected faulting behavior near wastewater disposal sites. The faulting criterion depends on the state of stress, the initial fluid pressure, the orientation of the fault, and the dynamic friction coefficient of the fault. If the initial ratio of shear to effective normal stress resolved on the fault (the prestress ratio) is less than the fault's dynamic friction coefficient, then earthquake ruptures will tend to be limited by the distance of the pressure front. In this case, parameters that affect seismic hazard assessment, like the maximum earthquake magnitude or earthquake recurrence interval, could correlate with injection well operational parameters. For example, the maximum earthquake magnitude might be expected to grow over time in a systematic manner as larger patches of the fault are exposed to significant pressure changes. In contrast, if the prestress ratio is greater than dynamic friction, a stress drop can occur outside of the pressurized region providing the energy necessary to drive ruptures beyond the pressure front. In this case, although fluid injection may be ultimately responsible for causing earthquakes to nucleate, the seismicity might depend more closely on characteristics of the natural geology, such as the size of the fault.

            "abstract": "ePoster - merging_poster.pdf\nThe updrafts that produce deep cumulus clouds have long been conceptually viewed and parameterized as only interacting indirectly, through their collective effects on the large-scale fields of temperature, water vapor, condensate, and horizontal wind. However, it is known that when updrafts develop in close proximity it is possible for them to merge, and thereby produce a larger and less rapidly entraining updraft compared to its precursors. Updraft merging at some height above cloud base level may be able to explain several puzzling features of near-cloud-base updraft properties. Updraft merging is favored by situations that congregate updrafts, such as gust fronts produced by convective cold pools. We are analyzing large-eddy simulations of deep convection to determine the importance of updraft merging and the factors that favor its occurrence. We are also considering how to incorporate the effects of updraft merging in cumulus parameterizations.",

            "abstract": "Despite ongoing efforts worldwide to compile different databases for volcanic eruptions, eruption records, particularly those of earlier time periods, are pervasively incomplete, a problem that is exacerbated when dealing with catalogs derived from geologic records. When using statistical models to analyze this type of records, missing data can strongly influence the parameter estimates, which are usually obtained by maximizing the log likelihood function, and hence affect the future hazard estimate. This work explores a hidden Markov model framework to handle missing data in volcanic eruption records. This framework will enable us to estimate the completeness level of the records, and offers a means of determining where in the record the missing observations are likely to be found. We apply these methods to different volcanic eruption records with the aim to estimate the completeness of the records over time and to obtain more robust estimates of the likelihood of future eruptions.",

            "abstract": "We have run the Advanced Research Weather Research and Forecasting Model (ARW) at scales that numerically resolve convection over a broad swath of the north central U.S. Our intentions were to simulate convective events that generated stratospheric water vapor plumes observed during the SEAC4RS mission, to quantify the amount of water vapor injected into the stratosphere by extremely deep convection, and to investigate ARW as a potential tool to forecast multi-decadal trends in extremely deep convection over North America. We have run ARW for five and a half days beginning at 12 UTC on 26 August 2013 on a 3-km horizontal grid with 50 vertical levels. We used MERRA for the initial conditions and boundary conditions because of its skill in reanalysis of water vapor. ARW was able to simulate many of the fundamental features of deep convection over North America, including specific events. We have shown that the convection simulated by ARW bears many of the features of mesoscale convective systems, including the flow of cold air over warm moist air, cold downdrafts and gust fronts, mid-level inflow, and wedges reminiscent of squall lines. The source of water vapor for the convection is low-level eastward transport into the ARW domain. Convection is initiated where local maxima in equivalent potential temperature of surface air form. Convection regularly penetrates to the level of neutral buoyancy of the surface air and can even influence the concentration of water vapor above. A few convective events inject water vapor above the 400 K potential temperature surface. Surprisingly, deep convective events can also desiccate the upper air, even in the stratosphere. There is clear evidence of convection generating ducted internal gravity waves that propagate upstream to trigger more deep convection. We will present a quantification of the amount of water vapor injected into the stratosphere by extremely deep convection, the causes of desiccation, and the mechanisms responsible for triggering extremely deep convection.",

Improved travel time predictions lead directly to significant improvements in the accuracy and precision of seismic event locations as compared to locations computed using standard 1D velocity models like ak135, or 2½D models like RSTT. A key feature of SALSA3D is that path-specific model uncertainty of travel time predictions are calculated using the full 3D model covariance matrix computed during tomography, which results in more realistic uncertainty ellipses that directly reflect tomographic data coverage. Recent improvements in the model include the generation of an S velocity model to compliment the P velocity model and development of capability to compute travel times for core phases, reflections off the core-mantle boundary and underside reflections off the Moho and the surface of the Earth. For use in routine operations, travel time predictions and prediction uncertainties are precomputed and stored in station-phase-specific 3D lookup tables, which allows fast, reliable retrieval of information needed by locators. The lookup capabilities are based on the open-source GeoTess software package available at http://www.sandia.gov/geotess.",

            "abstract": "The McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica is comprised of alpine and terminal glaciers, large expanses of patterned ground, and ice-covered lakes in the valley floors, which are linked by glacial meltwater streams that flow during the austral summer. As part of the McMurdo Dry Valleys Long-Term Ecological research project, we have observed stream ecosystem response to a sustained 18 year cool period with low flows, which has been recently interrupted by three \"flood events\" during sunny, warm summers. Many of these streams contain thriving microbial mats comprised of cyanobacteria and endemic diatoms, the most diverse group of eukaryotic organisms in the valleys. Of the 45 diatom taxa, some common taxa are heavily silicified, Hantzschia amphioxys f. muelleri, while others are only lightly silicified. By comparing diatom communities in streams which flow every summer with those in streams that only flow during flood events, we found that hydrologic flow regime acts as a strong environmental filter on diatom community composition. Following the first flood event in 2001/02, mat biomass was two-fold lower due to scouring and recovered over several years, with lesser declines following the subsequent floods. In the longer streams, the diatom community composition remained stable through the flood events, whereas in two of the shorter streams, Green and Bowles Creeks, the diatom community shifted after the first flood event to a greater abundance of lightly silicified taxa. Water quality monitoring and reactive transport modeling have shown that rapid weathering of silicate minerals in the hyporheic zone accounts for the downstream increases in Si concentration which are observed in the longer streams. One mechanism driving this greater abundance of lightly silicified diatoms in shorter streams could be the greater dilution of the Si supply from hyporheic weathering in shorter streams under high flows. Given that the stream diatom community is well preserved in the 40,000-year sediment record from the receiving lake, greater understanding of hydrologic and biogeochemical controls on diatom community composition provides insight into the evolution of the lakes and geologic history of the region.",

            "abstract": "The coupled chemical and mechanical response of reservoir and seal rocks to injection of CO2 have major implications on the short and long term security of sequestered carbon. Many current numerical models evaluating behavior of reservoirs and seals during and after CO2 injection in the subsurface consider chemistry and mechanics separately and use only simple mechanical stability criteria while ignoring time-dependent failure parameters. CO2 injection irreversibly alters the subsurface chemical environment which can then affect geomechanical properties on a range of time scales by altering rock mineralogy and cements through dissolution, remobilization, and precipitation. It has also been documented that geomechanical parameters such as fracture toughness (KIC) and subcritical index (SCI) are sensitive to chemical environment.\nDouble torsion fracture mechanics testing of reservoir lithologies under controlled environmental conditions relevant to CO2 sequestration show that chemical environment can measurably affect KIC and SCI. This coupled chemical-mechanical behavior is also influenced by rock composition, grains, amount and types of cement, and fabric. Fracture mechanics testing of the Aztec Sandstone, a largely silica-cemented, subarkose sandstone demonstrate it is less sensitive to chemical environment than Entrada Sandstone, a silty, clay-rich sandstone. The presence of de-ionized water lowers KIC by approximately 20% and SCI 30% in the Aztec Sandstone relative to tests performed in air, whereas the Entrada Sandstone shows reductions on the order of 70% and 90%, respectively. These results indicate that rock composition influences the chemical-mechanical response to deformation, and that the relative chemical reactivity of target reservoirs should be recognized in context of CO2 sequestration. In general, inert grains and cements such as quartz will be less sensitive to the changing subsurface environment than carbonates and clays.",

Observations by the MESSENGER spacecraft have significantly reduced the uncertainty in the spherical harmonic 2nd-degree (l2) topography and gravity coefficients. Similar to those of the Moon, the long wavelength shape and geoid of Mercury are significantly out of hydrostatic equilibrium [Perry et al., 2015]. The diversion from equilibrium of the Moon has been attributed to orbital evolution and the “freezing-in” of a fossil bulge. With respect to Mercury, the disequilibrium of the l2 shape and geoid is unlikely to be due to its orbital history [Matsuyama and Nimmo, 2009].\nNon-hydrostatic models can explain the gravity and shape of Mercury. Buoyancy from thermal anomalies isostatically supporting the surface falls short of reproducing the observed l2 admittance and topography. We explore three scenarios that can generate high admittances at degree-2: flexural/membrane loading on the surface, buoyant structures within the mantle, or topography on the core-mantle boundary. We discuss both isostatic and dynamic models of compensation, and include variations of viscosity structure and elastic properties. However, typical sources of these mechanisms (e.g. large volcanic provinces that collectively have symmetry about the equator or mantle convection with a strong l2 component) are not obviously present on Mercury.",

Apparent excavation and ejection of mafic/ultramafic target rock by the KT boundary impact might imply an additional KT impact site involving oceanic lithosphere. We speculate: 1) The Greater Antilles island chain ophiolite belt marks the rim of a ~700 km diameter impact basin, deformed and dismembered from an originally circular form by at least 50 million years of left lateral shear on the North American-Caribbean transform plate boundary; 2) Other ophiolite segments may similarly mark rims of large impact basins deformed to greater or lesser extent by, and serving as strain markers for, relative plate motions over geologic time; 3) The Greater Antilles/Chicxulub and Sulu Sea Basin/Spratly Island cases may constitute doublet craters of similar size ratio and separation distance; 4) Plate boundaries may be formed or modified by such impacts. Problems include: 1) The KT fireball layer should be tens of cm thick rather than a few mm thick [8-9]; 2) Impact basins of this size/scale are not expected in the Phanerozoic/Proterozoic [10];\n",

            "abstract": "The Mogollon-Datil volcanic field (MDVF) is a 40-20 ma cluster of caldera activity in southern New Mexico tied to the subduction of oceanic lithosphere beneath the North American continental plate. The calk-alkaline magmatism of the three calderas in this field (Mogollon, Bursum, and Gila Cliff Dwellings) produced several voluminous regionally dispersed ash flow tuffs. This study will specifically examine the volcanic rocks: Cooney Formation (a compositionally zoned rhyolitic to quartz latite ash flow tuff containing quartz>k-feldspar>plagioclase>biotite, and pumice and lithic fragments. Rb ranges from 213-317ppm, Sr from 104-108ppm, and 87Sr/86Srm from 0.71326-0.71534), Davis Canyon Tuff (a phenocryst poor, high-silica rhyolite ash flow tuff containing sanidine>quartz>sodic plagioclase. Rb ranges from 214-230ppm, Sr from 42.2-63.2ppm, and 87Sr/86Srm from 0.71383-0.71464), and the Shelley Peak Tuff (a compositionally zoned, crystal-rich rhyolite tuff containing sodic plagioclase>minor sanidine>biotite>cpx. Rb ranges from 154-213ppm, Sr from 105-245ppm, and 87Sr/86Srm from 0.70944-0.7112) to further elucidate their petrogenic origins, attempt to determine if they may be of the same magmatic source, and yield data that could help model processes that would generate magma of these particular compositions.\nThis study will examine compositional variation between the Davis Canyon, Shelley Peak and Cooney Tuffs and help with understanding the magma plumbing system during each eruption. More specifically, we will evaluate possible crustal components of these units, along with looking for geochemical signatures of arc or rift related magmatism. We will compare previous geochronology results (K-Ar and U-Pb fission track) and whole rock major and trace element geochemistry to data obtained via 40Ar/39Ar and U/Pb dates and new whole rock Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic ratios.",

The model chain is driven by output from atmospheric datasets with a simple in-house downscaling scheme which uses only data on atmospheric pressure-levels and a DEM (Fiddes and Gruber 2014). The scheme has been tested in the case of mountain permafrost in the European Alps (Fiddes and Gruber 2015) with good results. However the strength of the scheme is application to remote data-sparse regions. Recently we have applied the scheme to simulate permafrost conditions in the Western Himalaya. This included a simple approach to correct snow mass balance using MODIS products, as input precipitation from atmospheric models may often have bias. The scheme is flexible in choice of atmospheric model input data, numerical surface model and surface data. In this abstract we will (1) present the model chain, (2) show the results of simulating permafrost conditions over large areas using only global datasets as input and (3) give an outlook to simulating future conditions.\nFiddes, J., Endrizzi, S., and Gruber, S. 2015: Large-area land surface simulations in heterogeneous terrain driven by global data sets: application to mountain permafrost, The Cryosphere, 9, 411-426, doi:10.5194/tc-9-411-2015, 2015. http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-411-2015\nFiddes, J. & Gruber, S. 2014: TopoSCALE v.1.0: downscaling gridded climate data in complex terrain, Geoscientific Model Development, 7, 387-405, http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-7-387-2014\nFiddes, J. & Gruber, S. 2012: TopoSUB: a tool for efficient large area numerical modelling in complex topography at sub-grid scales, Geoscientific Model Development, 5, 1245–1257,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/gmd-5-1245-2012",

It still remains a mystery, though, why KH under southward IMF occurs only at one quarter of the rate compared to northward IMF [Kavosi and Raeder, 2015], and whether or not such waves occur only under specific conditions. The previous study [Hwang et al., 2011] suggested that the irregular and temporally intermittent structure of KH waves due to dynamically active sub solar behavior under southward IMF condition may explain the preferential in situ detection of KH waves under northward IMF. This explanation is also consistent with the KH events under southward IMF in our database. The majority of the events during southward IMF are irregular, short and polychromatic in compare to regular, long lasting and monochromatic waves under northward IMF. To effectively isolate these differences, we have used both our extensive THEMIS KH event database and OpenGGCM simulations. Our simulation results show that the KH waves under southward IMF are irregular, higher frequency, lower amplitude, and polychromatic compared to northward IMF. Additionally, our statistical analysis shows that occurrence rate of KH wave as a function of solar wind plasma parameters is different under southward IMF compared to northward IMF.",

            "abstract": "Carbon farms have a pivotal role in national and international efforts to mitigate and adapt to climate change. A carbon farm in its broadest sense is one that reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions or captures and holds carbon in vegetation and soils. Their capacity to remove carbon from the air and store it safely and permanently, while providing additional human and ecosystem benefits, means they could contribute significantly to national efforts to stabilize or reduce GHGs.\nWe examine carbon farms in the context of corn and soybean production agriculture. We illustrate, using Iowa data but with relevance across United States corn and soybean production, the potential for carbon farms to reduce human GHG emissions and sequester carbon permanently at a rate that has meaningful impact on global greenhouse gas concentration. Carbon has been viewed as a next generation cash crop in Iowa for over a decade. The carbon farm perspective, however, goes beyond carbon as cash crop to make carbon the center of an entire farm enterprise. The transformation is possible through slight adjustment crop practices mixed with advances in technology to sequester carbon through biochar.\nWe examine carbon balance of Iowa agriculture given only the combination of slight reduction in fertilizer and sequestration by biochar. We find the following.\nIowa carbon farms could turn Iowa agriculture into a carbon sink. The estimated range of GHG reduction by statewide implementation of carbon farms is 19.46 to 90.27 MMt CO2-equivalent (CO2-e), while the current agricultural CO2-e emission estimate is 35.38 MMt CO2-e.\nIowa carbon farm GHG reduction would exceed Iowa GHG reduction by wind energy (8.7 MMt CO2-e) and could exceed combined reductions from wind energy and corn grain ethanol (10.7 MMt CO2-e; 19.4 MMt CO2-e combined). In fact, Iowa carbon farms alone could exceed GHG reduction from national corn grain ethanol production (39.6 MMt CO2-e).\nA carbon price accessible to agricultural producers could generate revenue at carbon price of $15 per t CO2-e and $45 per t CO2-e in the range of $415 - $475 ha-1 and $440 - $620 ha-1, respectively.\nAs a carbon negative technology, carbon farms could provide the backbone technology for a carbon neutral transportation biofuel through reduced indirect land use change.",

            "abstract": "Mali, a West Africa Sahelian country, is characterized by a strong dependence on rain-fed agriculture and a low adaptive capacity, making it one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change worldwide. Moreover, although with high uncertainties, most climate models used for the region recognize a growing uncertainty in the onset of the rainy season, which demands urgent adaptation measures. Early-season drought limits crops germination, and hence growth, and yield during rainfed depending production as is common now in Mali, West Africa. Crops germination and establishment could be improved by using seed priming, a process that dry seeds take up water to initiate the primary stages of germination, but the amount of water added is not enough for completing germination.\nThe effects of hydro-priming (distilled, tap, rain, river and well water) were evaluated for three priming durations (4, 8 and 12 hour) in 2014 and 2015. Monitored were seed germination and seedling development of nine sorghum genotypes. Preliminary results showed that hydro-priming significantly improved germination rate, germination speed, number of seminal root, rate of survival and seedling vigour index, compared to non-primed seed treatments. However, seedling length, root length, shoot length and seedling dry weight did not differ significantly. Four out of the nine genotypes evaluated were attributed good seed quality and good response to hydro-priming. The priming with different sources of water resulted in higher seed germination (90%) and seedling development with well and river water, compared to the others. Seed germination rate, uniformity and speed were also enhanced by hydro-priming. It is argued that hydro-priming is a simple but effective method for improving seed germination and seedling development of sorghum. In addition hydro-priming is a safe, simple and inexpensive method to enhance germination. The most promising genotypes have consequently been included in consequent pot and field trials for further investigation.

            "abstract": "The speciation of aqueous uranium ions is an important factor in predicting its mobility and fate in the environment. Two major controls on speciation are pH and the presence of complexing ligands. For the case of aqueous uranyl, UO22+(aq), some common complexes include uranyl-hydroxy, uranyl-carbonato, and uranyl-calcium-carbonato complexes, all of which differ in chemical reactivity and mobility. Uranyl-silicate complexes are also known but remain poorly characterized. In this work, we studied uranyl speciation in a series of aqueous solutions of 0.1 mM uranyl and 2 mM silicate with pH ranging from 4 to 7. Extended X-Ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectra of these samples were recorded at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory). Of particular note are the uranyl and silicate concentrations employed in our experiments, which are lower than conditions in previously reported EXAFS studies and approach conditions in natural groundwater systems. Preliminary analyses of EXAFS data indicate that uranyl speciation changes across the pH range, consistent with published thermodynamic data that suggest uranyl-silicate complexes may be important for pH ~ 5 and below, while uranyl-carbonato complexes become dominant at circumneutral pH. To guide the interpretation of the EXAFS data, molecular-scale simulations were carried out using density functional theory. We considered two classes of models: (i) hydrated clusters, and (ii) ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of 3D-periodic models involving uranyl and silicate in water. These calculations reveal that at pH ~ 5, the uranyl speciation is the [UO2(H2O)4H3SiO4]+ complex formed by the substitution of an equatorial uranyl water with a monodentate silicate ligand. The evidence from experiments and simulations provide a consistent picture for the uranyl-silicate complex, which may be important in the transport of uranyl in acidic, silicate-rich waters.",

            "abstract": "Woody plants have expanded into grasslands over the last century, altering plant diversity, resource availability, and carbon and water fluxes in these systems. In the tallgrass prairies of northeastern Kansas, Cornus drummondii is a clonal C3 shrub that forms monospecific “islands” and is currently increasing in abundance and cover. Clonal expansion of C. drummondii may alter site ecohydrology in unpredictable ways, particularly if physiological characteristics vary throughout an island or change as island size increases. Here, we investigated the physiology of C. drummondii within individual islands and across islands of varying sizes in a mesic tallgrass prairie. We selected six C. drummondii islands of varying sizes at the Konza Prairie Long Term Ecological Research site near Manhattan, KS, USA. Within each island, we measured leaf-level gas exchange and leaf water potential at five ramets equidistant from the outer edge of the island to the center, bi-weekly during the 2015 growing season. Additionally, external heat pulse sap flow sensors were installed at three positions within each island that measured stem sap flow every 10 minutes. We found that leaf level gas exchange rates were consistently higher in the small islands than the medium and large islands, and that the outer most sampling location of the islands had higher net photosynthesis compared to the rest of the island. Conversely, leaf-water potential and stem sap flow rates did not differ between island sizes or within individual islands. These results suggest that carbon, not water flux dynamics, may vary as C. drummondii island size increases at the Konza Prairie. Additionally, these results will facilitate scaling water fluxes from individual shrub islands to watersheds that are encroached with C. drummondii and will ultimately improve our ability to predict changes in the water budget between woody encroached grasslands versus unencroached grasslands.",

            "abstract": "Vegetation fires can alter landscapes and are a significant source of atmospheric emissions, particulates and greenhouse gases. Currently, only coarse spatial resolution sensors with high temporal coverage, such as MODIS or VIIRS, are used for routine global active fire mapping. Higher spatial resolution satellites have not been used due to their low temporal coverage and so are less useful for monitoring fires at the time of satellite overpass. However, looking forward, combination of the recently launched Landsat-8 (2013), Sentinel-2A (2015) and upcoming Sentinel-2B (2016) sensor data will provide 10-30m global coverage multi-spectral reflective wavelength observations approximately every three days. Therefore the development of reflective wavelength active fire detections to take advantage of these new data is highly attractive. Conventional detection algorithms use the elevated thermal emission of fire to detect the location of fires burning at the time of satellite overpass and apply contextual checks to remove commission errors by examination of neighboring pixels. A Landsat 8 active fire detection algorithm that takes advantage of the improved 12-bit radiometric resolution and high reflectance saturation of the Landsat 8 OLI detectors is presented. The algorithm uses the 1.6 μm and 2.2 μm bands without the need for a contextual implementation, or thermal bands, and was parameterized using six months of Landsat 8 data over the conterminous United States. Active fire detection results for Landsat 8 scenes acquired over a range of fire sizes and temperatures in Canada, Brazil and Southern Africa are presented and compared to detections found using an existing Landsat 7 contextual algorithm adapted to the Landsat 8 bands. Results show that the Landsat 8 algorithm has potential for global application, with relatively low omission and commission errors, and is suitable for application to the corresponding Sentinel 2 reflectance wavelength bands.",

            "abstract": "Sustainable water management in the San Joaquin Valley, California involves the complex interaction of agricultural, municipal and industrial, and environmental water use. California’s Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) of 2014 requires groundwater basins historically in a state of overdraft to bring the basin into a sustainable balance over the next 20 years. In addition to limiting groundwater availability, implementation of the SGMA has implications for surface and groundwater quality. Availability of groundwater influences agricultural production decisions, resulting in variation in agricultural runoff and changes to surface and groundwater quality. Changes in water quality have economic impacts on agricultural production and urban water use. These impacts range from reductions in crop productivity to costs of alternative water supplies to amend declining water quality. We model the impact of agricultural and urban groundwater availability on surface water quality within the San Joaquin and Kings River watersheds in the Central Valley, downriver to the Mendota Pool by linking SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool), an integrated water supply-quality model, with SWAP (Statewide Agricultural Production Model), a regional agricultural economics model. The integrated model specifies the relationship between changes in groundwater availability, groundwater elevation, agricultural production, and surface water quality. We link the SWAT-SWAP model output to urban and agricultural economic loss calculations that are a function of water quality. Model results demonstrate the economic tradeoffs between groundwater availability and water quality. The results of the integrated economic water supply-quality model are applicable to other regions in California and elsewhere that contain complex water supply-quality interactions.",

Some multiparameter FWI success stories have been reported, a range of challenges remain, one being the parameter cross-talk, i.e., the confusion associated with the overlap of one parameter’s Fréchet derivative wavefield with another’s. Parameter cross-talk is largely decided by the scattering pattern produced by each parameter, i.e., the relative strength of incoming to outgoing waves from a volume scattering element as a function of opening angle. We have derived the 3D scattering patterns associated with the elastic constants of general anisotropic media, and applied them, in the specific case of HTI media, in an analysis of anisotropic parameter cross-talk and the ability of a FWI update to suppress it. This involves the inverse Hessian operator and its various approximations, in their capacity to adjust and weight bare gradients. Gradients alone exhibit cross-talk, as well as artifacts caused by doubly-scattered energy in the data residuals. We determine with numerical examples that the approximate inverse Hessian associated with a Gauss-Newton update contains the mechanism necessary to suppress a significant fraction of parameter cross-talk in the gradient; and, that the residual-dependent portion of the inverse Hessian, constructed using the adjoint-state method, contains the mechanisms for suppression of multi-parameter second-order scattering artifacts in the gradient.",

            "abstract": "Measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) of anthropogenic emissions and natural sources and sinks of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are crucial to predict climate change and develop transparent accounting policies to contain climate forcing. Remote sensing technologies are monitoring column averaged dry air mole fractions of CO2 and CH4 (XCO2 & XCH4) from ground and space (OCO-2 and GOSAT) with solar spectroscopy enabling direct MRV. However, current ground based coverage is sparse due to the need for large and expensive high-resolution spectrometers that are part of the Total Column Carbon Observing Network (TCCON, Bruker 125HR). This limits our MRV and satellite validation abilities, both regionally and globally. There are striking monitoring gaps in Asia, South America and Africa where the CO2 emissions are growing and there is a large uncertainty in fluxes from land use change, biomass burning and rainforest vulnerability. To fill this gap we evaluate the precision, accuracy and stability of compact, affordable and easy to use low-resolution spectrometers (Bruker EM27/SUN) by comparing with XCO2 and XCH4 retrieved from much larger high-resolution TCCON instruments. As these instruments will be used in a variety of locations, we evaluate their performance by comparing with 2 previous and 4 current United States TCCON sites in different regions up to 2700 km apart. These sites range from polluted to unpolluted, latitudes of 32 to 46°N, and altitudes of 230 to 2241 masl. Comparisons with some of these sites cover multiple years allowing assessment of the EM27/SUN performance not only in various regions, but also over an extended period of time and with different seasonal influences. Results show that our 2 EM27/SUN instruments capture the diurnal variability of the aforementioned constituents very well, but with offsets from TCCON and long-term variability which may be due in part to the extensive movement these spectrometers were subjected to. These off-the-shelf spectrometers should dramatically expand the coverage of regional XCO2 and XCH4 observations, particularly in gap regions. Increased temporal and spacial resolution on global carbon data will lead to more reliable information when considering climate change policy and funding.",

In the winter, atmospheric particles and trace gases are transported from the mid-latitudes to the Arctic, forming a springtime ‘Arctic haze’. In the winter-spring, thinning sea ice is causing ice fracturing and the formation of open sea ice leads, which are suggested to be a source of local sea spray aerosol. To investigate the chemical composition and source of atmospheric aerosols during the winter-spring transition in the Arctic, 0.1-5 µm particles were collected during January and February 2014 near Barrow, Alaska. The elemental composition and morphology of these particles were examined using computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (CCSEM-EDX). Significantly, major contributions of sea spray aerosol were observed for both submicron and supermicron size ranges during a nearby open lead event, and organic-sulfate (‘Arctic haze’) particles were also abundant at <1 µm in diameter. The single-particle chemical composition, sources, and evidence of aging processes will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Unconsolidated Holocene deltaic sediments comprise levee foundation soils in New Orleans, USA. Whereas geotechnical tests at point locations are indispensable for evaluating soil stability, the highly variable sedimentary facies of the Mississippi delta create difficulties to predict soil conditions between test locations. Combined electrical resistivity and seismic shear wave studies, calibrated to geotechnical data, may provide an efficient methodology to predict soil types between geotechnical sites at shallow depths (0- 10 m).\nThe London Avenue Canal levee flank of New Orleans, which failed in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, 2005, presents a suitable site in which to pioneer these geophysical relationships. Preliminary cross-plots show electrically resistive, high-shear-wave velocity areas interpreted as low-permeability, resistive silt. In brackish coastal environments, low-resistivity and low-shear-wave-velocity areas may indicate both saturated, unconsolidated sands and low-rigidity clays.\nVia a polynomial approximation, soil sub-types of sand, silt and clay can be estimated by a cross-plot of S-wave velocity and resistivity. We confirm that existent boring log data fit reasonably well with the polynomial approximation where 2/3 of soil samples fall within their respective bounds—this approach represents a new classification system that could be used for other mid-latitude, fine-grained deltas.",

            "abstract": "Observations of a currently weakening subpolar gyre south of Greenland has again increased scientific attention regarding the role of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) for the regional to global climate. The rapid climate shift of the Younger Dryas (YD, GS-1) cold reversal during the last deglaciation is attributed to an abrupt slowdown or collapse of the AMOC due to a strong meltwater pulse and/or the rapid disintegration of the Laurentide Ice sheet. Although such a dramatic event is not expected for the future, the spatiotemporal climatic response to such a slowdown is an interesting test case.\nTwo recently well dated proxy records around the North Sea region suggest a non-synchronous early cooling/onset of the YD compared to Greenland (NGRIP). Presentation #61803 discusses the hypothesis of a local cooling as a response to increased ice berg calving and/or meltwater from Fenno-Scandinavian Ice Sheet (FIS) during the late Alleröd warm phase (GI-1a).\nHere we study CCSM3 model output from the quasi-transient atmosphere-ocean simulation (TraCE) where no strong contribution from FIS is considered from the late Alleröd into the YD. We evaluate to which extent the spatiotemporal temperature response to the AMOC slowdown of the simulation is synchronous over the Euro-Atlantic region and how atmospheric teleconnections reorganize during the rapid shift into the YD. In addition, we run time-slice experiments at high spatial resolution of around 100 km with the Community Earth System Model CESM1.0.5 for the late Alleröd and YD to compare spatial climatic differences for both periods taking into account the regional influence from continental ice sheets in more detail.",

High frequency and medium frequency gravity waves propagate from the lower atmosphere and couple with the tidal forced lapse rate, imposing it’s temperature disturbance to a condition of high instability. Instabilities are forced resulting in overturning and often MILs (mesosopheric inversion layers) result. Data describing these features from the ALO observatory will be presented and discussed.",

In seasonally snow covered areas, this period is characterized by dramatic changes in ecosystem energy balance, hydrology, and biogeochemistry. Transitions at the beginning of the vernal window, such as warming air temperature, are occurring earlier due to climate change while the green-up that indicates the close of the window is responding more slowly. The result is a lengthening of the vernal window, with unclear ecosystem implications. Equally uncertain is how changes in the sequence, timing, or duration of transitions along the vernal window flow path affect subsequent processes and functions. We synthesized data collected throughout New Hampshire, USA to investigate the seasonal shift from winter to spring as manifested by changes in energy balance, physical properties, and biological phenomena across a variety of spatial and temporal scales. Data included observations from citizen science networks, terrestrial and aquatic sensors, remote sensing products, and meteorological model outputs and encompassed variables such as shortwave radiation; snow depth and water equivalent; soil temperature, moisture, and conductivity; and stream discharge, nitrate, and dissolved oxygen. For each variable, we developed algorithms to detect thresholds delineating the end of winter and the onset of spring. We also calculated lags between transitions and examined spatial patterns in thresholds and lags throughout the state. We found that transitions within the vernal window followed a predictable sequence, that there were quantifiable lags between transitions, and that the duration of lags varied with latitude, slope, aspect, and land cover. The sequence of biogeochemical changes and lags were sometimes surprising and indicate how integration of near-real time data collected a variety of scales can transform insights into ecosystem function during the critical vernal window period.",

Additionally, the shutting down or derating of certain wind turbines may impact the efficiency of large wind farms. In this study, a large eddy simulation (LES) of a fully developed wind turbine array boundary layer is performed in thermally stratified conditions. The impact on the overall plant performance, quantified by the collective extracted power of the turbines, is explored using a systematic shut down and derating of selected turbines.",

This advantage of preciseness makes TLS an ideal source to integrate to Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS), with regard to the potential for removing ALS’s penetration bias. The popular treatment of the integration is simply spatial co-registration or TLS-derived inventory statistics, without further concerning the rich geometrical information from TLS. This poster proposes a profile assimilation approach for ALS and TLS integration, in order to improve the plot-level estimation of tree height and biomass. The overlapped ALS and TLS data were first co-registered into compound point clouds and the canopy structure were reconstructed from the compound. The canopy profile of ALS was then calibrated from the reconstructed canopy profile using a Kalman filter. The calibration was applied to the rest ALS canopy profile, from which the new estimation of tree height and biomass can be derived. Our study site is located in Vivian, Toronto. The area was flown with an Optech Titan operating at 532, 1064 and 1550 nm wavelengths one week before the TLS data collection in July, 2015. The trees scans by TLS were halved to calibrate and to validate our proposed integration approach. Additional validation was also conducted via in-situ inventory.",

            "abstract": "Bats are important to many ecological processes such as pollination, insect (and by proxy, disease) control, and seed dispersal and can be used to monitor ecosystem health. However, they are facing unprecedented extinction risks from habitat degradation as well as pressures from pathogens (e.g., white-nose syndrome) and wind turbines. LiDAR allows ecologists to measure structural variables of forested landscapes with increased precision and accuracy at broader spatial scales than previously possible. This study used airborne LiDAR to classify forest habitat/canopy structure at the Ordway-Swisher Biological Station (OSBS) in north central Florida. LiDAR data were acquired by the NEON airborne observation platform in summer 2014. OSBS consists of open-canopy pine savannas, closed-canopy hardwood hammocks, and seasonally wet prairies. Multiple forest structural parameters (e.g., mean, maximum, and standard deviation of height returns) were derived from LiDAR point clouds using the USDA software program FUSION. K-means clustering was used to segregate each 5x5 m raster across the ~3765 ha OSBS area into six different clusters based on the derived canopy metrics. Cluster averages for maximum, mean, and standard deviation of return heights ranged from 0 to 19.4 m, 0 to 15.3 m, and 0 to 3.0 m, respectively. To determine the relationships among these landscape-canopy features and bat species diversity and abundances, AnaBat II bat detectors were deployed from May to September in 2015 stratified by these distinct clusters. Bat calls were recorded from sunset to sunrise during each sampling period. Species were identified using AnalookW. A statistical regression model selection approach was performed in order to evaluate how forest attributes such as understory clutter, open regions, open and closed canopy, etc. influence bat communities. This knowledge provides a deeper understanding of habitat-species interactions to better manage survival of these species.",

            "abstract": "Carbon tetrachloride (CT) is a toxic and recalcitrant groundwater contaminant with the potential to form a broad range of transformation products. Of the possible biochemical pathways through which CT can be degraded, reductive dehalogenation to less chlorinated compounds and mineralization to carbon dioxide (CO2) appear to be the most frequently utilized pathways by anaerobic organisms. Results will be presented from batch experiments of CT degradation by the Evanite (EV), Victoria Strain (VS) and Point Mugu (PM) anaerobic dechlorinating cultures. The cultures are grown in chemostats and are capable of transforming tetrachloroethene (PCE) or trichloroethene (TCE) to ethene by halorespiration via reductive dehalogenase enzymes. For the batch CT transformation tests, the cells along with supernatant were harvested from chemostats fed PCE or TCE, but never CT. The batch reactors were initially fed 0.0085 mM CT and an excess of formate (EV and VS) or lactate (PM) as electron donor. Transformation of CT was 100% with about 20% converted to chloroform (CF) and undetected products. Multiple additions of CT showed a slowing of pseudo first-order CT transformation rates across all cultures. Batch reactors were then established and fed 0.085 mM CT with an excess of electron donor in order to better quantify the reductive pathway. CT was transformed to CF and dichloromethane (DCM), with trace amounts of chloromethane (CM) detected. Between 60-90% of the mass added to the system was accounted for, showing that the majority of the carbon tetrachloride present is being reductively dehalogenated. Results from batch reactors that were poisoned using sodium azide, and from reactors not provided electron donor will be presented to distinguish between biotic and abiotic reactions. Furthermore, results from reactors prepared with acetylene (a potent, reversible inhibitor of reductive dehalogenases (1)) will be presented as a means of identifying the enzymes involved in the transformation of CT. The results clearly demonstrate that reductive dechlorination of CT can be promoted by anaerobic cultures not previously acclimated to CT.\n1. G. Pon, M. R. Hyman, L. Semprini, Environ. Sci.

Availability of in situ observations from Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS), the Van Allen Probes (VAP), and THEMIS in the magnetosphere, field-aligned currents from AMPERE, as well as the ionospheric data from the Floating Potential Measurement Unit (FPMU) instrument suite on board the International Space Station (ISS) represents an exciting opportunity to analyze storm-related dynamics. Our real-time space weather alert system sent out a “red alert” warning users of the event 2 hours in advance, correctly predicting Kp indices greater than 8. During this event, the MMS observatories were taking measurements in the magnetotail, VAP were in the inner magnetosphere, THEMIS was on the dayside, and the ISS was orbiting at 400 km every 90 minutes. Among the initial findings are the crossing of the dayside magnetopause into the region earthward of 8 RE, strong dipolarizations in the MMS magnetometer data, and dropouts in the particle fluxes seen by the MMS FPI instrument suite. At ionospheric altitudes, the FMPU measurements of the ion densities show dramatic post-sunset depletions at equatorial latitudes that are correlated with the particle flux dropouts measured by the MMS FPI. AMPERE data show highly variable currents varying from intervals of intense high latitude currents to currents at maximum polar cap expansion to 50 deg MLAT and exceeding 20 MA. In this paper, we use numerical simulations with global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models and the Rice Convection Model (RCM) of the inner magnetosphere in an attempt to place the observations in the context of storm-time global electrodynamics and cross-check the simulation global Birkeland currents with AMPERE distributions. Specifically, we will look at model-predicted effects of dipolarizations and the global convection on the inner magnetosphere via data-model comparison.",

AGU2015 HiRes.pdf\nIn the USVI, land-based sedimentation in coastal marine environments has increased due to watershed development and is a major cause of coral reef degradation. Watershed runoff and wave/current-induced resuspension of benthic sediment contribute to turbidity/sedimentation. Our objectives are to characterize the spatial and temporal variability of marine sediment dynamics in response to runoff and resuspension in shoreline and reef areas of St. John, USVI, and directly compare the efficacy of time-integrated vs. high-resolution sediment monitoring approaches.\nTo complement a six-year sediment trap study of sedimentation, nephelometers (10-min resolution) were deployed alongside sediment traps (26 day resolution) at four ephemeral stream outfalls and three reefs sites below comparable developed and minimally developed catchments. Watershed runoff was monitored using stream (10-min resolution) and peak crest (2-week resolution) gauges. Mean turbidity/deposition were 4/5 times greater at shore compared to reef sites, 5/6 times greater below developed compared to minimally developed catchments, 2/4 times greater during runoff compared to non-runoff periods, and 100/500 times background levels (time series median) following the largest runoff event of the 5-month time series. Turbidity values due to resuspension during non-runoff periods were primarily controlled by wave height (71% of the variability), tides, and the presence of finer sediment grains. However, the relative contribution to total sedimentation of resuspension vs. watershed runoff varied spatially between sites due to variations in bay geography, benthic sediment grain size, and catchment characteristics. Sediment traps and nephelometers recorded generally consistent temporal patterns of sedimentation at most sites. Though our study confirmed that watershed development increases turbidity and deposition in bays with coral reefs, multiple processes govern sediment dynamics and the distribution of sediments from the shoreline to the reef.",

Such information is essential for understanding and modeling human impacts on erosion and sediment routing at the watershed scale. In this study we use long- (Beryllium-10, 10Be) and short-lived (Lead-210 and Cesium-137, 210Pb and 137Cs, respectively) radionuclide tracers associated with suspended sediment to quantify sediment sources and channel-floodplain exchange across a range of watershed scales from 10 km2 to 4500 km2 in in the Root River, southeastern Minnesota, USA. The uppermost quarter of the Root River watershed was glaciated repeatedly during the late Pleistocene and is characterized by low relief agricultural fields and fine textured soils. The remainder of the watershed lies within the driftless area of the upper Midwestern US, which has not been glaciated in at least the past 500,000 years, and is characterized by karst topography, relatively steep hillslopes and bedrock channels that debouch into a wide, aggrading alluvial valley. The structure of the landscape exerts strong control on sediment generation and transport. Geochemical results indicate a highly variable erosion history, with significant variability of 10Be concentrations in source areas (agricultural fields, forested hillslopes, and alluvial floodplains and terraces) and inverted 10Be depth profiles (higher concentrations at depth) in floodplains, suggesting unsteady erosion and significant storage of legacy sediment. Concentrations of 10Be and 210Pb associated with suspended sediment show a systematic disparity in normalized concentrations, indicating that significant storage and re-suspension occurs in both systems as the sediment is routed through the channel-floodplain complex.",

Many relevant resources exist online that could be used to address this issue, but too often these resources are spread throughout the Internet, and have not necessarily been audited for content, alignment with state and national science standards, or current functionality. Because STEM subjects are increasingly difficult to teach, we set out to design a localized platform of year-long teaching ‘blueprints’ comprising units that cover a range of Earth science topics, researched and compiled by education professionals. The Diversity and Innovation for Geosciences (DIG) Texas Instructional Blueprint project has united teachers from diverse science backgrounds who act as Education Interns and work alongside geoscientists and curriculum experts at the University of Texas Jackson School of Geosciences, Texas A&M University and the University of Texas El Paso. Our DIG collective has employed a cross-disciplinary approach to vetting resources while compiling them in useful, logical sequences for classroom instruction. The DIG team has aligned each blueprint with the Texas Essential Skills and Knowledge (TEKS) standards for Earth and Space Science, the Earth Science Literacy Principles, and the Next Generation Science Standards. Emphasis for the summer 2015 project group was placed upon (1) alignment of the units with these three sets of science standards to allow for use within disparate classroom settings, (2) creating teacher aides including scaffolding notes for practical unit application, and potential real and virtual field trips for unit illustration, and (3) final vetting ensuring units follow a narrative that carries learners from basic principles to a full concept understanding.\nHere, we present our progress and the essential workflow that has contributed to significant advancement in our goal of providing a unified STEM teaching resource.",

Previous best estimates of dextral strike-slip along the Hope fault are ≤ ~23 mm/yr± 4 mm/year. Those rates, however, are poorly constrained and could be improved using better age determinations in conjunction with measurements of fault offsets using high-resolution imagery. In this study, we use airborne lidar- and field-based mapping together with the subsurface geometry of offset channels at the Hossack site 12 km ESE of Hanmer Springs to more precisely determine stream offsets that were previously identified by McMorran (1991). Specifically, we measured fault offsets of ~10m, ~75 m, and ~195m. Together with 65 radiocarbon ages on charcoal, peat, and wood and 25 pending post-IR50-IRSL225 luminescence ages from the channel deposits, these offsets yield three different fault slip rates for the early Holocene, the late Holocene, and the past ca. 500-1,000 years. Using the large number of age determinations, we document in detail the timing of initiation and abandonment of each channel, enhancing the geomorphic interpretation at the Hossack site as channels deform over many earthquake cycles. Our preliminary incremental slip rate results from the Hossack site may indicate temporally variable strain release along the Hope fault. This study is part of a broader effort aimed at determining incremental slip rates and paleo-earthquake ages and displacements from all four main Marlborough faults. Collectively, these data will allow us to determine how the four main Marlborough faults have work together during Holocene-late Pleistocene to accommodate plate-boundary deformation in time and space.",

            "abstract": "Diversity within the Ocean Sciences workforce is still underperforming relative to other scientific disciplines, a problem that will be only be solved by recruiting, engaging and retaining a more diverse student population. The Monterey Bay Regional Ocean Science Research Experiences for Undergraduates program is housed at California State University, Monterey Bay (CSUMB), an HSI with strong connections to multiple regional community colleges and other Predominantly Undergraduate Institutions (PUIs) in the CSU system. From this unique position, 11 sophomore and junior-level undergraduate students are recruited per year from academic institutions where research opportunities in STEM are limited and from groups historically underrepresented in the Ocean Sciences, including women, underrepresented minorities, persons with disabilities, and veterans. During the program, students engage in a 10-week original research project guided by a faculty research mentor in one of four themes: Oceanography, Marine Biology and Ecology, Ocean Engineering, and Marine Geology. In addition to research, students engage in rigorous weekly professional development workshops in which they practice critical thinking, ethical decision-making, peer review, writing and oral communication skills. These workshops include tangible products such as an NSF-style proposal paper, Statement of Purpose and CV modelled for the SACNAS Travel Award Application, research abstract, scientific report and oral presentation. To help retain students in Ocean Sciences, students build community during the REU by living together in the CSUMB dormitories; post-REU, students stay connected through an online facebook group, LinkedIn page and group webinars. To date, the REU has supported 22 students in two cohorts (2014, 2015) and here we present successes, challenges and lessons learned for a program designed to prepare students for 21st century Ocean Science careers.",

            "abstract": "The Lassen region is the southernmost active volcanic field in the Cascade Range. Since ~3.5 Ma distributed mafic to intermediate calc-alkaline magmas continuously built hundreds of cinder cones, lava flows, and a few small shield volcanoes. A set of 10 new unspiked K-Ar ages obtained on groundmass separates help reveal the timing of this regional volcanism. Although most lavas show a high atmospheric contamination level and a low K content, significant ages were obtained with this technique. Shields were dated at about 2.5 Ma (Clynne and Muffler, 2010) and are commonly dissected by erosion. However, we obtained a K-Ar age of 374 ± 25 ka for the late lava flow at the summit of Crater Mountain, which is less eroded than the other shields. This indicates that this regional volcano’s activity overlapped that of the Lassen Volcanic Center (LVC), and raises questions regarding the ages of other shields. The Caribou Volcanic field (CVF), at the eastern boundary of the Lassen region, was also contemporaneous with the LVC. The field’s activity initiated ~425 ka ago, but does not appear to have extended into the Holocene (Clynne and Muffler, 2010). We obtained a K-Ar age of 296 ± 13 ka on the basaltic andesite of Eleanor Lake, extending further the activity of the Caribou sequence. Our K-Ar age of 59 ± 3 ka on a basaltic flow confirms that the Bidwell Spring Chain was active between 20 and 70 ka as previously shown. We dated the basaltic andesite tuya of Turnaround Lake at 4 ± 5 ka. However, this conflicts with the timing of Tuya chain (15-18 ka). Finally, to the south-west of LVC, basalts of Cold Creek Butte yield an age of 207 ± 26 ka, and we dated a basaltic flow from Inskip Hill at ~5 ka. The new ages obtained, especially the Holocene ones, are consistent with magnetotelluric soundings and gravity data that show mid-crustal anomalies in the back-arc (Tavarez, 2015). These data demonstrate that the CVF is still active and has the potential for future eruptions.",

Here we examine the various sources of uncertainty, including driver uncertainty, model parameter uncertainty, and structural uncertainty, and the contribution of each type uncertainty to the net sink, and the attribution of this sink to anthropogenic causes: Increasing CO2 concentrations, nitrogen deposition, land use change, and changing climate. To examine driver and parameter uncertainty, model simulations are performed using the Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5) with literature-based parameter ranges and three different reanalysis meteorological forcing datasets. We also examine structural uncertainty thorough analysis of the Multiscale Terrestrial Model Intercomparison (MsTMIP).

Systematic surveys of water quality both pre- and post drilling/production are sparse. To examine the impacts of shale gas production on water quality, pilot studies have been conducted in adjacent counties of western NY (Chemung, Tioga, Broome, and Delaware) and northern PA (Bradford, Susquehanna, and Wayne). These 7 counties along the border of NY and PA share similar geology and demographic compositions and have been identified as a key area to develop shale gas with the key difference that active fracking is occurring in PA but there is no fracking yet in NY. Measurements include a suite of major and trace elements, methane and its stable isotopes, noble gases and tritium for dating purposes, and the primary radioactive elements of potential concern, radon and radium. We found elevated methane levels on both sides of the border. Higher levels of major ions were observed in PA samples close to the gas wells in the valley, possibly from hydraulic fracturing activities. The lab analysis of samples collected in recently launched 100 Bottom Project is ongoing and the results will be presented in this conference.",

            "abstract": "The steep relief of northern New England has long puzzled geomorphologists. Although it is suggestive of recent tectonic rejuvenation, roughly 200 Myr has passed since the opening of the Atlantic. The timing of recent exhumation has proven difficult to constrain because the magnitude of Cenozoic unroofing is often insufficient to reset surface thermochronometers and associated sediments are not well preserved. This study attempts to better resolve the Mesozoic-Cenozoic exhumation history of the White Mountains (New Hampshire) by combining apatite fission track, (U-Th)/He, and 4He/3He thermochronology in a 700 m deep drill core from the White Mountains of New Hampshire. Forward (HeFTY) and inverse (QTQt) modeling of age-elevation profiles point to a period of accelerated exhumation from roughly 85 to 65 Ma. Cooling rates accelerated by a factor of 6-10 around this time, presumably translating to the removal of 2-3 km of overburden in the span of ~20 million years. The timing of this episode is in broad agreement with AFT cooling ages across major faults in the region, which suggest late Cretaceous reactivation. However, an analysis of regional AFT ages suggests that not all of the uplift can be explained by extensional faulting and that dynamic surface uplift might have played a role. Although external forcing mechanisms remain unclear, the timing of this exhumation corresponds well to a reorganization of seafloor spreading in the North Atlantic and to the timing of alkaline volcanism in Iberia.",

            "abstract": "Aurora occurs in different well-known morphologies, or types, including the best-known arcs and patchy-pulsating aurora (PPA). Previous observational studies have demonstrated that the ionospheric effects of auroral precipitation affect the accuracy of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), including GPS, but how different types of aurora might affect GNSS differently has not been investigated to date. In an attempt to explore the relationship between auroral type and the resulting effects on GNSS, we have used data from a THEMIS (Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms) All-Sky Imager (ASI) located at Sanikiluaq (~67º geomagnetic latitude), Canada. GPS data was also obtained from a Canadian High Arctic Ionospheric Network (CHAIN) GPS receiver collocated with the THEMIS ASI. This GPS receiver is a custom-made GPS scintillation receiver capable of providing high-rate GPS signal power and phase and as well as scintillation data. A list of patchy pulsating aurora and auroral arc events were catalogued from the ASI data for the years 2008-2013. Corresponding scintillation data for these time periods were obtained from the GPS receiver. In order to determine the effects of PPA and arcs on GPS signals, the number of cycle slips observed during each were calculated. Results suggests PPA affects GPS in a more adverse manner than auroral arcs given its spatial extent. Even though the magnitude of phase scintillation index (σφ) observed in auroral arcs was much higher than in PPA, receiver was able to keep lock on to the signals much better during arcs compared to patchy aurora. Spectral characteristics of GPS scintillation signals during these events were also studied using wavelet derived “spatialograms” obtained from wavelet “scalograms”. These studies seems to suggest that for PPA, large sized ionospheric irregularities (around 2 Km) dominate their spectral content compared to auroral arcs, where there is also contribution from smaller sized irregularities (around 200m) coming into effect. Irregularity orientation is also estimated using wavelet “spatialograms”.",

CSEP testing centers are now operational in California, New Zealand, Japan, China, and Europe with 435 models under evaluation. The California testing center, operated by SCEC, has been operational since Sept 1, 2007, and currently hosts 30-minute, 1-day, 3-month, 1-year and 5-year forecasts, both alarm-based and probabilistic, for California, the Western Pacific, and worldwide. We have reduced testing latency, implemented prototype evaluation of M8 forecasts, and are currently developing formats and procedures to evaluate externally-hosted forecasts and predictions. These efforts are related to CSEP support of the USGS program in operational earthquake forecasting and a DHS project to register and test external forecast procedures from experts outside seismology. A retrospective experiment for the 2010-2012 Canterbury earthquake sequence has been completed, and the results indicate that some physics-based and hybrid models outperform purely statistical (e.g., ETAS) models. The experiment also demonstrates the power of the CSEP cyberinfrastructure for retrospective testing. Our current development includes evaluation strategies that increase computational efficiency for high-resolution global experiments, such as the evaluation of the Global Earthquake Activity Rate (GEAR) model. We describe the open-source CSEP software that is available to researchers as they develop their forecast models (http://northridge.usc.edu/trac/csep/wiki/MiniCSEP). We also discuss applications of CSEP infrastructure to geodetic transient detection and how CSEP procedures are being adapted to ground motion prediction experiments.",

The availability of this network enabled us to develop and realize a processing facility to estimate the tropospheric zenith delays from the observations in near real time within the frames of a research project funded by the Hungarian National Research Fund.\nAn automated near-realtime processing facility was established to collect and process the GNSS observations from 54 GNSSnet.hu stations with spatial resolution of approximately 60 kilometres, and it estimates the zenith wet delays (ZWD) and the precipitable water vapour (PW) and validate these values using radiosonde observations.\nRecently we updated the operational Bernese processing software from version 5.0 to 5.2. The estimation of precipitable water vapour from the zenith wet delays was also further refined and new methods were implemented. The GNSS based zenith total delay and precipitable water vapour estimates are transmitted to EUMETNET's E-GVAP project.\nCurrently the real-time processing of GNSS observations using the PPP technique is experimented to enable the exploitation of GNSS observations for nowcasting applications. The first results and comparisons with the near-realtime estimations are presented on this poster. We contribute to a dedicated project, concentrating around the Transcarpathian region, which targets the real-time monitoring of severe weather events based on GNSS analysis. The first results may expected by the end of this year.\nThe Hungarian Meteorological Service has also conducted the first tests of the zenith total delay assimilation in their AROME numerical weather prediction model. The data assimilation diagnostics showed that the zenit total delays originated from nearly 70 stations have important contribution to AROME analysis (especially to humidity analysis). The verification results of the first test conducted in January, 2014 show that the assimilation of GNSS based zenith wet delays slightly improved the accuracy of the short-term forecasts of the 2m relative humidity values.",

            "abstract": "Potential modification of regional rainfall by large-scale cropland irrigation has been investigated in several regions of the world. In particular, regional climate simulations over West Africa indicate that hypothetical large-scale irrigation schemes reduce rainfall over the irrigated areas but enhance rainfall remotely. However, these theoretical results cannot be substantiated without direct comparison to observations. We therefore conducted two complementary analyses over an actual, large-scale irrigation scheme in Africa: numerical simulations using a regional climate model, and observational analyses using several surface-based and satellite-derived datasets. For the observational analyses, we analyzed spatial and temporal patterns of both rainfall and air temperature in and around the irrigated area. For the numerical simulations, we examined multiple variables that contribute to an improved understanding of the mechanistic pathway between irrigation and rainfall modification. The results of both the simulations and observational analysis will be presented.",

A first generation 8-micron instrument quantifies 12CH4 and 13CH4 at a 1-second rate via tunable infrared direct absorption spectroscopy (TILDAS). A second generation instrument uses two 3-micron intraband cascade lasers in an Aerodyne dual laser chassis for simultaneous measurement of 12CH4, 13CH4 and 12CH3D. Sensitivity and noise performance improvements are examined.\nThe isotopic signature of methane provides valuable information for emission source identification of this greenhouse gas. A first generation spectrometer has been deployed in the field on a mobile laboratory along with a sophisticated 4-tank calibration system. Calibrations are done on an agressive schedule, allowing for the correction of measured isotope ratios to an absolute isotope scale. Distinct isotopic signatures are found for a number of emission sources in the Denver-Julesburg Basin: oil and gas gathering stations, compressor stations and processing plants; a municipal landfill, and dairy/cattle operations. The isotopic signatures are compared with measured ethane/methane ratios.\nThese direct absorption measurements have larger uncertainties than samples measured via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, but have several advantages over canister sampling methods: individual sources of short duration are easier to isolate; calibrated isotope ratio results are available immediately; replicate measurements on a single source are easily performed; and the number of sources sampled is not limited by canister availability and processing time.",

            "abstract": "London Volcano is a major public engagement and outreach effort that emerged from a large-scale interdisciplinary research project on Strengthening Resilience in Volcanic Areas (STREVA). The activity was created for a 5-day public exhibition in London, in 2014, and brought together 3 elements to illustrate the timeline of a volcanic crisis: a 5m x 3m scale model of Soufrière St Vincent, an interactive ‘monitoring station’ to explore technology used in monitoring and an engaging ‘bin bang’ sequence to simulate a volcanic explosion. Having a large hands-on volcano as a centrepiece to the exhibit enabled interaction with primary-age school children through the use of creativity and imagination. They looked at seismic traces of ‘bin bang’ explosions; measured dispersal of projectile ducks; and decided where to place a model house on the island, on which the model volcano sat. Over the 5-days we evolved the activity of the volcano to re-create the 1902 eruption. During the first 3 days, 94 houses were placed around the volcano, but after the cataclysmic eruption mid-week, 12 of these houses were destroyed by simulated pyroclastic flows and lahars down the flanks of the volcano model. Light and sound were key parts of the London Volcano simulation. A sound track was created to mimic the sounds reported by eyewitnesses. Between eruptions, the volcano would intermittently rumble, adding excitement and unpredictability to the eruptions. Explosions were simulated with compressed-CO2 jets, and a G-flame; but these events were rare. Creative arts are an effective mechanism for transfer of knowledge from communities living with volcanic activity, so artwork from school children living near Tungurahua, Ecuador and poems from school children on Montserrat were on display. The London Volcano was a unique opportunity to engage with over 2,000 people on volcanic risk and what it means to live near a volcano. Encouraging school children to be creative and to use their imagination allowed the volcano to come alive in ways that would have otherwise been impossible.",

We chose to analyze five sites within the Pacific Northwest (three in Oregon and one each in Idaho and Montana). The sites range in climate from wet lowland coastal to semi-arid high plains to intermountain valley, and elevations from 150 to 1500 m. Analysis of the time series yielded descriptive statistics of solar energy deposition on daily, seasonal and annual timescales for each site. Estimates of the contributions of clear and cloudy skies to the solar deposition have been obtained using the Long-Ackerman (JGR, 2000) technique. We are currently creating comparisons on varying timescales between measured surface solar energy deposition at these five sites and estimates from satellite data. In this presentation, we will describe the results of our analysis, focusing both on the variability at each site and comparisons among the five sites. To our knowledge, this level of detail has not previously been reported across the highly variable terrain of the Pacific Northwest region. While a 10-year period is inadequate for trend analysis, it does provide considerable insight into interannual variability on daily to seasonal timescales. In addition, we will present comparisons between satellite estimates and surface solar deposition measurements. Given the on-going need to use satellite estimates as a proxy for actual ground-based measurements, these assessments are critically important to understand the reliability of the satellite estimates on a variety of timescales and differing regional surface types.",

Such knowledge may provide necessary conditions, such as estimates of the magnetic energy needed for a flare to occur. Given the necessary conditions, it is often assumed that the evolution of the field, possibly by only a small amount, may trigger the onset of a flare. We present the results of a study using time series of photospheric vector field data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to quantitatively parameterize both the state and evolution of solar active regions - their complexity, magnetic topology and energy - as related to solar flare events. We examine both extensive and intensive parameters and their short-term temporal behavior, in the context of predicting flares at various thresholds. Statistical tests based on nonparametric Discriminant Analysis are used to compare pre-flare epochs to a control group of flare-quiet epochs and active regions. Results regarding the type of photospheric signature examined and the efficacy of using the present state vs. temporal evolution to predict solar flares is quantified by standard skill scores.

Understanding non-point source impacts on these natural ecosystems has become a prevalent topic in sustainable urban infrastructure design as efforts to restore the urban hydrologic regime continue to drive engineers, planners, and environmentalists to develop optimal design practices for rapidly expanding built environments. To best understand how and where these impairments are received, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other organizations have adopted urban runoff programs to identify contributions from non-point sources. This presentation provides a geospatial analysis method for identifying non-point source watersheds, and associated sub-basins, that contribute the highest loads of pollutants to receiving urban streams and lakes. This method, using a form of linear matrix inversion, is an area-averaged weighting method for non-point pollutants that corresponds to a geospatial land cover analysis. This two-phase analysis can be used to aid all parties in understanding how different land use types affect urban stream systems and processes. Optimal locations for water quality features (i.e., best management practices) can be evaluated in order to reduce, capture, and treat stormwater runoff as close to the source as possible. These best management practices have the ability to operate most effectively when located properly, because their ability to act as a minor treatment and prevention system is of great important for the restoration of the urban hydrologic regime.",

            "abstract": "Sediment transport in overland flow interacts dynamically with the soil surface morphology. Often, sediment transport models assume a simplified and static morphology. This assumption, although it limits the predictive capacity of models, is reasonable since the evolution of morphology is difficult to quantify, particularly when rill networks form. Such networks evolve due to local features of the surface, which are difficult to identify even in well controlled laboratory experiments. Instead of attempting to predict details of rill networks, we hypothesize that their statistical properties can (i) be measured reliably and (ii) that under reasonable background conditions they exhibit scale invariance in space.\nWe report initial results of laboratory experiments to test these hypotheses. An agricultural soil was placed in a 5 m × 2 m flume with a 5% slope to which a uniform rainfall was applied. Prior to the rainfall, the top 10 cm of the soil was ploughed and smoothed. Rill networks are generated in three 3-h experiments using different precipitation rates of 30, 45 and 60 mm h-1. The surface morphology was measured using a laser scanning every 30 min (rainfall was halted to permit scanning). For the measured Digital Elevation Models, the exceedance probabilities and corresponding scaling factors for the drainage area, upstream length of the network were calculated.\nThe results showed that, similar to river networks, there is a power law relation in the exceedance probabilities for the parts of the network in which rill erosion is dominant. However, contrary to large scale river networks, the scaling exponents were found to be dependent on rainfall intensity.",

            "abstract": "Estimation of the shape (topography) of the rocky bodies of the Solar System is essential to the understanding of crustal composition, internal structure, and thermal evolution. Topography obeys an empirical power law as a function of spherical harmonic degree n, whereby the degree variance V(n) is roughly proportional to 1/(n(n+1)). First observed for the Earth, this law has been documented for Mars, Mercury, Moon and Venus. This law is similar to Kaula’s law for gravity potential, but with the caveat that gravity predicted from topography must also consider density variations and partial compensation by relief on the crust-mantle interface. Neither power law can be rigorously deduced but the latter is often used a priori as a constraint for regularization of the problem of estimation of coefficients.\nWith the resolution afforded by laser altimetry and satellite-satellite tracking over airless bodies it is feasible to examine gravity and topography to degree 100 and beyond with confidence. However, in the case of topography obtained from sparse occultation measurements, radar ranging, and/or flyby altimetry, even to achieve estimates of low-degree coefficients it is necessary to expand solutions to a maximum degree that the data do not support on a global basis. As a result, the use of a prior constraint is required to avoid the instability of least-squares methods. An example from the occultation measurements of the southern hemisphere of Mercury combined with the northern hemisphere altimetric measurements by the Mercury Laser Altimeter illustrates how the spectral power behavior is a critical constraint on the solution and its error estimation. A simulation of the topography that could be obtained by the Europa Flyby Mission with a laser altimeter demonstrates the ability to extract critical shape parameters from limited observations.",

            "abstract": "In arid and semiarid ecosystems, rainfall pulses and associated vegetation responses play a crucial role in ecosystem and hydrologic functioning. While rainfall pulses are generally correlated with increased photosynthetic activity, the effect of these rainfall pulses in the context of persistent drought is unclear. Rainfall events during drought can lead to an overall reduction in primary productivity due to reduced soil infiltration and increased erosion. To assess the effective rainfall available for initiating biological processes, measurements of soil moisture are necessary. Rainfall pulses in drylands are generally localized in time and space making them difficult to detect remotely. Our objective was to determine whether space-based observations of soil moisture have the necessary spatial and temporal resolution to detect soil moisture pulses resulting from rain events in the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW) in southern Arizona. Using pre-beta-release soil moisture observations from the newly launched NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) observatory, we examined the effects of rainfall pulses on soil moisture over the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed from April to July 2015. To assess whether soil moisture pulses were associated with increased vegetation production, we monitored increases in vegetation greenness using the NASA MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) following increases in soil moisture. Regional-scale results were supported with local-scale in situ measurements of soil moisture, vegetation greenness from phenocams, precipitation and Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) associated with two eddy covariance flux towers at WGEW. In conclusion, SMAP observations have the potential to detect large rainfall pulses at the 9 km resolution, and the associated soil moisture pulses can result in increased EVI at the watershed scale. These results contribute to our understanding of the ecosystem and hydrologic functioning of dryland ecosystems.",

This study employed Bayesian frameworks to enable the explicit description and assessment of parameter and predictive uncertainty for convective rainfall-runoff modeling of a semiarid watershed system in Iran. We examined the performance and uncertainty analysis of a mixed conceptual and physical based rainfall-runoff model (AFFDEF) linked with three Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers: the DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM), the Shuffled Complex Evolution Metropolis (SCEM-UA), and DREAM- ZS, to forecast four potential semiarid convective events with varying rainfall duration (<24 hrs) and amount (>20 mm). Calibration results demonstrated that model predictive uncertainty was heavily dominated by error and bias in the soil water storage capacity which reflect inadequate representation of the upper soil zone processes by hydrological model. Furthermore, parameters associated with infiltration and interception capacity along with contributing area threshold for digital river network were identified the key model parameters and more influential on the modeled flood hydrograph. In addition, parameter inference in the DREAM model showed a consistent behavior with the priori assumption by closely matching the inferred error distribution to the empirical distribution of the model residual, indicating that model parameters are well identified. DREAM result further revealed that the uncertainty associated with rainfall of lower magnitudes was higher than rainfall of higher magnitudes. Uncertainty quantification of semiarid convective events provided significant insights into the mathematical relationship and characteristics of short-term forecast error and may be applicable to other semiarid watershed systems with the similar rainfall-runoff processes.",

INL is a nuclear research and development facility located on the eastern Snake River Plain with the potential for lava flow inundation from both monogenetic and polygenetic basaltic eruptions. Previously published inventories of observed surface vents and vents that are buried by younger lava flows and inferred from interpretation of borehole stratigraphy were used to created spatial density maps of vents within the INL region. Monte carlo simulations were run using the MOLASSES code to compare the difference between events initiated using only surface vents and events initiated using both the surface and the buried vents. We find that the inclusion of the buried vent locations drastically increases the number of site inundations and events initiating within INL boundaries. This highlights the need to seek out a more complete eruption record in an area of heavy prehistoric activity to better assess future hazard and associated risk.",

            "abstract": "Hyporheic zones impact the biogeochemical cycling of carbon and nitrogen, both organic and inorganic. To investigate and develop a predictive understanding of the coupled carbon and nitrogen cycling in the subsurface, we integrated a genome inspired complex reaction network with a high‐resolution, three-dimensional, reactive flow and transport code – PFLOTRAN. Three-dimensional reactive flow and transport simulations were performed, making use of the high performance computing platform provided by PFLOTRAN, to describe the biogeochemical zonation developed because of the organic carbon rich sediments and a gradient of dissolved oxygen and pH within the hyporheic zone. We conducted this study in the lower East River, a high elevation catchment in southwestern Colorado. The lower East River site displays a rolling-to-mountainous topography with multiple river meanders that extend over a distance of 11 km. We carried out simulations within two stream meanders to examine (1) the impact of hyporheic exchanges on the biogeochemical zonation of variables and (2) how carbon and nitrogen fluxes at the meander scale influence coupled carbon and nitrogen cycling at the river scale. Three-dimensional model domain – 330 m (X) by 400 m (Y) by 48 m (Z) – was uniformly discretized with 10 m horizontal (X and Y) and 0.25 m vertical (Z) resolutions using structured grids in PFLOTRAN. Simulation results show that the intra-meander hyporheic flow paths and biogeochemical reactions result in the lateral redox zonation, which considerably impact the carbon and nitrogen fluxes into the stream system. The meander-driven hyporheic flow paths enhance the denitrification because of relatively longer residence times in the organic carbon-rich sediments.",

            "abstract": "Planetary interior differentiation from a bulk silicate chondrite composition is shown by geochemical studies to occur early in planetary evolution producing separated enriched and depleted mantle reservoirs with important implications for the mantle and crustal compositions that we observe today. The absence of an enriched component at the Earth's surface, however, and has lead to implications of a reservoir at the base of the mantle, but the mechanism of differentiation or downward transport of this enriched material is unknown. Here we present results from laboratory fluid dynamic experiments using liquid metal to show that metal-silicate segregation from a metal pond which forms in a magma ocean following meteorite impacts will entrain magma ocean silicate material to the base of the mantle during metal descent to the core. We model liquid iron and silicate magma using emulsified liquid metal gallium in high viscosity glucose solutions which provide the buoyancy ratios and Stokes flow regimes expected for planetary interiors. Preliminary results indicate that emulsion metal droplets sink together as a Rayleigh-Taylor instability and forms a trailing conduit of buoyant solution. Metal droplets form a pile at the base of the box where the low density solution collects, grows, and initially rises back to the surface as a thermo-chemical plume. The remaining buoyant material, which surrounds each droplet, slowly migrates upwards and rises out of the metal pile. These physical experiments scaled to planetary interiors provide important tests of purely theoretical or numerical approximations and indicate that metal-silicate segregation is consistent with rapid core formation times and contributes simultaneously to complex mantle differentiation at all depths. Our observation of entrainment of a silicate-metal conduit provides a model for differentiation and sequestration of an enriched reservoir from a magma ocean to the base of the mantle. The composition and buoyancy of the rising thermo-chemical phase is tested with Stokes theory and modifications made for reduced drag and the added mass of conduit material indicate that rise times and differentiation during ascent are consistent with magmatism for proto-continental crust formation as well as later effusive volcanism from remnants of this reservoir.",

Presently, there is an increasing and urgent need to reduce forest biomass uncertainty in order to meet the requirements of carbon mitigation treaties, such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+). Here we describe a new parameterization and assimilation methodology used to estimate tropical forest biomass using the ORCHIDEE-CAN dynamic global vegetation model. ORCHIDEE-CAN simulates carbon uptake and allocation to individual trees using a mechanistic representation of photosynthesis, respiration and other first-order processes. The model is first parameterized using forest inventory data to constrain background mortality rates, i.e., self-thinning, and productivity. Satellite remote sensing data for forest structure, i.e., canopy height, is used to constrain simulated forest stand conditions using a look-up table approach to match canopy height distributions. The resulting forest biomass estimates are provided for spatial grids that match REDD+ project boundaries and aim to provide carbon estimates for the criteria described in the IPCC Good Practice Guidelines Tier 3 category. With the increasing availability of forest structure variables derived from high-resolution LIDAR, RADAR, and optical imagery, new methodologies and applications with process-based carbon cycle models are becoming more readily available to inform land management.",

These sites include Ring Mountain in the north to Silver Creek near San Jose in the south, spanning nearly 100 km of Coast Range geology. These bodies show extensive variation in volume ratios of serpentinite blocks (some including peridotite minerals) to sheared matrix, in peridotite mineral modes, in the degrees of weathering, in the proportions of peridotite minerals versus alteration minerals, and in the degree of late-stage brittle deformation. However, we found remarkable coherence in the serpentinite alteration mineralogy and our samples bear a strong resemblance to those in the Redwood City serpentinite body studied recently by Uno and Kirby (GRL submitted). In particular, we see mineralogical and geochemical evidence for multiple stages of alteration of the original peridotite minerals that reflect partial peridotite alteration, likely in the mantle, and then a later reaction to lizardite + magnetite in the crust. These reactions are followed by localized late-stage partial alteration of serpentinite to silica minerals and magnesite by carbonated water. Our findings suggest that the mantle sources of this type of partially-serpentinized peridotite in this section of the Coast Ranges are remarkably similar and that the processes leading to later-stage alteration reactions have operated repeatedly over the area that we sampled. Internal deformation in these bodies during later stages of alteration probably occurred during ascent through the crust, as reflected by sheared lizardite skins on the serpentinite blocks that we collected. We put forward several working hypotheses that provide insights into the origins and geologic histories of these rocks.",

High-throughput RNA-sequencing can afford a wealth of information about transcript-level expression patterns, but it is becoming clear that expression dynamics are often very different at the protein level where biochemistry actually occurs. These divergent dynamics between levels of biological organization necessitate quantitative proteomic measurements to address many biogeochemical questions. The protein-level expression changes that underlie shifts in the magnitude, or even the direction, of metabolic and biogeochemical fluxes can be quite subtle and test the limits of current quantitative proteomics techniques. Here we describe methodologies for high-precision, whole-proteome quantification that are applicable to both model organisms of biogeochemical interest that may not be genetically tractable, and to complex community samples from natural environments. Employing chemical derivatization of peptides with multiple isotopically-coded tags, this strategy is rapid and inexpensive, can be implemented on a wide range of mass spectrometric instrumentation, and is relatively insensitive to chromatographic variability. We demonstrate the utility of this quantitative proteomics approach in application to both isolates and natural communities of sulfur-metabolizing and photosynthetic microbes.",

            "abstract": "The internal ice sheet temperature profile is an important parameter in ice dynamics as it influences ice deformation and motion. At present knowledge of the temperature profile is limited since it is measured in a few boreholes in Antarctica and Greenland or modeled. Techniques for remotely sensing internal temperature have to be demonstrated. To address this challenge, the Ultra Wide Band Software Defined Radiometer (UWBRAD) is being developed to provide 0.5-2 GHz nadiral measurements of ice sheet brightness temperature.\nThis study presents results from a UWBRAD forward model comparison between the coherent model (CM) and DMRT-ML model, in order to assess the relevance of varying emission physical mechanisms in the 0.5-2 GHz range. CM computes the thermal emission of a stratified medium from the fluctuation dissipation theorem. Scattering effects are not considered, but CM includes all coherent interactions among layers. Because density fluctuations cause internal reflections that exhibit coherent effects, CM predictions are strongly sensitive to density fluctuations. DMRT-ML in contrast is incoherent, and solves the radiative transfer equation using the discrete ordinate method so that scattering effects are included. However, simulations varying DMRT-ML parameters have shown that scattering effects are negligible in this frequency range. Model results show that coherent reflections become important in the brightness temperature across the 0.5-2 GHz band (10s of K) when the correlation length of density fluctuations is short (a few centimeters). The model predictions are similar when the correlation lengths exceed 10 cm.\nThe project will conduct experiments with a 4-channel (0.5, 0.94, 1.38, 1.74 GHz) prototype in November, 2015 at Dome C, Antarctica. The system will observe the ice sheet at 45o incidence from a tower. Results from the modeling studies, the Dome C experiment, and preliminary assessment of retrieval performance will be provided in the presentation.",

            "abstract": "Over the past decade, biofuel has emerged as an important renewable energy source to supplement gasoline and reduce the associated greenhouse gas emission. Many countries, for instant, have adopted biofuel production goals to blend 10% or more of gasoline with biofuels within 10 to 20 years. However, meeting these goals requires sustainable production of biofuel feedstock which can be challenging under future change in climate and extreme weather conditions, as well as the likely impacts of biofuel feedstock production on water quality and availability. To understand this interrelationship and the combined effects of increased biofuel production and climate change on regional and local water resources, we have performed watershed hydrology and water quality analyses for the Ohio River Basin. The basin is one of the major biofuel feedstock producing region in the United States, which also currently contributes about half of the flow and one third of phosphorus and nitrogen loadings to the Mississippi River that eventually flows to the Gulf of Mexico. The analyses integrate future scenarios and climate change and biofuel development through various mixes of landuse and agricultural management changes and examine their potential impacts on regional and local hydrology, water quality, soil erosion, and agriculture productivity. The results of the study are expected to provide much needed insight about the sustainability of large-scale biofuel feedstock production under the future climate change and uncertainty, and helps to further optimize the feedstock production taking into consideration the water-use efficiency.",

            "abstract": "Current sheets and associated intermittency are known to be prevalent in many turbulent plasmas and have been shown to be correlated with heating in observations of solar wind turbulence [1] and dissipation in kinetic particle-in-cell simulations [5]. Most intriguing, recent PIC simulations have found that the relative ion to electron heating ratio is strongly dependent on the turbulence amplitude [3]. An important question is whether magnetic reconnection is an important mechanism responsible for this heating. Studies focused on laminar reconnection have made significant progress recently on the magnitude and physics responsible for heating during magnetic reconnection [2,4]. The ambient Alfven speed of plasma flowing into the reconnection region plays a critical role, with heating initially taking the form of counterstreaming beams generated by non-local acceleration mechanism. However, there are significant uncertainties with how to link this basic reconnection heating with generic heating in a turbulent plasma. In this presentation, our current understanding of heating due to reconnection will be reviewed, and the factors determining the applicability of this heating to turbulent dissipation and heating will be discussed. These ideas will be explored through the comparison of kinetic PIC simulations of turbulence with reconnection heating models. Key aspects that will be examined are the effect of differing turbulent conditions on the magnitude and anisotropy of the heating, as well as the ion to electron heating ratio.\n[1] Osman et al., ApJ Letters, 727, L11, 2011.\n[2] Phan, et al., GRL, 40, 50917, 2013.\n[3] Wu et al., ApJ Letters, 763, L30, 2013.\n[4] Shay et al., Phys.

            "abstract": "Title: Geometry and spatial distribution of lenticulae on Europa\nOrder of Authors: Cansu Culha (Stanford University); Michael Manga (University of California, Berkeley)\nThe surface of Europa contains several types of elliptical features, collectively called lenticulae. These features may have positive relief (domes) or negative relief (pits), may disrupt the crust (chaos), or discolor the surface (spots); some lenticulae have attributes of both domes and chaos (dome/chaos). We map the location, dimensions and shapes of all these features and their interactions with other surface features. We find (1) pits and domes have similar sizes; (2) pits are clustered in certain regions of the surface whereas domes, dome/chaos, and chaos terrains are more uniformly distributed; (3) chaos are larger than the other lenticulae; (4) lineaments do not divert their paths around lenticulae. Taken together, these observations are consistent with conceptual models in which lenticulae are created by convection or intrusion of liquid water bodies within the ice shell. Additionally, the observations are consistent with the notion that each type of lenticulae is a surface expression of dynamics within the ice shell at a different stage of the lenticulae evolution. The similar size and shape of pits and domes suggests that one may evolve into the other. Because domes are more numerous and more uniformly distributed than pits, they are more likely to represent the end stage of this evolution assuming the end-stage leaves a longer-lasting surface expression. We find no examples of lineaments crossing pits but lineaments do cross some chaos, implying that pits are younger than chaos and consistent with pits being the earliest stage in the evolution of lenticulae. Models also predict that larger features are more likely to disrupt the crust, which is consistent with dome/chaos and chaos being larger than pits and domes. The absence of lineaments deflected by lenticulae implies either that the stresses created by lenticulae are too small to influence lineaments, or that the complete evolution of lenticulae occurs on a time scale that is short compared to the time between the formation of lineaments at a given location.",

The natural gas associated with this oil production is typically burned off, or flared, if there does not exist infrastructure to transport the natural gas to market. This flaring activity can be characterized using the satellite Nightfire data product, generated at NOAA NCEI. Nightfire uses nighttime data from the infrared bands of the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) instrument, onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) platform, and identifies hotspots at the time of overpass. In addition, Nightfire gives estimates of the temperature, size, and radiant heat of the hotspots. This presentation will show the spatial and temporal distribution of gas flaring in North Dakota from 2012-2015. In addition, a summary of calibration work to estimate flared gas volumes from Nightfire detections will be presented.",

            "abstract": "IODP Expedition 351 drilled 150 m of volcanic basement overlain by 1461 m of sedimentary material at Site 1438 in the Amami Sankaku basin, just west of the Kyushu Palau Ridge, the locus of IBM arc initiation. Age interpretations based on biostratigraphy (Arculus et al., Nat. Geosci., in-press) determined that the age of the basement section is between 64 and 51 Ma, encompassing the age of the earliest volcanic products of the IBM arc. The Site 1438 volcanic basement consists of multiple flows of aphyric microcrystalline to finely crystalline basalts containing plagioclase and clinopyroxene with rare olivine pseudomorphs. New XRF major and ICPMS trace element data confirm findings of shipboard analysis that the basalts are moderately differentiated (6-14 % MgO; Mg# = 51-83; 73-490 ppm Cr and 58-350 ppm Ni) with downcore variations related to flow units. Ti/V and Ti/Sc ratios are 16-27 and 75-152, respectively, with lowest values at the base of the core. One prominent characteristic of the basalts is their depletion of immobile highly incompatible elements compared with MORB. Basalts have MORB-normalized La/Nd of 0.5 to 0.9, and most have Th/La < 0.05. Although all basalts are LREE-depleted, La/Nd ratios increase slightly upcore, and Th enrichment compared with LREE occurs in the uppermost 5 meters. Cs, Rb, K, Ba and U are concomitantly enriched relative to LREE in several intervals as a probable result of seawater alteration, but ratios less than those of MORB are found in other areas. In contrast to basement, andesites from three sills in the lowermost sedimentary unit have arc-like trace element patterns with La/Nb > 3 and primitive mantle normalized La/Yb > 1. Our results suggest that mantle melting at the onset of subduction involved exceptionally depleted sources. Enrichment over time may be related to increasing subduction inputs and/or other processes, such as entrainment of fertile asthenosphere during extension of the overriding plate.",

            "abstract": "Liquid iron is likely the dominant constituent in the cores of terrestrial planets and icy satellites such as Earth, Mars, Mercury, the Moon, Ganymede, and Io. Suggested by geophysical and geochemical observations, light elements such as S, C, Si, etc., are likely present in planetary cores. These light elements can significantly reduce the density and melting temperature of the Fe cores, and hence their abundances are crucial to our understanding of the structure and thermal history of planetary cores, as well as the generation of intrinsic magnetic fields. Knowledge on the density of Fe-light element alloying liquids at high pressures is critical to place constraints on the composition of planetary cores. However, density data on liquid Fe-light element alloys at core pressures are very limited in pressure and composition and are sometimes controversial. In this study, we extend the density dataset for Fe-rich liquids by measuring the density of Fe, Fe-10wt%S, Fe-20wt%S, Fe-27wt%S, and FeS liquids using the X-ray absorption technique in a DIA-type multianvil apparatus up to 7 GPa and 2173 K. An ion chamber (1D-detector) and a CCD camera (2D-detector) were used to measure intensities of transmitted monochromatic X-rays through molten samples, with the photon energy optimized at 40 keV. The densities were then determined from the Beer-Lambert law using the mass absorption coefficients, calibrated by solid standards using X-ray diffraction. At each pressure, density measurements were conducted at a range of temperatures above the liquidus of the samples, enabling the determination of thermal expansion. Combined with our previous results on the sound velocity of Fe and Fe-S liquids at high pressures (Jing et al., 2014, Earth Planet. Sci. Lett. 396, 78-87), these data provide tight constraints on the equation of state and thermodynamic properties such as the adiabatic temperature gradient for Fe-S liquids. We will discuss these results with implications to planetary cores.",

Recent studies have implicated irrigation as a strong factor in perturbing land-atmosphere coupling, although the details of this interaction are not fully characterized. Therefore, in this study we seek to better understand the role of subsurface flow under conditions of groundwater extraction and irrigation on resulting atmospheric states. We use an ensemble of coupled ParFlow-WRF simulations over the San Joaquin River Basin in California to identify the type and character of land-atmosphere interactions for a set of irrigation scenarios. Ensemble members include selected boundary layer schemes, land surface model configurations, and initial and boundary condition perturbations. Variability in atmospheric response, particularly in boundary layer height and precipitation patterns, under high water table (characteristic of predevelopment conditions) and lowered water table (resulting from historic groundwater extraction) conditions are evaluated in the context of the uncertainty resulting from choice of model physics and atmospheric perturbations. Hydrologic alterations associated with lowered water table elevation appear linked to the atmosphere via changes in boundary layer height.",

The combination of these characteristics results in the unique soil–aquifer phenomena that are highlighted and summarized in this review work. The following four vertisols-aquifer topics will be discussed: 1) Soil cracks as preferential pathways for water and contaminants - Lysimeter to basin-scale observations show the significance of cracks as preferential flow paths in vertisols that bypass matrix blocks in the unsaturated zone. Fresh recharge and groundwater contamination from these fluxes will be reviewed; 2) Soil cracks as deep evaporators and unsaturated-zone salinity - Deep soil samples under uncultivated vertisols in semiarid regions reveal a dry (immobile), saline matrix, partly due to enhanced evaporation through soil cracks. Observations of this phenomenon will be compared and the mechanism of evapoconcentration due to air flow in the cracks is discussed; 3) Impact of cultivation on flushing of the unsaturated zone and aquifer salinization - Land-use change of vertisols from native land to cropland promotes greater fluxes through the saline unsaturated-zone matrix, eventually flushing salts to the aquifer. Different degrees of salt flushing will be presented as well as aquifer salinization on different scales, and a comparison is made with aquifers under other soils; 4) Relatively little nitrate contamination in aquifers under vertisols - A number of observations show that aquifers under cultivated vertisols are somewhat resistant to groundwater contamination by nitrate (the major agriculturally related groundwater problem). Denitrification is probably the main mechanism supporting this resistance, whereas a certain degree of anion-exchange capacity may have a retarding effect as well.  \n ",

Here we demonstrate new capabilities that use satellite measurements from the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) Suomi-NPP (S-NPP) instruments (operational since 2012) in the generation of trajectory-based predictions of smoke dispersion from North American wildfires. Two such data products are used, namely the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and the combined Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) and Advanced Technology Microwave Sounder (ATMS) NOAA-Unique CrIS-ATMS Processing System (NUCAPS) carbon monoxide (CO) retrievals. The latter is a new data product made possible by the release of full spectral-resolution CrIS measurements since December 2014. Once NUCAPS CO becomes operationally available it will be used in real-time applications such as IDEA-I along with VIIRS AOD and meteorological forecast fields to support National Weather Service (NWS) Incident Meteorologist (IMET) and air quality management decision making. By combining different measurements, the information content of the IDEA-I transport and dispersion forecast is improved within the complex terrain features that dominate the Western US and Alaska. The primary user community of smoke forecasts is the Western regions of the National Weather Service (NWS) and US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) due to the significant impacts of wildfires in these regions. With this we demonstrate the quality of the smoke dispersion forecasts that can be achieved by integrating polar-orbiting satellite measurements with forecast models to enable on-site decision support services for fire incident management teams and other real-time air quality agencies.",

            "abstract": "Large D/H fractionations have been observed in the lipids and growth water of most organisms studied today. These fractionations have generally been assumed to be constant across most biota because they originate solely from isotope effects imposed by the highly conserved lipid biosynthetic pathway. Recent data is illustrating this conclusion as incomplete. Lipids from field and laboratory samples exhibit huge variations in D/H fractionation. In environmental samples, lipids vary in δD by up to 300 ‰ and in laboratory cultures the documented variation is up to 500 ‰ within the same organism. Remarkably, the isotope fractionation appears to be correlated with the type of metabolism employed by the host organism. However, the underlying biochemical mechanisms leading to these isotopic variations are not yet fully understood.\nBecause the largest proportion of H-bound C in fatty acids is derived directly from NADPH during biosynthesis, the original hypothesis was that large differences in the isotopic composition of NADPH, generated by different central metabolic pathways, were the primary source of D/H variation in lipids. However, recent observations indicate that this cannot be the whole story and lead us to the conclusion that additional processes must affect the isotope composition of NADPH. These processes may include the isotopic exchange of NADPH with water as well as fractionation of NADPH by transhydrogenases, interconverting NADH to NADPH by exhibiting large isotope effects.\nIn this project, our objective is to ascertain whether D/H fractionation and these biochemical processes are correlated. We investigate correlations between cellular NADPH/NADP+ as well as NADH/NAD+ pool sizes and the D/H fractionation in a set of different microorganisms and will present the first trends here. Our results will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the basic biological regulations over D/H fractionation and potentially enables their use as tracers and proxies across earth and biological sciences.",

As results, we found a significant cross correlation of 0.7 between SOI component 10 and precipitation component 10 in Climate Division 6. Furthermore, among all the Niño indices, Niño 3 region displayed the best correlation. When we compared precipitation division 7 component 9 with Niño 3 component 10, a 0.95 cross correlation value was obtained. The lowest cross correlation value of (0.33) was obtained from Climate Division 6, precipitation component 7 with Niño 4 component 7.",

The Coronal Solar Magnetism Observatory (COSMO) is a proposed ground-based suite of instruments designed for routine study of coronal and chromospheric magnetic fields and their environment, and to understand the formation of coronal mass ejections (CME) and their relation to other forms of solar activity. This new facility will be operated by the High Altitude Observatory of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (HAO/NCAR) with partners at the University of Michigan, the University of Hawaii and George Mason University in support of the solar and heliospheric community. It will replace the current NCAR Mauna Loa Solar Observatory (http://mlso.hao.ucar.edu). COSMO will enhance the value of existing and new observatories on the ground and in space by providing unique and crucial observations of the global coronal and chromospheric magnetic field and its evolution.

            "abstract": "Wave breaking across bodies of water releases coarse particles into the air which can impact climate and human health. Freshwater lakes, such as the Great Lakes, can generate lake spray aerosols (LSA), similarly to how sea spray is generated, during periods of high winds and wave action. This LSA has the potential to impact climate through direct and indirect effects (ie. scattering/absorption and cloud nucleation) and are suggested to impact human health via inhalation of these particles during algal bloom periods characterized by toxic cyanobacteria. Very few studies have been conducted to assess the physicochemical properties of freshwater LSA. Prior work in our lab included the construction and characterization of a laboratory based LSA generator. In this work, we examine laboratory generated aerosol particles from laboratory based freshwater standards, freshwater samples collected from Lake Michigan, and ambient particles collected during a wave event on the shores of Lake Michigan in the summer of 2015. Particle size distributions, number concentrations, and chemical composition are presented and discussed as a function of laboratory generated and ambient collected LSA. Results indicate that there are characteristic particles that represent LSA. This study represents the next step towards evaluating and understanding the potential for coarse LSA to impact climate and health in the Great Lakes region.",

            "abstract": "We statistically analyze the impact of jet fuel properties on aerosols emitted by the NASA McDonnell Douglas DC-8 CFM56-2-C1 engines burning fifteen different aviation fuels. Data were collected for this single engine type during four different, comprehensive ground tests conducted over the past decade, which allow us to clearly link changes in aerosol emissions to fuel compositional changes. It is found that the volatile aerosol fraction dominates the number and volume emissions indices (EIs) over all engine powers, which are driven by changes in fuel aromatic and sulfur content. Meanwhile, the naphthalenic content of the fuel determines the magnitude of the non-volatile number and volume EI as well as the black carbon mass EI. Linear regression coefficients are reported for each aerosol EI in terms of these properties, engine fuel flow rate, and ambient temperature, and show that reducing both fuel sulfur content and napththalenes to near-zero levels would result in roughly a ten-fold decrease in aerosol number emitted per kg of fuel burn. This work informs future efforts to model aircraft emissions changes as the aviation fleet gradually begins to transition toward low-aromatic, low-sulfur alternative jet fuels from bio-based or Fischer-Tropsch production pathways.",

            "abstract": "The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is Europe’s dominant mode of climate variability. Its negative phase represents a change in the westerlies that brings wet conditions to the Iberian Peninsula (IP). The NAO exhibits decadal and centennial non-stationary behaviour with high temporal variability challenging the reliability of its reconstruction and predictability. Here, we use ring-width and stable isotopes in cellulose of trees from the northwest Iberian Peninsula to link NAO and regional hydroclimate over the last 400 years. Non-linear methods based on extremes allow the capture of distinct seasonal climatic variability recorded by tree-ring parameters and asymmetric signals of the associated atmospheric features. Tree growth is largely pre-conditioned by winter-spring precipitation, rather than water availability during the growing season. Thus, wider rings allow for a skillful wintertime NAO reconstruction. In contrast, extreme values in stable isotopic records are linked to early-summer IP hydroclimatic conditions. Extreme wet/dry summers detected by these trees compare favourably to pluvial/drought episodes in historical records based on rogation ceremonies from Catholic liturgy in northeastern Spain. Independent sources of past climate variability validate our findings that attribute the non-linear moisture signals recorded by extreme tree-ring values to distinct large-scale atmospheric patterns and allow for targeted seasonal 400-yr reconstructions of wintertime NAO and summer hydroclimate variability.",

            "abstract": "In temperate regions, channels are expected to recover from intense floods in a matter of months to years, but quantitative empirical support for this idea remains limited. Moreover, existing literature fails to address the spatial variability of the recovery process. Using an emerging technology, we investigate the immediate response to and progressive recovery of channels in the Northeastern United States from an extreme flood. We seek to determine what factors, including the nature and extent of the immediate response of the channel to the flood and post-flood availability of sediment, contribute to the spatial variability of the rate of recovery. Taking advantage of the 2011 flooding from Tropical Storm Irene, for which pre- and post-flood aerial lidar exist, along with a third set of terrestrial lidar collected in 2015, we assess channel response and recovery with multi-temporal lidar comparison. This method, with kilometers of continuous data, allows for analysis beyond traditional cross-section and reach-scale studies. Results indicate that landscape-scale factors, such as valley morphology and gradients in unit stream power, are controls on channel response to the flood, producing spatially variable impacts. Along a 16.4-km section (drainage area = 82 km2) of the Deerfield River in Vermont, over 148,000 m3 or erosion occurred during the flood. The spatial variation of impacts was correlated (R2= 0.476) with the ratio of channel width to valley width. We expect the recovery process will similarly exhibit spatial variation in rate and magnitude, possibly being governed by gradients in unit stream power and sediment availability. We test the idea that channel widening during the flood reduces post-flood unit stream power, creating a pathway for deposition and recovery to pre-flood width. Flood-widened reaches downstream of point-sources of sediment, such as landslides, will recover more quickly than those without consistent sediment supply. Results of this study will improve our ability to predict the nature and location of flood impacts and determine what factors contribute to the spatial variability of channel recovery.",

This occurred most recently in 1509, causing 10,000 casualties in a population of about 200,000. The population is now 20 million, the building stock more fragile, and the last earthquake of the current sequence is considered imminent.\nSince July 2014, UNAVCO has installed 2 EarthScope borehole geophysical instrument strings, which include Gladwin Tensor strainmeters and passive, short-period 3-component seismometers, into boreholes provided by internationally supported Geophysical Observatory at the North Anatolian Fault (GONAF) and Bogazici University Kandilli Observatory. Funding for instruments and staff participation was provided by NSF. If the project remains on schedule, we anticipate that 4 additional BSM strings will be installed by the fall 2015.\nOur joint international project gives an opportunity to enhance the detection capability of a suite of deep seismometers (GONAF) installed near Istanbul and will permit us to image dynamic rupture along the NAF and to monitor and better understand the tectonic processes leading to failure. The tectonic and geodynamic environment of the NAF near Istanbul in many ways resembles the San Andreas Fault setting of San Francisco; these instruments will enhance the ability to monitor ultra-slow process near the probable source zone of the Mw>7 earthquake beneath the Marmara Sea on the NAF\nThis project has provided UNAVCO an opportunity to gain experience in strainmeters installations outside of North America. The techniques developed to adapt to the challenges of installing borehole strainmeters on islands and other remote locations with limited resources will greatly enhance our ability to install these BSM instruments in similar locations in the future.",

Previous studies examining the ages and displacements of offset fluvial terraces and bedrock features at the Saxton River site suggest that slip rates along the Awatere fault have been highly variable since ~16 ka, exhibiting rates as low as ~3 mm/yr and as fast ~13 mm/yr, with an average of ~6 mm/yr (e.g., Mason et al., 2006). Mapping on high-resolution lidar topographic data and additional field surveys yield revised measurements of the five fluvial terrace risers and bedrock ridge that have been offset by the Awatere fault at the Saxton River site. Improved dating of those geomorphic features provided by post-IR50-IRSL225 luminescence ages allows us to more accurately constrain the incremental slip rates recorded at this site. Preliminary results suggest that the slip rate during latest Pleistocene-Holocene time has indeed varied considerably over millennial timescales. This study is part of a broader effort aimed at determining incremental slip rates and paleo-earthquake ages and displacements from all four main Marlborough faults. Collectively, these data will allow us to determine how the Marlborough system faults have worked together during the Holocene-late Pleistocene to accommodate plate-boundary deformation in time and space.",

            "abstract": "The Atchafalaya River (AR) in Louisiana is the principal distributary of the Mississippi River (MR), and its basin contains the largest contiguous area of baldcypress-water tupelo swamp forests in North America. After designation of the Atchafalaya River Basin (ARB) as a federal floodway following the destructive 1927 MR flood, it was extensively modified to accommodate a substantial portion of the MR flow (~25%) to mitigate flooding in southern Louisiana. These modifications and increased flows resulted in substantial incision along large portions of the AR, altering connectivity between the river and its associated waterbodies. As a result of incision, the hydroperiod has been substantially altered, which has contributed to a decline in ecological health of the ARB’s baldcypress-water tupelo forests. While it is recognized that the altered hydroperiod has negatively affected natural baldcypress regeneration, it is unclear whether proposed projects designed to enhance flow connectivity will increase long-term survival of these forests. In this study, we have constructed a 1D2D hydrodynamic model using SOBEK 2.12 to realistically model key physical parameters such as residence times, inundation extent, water-surface elevations (WSELs), and flow velocities to increase our understanding of the ARB’s altered hydroperiod and the consequences for baldcypress-water tupelo forests. While the model encompasses a majority of the ARB, our modeling effort is focused on the Flat Lake Water Management Unit located in the southern portion of the ARB, where it will also be used to evaluate flow connectivity enhancement projects within the management unit. We believe our 1D2D hybrid hydraulic modeling approach will provide the flexibility and accuracy needed to guide connectivity enhancement efforts in the ARB and may provide a model framework for guiding similar efforts along other highly-altered river systems.",

Reconstructing past terrestrial N cycling is a valuable complement to experimental manipulation of complex climate-carbon-N interactions, but has been challenged by shortcomings of available proxies. We here examine 40ky of terrestrial N cycling on the landscape of northeast Siberia as recorded in N-isotopes of chlorophyll degradation products preserved in a permafrost soil core. This dataset gives insight into the response of the N cycle to concurrent changes in climate, plant community, and atmospheric pCO2 that accompany a cycle of glaciation. This study is the first application to temporal reconstruction of this compound-specific, soil-based proxy for an integrated foliar N isotope signal. We infer ~10 per mil swings in foliar N-isotope values at this site, pointing to the sensitivity of denitrification at high latitudes to changes in environmental conditions. We further observe the effect of increases in N-fixing species on stimulating N cycling as recorded by our proxy. We do not see an effect of progressive N limitation due to pre-anthropogenic increases in pCO2 accompanying deglaciation.",

            "abstract": "Magma volatile contents and ascent rates primarily determine whether rhyolites erupt explosively or effusively. Techniques for assessing ascent rates include experimental calibrations of microlite growth and hornblende breakdown, and diffusion of volatiles in reentrants (embayments). We present a new method based on diffusive loss of H from quartz-hosted, rhyolitic melt inclusions (MIs) in the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff (HRT). The initial HRT fall deposits show evidence for syn-eruptive reworking, reflecting episodicity during the opening explosive phases. Quartz-hosted MIs from 9 levels in the fall deposits have U, Cl, and B contents that form correlated arrays versus Rb, indicative of the effects of crystallization differentiation. However, H and Li, which diffuse much faster in quartz, plot as scattered clusters, suggesting that diffusive changes occurred post-entrapment. In each fall horizon sampled, wide ranges of H2O (~1.0-4.5 wt%) but restricted ranges in CO2 occur in sealed MIs. In contrast to the wide H2O ranges, incompatible elements in the MIs from each sample vary by less than a factor of 2, consistent with diffusive loss of H from MIs. We infer that the highest H2O values reflect the magma H2O content at the pre-eruptive storage depth, and lower values reflect variable diffusive losses, implying that at a given stratigraphic horizon, co-deposited crystals experienced different ascent histories. Timescales for H2O loss from a diffusion model1 and experimentally calibrated H diffusivities2 yield decompression times of <12 hours to 5 days, with the lowest H2O values (~1 wt%) requiring ~2 weeks. HRT initial magma ascent was complex in that single fall layers contain crystals from both rapidly ascending, deeply derived magma and magma that had decompressed to varying degrees over varying times within the conduit system. The timescales for individual stratigraphic horizons are of the same magnitude as the estimates based on reworking in individual layers. The field evidence for multiple time breaks and the MI evidence for hours to weeks ascent timescales of co-erupted crystals in single layers requires that magma ascended episodically over the weeks-months timescale represented by the early HRT fall deposit.\n1Cottrell, E. et al.

As a result, programming required is drastically decreased, and runtime efficiency and analysis effectiveness are increased relative to each unique model.",

Res., 101, 10761 (1996)] is a non-fluctuating, non-travelling, spatially periodic pattern in electromagnetic field and fluid quantities that arises in the simultaneous presence of a magnetic-field-aligned current channel and cross-magnetic field plasma flow. Theory predicts [Finnegan et al., Nonlin. Proc. Geophys., 15, 957 (2008)] that the wave appears as an ion density perturbation that is static in the laboratory frame and that the wave electric field can accelerate electrons parallel to a background magnetic field. For experiments in the afterglow plasma in LAPD-U, results of which are reported on in this poster, the necessary conditions for the stationary wave are generated by a biased segmented electrode that creates a convective flow and a planar-mesh electrode that draws current parallel to the background magnetic field. An electrostatic probe and a retarding field energy analyzer measure fixed (in the laboratory frame) patterns in the ion density and electron energy. Spatial patterns of electron acceleration are reminiscent of the patterns present during the formation of discrete auroral arcs. Observation of long-lived discrete arcs indicates that some arcs require a generation mechanism that supports electron acceleration parallel to auroral field lines for tens of minutes. We present arc lifetime statistics to emphasize the paucity of physical models that explain these observations.\n*Support from NSF grant PHY-130-1896 and grants from the Canadian Space Agency is gratefully acknowledged.

Seasonal variation of PAHs (range 37.2–74.0 ng m−3) was significant with winter values being 72% and 68% higher than summer and monsoon respectively. Principal component analysis coupled with multiple linear regression identified diesel, natural gas and lubricating oil combustion (49.5%), wood combustion (25.4%), gasoline (15.5%) and coal combustion (9.6%) sources for the observed PAHs. Heavy traffic on the national highway and arterial roads and domestic emissions from suburban households in the vicinity of the site appeared to have significantly affected its air quality. A substantial portion (∼55%) of the aerosol PAH load was comprised of carcinogenic species, which yielded a considerably high lifetime inhalation cancer risk estimate (8.7E−04). If considered as a conservative lower-bound estimate, this risk translates into ∼211 excess cancer cases for lifetime inhalation exposure to the observed PAH concentrations in Delhi.",

            "abstract": "Research on asteroid impacts on Earth is crucial and challenging nationally and globally. Existing efforts for Near Earth Object (NEO) survey such as Catalina Sky Survey and SAO-minor planets center (MPC) have been established. However, our understanding of asteroids still needs to be advanced through physical characterization, modeling of atmospheric entry/breakup, and risk assessments of impacts (land and water), with emphases on small impactors. To achieve the goal of knowledge advancement, activities such as orbit determination, threat analysis, and impact simulation are fundamental, and all require accurate information and effective processing capability. Here we propose a planetary framework including the workflow, information flow, organization dependencies, and most importantly the cyberinfrastructure configuration required to achieve effective information processing. This framework will serve as a foundation for understanding the NEO hazard and building a long-term capability to counter a potential NEO impact threat.",

            "abstract": "IODP Expedition 331 to the Okinawa backarc basin provided an opportunity to study the microbial stratigraphy within the sediments surrounding a hydrothermal vent. The Okinawa backarc basin is a sedimented region of the seafloor located on a continental margin, and also hosts a hydrothermal network within the subsurface. Site C0014 within the Iheya North hydrothermal field is located 450 m east of the active vent and has a surface temperature of 5°C with no evidence of hydrothermal alteration within the top 10 meters below sea floor (mbsf). Temperature increases with depth at an estimated rate of 3°C/m and transitions from non-hydrothermal margin sediments to a hydrothermally altered regime below 10 mbsf.\nIn this study, we utilized deep 16S rRNA sequencing of DNA from IODP Expedition 331 Site C0014 sediment horizons in order to assess diversity throughout the sediment column as well as determine the potential limits of the biosphere. Analysis of the amplicon data shows a shift over 15 mbsf from a heterogeneous community of cosmopolitan marine subsurface taxa toward an archaeal-dominated community in the deepest horizons of the predicted biosphere. Notably, the phylum Chloroflexi represents a substantial taxon through most horizons, where it appears to be replaced below 10 mbsf by punctuations of thermophilic and methanotrophic Archaea and Miscellaneous Crenarchaeotic Group abundances.\nDNA from the aforementioned transition horizons was further analyzed using metagenomic sequencing. Preliminary taxonomic analysis of the metagenomic data agrees well with amplicon data in capturing the shift in relative abundance of Archaea increasing with depth. Additionally, reverse gyrase, a gene found exclusively in hyperthermophilic microorganisms, was recovered only in the metagenome of the deepest horizon. A BLAST search of this protein sequence against the GenBank non-redudnant protein database produced top hits with reverse gyrase from Thermococcus and Pyrococcus, which are known thermophiles. Up until now, thermophiles and hyperthermophiles have been studied in cultured hydrothermal vent fluid samples, or have been identified from 16S rRNA taxonomic analyses. These recovered genes provide direct evidence for a pervasive subsurface hyperthermophilic biosphere in off-axis hydrothermal sediments.",

The primary objective of this mission was to determine the contribution of small spatial and temporal scale fluctuations of the electric fields to the larger-scale energy deposition processes associated with the aurora. The Auroral Spatial Structures Probe Sub-Orbital Mission consisted of a formation of 7 spacecraft (a main payload with 6 deployable sub-payloads) designed for multiple temporally spaced co-located measurements of electric and magnetic fields in the earth’s ionosphere. The mission was able to make observations at a short time scale and small spatial scale convergence that is unobservable by either satellite or ground-based observations. The payloads included magnetometers, electric field double probes, and Langmuir probes as well as a sweeping impedance probe on the main payload. We present here preliminary results from the measurements taken that hint at the underlying spatial structure of the currents and energy deposition in the aurora. The Poynting flux derived from the observations is shown and implications are discussed in terms of the contribution of small spatial scale, rapid temporal scale fluctuations in the currents that deposit energy in the auroral region.\nFunding provided by NASA Grants NNX11AE23G and NNX13AN20A.",

            "abstract": "Agroecosystems are major contributors of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. Denitrification and nitrification are the primary pathways of N2O emission in soils. However, there is uncertainty regarding the organisms responsible for N2O production. Bacteria were previously considered the only microbial N2O source, however, current studies indicate that fungi also produce N2O by denitrification. Denitrifying bacteria can be a source or sink of N2O depending on the presence and expression of nitrous oxide reductase genes (nosZ), encoding for the enzyme converting N2O to N2. Fungal denitrification may produce only N2O as an end product due to missing the nosZ gene. Animal manures applied to agricultural fields can transfer antibiotics to soils as a result of antibiotic use in the livestock industry. These antibiotics target mostly bacteria and may promote fungal growth. The growth inhibition of denitrifying bacteria may favor fungal denitrifiers potentially enhancing N2O emissions. Our objective is to examine the effects of antibiotic exposure and manure fertilization on the microbial communities responsible for N2 and N2O production in grasslands. Soil slurry incubations were conducted with tetracycline at different concentrations. A mesocosm experiment was also performed with soil cores exposed to tetracycline and cow manure. Production of N2O and N2 was measured using gas chromatography with electron capture detector (GC-ECD) and isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS), respectively. Antibiotic inhibition of soil N2 production was found to be dose dependent, reaching up to 80% inhibition with 1g Kg-1 of tetracycline treatment, while N2O production was enhanced up to 8 times. These results suggest higher fungal denitrification with a concomitant decrease in bacterial denitrification after antibiotic exposure. We also found higher N2O fluxes in the soil mesocosms treated with manure plus tetracycline. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) will be conducted to examine the changes in abundance and expression of total bacteria (targeting 16S rRNA), fungi (targeting ITS) and the nosZ genes in the soil communities. Thus, this study demonstrates potential impact of antibiotic contaminated manure on microbial communities responsible for agricultural N2O emissions.",

            "abstract": "Silicic volcanic and plutonic rocks of an eroded Mesoproterozoic caldera complex were intruded and replaced by iron ore, and cross-cut by REE-enriched breccia pipes (~12% total REO) to form the Pea Ridge iron-oxide-apatite-REE (IOA-REE) deposit. Igneous activity, iron ore formation, and REE mineralization overlapped in space and time, however the source of REEs and other metals (Fe, Cu, Au) integral to these economically important deposits remains unclear. Melt inclusions (MI) hosted in refractory zircon phenocrysts are used to constrain magmatic components and processes in the formation of the Pea Ridge deposit. Homogenized (1.4 kbar, 1000°C, 1 hr) MI in zircons from rhyolites ~600 ft (PR-91) and ~1200 ft (PR-12) laterally from the ore body were analyzed for major elements by EPMA and volatiles and trace elements (H2O, S, F, Cl, REEs, Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Nb, U, Th) by SHRIMP-RG. Metals (including Cu, Au) will be measured in an upcoming SHRIMP-RG session. U-Pb ages, Ti and REE were determined by SHRIMP-RG for a subset of zircon spots adjacent to MI (1458 ± 18 Ma (PR-12); 1480 ± 45 Ma (PR-91)). MI glasses range from fresh and homogeneous dacite-rhyolite (65-75 wt% SiO2) to heterogeneous, patchy mixtures of K-spar and quartz (PR-12, 91), and more rarely mica, albite and/or anorthoclase (PR-91). MI are commonly attached to monazite and xenotime, particularly along re-entrants and zircon rims (PR-91). Fresh dacite-rhyolite glasses (PR-12) have moderate H2O (~2-2.5 wt%), Rb/Sr ratios (~8) and U (~5-7 ppm), and negative (chondrite-normalized) Eu anomalies (Eu ~0.4-0.7 ppm) (typical of rhyolites), whereas HREEs (Tb, Ho, Tm) are elevated (~2-3 ppm). Patchy K-spar and quartz inclusions (PR-12, 91) have flat LREE patterns, and positive anomalies in Tb, Ho, and Tm. One K-spar inclusion (PR-91) has a ~5-50 fold increase in HREEs (Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm) and U (35 ppm) relative to other MI. U-Pb and REE analyses of its zircon host are not unusual (1484 ± 21 Ma); its irregular shape surrounded by a CL-bright zone (Ti-in-zircon = 713°C) is a commonly observed texture and suggests resorption. Silicic magmatism at Pea Ridge was complex, with zircons trapping both pristine melt and poly-phase mixtures that span a range of REE contents. Most MI have lower REE contents than would be expected for significant magmatic REE contribution to the Pea Ridge IOA-REE deposit.",

            "abstract": "A combination of factors including climate change, land clearing, and artificial drainage have increased many agricultural regions’ stream flows and rates at which channel banks and bluffs are eroded. Increasing erosion rates within the Minnesota River Basin have contributed to higher sediment-loading rates, excess turbidity levels, and increases in sedimentation rates in Lake Pepin further downstream. Water storage sites (e.g., wetlands) have been discussed as a means to address these issues. This study uses the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to assess a range of water retention site (WRS) implementation scenarios in the Le Sueur watershed in south-central Minnesota, a subwatershed of the Minnesota River Basin. Sediment loading from bluffs was assessed through an empirical relationship developed from gauging data. Sites were delineated as topographic depressions with specific land uses, minimum areas (3000 m2), and high compound topographic index values. Contributing areas for the WRS were manually measured and used with different site characteristics to create 210 initial WRS scenarios. A generalized relationship between WRS area and contributing area was identified from measurements, and this relationship was used with different site characteristics (e.g., depth, hydraulic conductivity (K), and placement) to create 225 generalized WRS scenarios. Reductions in peak flow volumes and sediment-loading rates are generally maximized by placing site with high K values in the upper half of the watershed. High K values allow sites to lose more water through seepage, emptying their storages between precipitation events and preventing frequent overflowing. Reductions in peak flow volumes and sediment-loading rates also level off at high WRS extents due to the decreasing frequencies of high-magnitude events. The generalized WRS scenarios were also used to create a simplified empirical model capable of generating peak flows and sediment-loading rates from near-channel features in the lower watershed. This simplified model is being incorporated into a decision-analysis model portraying a wide variety of management options in the Le Sueur watershed. This tool may help local stakeholders to evaluate, select, and promote management scenarios that best address the issues faced in the region.",

Various precipitation patterns exist due to El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) which can cause abnormal precipitation or droughts. As temperature increases mainly due to the increase of CO2 in the atmosphere, it is rapidly changing the climate of not only California but the world. An increase in temperature is leading to droughts in certain areas as other areas are experiencing heavy rainfall/flooding. Droughts in return are providing a foundation for fires harming the ecosystem and nearby population. Various natural hazards can be induced due to the coupling effects from inconsistent precipitation patterns and vice versa. Using wavelets and ARIMA modeling, we were able to identify anomalies of high precipitation and droughts within California's 7 climate divisions using NOAA's hourly precipitation data from rain gauges and compared the results with modeled data, SOI, PDO, and AMO. The identification of anomalies can be used to compare and correct remote sensing measurements of precipitation and droughts.",

            "abstract": "Seasonally inundated wetlands in the Yolo Bypass Wildlife Area (YBWA; Davis, CA) are producers of monomethylmercury (MeHg) during fall flood up. The export of MeHg from the YBWA is of serious concern to downstream habitats as it is a neurotoxin and poses a serious health concern to humans and wildlife. In this experiment, we routed water from a 40 hectare seasonal wetland through nine replicated 100 x 25 m constructed ponds to determine their efficiency at lowering MeHg. All of the sampling was conducted over a three year period (2011-2013) during fall months. We measured total and filtered (<0.45 µm) methyl and total mercury as well as nutrients in incoming tail water and at the outflow of each pond. Residence times in the ponds were modeled using rhodamine dye and ranged from 0.7 to 13.0 days in depending on flow (Q = 0.08 – 1.39 cfs). Reductions of dissolved (filtered) MeHg concentrations ranged from 0.024 – 0.455 ng L-1 d-1 and particulate (total – filtered) MeHg reductions ranged from 0.028 – 1.02 ng L-1 d-1 in the outflow of the ponds. We observed little to no change in dissolved MeHg concentrations at high flow rates, however, there was still a significant decrease in the particulate fraction of MeHg. In contrast, ponds with lower flow rates (e.g. longer residence times) were efficient at lowering both dissolved and particulate MeHg concentrations. During polishing periods when overlying water MeHg concentrations were highest dissolved MeHg flux was into sediments where we hypothesize bacterial demethylation was responsible for transformation back to inorganic mercury species. Loss of particulate MeHg from the water column was attributed to particle settling. Results from this experiment indicate small ponds with short residence times can be efficient at lowering MeHg concentrations. The design of the pond will vary depending on the volume of the seasonal wetland being drained and needs of the wetland manager.",

            "abstract": "Impact cratering is a primary weathering process of airless bodies and is the dominant method of redistributing material across the lunar surface. Crater ejecta blankets are a window into the impact cratering process and can provide important information on the properties of subsurface materials as well as surface evolution. Radar scattering information, in particular the circular polarization ratio (CPR), provides a useful means of investigating these properties. Using data returned from the Mini-RF instrument onboard NASA’s LRO, we observe significant diversity in the CPR around young mare craters as a function of distance from the crater rim, regardless of crater size or relative age. Some commonalities in the scattering profiles are observed for all crater diameters: higher CPR values occur near the crater rim that decay with radial distance outward, larger craters have a higher CPR than smaller craters, and the overall shapes of the profiles are similar such that the main scattering characteristics of the studied craters can generally be grouped into three main categories.\nComparing CPR profiles with data at other wavelengths provides additional insights and suggests two interesting results. The first is that comparisons of radar and optical data imply relationships between mare subsurface stratigraphy and structure and the relative size of the material found within the ejecta blanket. Of the examined craters, twelve have shelves of approximately constant CPR as well as discrete layers outcropping in the subsurface, and nine fall along a trend line when comparing shelf-width with thickness of subsurface layers. The second is that comparisons of radar data with other wavelengths may provide insights into the maturity of the surface. For example, some examined craters have laterally extensive, optically bright ejecta blankets suggesting that a region of rough, high-CPR material should be present near the crater rim, though this is not observed. Radar data is sensitive to distributions of larger scatterers than optical data, thus differences in optical versus radar data may be related to maturity of the surface materials. Comparisons across wavelengths, and with established techniques such as the optical maturity parameter (OMAT), may provide further insights into the evolution of crater ejecta with time.",

            "abstract": "The northeastern North Atlantic Ocean, and the Norwegian and Greenland Seas are subject to large hydrographic changes. These variations can influence oceanic heat transport to the Arctic, meridional overturning circulation, and atmospheric circulation patterns and thereby impact global climate patterns. Marine records suggest that numerous large-scale changes in the hydrography of the northern North Atlantic took place during the middle to late Holocene. Here, we report a record of nitrogen and hydrogen isotope measurements from a lake sediment core from Bjørnøya, Svalbard (74.38°N, 19.02°E) that documents major regime shifts in the climate of the northern North Atlantic during the past 6,000 years. Bjørnøya is the nesting ground for one of the largest seabird populations in the North Atlantic. As top predators in the marine ecosystem, seabirds (and their guano) are enriched in 15N; during spring and summer months they deliver this isotopically enriched nitrogen to their nesting area. We developed a record of seabird population changes on Bjørnøya based on the bulk nitrogen isotope composition of sediments in a core collected from lake Ellasjøen. The record reveals multiple multicentennial scale changes in δ15N values (varying between ~8-12‰) that track past changes in the size of seabird populations. From the same sediment core, we also developed a record of δD of precipitation, by measuring δD values of sedimentary n-alkanes. Past intervals with the largest inferred bird populations correspond with the most enriched δD of precipitation, which we interpret to represent a more Atlantic climate. Periods with reduced seabird populations correspond with intervals having more negative δD of precipitation and representing a more Arctic climate. Together, the nitrogen and hydrogen isotope records signify regime shifts in the oceanography, marine ecosystem, and atmospheric circulation of the northern North Atlantic that are related to variations in the strength of the subpolar gyre.",

About 80% of the ITF flows through the Makassar Strait between the islands of Borneo and Sulawesi and can be modified by the complex climate system over the Maritime continent characterized by interacting climate phenomena like e.g. El Niño Southern Oscillation and the Australasian monsoon system. To assess changes in the hydroclimate of the Makassar Strait in relation to dominant climatic forcing over the past 5,000 years, sediment core SO 217-18517 (1°32.198' S 117°33.756' E, 698 m water depth) collected off the Mahakam Delta, eastern Borneo, was studied. We use shell Mg/Ca ratio in planktic foraminifera to reconstruct sea surface temperature (SST), sedimentation rates and Ti/Ca ratios to reconstruct changes in terrigenous runoff, and seawater δ18O (δ18Osw) as a measure of past changes in sea surface salinity. Zr/Rb ratios are interpreted to indicate changes in grain size distribution.\nSST shows small-scale variations around 28.5°C during the mid Holocene, a decreasing trend between 3,000 and 1,700 years BP, and thereafter minor variations around 27.5°C. Sedimentation rates were higher between 3,400 and 1,000 years BP. Runoff increased during the past 5,000 years while our data indicate no change in sea surface salinity from mid to late Holocene. Grain size decreased until 1,700 years BP, and remained stable thereafter towards the present.\nThe partly inconsistent timing and pattern of our data indicate the different degree to which our proxies are influenced by different forcings. We will explore the complex connection between local insolation and climate phenomena such as ENSO, dynamic and thermodynamic changes in ITCZ and monsoonal rainfall, their possible relation to high-latitude forcing including an (inter)hemispheric insolation gradient.",

Dust modelling, satellite observations and stable isotope data have contributed to understanding of the dust provenance, teleconnection and process mechanisms. Most paleo-aeolian data have suggested positive links between Asian dust input variability and glacial-interglacial cycles in the North Pacific. However, existing Pacific paleodust studies mostly depend on low-resolution marine records at mid- and high-latitudes. In this study, we reconstruct 38 kyr terrestrial records of Asian dust deposition from Hawaiian montane peat bogs. We also focus on interpreting temporal correlations of the Asian dust flux history with its local hydrological variability over late Quaternary interglacial/glacial changes because of the significant positive correlation between Asian dust mass in Hawaiian surface soils and annual precipitations (Figure A1 & A2). For a proxy for Asian dust in Hawaii, we use quartz, a continental igneous rock-driven mineral type absent in Hawaiian basaltic rocks. Using an X-ray diffraction method, we quantify quartz content and calculate quartz deposition rates. We also reconstruct Hawaiian paleoprecipitation history by using pollen assemblage and peat humification degree analyses. Our results present two significant quartz deposition peaks during the Last Glacial Maximum (0.134 g/cm3) and between 2.6 and 0.4 kyr BP (0.044 g/cm3). Our moisture varaition results show that Hawaii was drier during the LGM than the Holocene. Therefore, this study suggests that Asian dust input in Hawaii has negative temporal correlations with wet deposition-controlling climates, but positive correlations with the drier glacial period in the late Quaternary.",

            "abstract": "Both meteorology and microphysics affect cloud formation and consequently their droplet distributions and shortwave reflectance. The Eastern Pacific Emitted Aerosol Cloud Experiment (EPEACE) and the Stratocumulus Observations of Los-Angeles Emissions Derived Aerosol-Droplets (SOLEDAD) studies provide detailed measurements in 6 case studies of both cloud thermodynamic properties and initial particle number distribution and composition, as well as the resulting cloud drop distribution and composition. This study uses simulations of a detailed chemical and microphysical aerosol-cloud parcel (ACP) model with explicit kinetic drop activation to reproduce the observed cloud droplet distribution and composition. Four of the cases examined had a sub-adiabatic lapse rate, which was shown to have fewer droplets due to decreased maximum supersaturation, lower LWC and higher cloud base height, consistent with previous findings. These detailed case studies provided measured thermodynamics and microphysics that constrained the simulated droplet size distribution sufficiently to match the droplet number within 6% and the size within 19% for 4 of the 6 cases, demonstrating “closure” or consistency of the measured composition with the measured CCN spectra and the inferred and modeled supersaturation. The contribution of organic components to droplet formation shows small effects on the droplet number and size in the 4 marine cases that had background aerosol conditions with varying amounts of coastal, ship or other non-biogenic sources. In contrast, the organic fraction and hygroscopicity increased the droplet number and size in the cases with generated smoke and cargo ship plumes that were freshly emitted and not yet internally mixed with the background particles. The simulation results show organic hygroscopicity causes small effects on cloud reflectivity (<0.7%) with the exception of the cargo ship plume and smoke plume which increased absolute cloud reflectivity fraction by 0.02 and 0.20 respectively. In addition, the ACP model simulations are compared to those from a numerical parameterization of cloud droplet activation that is suitable for GCMs and show droplet concentrations are comparable between the two methods.",

Traditionally, biomass of vegetation was measured with allometric-based approach. However, it is also time-consuming, labor-intensive, and extremely expensive to conduct over large scales and consequently is cost-prohibitive at the landscape scale. Furthermore, in semi-arid ecosystems characterized by vegetation with inconsistent growth morphologies (e.g., piñon-juniper woodlands), even ground-based conventional allometric approaches are often challenging to execute consistently across individuals and through time, increasing the difficulty of the required measurements and consequently the accuracy of the resulting products. To constrain the uncertainty associated with these campaigns, and to expand the extent of our measurement capability, we made repeat measurements of vegetation biomass in a semi-arid piñon-juniper woodland using structure-from-motion (SfM) techniques. We used high-spatial resolution overlapping aerial images and high-accuracy ground control points collected from both manned aircraft and multi-rotor UAS platforms, to generate digital surface model (DSM) for our experimental region. We extracted high-precision canopy volumes from the DSM and compared these to the vegetation allometric data, s to generate high precision canopy volume models. We used these models to predict the drivers of allometric equations for Pinus edulis and Juniperous monosperma (canopy height, diameter at breast height, and root collar diameter). Using this approach, we successfully accounted for the carbon stocks in standing live and standing dead vegetation across a 9 ha region, which contained 12.6 Mg / ha of standing dead biomass, with good agreement to our field plots. Here we present the initial results from an object oriented workflow which aims to automate the biomass estimation process of tree crown delineation and volume calculation, and partition standing biomass into live and dead pools, in a change detection context.",

It aims to test how different kinds of observations may improve system state estimations with a focus on inter-compartmental fluxes of matter and heat energy. To that goal a simulated virtual reality (VR) catchment is being generated as a tool to test data assimilation schemes for SLAS. The virtual reality overcomes the problem of data scarcity for the different components as subsurface, soil and atmosphere in the real world and provides the full system state as a basis for the evaluation of the effectiveness of data assimilation strategies.\nThe first version of the VR uses TerrSysMP - reduced to COSMO and CLM - to generate virtual observations such as satellite measurements, radar observations and meteorological station data. Currently VR simulations are available for a region encompassing the Neckar catchment located in south-west Germany with 1.1km horizontal resolution for the time period from 2007 to 2013.\nThis contribution focuses on the evaluation of satellite observations of the microwave emission at L-band as observed by the current satellite missions SMAP and SMOS.\nBy adjusting the Community Microwave Emission Model (CMEM) as a forward operator for the VR framework, a first set of virtual passive microwave observations is generated. SMAP and SMOS observations are simulated taking into account orbit characteristics, revisit times, and angular viewing geometries. The virtual observations will be statistically compared with available real observations to evaluate the degree of reality in terms of mean values and dynamic ranges. These comparisons will hint to systematic differences between TerrSysMP and reality, which need to be addressed by appropriate bias correction schemes or by adjusting parameters in the virtual reality itself. The presentation will discuss results from the statistical comparison oriented towards identifying potential deficiencies in the forward operator over specific areas i.e. frozen soil and dense vegetation to support the further development of the VR and the CMEM model.",

El Niño tends to increase late-spring precipitation in the southern Great Plains and this effect has intensified since 1980. There was a detectable effect of anthropogenic global warming in the physical processes that caused the persistent precipitation in May of 2015: Warming in the tropical Pacific acted to strengthen the teleconnection towards North America, modification of zonal wave-5 circulation that deepened the anomalous trough to the west of Texas, and an enhanced Great Plains low-level southerlies increasing moisture supply from the Gulf of Mexico. Attribution analysis using the CMIP5 single-forcing experiments and the CESM Large Ensemble Project indicated a significant increase in the El Niño- induced precipitation anomalies over Texas and Oklahoma when increases in the anthropogenic greenhouse gases were taken into account.

A methodology is devised to match the observed records of the flood events with the corresponding satellite and reference rainfall and runoff simulations. The flood events are sorted according to flood type (i.e. rain flood and flash flood) and basin’s antecedent conditions represented by the event’s runoff-to-precipitation ratio. The satellite precipitation products and runoff simulations are evaluated based on systematic and random error metrics applied on the matched event pairs and basin scale event properties (i.e. cumulative volume, timing and shape). Overall satellite-driven event runoff exhibits better error metrics than the satellite precipitation. Better error metrics are also shown for the rain flood events relative to the flash flood events. The event timing and shape from satellite-derived precipitation agreed well with the reference; the cumulative volume is mostly underestimated. In terms of error propagation, the study shows dampening effect in both systematic and random error components of the satellite-driven runoff time series relative to the satellite-retrieved event precipitation. This error dampening effect is less pronounced for the flash flood events and the rain flood events with high runoff coefficients. This study provides for a first time flood event characteristics of the satellite precipitation error propagation in flood modeling, which has implications on the Global Precipitation Measurement application in mountain flood hydrology.",

            "abstract": "Critical Zone science examines the structure and properties of the thin veneer that links surface properties to deep geology, at time scales of seconds to millennia. One of the fundamental premises of the US Critical Zone Observatories program is that CZOs should include some measurements made in common at all sites, as these common measurements will enable us to make stronger inferences about how the structure and function of the critical zone interact to drive key processes such as soil formation, stream flow generation, and nutrient export. Recent advances in real-time sensors provide new opportunities to address some fundamental questions about how hillslope soils and streams are linked. Data from the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory in Puerto Rico, for example, document a previously undescribed transition, or flipping, of stream and soil biogeochemistry in a tropical rain forest. Under typical conditions, soil moisture is high and soil oxygen content is often low, especially at depth. Streams, in contrast, are typically near oxygen saturation. Under severe drought, however, oxygen increases dramatically in soil air and declines to values that are well below saturation in streams. This flipping in redox conditions suggests that despite the strong hydrologic connection between hillslope and stream, gas dynamics and potentially solute dynamics are decoupled along the flow path. The international CZO community has the opportunity to develop a suite of sensor arrays to document soil air, groundwater chemistry, and stream water chemistry. Progress towards realizing the potential of these international networks to develop coherent sensor programs will be addressed based on the current status of sensor deployments in CZO networks in the US, China, and Europe.",

Previous work has focused primarily on the atmospheric angular-momentum budget and the effect of eddies via their transport of momentum. But midlatitude eddies are also associated with a substantial fraction of the poleward heat transport in the subtropics and midlatitudes, and examining the energy budget provides a different perspective on the effects of eddies on the zonal-mean circulation. Here, we contrast these two perspectives using idealized simulations of a Hadley circulation with and without the effects of large-scale eddies. In simulations run with a fixed distribution of sea-surface temperature, the Hadley circulation strength is relatively insensitive to the presence of eddies despite their strong influence on the angular-momentum budget. In slab-ocean simulations, on the other hand, large-scale eddies can act to amplify the Hadley circulation substantially. These results point to the importance of considering the energetic perspective in order to understand eddy influences on Earth's Hadley circulation. We discuss the implications of this conclusion for theories of monsoon onset as well as predictions of the behavior of the Hadley circulation in future climates.",

Recognizing the importance of a characteristic timescale to any definition of stability, our metrics will be focused scales from annual to multi-annual, capturing different aspects of stability. Our three measures of stability, in increasing order of temporal scale, are: (1) Ecosystem resistance, quantified as the degree to which the system maintains its mean state in response to a perturbation (drought), based on inter-annual variability in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). (2) An optimization approach, relevant to arid systems with pulse dynamics, that models vegetation structure and function based on a trade off between the ability to respond to resource availability and avoid stress. (3) Community resilience, measured as species turnover rate (β diversity). Understanding the nature of stability in structurally-diverse arid ecosystems, which are highly variable, yields theoretical insight which has practical implications.",

Recent work has explored whether discharge can be estimated from overhead imagery such as LANDSAT, using the pair of relationships known as hydraulic geometry that are also the basis for rating curves. High accuracy has not yet been achieved, because of the three observable variables (width, depth, velocity) only width is directly available from imagery. This results in an under-constrained problem that requires additional assumptions and suffers from high error. We here utilize high-resolution commercial imagery (e.g. WorldView 3) which allows measuring the water surface elevation through stereo processing. We also utilize an algorithm known as RiverEye that calculates surface velocities by solving an optical flow problem on passive tracers such as sediment load. Our technique thus provides measurements of all three hydraulic variables from the same observation. By observing under different flow conditions, we will be able to solve for the hydraulic geometry coefficients and enable fully remote measurement of river discharge.",

This has been argued using simulated declines in both the aridity index P/PET (by the present author among others) and the Palmer drought index, driven by warming-powered PET increases. However, this picture is at odds with the broad paleoclimate tenet that greenhouse eras in fact appear \"wet\" on land while cold intervals appear \"dry.\"\nHere, we show that the same GCMs which project widespread P/PET declines for the greenhouse future also project fairly widespread P/PET increases (i.e. \"wetting\") for the last glacial maximum (LGM), when CO2 was half present levels and snow and ice were extensive. Yet, global pollen and dust records of the LGM suggest mostly \"drier\"-looking vegetation patterns than today, as we also review here. Thus, either the GCMs' P and/or PET responses to past global change are flawed, or, P/PET change is not relevant for the vegetation response to CO2-driven climate change. Either way, this calls into question the ecological relevance of the above \"drying-out\" conclusions. We also show parallel results for the Palmer index, and investigate whether the P/PET results seem any more relevant for lakes and other abiotic wetness indicators than for vegetation.",

            "abstract": "Regions of low seismic velocities in the mantle and crust are commonly attributed to the presence of silicate melt or aqueous fluid. The elastic properties of silicate melts are typically modeled at high pressure using equations of state developed for crystalline materials. However, amorphous silicates spanning a wide range of composition and structure, i.e. SiO2 to MgSiO3, and including naturally occurring basalt compositions, exhibit a weak dependence of P-wave velocity on density in clear violation of Birch’s law, which governs the behavior of crystalline materials. This anomalous behavior is attributed to the high degree of flexibility of the silicate network on loading that may be a general property of naturally occurring silicate melts at crustal and upper mantle conditions. If this is the case, P-wave velocities for silicate melts will be significantly less pressure dependent than previously assumed, which in turn will enhance the effects of melt fraction on lowering aggregate mantle seismic velocities. Here we present VP calculated for partially molten mantle up to 20 GPa showing that melt fractions purported to explain VP reductions associated with the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary may be overestimated by 15%, while those reported for the transition zone may be overestimated to an even greater extent. Moreover, we predict that d lnVS/d lnVP (RSP) should vary little across low velocities regions within the upper mantle due solely to the presence of melt, but will be strongly influenced by how melt is distributed, consistent the work of [1]. Finally, RSP is found to be relatively insensitive to type of fluid present, contrary to conventional wisdom, and thus caution is warranted in attributing changes in RSP to either silicate melt or aqueous fluids. The implications of these findings for interpreting low velocity anomalies beneath hotspots and arcs (e.g. Iceland and Japan) will be discussed.\n[1] Takei, Y. (2002) JGR vol. 107",

Greatly clarifying the view of subsurface features, a completed volume for Planum Boreum provides new constraints on the nature and timing of emplacement of the northern polar deposits and their relationship to climate. The standard method of mapping subsurface features with single-pass 2-D radargrams has been very fruitful (see Brothers et al. 2015, JGR 120 in press, and references therein), but a full assessment of internal structures has been hindered by interfering off-nadir echoes from spiral troughs and other variable topography prevalent on both caps. By assembling the SHARAD radargrams into a volume and applying a 3-D imaging process (migration) borrowed from seismic processing techniques, we enhance the signal-to-noise ratio while repositioning the echoes to their proper locations, thereby unraveling the interference. As part of the process, we correct ionospheric distortions and delays of the radar echoes (Campbell et al. 2014, IEEE GRSL 11 #3). Interfaces painstakingly mapped in radargrams (e.g., the basal-unit surface, a buried chasma) are clearly visible in the 3-D volume, and new features are revealed. Structures may now be mapped through trough-rich regions, including a widespread sequence that provides corroborative evidence of recent ice ages (Smith et al. 2015, LPSC XLVI #2574). Distinctive radar signatures associated with known, partially buried craters also occur elsewhere in the volume but without surface expression. Presumably, these are fully buried craters that may provide a new means to estimate the age of the deposits. Preliminary work for Planum Australe demonstrates that the 3-D processing currently underway will illuminate deep structures that are broadly obfuscated in 2-D radargrams by a shallow scatterer (Campbell et al. 2015, LPSC XLVI #2366).",

            "abstract": "The boreal forest is one of the largest of the world’s biomes covering about 11% of its terrestrial surface and accounting for about 18% of its total terrestrial carbon pool. The timing of spring thaw, resulting in a lengthening or shortening of the growing season, has a strong influence on boreal forest productivity and associated carbon dioxide exchange with the atmosphere. A study of the influence of forest-cover type upon spring-thaw timing in the southern Canadian boreal forest has been undertaken using 18 years of soil temperature measurements at depths of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 cm. Soil was considered to be thawing during days of consistent near-zero soil temperature (daily mean of -0.5 to 0.5 °C and standard deviation of near zero). We compared the temporal pattern (first and last day) of soil thaw at three mature forest stands: trembling aspen, black spruce, and jack pine located in central Saskatchewan (~54°N, ~105°W). The soil freezing depth was deepest at the jack pine site (>100 cm) and shallowest at the black spruce site (<50 cm during most years). The mean last day of thaw at the 5-cm depth was earliest for the aspen site followed by jack pine and black spruce, respectively, with approximately 4 days difference among sites. Deeper in the soil profile, the trend of soil thaw remained in the same order, however, with much larger differences among sites: jack pine thawed 16 days later than aspen and black spruce thawed 18 days later than jack pine. Our analysis will relate the observed site differences in thaw timing to differences in site (soil and canopy) characteristics. Developing an improved understanding of the factors influencing the inter-annual and inter-site variability of soil thaw at these sites is required to appropriately characterize the ecological and hydrological responses of these sites to projected climate change.",

            "abstract": "During the last year, the Alaska and the Cascadia regions of the EarthScope Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) network were combined into a single management unit. While both remain distinct regions with their own challenges and engineering staff, every effort has been made to operate as a single team to improve efficiency and provide the highest possible data quality and uptime. Over the last several years a concerted effort has been made to work collaboratively with other institutions and stakeholders to defray ongoing costs by sharing staff and resources. UNAVCO currently operates four integrated GPS/seismic stations in collaboration with the Alaska Earthquake Center, eight with the Alaska Volcano Observatory, and three with the EarthScope TA. By the end of 2015, PBO and TA plan to install another 3 integrated and/or co-located geodetic and seismic systems. While most of these are designed around existing PBO stations, the 2014 installation at Middleton Island is a new station for both groups, providing PBO with an opportunity to expand geodetic data in Alaska. There were two major joint maintenance efforts in 2015:, the largest was a 5 day mission among PBO, AVO, and TA, which shared boat, helicopter, and staff on and around Augustine Volcano; the second, was a 10 day helicopter mission shared between AVO and PBO on Unimak Island. PBO Pacific Northwest is working closely with University of Washington to co-locate at least 9 Earthquake Early Warning Systems, which include the addition of strong motion sensors and high speed RT telemetry at PBO sites. The project is managed by University of Washington but UNAVCO is providing land contact information and infrastructure support. Summer 2015 upgrades include a complete overhaul of aging radio technology at two major networks and several small radio networks in Cascadia. The upgrades will increase reliability and enhance the speed of existing telemetry infrastructure and will continue through summer 2018.",

            "abstract": "Shales are of particular interest both for their energy production potential and their ability to provide seals for sequestered CO2. It is imperative to understand the processes that influence fracture properties in order to accurately predict subsurface behavior. In order to evaluate the coupled hydrologic and geometric changes to a fracture undergoing shear displacement, a novel apparatus was used to produce real-time shearing of fractured shale at elevated pressures. Intermittent computed tomography (CT) scans were performed during each shearing event and transmissivity measurements taken to characterize both the mechanical evolution as well as the hydrodynamic response of the fracture.   The initial fractures examined had small apertures and high resistance to flow, with most aperture values below the resolution of the CT scanner and low transmissivities. Initial shearing events, with total displacement less than two mm, minimally increased the aperture and increased the transmissivity. Further shearing resulted in fracture apertures that were large with pressure differentials across the core below the detection limit of the pressure measurement equipment. Flow models using the complex fracture geometries obtained from the CT scanning was performed to examine the micro-scale impacts of fracture evolution on the flow field that were not apparent in the bulk data. These results showed strong flow channelization within the larger aperture regions and showed that hydraulic aperture was significantly different than average mechanical apertures.   Fracture aperture evolution due to shearing was characterized with the resulting mechanical and hydrologic responses. Apertures showed increases after each shearing event. Additionally, this increased aperture resulted in increased transmissivity and subsequent increases in hydraulic aperture. Coupling the experimental work with computational analysis provided further insight into the evolution of fracture flow properties.",

Rice is one of the most produced grains in the world, mainly flooded-irrigated. However, determine the ET for large areas of irrigated rice is a limiting factor due to the high cost of equipment and monitoring of the site. The utilization of data from remote sensing is an important tool for monitoring large areas and are of fundamental importance for the description of the behavior the ET estimate. The aim of this study is to evaluate the ET (MOD16) using Eddy Covariance flux tower-derived ET for a rice paddy in the Paraíso do Sul - Brazil. The data used in this study cover the period from July 2003 to July 2004, with the cultivated rice during the months from November to April. The comparison between ET-MODIS the central pixel with ET observed showed statistical values of RMSE = 8.83, PBIAS -25.8 and R2 = 0.5. For the pixels with same coverage vegetation were also extracted the average values of ET-MODIS and compared with data flux tower, resulting in RSME = 7.68, = -31.3 PBIAS and R2 = 0.63. Although the average of pixels with the same vegetation present greater underestimation of ET compared the observed, showed lower RMSE and higher R2. Much of this difference is associated to the period from July 2003 to January 2004, wherein the months January to April the ET-MODIS central pixel overestimates the observed data. However, in general mode we observed that MOD16 product shows similar behavior ET observed.",

            "abstract": "Chicxulub formed 66 Ma ago by an asteroid impact on the Yucatan carbonate platform, southern Gulf of Mexico. Impact produced a 200 km diameter crater, platform fracturing, deformation and ejecta emplacement. Carbonate sedimentation restarted and crater was covered by up to 1 km of sediments. Drilling programs have sampled the Paleogene sediments, which record the changing sedimentation processes in the impact basin and platform. Here, results of a study of the Paleocene-Eocene sediments cored in the Santa Elena borehole are used to characterize the K/Pg and PETM. The borehole reached a depth of 504 m and was continuously cored, sampling the post-impact sediments and impact breccias, with contact at 332 m. For this study, we analyzed the section from ~230 to ~340 m, corresponding to the upper breccias and Paleocene-Eocene sediments. The lithological column, constructed from macroscopic and thin-section petrographic analyses, is composed of limestones and dolomitized limestones with several thin clay layers. Breccias are melt and basement clast rich, described as a suevitic unit. Section is further investigated using paleomagnetic, rock magnetic, X-ray fluorescence geochemical and stable isotope analyses. Magnetic polarities define a sequence of reverse to normal, which correlate to the geomagnetic polarity time scale from chrons 29r to 26r. The d13 C values in the first 20 m interval range from 1.2 to 3.5 %0 and d18 O values range from -1.4 to -4.8 %0. Isotope values show variation trends that correlate with the marine carbon and oxygen isotope patterns for the K-Pg boundary and early Paleocene. Positive carbon isotopes suggest relatively high productivity, with apparent recovery following the K-Pg extinction event. Geochemical data define characteristic trends, with Si decreasing gradually from high values in the suevites, low contents in Paleocene sediments with intervals of higher variability and then increased values likely marking the PETM. Variation trends are similar in other elements like Fe, Ti, K and Al, recording changing conditions in the platform. Ca shows the opposite trend, with low values in the suevites, higher values in Paleocene carbonates and lower values at PETM. Variations are interpreted in terms of the impact, hydrothermal activity, platform carbonate deposition and the PETM.",

            "abstract": "The 900-instrument Mount St. Helens nodal array recorded continuous data for approximately two weeks in the summer of 2014 and provides a remarkable opportunity to interrogate the structure beneath an active arc volcano. Two separate imaging techniques are applied to constrain both the distribution of microseismicity and subsurface velocity structure.\nReverse-time source imaging is applied to the 10 km3 region beneath the volcanic edifice where most of cataloged seismicity occurred during the experiment. These efforts resulted in an order of magnitude increase in earthquake detections over the normal monitoring operations of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network. Earthquake locations resolve a narrow, ≤1 km wide, vertical lineament of seismicity that extends from the surface to 4 km depth directly beneath the summit crater, consistent with the historical event distribution of Waite and Moran[2009]. This feature is interpreted as a fracture network that acts as a conduit connecting an underlying magma chamber to the surface.\nMoho imaging is achieved using the near-offset (< 30 km) PmP phase generated by the iMUSH active source shots that occurred during the deployment. The PmP arrivals are enhanced using short-term-average over long-term-average processing and then migrated using a 3D velocity model. The observed Moho depths range from 35-40 km with a slight eastward deepening across the Mt St Helens fracture zone. Significant variations are observed in the Moho reflectivity. Large amplitude PmP energy is observed in shots originating from the north and east whereas shots from the south-west display little-to-no PmP energy. The region above the reflective Moho is approximately coincident with areas displaying reduced lower-crustal velocities in the initial iMUSH tomography models and may therefore contain fluids and/or partial melt.\nAdditional evidence for lower crustal fluids in this region is provided by deep-long-period (DLP) events which have historically been observed east of the crater and below ~20 km depth [Nichols et al., 2011]. Two DLP events were observed during the nodal deployment [Han and Vidale, this meeting] and are located using the source imaging approach applied to the S-wave coda envelopes. Both events locate at 25-45 km depth, indicating that they occurred at or near the Moho interface.",

REASON is an active dual-frequency (9/60 MHz) instrument led by the University of Texas Institute for Geophysics (UTIG). It is designed to achieve multi-disciplinary measurements to investigate subsurface waters and the ice shell structure (Sounding), the surface elevation and tides (Altimetry), the surface physical properties (Reflectometry), and the ionospheric environment (Plasma/Particles). We will present the concepts behind the “Reflectometry” and “Plasma/Particles” measurements, demonstrate their efficiency with planetary analogs, and anticipate their capabilities for the exploration of Europa. We will also highlight the potential synergies with other instruments selected for the Europa mission payload.\nThe “Reflectometry” compares the statistical behavior of the surface echo amplitudes with theoretical stochastic models to separate the reflected and scattered contributions to the signal. Once those two components are deduced they are used in a backscattering model to invert surface properties such as roughness, density, and/or impurity load. “Reflectometry” measurements will contribute to the statistical characterization of the surface over ~ 10-km-long areas with a ~ 10 m skin depth for geological investigation, near-surface brine detection, plume-deposited snow characterization, and landing site reconnaissance. The “Plasma/Particles” measurement relies on the dispersive signal delays induced by the ionospheric content integrated along the radio propagation path. Correction of this delay with existing techniques provides the total electron content below the spacecraft. “Plasma/Particles” measurements will constrain the ionosphere’s shape and variability along the acquisition track and might detect transient plume-induced ionosphere when active.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - IntraplateDeformationDueToTheMotionOfPlatesOverANonspericalEarth.pdf\nThe central tenet of plate tectonics is that the plates are rigid. Not long after the acceptance of plate tectonics, however, it was recognized that the motion of plates over a non-spherical Earth should cause intraplate deformation [McKenzie, 1972; Turcotte & Oxburgh, 1974]. Even so, no firm connection between hypothesized deformation and observed deformation has yet been made. An alternative cause of intraplate deformation is the horizontal contraction of lithosphere as it cools with age [Collette, 1974]. The rate of horizontal thermal contraction decreases as ~1/age and the resulting intraplate deformation should be large enough to cause observed plate circuit non-closures [Kumar & Gordon, 2009]. Strain rates thus obtained for 0 Ma-old, 0.1 Ma-old, 1 Ma-old, and 10 Ma-old oceanic lithosphere respectively are 2 × 10-2 Ma-1 (5 × 10-16 s-1), 8 × 10-3 s-1 (3 × 10-16 s-1), 1.5 × 10-3 Ma-1 (5 × 10-17 s-1), 2 × 10-4 Ma-1 (5 × 10-18 s-1) [Mishra & Gordon, 2015]. Across the Pacific Plate, such strains sum to intraplate relative velocities of up to ≈2 mm yr-1 [Kreemer & Gordon, 2014].Here we attempt to quantify rates of intraplate strain due to motion of plates over a nonspherical Earth to compare with strain rates due to horizontal contraction and due to observed intraplate deformation. We determine rates of northward motion of lithosphere using the SKS-MORVEL set of plate angular velocities relative to the deep mantle [Zheng et al., 2014]. Following Turcotte [1974], we use the approximation of a spherical Earth whose radius of curvature changes with the latitudinal motion of the plate. We considered two end-member cases—no radial strain and no change in thickness—in our calculations. We estimate average strain rates for the twenty-five major plates ranging from ~10-11 to 10-4 Ma-1 (3 × 10-25 to 3 × 10-18 s-1). For the Pacific Plate, we estimate strain rates that approach or exceed those due to thermal contraction only in the oldest lithosphere, where strain rates from thermal contraction are at a minimum. Further, for the Australia Plate, where anomalously high strain rates of ~10-7 to 10-3 Ma-1 (3 × 10-21 to 3 × 10-17 s-1) have been estimated from seismic moment release [Braun et al., 2009], we estimate strain rates due to nonsphericity of ~10-3 Ma-1 (3 × 10-17 s-1), consistent with the upper limits to values found from seismic strain rate.",

The higher spatial resolution is particularly as important as the spectral resolution for crop monitoring. It is important to develop data integration techniques between field or airborne hyperspectral data with spaceborne broad band multispectral images for plant productivity monitoring. To investigate varying rootstock and irrigation interactions, different irrigation treatments are implemented in a vineyard experimental site either i) unirrigated ii) full replacement of evapotranspiration (ET) iii) irrigated at 50 % of the potential ET. In summer 2014, we collected leaf and canopy spectra of the vineyard using field spectroscopy along with other plant physiological and nutritional variables. In this contribution, we integrate the field spectra and the spectral wavelengths of WorldView-2 to develop a predictive model for plant productivity,i.e., fruit quality and yield. First, we upscale field and canopy spectra to WorldView-2 spectral bands using radiative transfer simulations (e.g., MODTRAN). Then we develop remote sensing techniques to quantify plant productivity in different scenarios water stress by identifying the most effective and sensitive wavelengths, and indices that are capable of early detection of plant health and estimation of crop nutrient status. Finally we present predictive models developed from partial least square regression (PLSR) for plant productivity using spectral wavelengths and indices derived from integrated field and satellite remote sensing data.",

            "abstract": "A growing body of evidence suggests contributions to runoff from ephemeral channels during events can exhibit significant control over water quality in higher order streams. Furthermore, field observations from a steep Appalachian catchment influenced by human activity suggest these disturbed ephemeral drainages exhibit significant control over turbidity, water temperature, and conductivity levels downstream. High turbidity during stormflow is a water quality problem in many areas of the Southern Appalachians. However, upland ephemeral channels are not included in the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act. This offers little recourse if their contributions degrade the water quality of larger-scale streams and highlights the need for robust evidence of the potential impacts of ephemeral drainages. The aim of this research is to isolate the contribution of a disturbed ephemeral drainage by diverting its flow from the study stream network. Spatially and temporally distributed stream water samples taken during storms, when the channel is diverted or allowed to flow normally, will allow us to assess its contribution. In this poster, we present initial spatial and temporal streamwater chemistry and turbidity data as well as a detailed description of the stream network, study design, and diversion construction. We anticipate the findings of this study will be relevant to describing the environmental impact of disturbed ephemeral channels and to describing their potential influence on other water chemistry parameters downstream.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic Ocean is expected to transition into a seasonally ice-free state by mid-century, enhancing Arctic warming and leading to substantial ecological and socio-economic challenges across the Arctic region. It has been proposed that artificially increasing high latitude ocean albedo could restore sea ice, but the climate impacts of such a strategy have not been previously explored. Motivated by this, we investigate the impacts of idealized high latitude ocean albedo changes on Arctic sea ice restoration and climate.\nIn our simulated 4xCO2 climate, imposing surface albedo alterations over the Arctic Ocean leads to partial sea ice recovery and a modest reduction in Arctic warming. With the most extreme ocean albedo changes, imposed over the area 70°–90°N, September sea ice cover stabilizes at ~40% of its preindustrial value (compared to ~3% without imposed albedo modifications).This is accompanied by an annual mean Arctic surface temperature decrease of ~2 °C but no substantial global mean temperature decrease. Imposed albedo changes and sea ice recovery alter climate outside the Arctic region too, affecting precipitation distribution over parts of the continental United States and Northeastern Pacific. For example, following sea ice recovery, wetter and milder winter conditions are present in the Southwest United States while the East Coast experiences cooling.\nWhile our model results imply that ocean albedo alteration does not appear to be an effective way of offsetting the overall effects of CO2 induced global warming or achieving full sea ice recovery, we do not exclude that it may represent a possible approach for small-scale (e.g. individual bay or estuary) sea ice restoration.",

            "abstract": "The Elk Creek carbonatite complex (ECCC) is a large Early Cambrian carbonatite-alkaline syenite complex located in SE Nebraska (USA). The carbonatite and related rocks are buried by more than 200 m of Pennsylvanian marine sedimentary rocks and Quaternary till. The pre-Pennsylvanian sub-crop is crudely circular in plan-view and exceeds 30 km2, making it one of the larger carbonatite complexes in North America. The rocks of the complex were intruded in Precambrian granite and gneiss on the eastern margin of the Mid-Continent rift where it has been offset by one of a series of southeasterly trending structures. The primary rock type in the ECCC is dolomite carbonatite. The dolomite carbonatite ranges from fine-grained flow-banded dolomite to a coarse-grained rock comprising large prismatic dolomite crystals. The central portion of the complex comprises a pipe-like intrusion of magnetite dolomite carbonatite and magnetite dolomite carbonatite breccia. Magnetite dolomite carbonatite is typically fine-grained and contains angular or rounded elongate fragments of dolomite carbonatite. Fragments of magnetite dolomite carbonatite are also included in dolomite carbonatite and other carbonatite rocks in the complex. Emplacement of a discreet pulse of reduced, iron-rich carbonatite magma was, therefore, a likely early event in the evolution of the ECCC. The magnetite is altered locally to hematite and other iron oxides. The oxidation ranges from a dusting of hematite to pervasive alteration to hematite and ferric oxyhydroxides and occurs to depths as much as 630 m below the modern land surface. Other volumetrically important rock types include apatite dolomite carbonatite and barite dolomite carbonatite. Both of these rock types are localized largely along fractures, occur later in the intrusive sequence, and may reflect exsolution of phosphates and sulfates with decreasing temperatures. The magnetite dolomite carbonatite hosts significant pyrochlore mineralization. Microprobe analyses of pyrochlore can be used to characterize three generations of mineralization. The first generation comprises coarse Ta-rich pyrochlore. The second and third generations are near stoichiometric Nb-pyrochlore and Ti-enriched pyrochlore. Mineral grain size decreases from the first to the third generation.",

            "abstract": "Although historically resistant to invasion and type-conversion, there are strong indications that native shrublands in southern California are often increasingly degraded, and in many cases have begun transitioning into herbaceous grasslands. Chaparral shrublands in particular, which are characterized by a closed evergreen canopy composed of multiple species, represent a critical habitat for many native fauna and also play a significant role in soil stabilization and water partitioning throughout much of Southern California. However, in response to interactive global changes, these ecosystems may be transitioning into invasive-dominated deciduous grasslands. Through the use of a novel, phenology-driven vegetation classification, we examine the extent of such type-conversions through analysis of increases in seasonal changes (i.e. deciduousness).\nEstimates of phenological variation in greenness (NDVI) developed through analysis of Landsat 4-8 imagery were calibrated to observed seasonal NDVI variation as developed through high-resolution ground-based imagery platforms to develop estimates in the change of percent cover by evergreen shrubs and drought-deciduous herbs and grasses. This study evaluates long-term changes in invasive cover from 1985 through 2011. These analyses indicate substantial type-conversion of native chaparral over this period, as with differences in local elevation representing the dominant factor in the degree of long-term type-conversion at broad landscape-scales, with high elevation sites being the least susceptible to type conversion from chaparral to invaded grassland.",

Over a dozen large so-called postglacial faults (PGF) have been found, mainly using aerial photogrammetry, trenching, and recognition of numerous paleolandslides in the vicinity of the faults (e.g. Lagerbäck & Sundh 2008). Recent LiDAR-based mapping led to the extension of known PGFs, the discovery of new segments of existing PGFs, and a number of new suspected PGFs (Smith et al. 2014; Mikko et al. 2015).\nThe PGFs in Fennoscandia occur within 14-25°E and 61-69°N; the majority are within Swedish territory. PGFs generally are prominent features, up to 155 km in length and 30 m maximum surface offset. The most intense microseismic activity in Sweden occurs near PGFs. The seismogenic zone of the longest known PGF (Pärvie fault zone, PFZ) extends to ≈40 km depth. From fault geometry and earthquake scaling relations, the paleomagnitude of PFZ is estimated to 8.0±0.3 (Lindblom et al. 2015).\nThe new high-resolution LiDAR-derived elevation model of Sweden offers an unprecedented opportunity to constrain the surface geometry of the PGFs. The objective is to reach more detailed knowledge of the surface offset across their scarps. This distribution provides a one-dimensional view of the slip distribution during the inferred paleorupture. The second objective is to analyze the pattern of vertical displacement of the hanging wall, to obtain a two-dimensional view of the displaced area that is linked to the fault geometry at depth. The anticipated results will further constrain the paleomagnitude of PGFs and will be incorporated into future modeling efforts to investigate the nature of PGFs.\n",

            "abstract": "Volcanic and hydrothermal systems are generally characterized by persistent, low-amplitude seismic “noise” with no clear onset or end. Outside of active eruptions and earthquakes, which tend to occur only a small fraction of the time, seismic records and spectrograms from these systems are dominated by long-duration “noise” (typically around 1-5Hz) generated by ongoing processes in the systems’ subsurface. Although it has been shown that these low-amplitude signals can represent a series of overlapping low-magnitude displacements related to fluid and volatile movement at depth, because of their “noisy” properties compared to typical active or earthquake sources they are difficult to image using traditional seismic techniques (i.e. phase-picking). In this study we present results from applying a new ambient noise back-projection technique to improve seismic source imaging of diffuse signals found in volcanic and hydrothermal systems. Using this new method we show how the distribution of all seismic sources – particularly sources associated with volcanic tremor – evolves during a proposed intrusion in early June 2010 at Sierra Negra Volcano on the Galápagos Archipelago off the coast of Ecuador. We use a known velocity model for the region (Tepp et al., 2014) to correlate and back-project seismic signals from all available receiver-pairs to potential subsurface source locations assuming bending raypaths and accounting for topography. We generate 4D time-lapsed images of the source field around Sierra Negra before, during and after the proposed intrusion and compare the consistency of our observations with previously identified seismic event locations and tomography results from the same time period. Preliminary results from applying the technique to a dense grid of geophones surrounding a periodically erupting geyser at El Tatio Geyser Field in northern Chile (>2000 eruptions recorded) will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "Mounting evidence suggests that noble gases are transported from Earth’s surface reservoirs back into the mantle during subduction of oceanic lithosphere [e.g. 1]. Recent experiments [2] show that noble gases are relatively soluble in ring-structured minerals, such as amphibole, highlighting the potential for hydrated oceanic crust to control the input flux of noble gases into subduction zones. However, it is unclear whether the return flux of noble gases is controlled by mineral solubility alone or whether diffusive loss during subduction is important. Here, we address this issue by combining the solubility data with recently acquired He and Ne [3], and previously published Ar [4], diffusivity measurements in amphibole to parameterize a diffusion-solubility model, simulating noble gas fractionation during subduction. The model predicts that the light noble gases, He and Ne, are efficiently extracted from hot slabs at depths shallower than 50 km, whereas Ar and, by implication, Kr and Xe are retained in the slab past sub-arc depths. Conversely, cold slabs with low porosity volume fractions have the potential to recycle Ne. Our modelling shows that the Ne/Ar elemental ratio of slab minerals is strongly influenced by thermal regime and grain boundary porosity. We test these predictions against a new laser fusion dataset of Ne and Ar isotopic measurements in high-pressure minerals from a suite of exhumed high-pressure rocks that have experienced varying degrees of subduction and dehydration.

The data obtained during joint NST-IRIS observations on 30 and 31 in July 2014. We observed two representative events on both days. The first one was a relatively weak Ellerman bomb occurred around 19:20 UT on 30 July 2014. IRIS observed this event by sit-and-stare mode thus we analyzed high cadence spectral data and slit-jaw data simultaneously. We found that this event was a hot explosion that occurred by magnetic reconnection in the lower atmosphere of the Sun. The second event was quite strong Ellerman bomb (20:20 UT on 31 July 2014) that is well observed by NST FISS (Fast Imaging Solar Spectrograph), while there was no IRIS spectral data. We had IRIS slit-jaw data only. The Ellerman bomb was clearly coincident with the IRIS brightening at the same location. Since the Ellerman bombs are usually believed to occur in the photosphere with no coronal emission, it should be explained its higher atmospheric emission in IRIS data. We will present the result of simultaneous observations by IRIS and NST instruments and discuss physical connection between Ellerman bombs and IRIS brightenings.",

            "abstract": "Here we present an overview of inter-related programs designed to promote leadership and professional development among graduate students and early career scientists. In a very short time, these young scientists have developed into an impressive cohort of leaders.\nProposal Writing. The EDventures model combines proposal-writing training with the incentive of seed money. Rather than providing training a priori, the EDventures model encourages students and post-docs to write a proposal based on guidelines provided. Training occurs during a two-stage review stage: proposers respond to panel reviews and resubmit their proposal within a single review cycle. EDventures alumni self-report statistically significant confidence gains on all questions posed. Their subsequent proposal success is envious: of the 12 proposals submitted by program alumni to NSF, 50% were funded. (Wood Charlson & Bruno, in press; cmore.soest.hawaii.edu/education/edventures.htm)\nMentoring. The C-MORE Scholars and SOEST Maile Mentoring Bridgeprograms give graduate students the opportunity to serve as research mentors and non-research mentors, respectively, to undergraduates. Both programs aim to develop a \"majority-minority\" scientist network, where Native Hawaiians and other underrepresented students receive professional development training and personal support through one-on-one mentoring relationships (Gibson and Bruno, 2012; http://cmore.soest.hawaii.edu/scholars; http://maile.soest.hawaii.edu).\nOutreach & Science Communication. Ocean FEST (Families Exploring Science Together), Ocean TECH (Technology Explores Career Horizons) and the Kapiolani Community College summer bridge program provide opportunities for graduate students and post-docs to design and deliver outreach activities, lead field trips, communicate their research, and organize events (Wiener et al, 2011, Bruno & Wren, 2014; http://oceanfest.soest.hawaii.edu; http://oceantech.soest.hawaii.edu)\nProfessional Development Course. In this career-focused graduate seminar, students and post-docs explore a range of career paths, identify and build skills, prepare application materials, and develop a class project around their professional development interests (Guannel et al, 2014).",

            "abstract": "The accurate determination of the Field Line Resonance (FLR) frequency of a resonating geomagnetic field line is necessary for the remote monitoring of the plasmaspheric mass density during geomagnetic storms and quiet times alike. Under certain assumptions the plasmaspheric mass density at the equator is inversely proportional to the square of the FLR frequency. The most common techniques to determine the FLR frequency from ground magnetometer measurements are the amplitude ratio and phase difference techniques, both based on geomagnetic field measurements at two latitudinally separated ground stations. Previously developed automated techniques have used statistical methods to pinpoint the FLR frequency using the amplitude ratio and phase difference calculations. We now introduce a physics-based automated technique that can reproduce the resonant wave characteristics from the two ground station data, and from those determine the FLR frequency. The advantage of the new technique, besides moving away from ambiguous statistical manipulations of the ground data, is the estimation of physically determined errors of the FLR frequency, which can yield physically determined errors of the equatorial plasmaspheric mass density. We present preliminary results of the new technique calculations, and test it using data from the new Inner-Magnetospheric Array for Geospace Science (iMAGS) ground magnetometer chain along the coast of Chile and the east coast of the United States. We compare the results with the results of previously published statistical automated techniques.",

Sea level rise, along with tectonic, sediment compaction/load and groundwater extraction induced land uplift/subsidence, have\nsignificantly exacerbated these risks and Bangladesh’s coastal vulnerability.

Chorus wave intensity is enhanced at the region where the field aligned component Bz of ULF wave is antiparallel to the background magnetic field, and vice verse.

            "abstract": "Modern microbialites occur in a variety of shallow aquatic environments and are often spatially co-located with zones of groundwater discharge. Here we show that feedbacks between groundwater inflow to the aquatic environment and microbial productivity result in the self-organization of modern thrombolitic microbialites. Groundwater springs emerge directly through thrombolites in Lake Clifton, Western Australia, a site with large salinity and temperature contrasts between groundwater and surface water. The thrombolites are highly permeable compared to nearby sandy sediments and spring flow occurs through an interconnected network of conduits within the thrombolite structure. Spring flow reduces osmotic stress and increases nutrient fluxes for microbial mats covering the thrombolites, which otherwise form in a hypersaline and oligotrophic environment. Microbial mats lithify into a permeable structure through which spring flow can be maintained as additional material accretes and the thrombolites grow upward. Thus favorable growth conditions are sustained for microbial communities. Microbialites are some of the oldest organosedimentary structures evidencing life on Earth. If this model of thrombolite formation applies broadly, then fossil thrombolites are perhaps the earliest examples of microbial communities facilitating their survival through the creation of a solid structure.",

            "abstract": "Perchlorate salts, discovered in the Martian regolith at multiple landing sites, may provide pathways for liquid water stability on current Mars. It has previously been assumed that if perchlorate brines form in the Martian regolith via melting or deliquescence, they would be present only briefly because efflorescence into a crystal or freezing to ice would soon occur. Here, we used a Raman microscope to study the temperature and relative humidity (RH) conditions at which magnesium perchlorate brine will form ice. Although ice is thermodynamically predicted to form whenever the saturation with respect to ice (Sice) is greater than or equal to 1, ice formation by perchlorate brines did not occur until elevated Sice values were reached: Sice= 1.17, 1.29, and 1.25 at temperatures of 218 K, 230.5 K, and 244 K, respectively. If a magnesium perchlorate particle was allowed to deliquesce completely prior to experiencing ice supersaturation, the extent of supercooling was increased even further. These high supersaturation values imply perchlorate brines can exist over a wider range of conditions than previously believed. From these experiments it has been found that magnesium perchlorate exhibits supercooling well into the previous theoretical ice region of the stability diagram and that liquid brines on Mars could potentially exist for up to two additional hours per sol. This supercooling of magnesium perchlorate will help with the exploration of Mars by the Mars 2020 spacecraft by helping to understand the phase and duration of water existing in the Martian subsurface.",

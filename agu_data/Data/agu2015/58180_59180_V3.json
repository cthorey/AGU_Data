            "abstract": "Heavy precipitation is a major hazard over Europe. It is well established that climate model projections indicate a tendency towards more extreme daily rainfall events. It is still uncertain, however, how this changing intensity translates at the sub-daily time scales. The main goal of the present study is to examine possible differences in projected changes in intense precipitation events over Europe at the daily and sub-daily (3-hourly) time scales using a state-of-the-art climate model. The focus will be on one Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP8.5), considered as illustrative of a high rate of increase in greenhouse gas concentrations over this century. There are statistically significant differences in intense precipitation projections (up to 40%) when comparing the results at the daily and sub-daily time scales. Over north-eastern Europe, projected precipitation intensification at the 3-hour scale is lower than at the daily scale. On the other hand, Spain and the western seaboard exhibit an opposite behaviour, with stronger intensification at the 3-hour scale rather than daily scale. While the mean properties of the precipitation distributions are independent of the analysed frequency, projected precipitation intensification exhibits regional differences. This finding has implications on the extrapolation of impacts of intense precipitation events, given the daily time scale the analyses are usually performed at.",

            "abstract": "Forward and inverse modelling of dripwater chemistry is a fast-developing area in speleothem science. Such approaches can incorporate theoretical, parameterized or observed relationships between forcing factors and water composition, but at the heart is mass balance: a fundamental principle that provides important constraints. Mass balance has been used in speleothem studies to trace the evolution of dissolved inorganic carbon and carbon isotopes from soil to cave, and to characterize the existence and quantification of prior calcite precipitation (PCP) based on ratios of Mg and Sr to Ca. PCP effects can dominate slow drips, whereas fast drips are more likely to show a residual variability linked to soil-biomass processes.\nA possible configuration of a more complete mass balance model is illustrated in the figure. Even in humid temperate climates, evapotranspiration can be 50% of total atmospheric precipitation leading to substantially raised salt contents and there can be significant exchange with biomass. In more arid settings, at least seasonal soil storage of salts is likely. Golgotha Cave in SW Australia is in a Mediterranean climate with a strong summer soil moisture deficit. The land surface is forested leading to large ion fluxes related to vegetation. There are also periodic disturbances related to fire. Mass balance approaches have been applied to an 8-year monitoring record. Inter-annual trends of elements coprecipitated in speleothems from fast drips are predicted to be dominated by biomass effects.",

            "abstract": "Explosive volcanic eruptions are among the most powerful sources of infrasound observed on earth, with recordings routinely made at ranges of hundreds to thousands of kilometers. These eruptions can also inject large volumes of ash into heavily travelled aviation corridors, thus posing a significant societal and economic hazard. Detecting and counting the global occurrence of explosive volcanism helps with progress toward several goals in earth sciences and has direct applications in volcanic hazard mitigation. This project aims to build a quantitative catalog of global explosive volcanic activity using the International Monitoring System (IMS) infrasound network. We are developing methodologies to search systematically through IMS infrasound array detection bulletins to identify signals of volcanic origin. We combine infrasound signal association and source location using a brute-force, grid-search, cross-bearings approach. The algorithm corrects for a background prior rate of coherent infrasound signals in a global grid. When volcanic signals are identified, we extract metrics such as location, origin time, acoustic intensity, signal duration, and frequency content, compiling the results into a catalog. We are testing and validating our method on several well-known case studies, including the 2009 eruption of Sarychev Peak, Kuriles, the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull, Iceland, and the 2015 eruption of Calbuco, Chile. This work represents a step toward the goal of integrating IMS data products into global volcanic eruption early warning and notification systems. Additionally, a better characterization of volcanic signal detection helps improve understanding of operational event detection, discrimination, and association capabilities of the IMS network.",

            "abstract": "Numerical models of tsunami inundation and sedimentation can provide useful insights into the dynamics of palaeotsunamis. We applied a coupled field data and numerical modelling approach for the AD1755 tsunami, the most destructive tsunami to affect the Atlantic coast of Europe in historical times. At Salgados, a lowland on the south coast of Portugal, tsunami deposits from AD1755 mostly consist of massive or normally-graded, landward thinning layers of shell-rich sand with an erosive base within the mud-dominated lowlands. Landward of the foredune, the AD1755 deposit is roughly 10cm thick and thins in the landward and alongshore directions. It is possible to ascribe the sediment source of this deposit to the dune and/or beach based on mineralogical and grain-size comparisons with modern surface samples. The present dune crest height is 6 m above MSL (mean sea level) near the seasonally-closed inlet of the lagoon, and rises alongshore towards the west up to 17m above MSL. From the combination of the spatial distribution of the deposit thickness landward of the sloping dune, and GPR data, which shows an erosional surface at approximately 6m above MSL, we infer that the maximum tsunami water level at the coast was between 6 and 10m. Regional tsunami historical records, however, suggest higher heights, up to 12m above MSL at the coast.\nWe simulated tsunami inundation and sediment transport using Delft3D to examine these discrepancies. A 1D cross shore model was used to test flow height controls on deposit thickness and also to identify the sediment source of the AD1755 deposit. Four possible sediment sources were tested (nearshore, beach, dune and lagoon) using synthetic, long-period waves to simulate the AD1755 tsunami. The combination of geological studies with numerical modeling of inundation and sediment transport produces a better description of the AD1755 tsunami and its effects in coastal areas in the Algarve that will contribute to better hazard assessments.",

The magnitude and duration of the volcanic cloud on Earth's temperatures, circulation, clouds, and stratospheric ozone is strongly affected by the microphysical properties of the aerosol size distribution, which can evolve in complex ways. This presentation will cover the impacts and uncertainties associated with microphysical aerosol measurements and modeling of the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, and valuable future measurements after the next large volcanic eruption. These additional measurements can help improve our understanding of stratospheric processes as well as possible consequences of large volcanic eruptions and hypothetical geoengineering scenarios on radiative forcing and chemistry.",

            "abstract": "There are 5 instruments currently operating in space with capability to measure stratospheric aerosols. Two of these are lidar backscatter instruments (CALIOP & ISS/CATS) that provide high vertical resolution, day/night coverage, and polarization information to separate ice clouds from sulfate aerosols. Two are limb scattering instruments (OSIRIS & OMPS-LP) with high sensitivity to aerosols and provide extensive spatial coverage of the sunlit globe. And a Canadian solar occultation instrument (ACE-MAESTRO) measures aerosol extinction twice per orbit. Next year we are expecting the launch of the SAGE III instrument on ISS with capability to measure aerosol extinction and Angstrom Exponent (AE) at multiple wavelengths by solar and lunar occultation techniques. It also has limb scattering capability to provide spatial coverage between solar occultations. The 51.6˚ inclination of the ISS orbit will allow SAGE III to measure aerosol scattering across the gobe for a wide range of scattering angles. Therefore, ISS SAGE III has the capability to provide vertically resolved information about a wide variety of aerosol properties, potentially including aerosol extinction, size distribution, refractive index, and particle shape parameters, similar to the one provided by the ground-based almucantar technique. In our talk we will focus primarily on the synergy between the OMPS LP instrument that has been flying on the Suomi NPP satellite since October 2011 and ISS SAGE III. We will show how these measurements can be combined together to capture spatial and temporal evolution of aerosols and ozone in large volcanic plumes to validate models and to support field campaigns.",

            "abstract": "MERRA-2 is NASA's latest reanalysis for the satellite era (1980-present) using GEOS-5 earth system model. This project focuses on historical analyses of the hydrological cycle on a broad range of weather and climate time scales, and includes interactive aerosols for the entire period. MERRA-2 provides several improvements over its predecessor MERRA reanalysis, including: 1) modern satellite observing systems not available with MERRA, 2) reduction in discontinuities associated with a changing observing system, and 3) reduced biases and imbalances in the hydrologic cycle. As another step towards an integrated Earth System Analysis (IESA), MERRA-2 includes for the first time aerosols in a reanalysis, improves the representation of stratospheric ozone, and better characterizes cryospheric processes.\nIn this talk we will present results relating to the introduction of aerosols in MERRA-2. The assimilation of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) in GEOS-5 involves very careful cloud screening and homogenization of the observing system by means of a Neural Net scheme that translates MODIS and AVHRR radiances into AERONET calibrated AOD. The system also assimilates MISR and AERONET AOD observations. For the EOS period (2000-present) GEOS-5 is driven by daily biomass burning emissions derived from MODIS fire radiative power retrievals using the so-called QFED emissions. Historical emissions are calibrated as to minimize discontinuities the EOS/pre-EOS boundaries. MERRA-2 aerosols are also driven by historical anthropogenic and volcanic emissions.\nWe will present a summary of our efforts to validate the MERRA-2 aerosols. The GEOS-5 assimilated aerosol fields are first validated by comparison to independent in-situ measurements. In order to assess aerosol absorption on a global scale, we perform a detailed radiative transfer calculation to simulate the UV aerosol index, comparing our results to OMI measurements. By simulating aerosol-attenuated backscatter, we use CALIPSO measurements to evaluate the vertical structure of our aerosol estimates, in particular in regions where we have larger discrepancies with OMI. Finally, the consistency of our AOD estimates with estimates from MODIS/Deep Blue, OMI and PARASOL will be briefly discussed.",

            "abstract": "It has been strongly demonstrated that variations in the circulation of the middle atmosphere influence weather and climate all the way to the Earth’s surface. A key part of this coupling occurs through the propagation and breaking of planetary and gravity waves. However, limited observations prevent to faithfully reproduce the dynamics of the middle atmosphere in numerical weather prediction and climate models. The main challenge of the ARISE (Atmospheric dynamics InfraStructure in Europe) project is to combine existing national and international observation networks including: the International infrasound monitoring system developed for the CTBT (Comprehensive nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty) verification, the NDACC (Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Changes) lidar network, European observation infrastructures at mid latitudes (OHP observatory), tropics (Maïdo observatory), high latitudes (ALOMAR and EISCAT), infrasound stations which form a dense European network and satellites. The ARISE network is unique by its coverage (polar to equatorial regions in the European longitude sector), its altitude range (from troposphere to mesosphere and ionosphere) and the involved scales both in time (from seconds to tens of years) and space (from tens of meters to thousands of kilometers). Advanced data products are produced with the scope to assimilate data in the Weather Prediction models to improve future forecasts over weeks and seasonal time scales. ARISE observations are especially relevant for the monitoring of extreme events such as thunderstorms, volcanoes, meteors and at larger scales, deep convection and stratospheric warming events for physical processes description and study of long term evolution with climate change. Among the applications, ARISE fosters integration of innovative methods for remote detection of non-instrumented volcanoes including distant eruption characterization to provide notifications with reliable confidence indices to the civil aviation.",

            "abstract": "The standard model of injection-induced seismicity considers changes in Coulomb strength due solely to changes in pore-pressure. We consider two additional effects: full poro-elastic coupling of stress and pore-pressure, and time dependent earthquake nucleation. Stress and pore-pressure due to specified injection rate are modeled in a homogeneous, poroelastic medium. Stress and pore-pressure are used to compute seismicity rate through the Dieterich [1994] model. For constant injection rate, the time to reach a critical seismicity rate scales with t ~ r^2/(c f_c), where r is distance from the injector, c is hydraulic diffusivity, and f_c is a factor that depends on mechanical properties, and weakly on r. The seismicity rate decays following a peak, consistent with some observations. During injection poro-elastic coupling may increase or decrease the seismicity rate, depending on the orientation of the faults relative to the injector. If injection induced stresses inhibit slip, abrupt shut-in can lead to locally sharp increases in seismicity rate; tapering the flux mitigates this effect. The maximum magnitude event has been observed to occur post-injection. We suggest the seismicity rate at a given magnitude depends on the nucleation rate, the size distribution of fault segments, and if the background shear stress is low, the time varying volume of perturbed crust. This leads to a roll-over in frequency magnitude distribution for larger events, with a corner that increases with time. Larger events are absent at short times, but approach the background frequency with time; larger events occurring post shut-in are thus not unexpected.",

            "abstract": "NASA mission proposals of today must promise “ground-breaking” new results. “Ground-breaking” is a buzzword, but sounds good to a geologist who likes to study active processes. Great progress in understanding active processes on the Moon and Mars has resulted from very-high-resolution (sub-meter scale) repeat imaging (monitoring) by LROC and HiRISE. Such changes include new impact craters and mass wasting on both the Moon and Mars. One martian surprise was not just finding that the gullies or ravines are forming today, but that they are forming in times and places with CO2 frost on the ground. The geomorphology of these gullies is a perfect match for water-carved gullies on Earth, but the CO2 buffers the ground and air temperatures to near 150 K, far too cold for liquid water to play a role. Snapshot geomorphology, even at very high resolution, does not enable a unique interpretation of geologic processes. Repeat imaging led to discovery of the martian Recurring Slope Lineae (RSL), which form at the warmest times and places and may be seeps of salty water. A source of water in a non-polar location is needed to support a future human presence on Mars, but Planetary Protection will be a challenge (or impossible). Jupiter’s moon Io is the ideal natural laboratory to understand groundbreaking volcanism and tectonism. Very large-scale energetic processes that have shaped the planets are active today on Jupiter’s moon Io, so this is the best place to study these processes. Is there active venting on Europa? We don’t know (yet) because we haven’t looked with the proper combination of resolution (<20 km), phase angle, and coverage. Understanding active geologic and atmospheric processes and how they affect spectral signatures will determine the interpretability of exoplanet spectra and inform the search for ET life. However, the most amazing planetary habitability experiment in this arm of the galaxy is Earth.",

            "abstract": "The thermal states of rocky planets can vary widely during the process of accretion. The thermal structure affects several major processes on the growing planet, including the mechanics of core formation, pressure-temperature conditions for metal-silicate equilibration, mixing, and atmospheric erosion. Because impact energy is distributed heterogeneously, accretional energy is preferentially deposited in the gravitationally re-equilibrated outer layers of the planet for both small and giant impacts. The resulting stably stratified structure inhibits complete mixing within the mantle.\nInitially, the specific energy of giant impacts between Mars-mass embryos leads to melting of the mantle. However, as planet formation progresses, the specific energies of giant impacts increase and can drive the mantle into a transient supercritical state. In the hottest regions of the planet, metal and silicates are miscible, and metal exsolution occurs as the structure cools. The cooling time of the supercritical structure is typically longer than the timescale for metal segregation to the core. Thus, these high temperature excursions during planet formation are significant for understanding metal-silicate equilibration. Furthermore, when a supercritical planet is also rapidly rotating, the mantle, atmosphere and disk (MAD) form a continuous dynamic and thermodynamic structure. Lunar origin by condensation from a MAD Earth can explain the major characteristics of the Moon (Lock et al., this meeting).\nOne of the greatest uncertainties in understanding the thermal states of planets during accretion is the changing composition and mass of the atmosphere. After the dispersal of the solar nebula, the thermal boundary condition imposed by the atmosphere can vary between silicate vapor and condensed ices. The coupled problem of atmospheric origin and planetary accretion can be used to constrain the many uncertainties in the growth and divergence of the terrestrial planets in our solar system.",

            "abstract": "A large, long-standing, and pervasive climate model bias is excessive absorbed shortwave radiation (ASR) over the mid-latitude oceans, especially the Southern Ocean. We investigate both the underlying mechanisms for and climate impacts of this bias within the Community Earth System Model with the Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CESM-CAM5). Excessive Southern Ocean ASR in CESM-CAM5 results in part because low-level clouds contain insufficient amounts of supercooled liquid. In a present-day atmosphere-only run, an observationally motivated modification to the shallow convection detrainment increases supercooled cloud liquid, brightens low-level clouds, and substantially reduces the Southern Ocean ASR bias. Tuning to maintain global energy balance enables reduction of a compensating tropical ASR bias. In the resulting pre-industrial fully coupled run with a brighter Southern Ocean and dimmer Tropics, the Southern Ocean cools and the Tropics warm. As a result of the enhanced meridional temperature gradient, poleward heat transport increases in both hemispheres (especially the Southern Hemisphere) and the Southern Hemisphere atmospheric jet strengthens. Cross-equatorial heat transport increases in the ocean, but not in the atmosphere. As a result, a proposed atmospheric teleconnection that links Southern Ocean ASR bias reduction and cooling with northward shifts in the Intertropical Convergence Zone is not found. All results discussed above are for the transient response. Ongoing work to assess the equilibrium response and the impact of the fix climate change experiments results will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "Tsunami warning procedures adopted by national tsunami warning centres largely rely on the classical approach of earthquake location, magnitude determination, and the consequent modelling of tsunami waves. Although this approach is based on known physics theories of earthquake and tsunami generation processes, this may be the main shortcoming due to the need to satisfy minimum seismic data requirement to estimate those physical parameters. At least four seismic stations are necessary to locate the earthquake and a minimum of approximately 10 minutes of seismic waveform observation to reliably estimate the magnitude of a large earthquake similar to the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami Earthquake of M9.2. Consequently the total time to tsunami warning could be more than half an hour. In attempt to reduce the time of tsunami alert a new approach is proposed based on the classification of tsunamigenic and non tsunamigenic earthquakes using speaker recognition techniques. A Tsunamigenic Dataset (TGDS) was compiled to promote the development of machine learning techniques for application to seismic trace analysis and, in particular, tsunamigenic event detection, and compare them to existing seismological methods. The TGDS contains 227 off shore events (87 tsunamigenic and 140 non-tsunamigenic earthquakes with M≥6) from Jan 2000 to Dec 2011, inclusive. A Support Vector Machine classifier using a radial-basis function kernel was applied to spectral features derived from 400 sec frames of 3-comp. 1-Hz broadband seismometer data. Ten-fold cross-validation was used during training to choose classifier parameters. Voting was applied to the classifier predictions provided from each station to form an overall prediction for an event. The F1 score (harmonic mean of precision and recall) was chosen to rate each classifier as it provides a compromise between type-I and type-II errors, and due to the imbalance between the representative number of events in the tsunamigenic and non-tsunamigenic classes. The described classifier achieved an F1 score of 0.923, with tsunamigenic classification precision and recall/sensitivity of 0.928 and 0.919 respectively. The system requires a minimum of 3 stations with ~400 seconds of data each to make a prediction. The accuracy improves as further stations and data become available.",

            "abstract": "Large scale earthquakes often cause serious economic losses and a lot of deaths. Because the seismic magnitude, the occurring time and the occurring location of earthquakes are still unable to predict now. The pre-disaster risk modeling and post-disaster operation are really important works of reducing earthquake damages. In order to understanding disaster risk of earthquakes, people usually use the technology of Earthquake simulation to build the earthquake scenarios. Therefore, Point source, fault line source and fault plane source are the models which often are used as a seismic source of scenarios. The assessment results made from different models used on risk assessment and emergency operation of earthquakes are well, but the accuracy of the assessment results could still be upgrade. This program invites experts and scholars from Taiwan University, National Central University, and National Cheng Kung University, and tries using historical records of earthquakes, geological data and geophysical data to build underground three-dimensional structure planes of active faults. It is a purpose to replace projection fault planes by underground fault planes as similar true. The analysis accuracy of earthquake prevention efforts can be upgraded by this database. Then these three-dimensional data will be applied to different stages of disaster prevention. For pre-disaster, results of earthquake risk analysis obtained by the three-dimensional data of the fault plane are closer to real damage. For disaster, three-dimensional data of the fault plane can be help to speculate that aftershocks distributed and serious damage area. The program has been used 14 geological profiles to build the three dimensional data of Hsinchu fault and HisnCheng faults in 2015. Other active faults will be completed in 2018 and be actually applied on earthquake disaster prevention.",

            "abstract": "The UK Carbon Plan presents four low-carbon energy system pathways that achieves 80% GHG emission targets by 2050, stipulated in the UK Climate Change Act (2008). However, some of the energy technologies prescribed under these pathways are land and water intensive; but would the increase demand for land and water under these pathways lead to increased competition and stress on agricultural land, and water resources in the UK?\nTo answer the above question, this study uses an integrated modelling approach, ForeseerTM, which characterises the interdependencies and evaluates the land and water requirement for the pathways, based on scenarios of power plant location, and the energy crop yield projections. The outcome is compared with sustainable limits of resource appropriation to assess potential stresses and competition for water and land by other sectors of the economy.\nThe results show the Carbon Plan pathways have low overall impacts on UK water resources, but agricultural land use and food production could be significantly impacted. The impact on agricultural land use is shown to be mainly driven by projections for transport decarbonisation via indigenously sourced biofuels. On the other hand, the impact on water resources is mainly associated with increased inland thermal electricity generation capacity, which would compete with other industrial and public water demands. The results highlight the need for a critical appraisal of UK’s long term low-carbon energy system planning, in particular bioenergy sourcing strategy, and the siting of thermal power generation in order to avert potential resource stress and competition.",

New global scenarios of HFC emissions reach 4.0-5.3 GtCO2-eq yr-1 in 2050, which corresponds to a projected growth from 2015 to 2050 which is 9% to 29% of that for CO2 over the same time period. New baseline scenarios are formulated for 10 HFC compounds, 11 geographic regions, and 13 use categories. These projections are the first to comprehensively assess production and consumption of individual HFCs in multiple use sectors and geographic regions with emission estimates constrained by atmospheric observations. In 2050, in percent of global HFC emissions, China (~30%), India and the rest of Asia (~25%), Middle East and northern Africa (~10%), and USA (~10%) are the principal source regions; and refrigeration and stationary air conditioning are the major use sectors. National regulations to limit HFC use have been adopted recently in the European Union, Japan and USA, and four proposals have been submitted in 2015 to amend the Montreal Protocol to substantially reduce growth in HFC use. Calculated baseline emissions are reduced by 90% in 2050 by implementing the North America Montreal Protocol amendment proposal. Global adoption of technologies required to meet national regulations would be sufficient to reduce 2050 baseline HFC consumption by more than 50% of that achieved with the North America proposal for most developed and developing countries. The new HFC scenarios and effects of national regulations and Montreal Protocol amendment proposals will be presented.",

Changing climate regimes such as extreme precipitation events increase flood vulnerability and put additional stresses on infrastructure. In this study the flood modelling in an urbanized area, namely Samsun-Terme in Blacksea region of Turkey is done. MIKE21 with flexible grid is used in 2- dimensional shallow water flow modelling. 1/1000 scaled maps with the buildings for the urbanized area and 1/5000 scaled maps for the rural parts are used to obtain DTM needed in the flood modelling. The bathymetry of the river is obtained from additional surveys. The main river passing through the urbanized area has a capacity of Q5 according to the design discharge obtained by simple ungauged discharge estimation depending on catchment area only. The effects of the available structures like bridges across the river on the flooding are presented. The upstream structural measures are studied on scenario basis. Four sub-catchments of Terme River are considered as contributing the downstream flooding. The existing circumstance of the Terme River states that the meanders of the river have a major effect on the flood situation and lead to approximately 35% reduction in the peak discharge between upstream and downstream of the river. It is observed that if the flow from the upstream catchments can be retarded through a detention pond constructed in at least two of the upstream catchments, estimated Q100 flood can be conveyed by the river without overtopping from the river channel. The operation of the upstream detention ponds and the scenarios to convey Q500 without causing flooding are also presented. Structural management measures to address changes in flood characteristics in water management planning are discussed. Flood risk is obtained by using the flood hazard maps and water depth-damage functions plotted for a variety of building types and occupancies. The estimated mean annual hazard for the area is calculated as $340 000 and it is estimated that the upstream structural management measures can decrease the direct economic risk 11% for the 500 return period flood.",

The radiative kernels are able to accurately capture both the spatial pattern and global mean effects of aerosol forcing and aerosol-induced cloud changes. We also quantify the aerosol-mediated response of the atmospheric circulation and energy transport to aerosol forcing. Aerosol forcing induces coherent changes in the dynamics and energy transport. The response associated with this change in energy transport also induces non-local cloud responses whose global-mean radiative impact is comparable in magnitude to the in-situ component of aerosol indirect forcing. In CMIP5 models, the impact of this aerosol-induced dynamical cloud response is large enough to alter the sign of the aerosol-mediated cloud-radiative response.",

A double-direct-shear experiment was done on floating sea ice in the field, with the addition of rubble ice between the sliding surfaces. This was achieved by moving a floating ice block through a channel of open water whilst subjected to normal loading, which was transferred through regions of ice rubble on both sides of the mobile block. The ice rubble regions were 30 cm deep and 50 cm wide. The displacement of the block and the force needed to move the block were measured. The rate dependence of friction was investigated for speeds of 10-3 to 10-2 ms-1. To investigate the state dependence of friction, slide-hold-slide (SHS) tests were conducted for hold times ranging from 1 second to 18 hours. When comparing the results from these experiments with a model for ice friction presented by Schulson and Fortt (2013), similar behaviour is seen at low hold times, where the peak coefficient of friction has a linear relationship with the logarithm of hold time. This is not the case for long hold times, however, and we attribute this to thermal consolidation of the ice rubble region.",

At present, their use is limited to small-scale areas. They are not designed to simulate the water cycle in climate modelling at the global scale. In this context, simpler models are still useful. There are many models in the literature which propose different approaches to reduce complexity. The equivalent vertical column (1D) is the most widespread physically-based model. These column models are mainly developed for large-scale models. A column simulates the water-energy vertical transfers at a lateral scale given by the pixel size of the climate model. Therefore, any sub-pixel time and space variation is not taken into account. These models usually neglect groundwater flow, an essential component of the water cycle and shown to have an important impact on the water-energy vertical transfers.\nTo overcome these limitations, we propose a new soil-vegetation column with a drainage function at the bottom of the column. The modelled column aims to simulate water transfer at any given location in a catchment. The drainage function accounts for lateral groundwater flow, allowing the representation of the groundwater table. This function has been established on the basis of different hypotheses. The main one is the assumption of a linear water table along the hillslope including the column. This model simulates the vertical soil moisture profile and the evapotranspiration fluxes at the column scale and the hydrograph at the catchment scale.\nAn evaluation of this model on a set of simple academic test cases has been carried out. Then, the model has been tested on the Strengbach catchment (Vosges, France). Three column models have been compared with measured data at three piezometers located in the catchment. Results show good agreement with data.",

These processes endanger delta populations and infrastructure, a situation which is increasingly exacerbated by anthropogenic activities. The flux of fluvial sediment to deltas is a first order control on delta aggradation and thus the potential for the surface elevation of a delta to be maintained or rise relative to sea level. Aggradation may occur without anthropogenic interference, but it can also be induced by controlled flooding. This research investigates how future environmental changes through to 2100 will influence fluvial sediment delivery to a selection of 10 vulnerable deltas, thereby contributing to the understanding of relative sea level change projections for these fragile coastal systems.\nThe key environmental changes investigated in this study include anthropogenic climate change, reservoir construction, and land cover changes induced by changes in agricultural practices and vegetation cover. The effects of these environmental changes on fluvial sediment delivery are being evaluated using the catchment numerical model WBMsed, which is being calibrated for the selection of deltas using historical reference data. As a test case, the inputs for modelling current and future sediment fluxes to the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna delta are refined using economic and population projections as proxies for anthropogenic influences on delta catchments.\nThis research will contribute to the prognosis for vulnerable deltas and inform their short- and long-term management by indicating the consequences of anthropogenic activities which affect delta elevation and sustainability via altering fluvial sediment processes. While this could give forewarning for the residents and managers of unsustainable deltas, it could also be used as an argument for or against various anthropogenic activities.",

            "abstract": "Repeating earthquakes, with their similar locations and similar waveforms, are often thought to represent slip along the same patch of fault. Analysis of these earthquake clusters can provide useful information about the nature of the fault and earthquake interaction. Here we focus on sequences of repeating earthquakes along both the Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica and along the Oaxaca segment of Mexico, as both megathrust faults have been well instrumented in recent years with local seismic networks able to record the small magnitude earthquakes. These regions have also experienced large megathrust earthquakes as well as non-volcanic tremor and slow slip, suggesting a complex fault system that allows a wide spectrum of slip. We can use source characteristics of the repeating earthquakes to probe this fault complexity. Along the Nicoya Peninsula, there are over 370 repeating earthquakes (M 0.5-3.3) in the 3 months following the 2012 Mw 7.6 megathrust earthquake grouped into 55 distinct clusters. Along Oaxaca, the earthquake clusters or swarms (M 1.5-5.5) span a wider spatial and temporal range. For our source parameter calculations, we form narrow-frequency band envelopes for pairs of earthquakes within the earthquake clusters to compute spectral ratios for each pair. We determine seismic moment, corner frequency, and earthquake stress drop for each earthquake from these spectral ratios. We compare the source parameters for events within the clusters to examine temporal variations and compare between clusters to explore spatial variations that could be linked to other slip heterogeneity. Preliminary results for the Nicoya region suggest nearly identical stress drop for repeating events within clusters located near the 2012 mainshock, and more variability in stress drops for earthquakes in clusters located updip and to the northwest of the mainshock.",

Given the recent development and application of the stable Cr isotope system in the marine environment, a full account of the sources, sinks, and internal processes affecting the modern marine Cr cycle is prudent. Using the radioisotope 51Cr, we investigated the controls of cellular Cr accumulation in an array of marine phytoplankton grown in environmentally relevant Cr concentrations (1-10 nM). Given the affinity of Cr(III) for amorphous Fe-hydroxide mineral surfaces, and the formation of these mineral phases on the outside of phytoplankton cells, extracellular Cr was monitored in a model diatom species (Thalassiosira weissflogii) as extracellular Fe concentrations varied. Extracellular Cr in T. weissflogii increased with increasing extracellular Fe, demonstrating that Cr may be removed from seawater via extracellular adsorption to phytoplankton. Short-term Cr(VI) and Cr(III) uptake experiments performed with T. weissflogii demonstrated that Cr(III) both adsorbed to and was internalized by the cells ~20x faster than Cr(VI). This suggests that Cr(III) is the dominant oxidation state associated with phytoplankton cells. Cellular Cr:C ratios (<0.5 µmol Cr mol C‑1) of the nine phytoplankton species surveyed were significantly lower than previously reported Cr:C ratios of sinking particulate organic matter (~500 µmol Cr mol C-1). Thus, Cr accumulates in sinking particles– likely as Cr(III) – as it travels to the seafloor. Given the large fractionation of stable Cr isotopes during Cr(VI) reduction, Cr associated with exported phytoplankton may be enriched in lighter Cr isotopes. These data will assist investigators using stable Cr isotopes to examine past and present Cr biogeochemical cycles.",

This process is expected to help our multidisciplinary research team obtain feedback on the models and forecast products. In addition, engaging decision makers is essential in evaluating the use of drought and flood prediction models and products for decision-making processes in drought and flood management. Through this study, we plan to assess information requirements to implement a robust Early Warning Systems (EWS) by engaging decision makers in the process.

Our incomplete understanding of the fundamental physiological thresholds of vegetation mortality during drought limits our ability to accurately simulate future vegetation distributions and associated climate feedbacks.

Experimentally, dominant Southwest USA NET species died when they fell below predawn water potential (Ypd) thresholds (April-August mean) beyond which photosynthesis, stomatal and hydraulic conductance, and carbohydrate availability approached zero. Empirical and mechanistic models accurately predicted NET Ypd, and 91% of predictions (10/11) exceeded mortality thresholds within the 21st century due to temperature rise. Completely independent global models predicted >50% loss of northern hemisphere NET by 2100, consistent with the findings for Southwest USA. The global models disagreed with the ecosystem process models in regards to future mortality in Southwest USA, however, highlighting the potential underestimates of future NET mortality as simulated by the global models and signifying the importance of improving regional predictions. Taken together, these results from the validated regional predictions and the global simulations predict global-scale conifer loss in coming decades under projected global warming.",

            "abstract": "Recent improvements in the scope and precision of GPS networks across California and Nevada have allowed for uplift of the Sierra Nevada to be observed directly. Much of the signal, in the range of 1 to 2 mm/yr, has been attributed to lithospheric scale rebound following massive groundwater withdrawal in the San Joaquin Valley in southern California, exacerbated by drought since 2011. However, natural tectonic deformation associated with long term uplift of the range may also contribute to the observed signal.\nWe have developed new algorithms that enhance the signal of Sierra Nevada uplift and improve our ability to interpret and separate natural tectonic signals from anthropogenic contributions. We apply our new Median Interannual Difference Adjusted for Skewness (MIDAS) algorithm to the vertical times series and a inverse distance-weighted median spatial filtering and Delaunay-based interpolation to despeckle the rate map. The resulting spatially continuous vertical rate field is insensitive to outliers and steps in the GPS time series, and omits isolated features attributable to unstable stations or unrepresentative rates. The resulting vertical rate field for California and Nevada exhibits regionally coherent signals from the earthquake cycle including interseismic strain accumulation in Cascadia, postseismic relaxation of the mantle from recent large earthquakes in central Nevada and southern California, groundwater loading changes, and tectonic uplift of the Sierra Nevada and Coast Ranges.\nUplift of the Sierra Nevada extends from the Garlock Fault in the south to an indefinite boundary in the north near the latitude of Mt. Lassen to the eastern Sierra Nevada range front in Owen’s Valley. The rates transition to near zero in the southern Walker Lane. The eastern boundary of uplift coincides with the highest strain rates in the western Great Basin, suggesting higher normal fault slip rates and a component of tectonic uplift of the Sierra Nevada.",

            "abstract": "Volatiles such as H2O and CO2 play an important role in a variety of magmatic processes from magma generation to eruption, and melt inclusions (MI) – small volumes of melt trapped inside phenocrysts – have been used to measure their pre-eruptive concentrations. In particular, the volatile contents of MI from basaltic arc magmas have been used to track the role of dehydrating subducted oceanic lithosphere in magma formation in subduction zones. However, recent studies have shown that MI are imperfect storage containers and can lose H by diffusion through the mineral host and CO2 due to formation of a vapor bubble in the inclusion. Such results suggest that even the least degassed melt inclusions from a volcano may have volatile concentrations that underestimate the initial volatile contents of the magma. Thus, recognizing pre- and post-entrapment processes that influence MIs is important for interpreting magmatic processes at depth. Recent studies have developed methods that can be used to distinguish and correct for H diffusive loss (Bucholz et al., 2013) and CO2 loss to vapor bubbles (Wallace et al., 2015). Here, we focus on MI from eight cinder cones that erupted primitive basaltic magmas in the Lassen region of the Cascade arc, where H2O and Cl concentrations have been shown to relate to the amount of a subduction component added to the mantle wedge (Walowski et al., 2015). Using methods of Aster (2015), we correct for the loss of CO2 to a vapor bubble formed within a melt inclusion as the result of post-entrapment crystallization and thermal contraction. The results of the CO2 restoration calculations suggest that ~25-75% of the initial dissolved CO2 in the melt inclusions at the time of trapping was lost to a vapor bubble after entrapment. Trapping pressures for the restored CO2 and maximum H2O contents calculated using methods of Iacono-Marziano et al. (2012) range from ~2-5 kbar, equivalent to entrapment depths of ~7-18 km below the surface. The results indicate that primitive magmas in the southern Cascades stall in the middle crust, where they crystallize olivine and trap melt inclusions. Lastly, we consider the relationships of restored CO2 contents to highly incompatible elements like Nb and compare our results to data for basaltic magmas from other tectonic environments.",

It is found that for both weak (tropical storms to category 1 TCs) and strong (categories 2–5 TCs) storms over all six TC basins, the TC precipitation reaches its daily maximum in the morning, but the mean rain rate and diurnal variations are larger in the inner core than in the outer rainbands. With increasing radial distance from the TC center, the diurnal amplitude of precipitation decreases, and the peak time appears progressively later. The outward propagation of diurnal signals from the TC center dominates as an internal structure of the TC convective systems. For all basins examined, the diurnal precipitation maximum within the inner core of a strong storm occurs earlier than the maximum observed in non-TC precipitation; the same result is not found for the outer rainbands.",

            "abstract": "The Mw 7.8 Gorkha, Nepal, earthquake, the largest central Himalayan earthquake in eighty-one years, yielded few instrumental recording of strong motion. To supplement these we collected 3800 detailed media and first-person accounts of macroseismic effects that included sufficiently detailed information to assign intensities. Our resultant macroseismic intensity map reveals the distribution of shaking in Nepal and the adjacent Gangetic basin. A key observation was that only in rare instances did near-field shaking intensities exceed intensity 8 on the European Macroseismic Scale (EMS), a level that corresponds with heavy damage or total collapse of many unengineered masonry structures. Within the Kathmandu Valley, intensities were generally 6-7 EMS, with generally lower intensities in the center of the valley than along the edges and foothills. This surprising (and fortunate) result can be explained by the nature of the mainshock ground motions, which were dominated by energy at periods significantly longer than the resonant periods of vernacular structures throughout Kathmandu. Outside the Kathmandu Valley the earthquake took a heavy toll on a number of remote villages, where many especially vulnerable masonry houses collapsed catastrophically in shaking equivalent to 7-8 EMS. Intensities were also generally higher along ridges and small hills, suggesting that topographic amplification played a significant role in controlling damage. The spatially rich intensity data set provides an opportunity to consider several key issues, including amplification of shaking in the Ganges basin, and the distribution of shaking across the rupture zone. Of note, relatively higher intensities within the near-field region are found to correlate with zones of enhanced high-frequency source radiation imaged by teleseismic back-projection (Avouac et al., 2015). We further reconsider intensities from a sequence of earthquakes on 26 August 1833, and conclude the largest of these ruptured at least part of the same plate boundary segment as did the Gorkha earthquake.",

            "abstract": "Soil surface crusts are important controllers of the small-scale wind entrainment processes that occur across all dust source regions globally. The crust type influences water and wind erosion by impacting infiltration, runoff, threshold wind velocity and surface storage capacity of both water and loose erodible material. The spatial and temporal patterning of both physical and biological crusts is known to change with rainfall and flooding. However, little is known about the impact of differing water quantity (from light rainfall through to flooding) on soil crusting characteristics (strength, roughness, sediment loss). This study compares the response of two soil types (loamy sand - LS, sandy loam - SL) with and without BSCs to three different rainfall events (2mm, 8mm, 15mm). Two BSC treatments were used one that simulated a young cyanobacteria dominated crust and an older flood induced multi species biological crust. For both soil types, soil surface strength increased with increasing rainfall amount with LS having consistently higher resistance to rupture than SL. Regardless of texture, soils with BSCs were more resistant and strength did not change in response to rainfall impact. Soil loss due to wind erosion was substantially higher on bare LS (4 times higher) and SL (3 times higher) soils compared with those with BSCs. Our results also show that young biological crust (formed by the rainfall event) have reduced soil erodibility with notably greater strength, roughness and reduced sediment losses when compared to soils with physical crust. Interestingly though, the erodibility of the old BSC did not differ greatly from that of the young BSC with respect to strength, roughness and sediment loss. This raises questions regarding the rapid soil surface protection offered by young colonising cyanobacteria crusts. Further analyses exploring the role of biological soil crusts on surface response to rainfall and wind saltation impact are ongoing.",

            "abstract": "Seismic surface waves are the major source of information to delineate the lateral heterogeneity and anisotropy in the upper mantle. S-wave radial anisotropy representing the difference between SV and SH velocities is often discussed with the seismic properties of the lithosphere-asthenosphere transition (LAT) and the mid-lithosphere discontinuity (MLD). Such boundaries have been studied well by body-wave receiver functions, which have a good sensitivity to the sharpness of boundaries. Surface waves are rather insensitive to the boundary sharpness, but can delineate the spatial distributions of shear wave speeds and radial anisotropy in the upper mantle, which can be alternative constraints on LAT and MLD.\nWe have recently constructed a radially anisotropic 3-D S wave speed model of the Australian continent from multi-mode Love and Rayleigh waves with enhanced ray coverage. In the inversions for S-wave radial anisotropy, we can use either parameterizations for SH and SV velocities, or for dimensionless radially anisotropic parameter ξ=(Vsh/Vsv)2. Both are theoretically the same, but this difference causes non-negligible effects on the estimated radial anisotropy, mainly due to the different sensitivities of Love-wave phase speeds to the structural parameters. Synthetic experiments and data variance reductions suggest the former is the better choice. The LAT throughout the continent can be estimated by the vertical velocity gradient of the isotropic S-wave model. The radial anisotropy with the suitable model parameterization shows strong anisotropy with faster SH velocity in the asthenosphere, suggesting the influence of strong shear beneath the fast drifting Australian continent. We can also identify the clear vertical changes in the radial anisotropy profiles at the MLD depth estimated from earlier receiver function studies in cratonic regions, which can be a key to elucidate the enigmatic MLD in the continental lithosphere.",

In this talk I will layout the method we used to recognize earthquake-like movement from single smartphone, and the overview of the whole system that harness the information from a network of smartphones for rapid earthquake detection. This type of system can be easily deployed and scaled up around the global and provides additional insights of the earthquake hazards.",

            "abstract": "Tsunami inundation maps are a powerful tool to design evacuation plans of coastal communities, additionally can be used as a guide to territorial planning and assessment of structural damages in port facilities and critical infrastructure (Borrero et al., 2003; Barberopoulou et al., 2011; Power et al., 2012; Mueller et al., 2015). The accuracy of inundation estimation is highly correlated with tsunami initial conditions, e.g. seafloor vertical deformation, displaced water volume and potential energy (Bolshakova et al., 2011). Usually, the initial conditions are estimated using homogeneous rupture models based in historical worst-case scenario. However tsunamigenic events occurred in central Chilean continental margin showed a heterogeneous slip distribution of source with patches of high slip, correlated with fully-coupled interseismic zones (Moreno et al., 2012).\nThe main objective of this work is to evaluate the predictive capacity of interseismic coupling models based on geodetic data comparing them with homogeneous fault slip model constructed using scaling laws (Blaser et al., 2010) to estimate inundation and runup in coastal areas. To test our hypothesis we select a seismic gap of Maule, where occurred the last large tsunamigenic earthquake in the chilean subduction zone, using the interseismic coupling models (ISC) proposed by Moreno et al., 2011 and Métois et al., 2013. We generate a slip deficit distribution to build a tsunami source supported by geological information such as slab depth (Hayes et al., 2012), strike, rake and dip (Dziewonski et al., 1981; Ekström et al., 2012) to model tsunami generation, propagation and shoreline impact using Neowave 2D (Yamazaki et al., 2009). We compare the tsunami scenario of Mw 8.8, Maule based in coseismic slip distribution proposed by Moreno et al., 2012 with homogeneous and heterogeneous models to identify the accuracy of our results with sea level time series and regional runup data (Figure 1). The estimation of tsunami source using ISC model can be useful to improve the analysis of tsunami threat, based in more realistic slip distribution.",

Here this apparent contradiction is reconciled through consideration of sea surface temperature (SST) pattern effects and differences between tropospheric and surface winds. The SST patterns are found to exert a strong influence on the surface winds, acting against the intrinsic large-scale circulation slow-down to produce a near-zero surface wind speed change averaged in space. The intrinsic slow-down and SST pattern effects combine to maintain a muted precipitation response despite the near-zero change in surface wind speed. Because the planetary boundary layer is decoupled from the free troposphere, the surface wind speed change cannot be regarded as an indicator for the trend of the tropical tropospheric circulation. As a result, there is no inconsistency between observed changes in surface winds and future projections of the atmospheric circulation: The total tropospheric circulation, dominated by the zonal wind (e.g., Walker cell), tends to slow down with global warming, while the meridional circulation (i.e. Hadley cell) and total surface winds are by no means predicted to weaken robustly.",

            "abstract": "Understanding patterns of deformation and testing geophysical models in the dynamic region of the Yellowstone Hotspot requires Quaternary-scale records of incision and uplift, which are currently absent. This study examines fluvial terraces and longitudinal-profile metrics along Alpine Canyon of the Snake River, WY. Because the Snake is the only regional river crossing from the uplifting Yellowstone Plateau and flowing into the subsiding Eastern Snake River Plain, it provides an opportunity to investigate both ends of the phenomenon. Field observations through Alpine Canyon indicate that Pleistocene incision rates in this region are relatively high for the interior western U.S., that the river switches between bedrock and alluvial forms, and that incision/uplift is not uniform. Two endmembers of regional deformation may be tested: 1) the arch of high topography surrounding Yellowstone is uplifting and terraces converge downstream as incision rates decrease towards the Snake River Plain, or 2) baselevel fall originates at the subsiding Snake River Plain and terraces diverge as incision rates increase downstream. Datasets include surficial mapping, rock strength measurements, surveying of the longitudinal profile and terraces using RTK-GPS, optically stimulated luminescence dating of fluvial-terrace deposits, and investigation of drainages through ksn and χ analyses. Initial results indicate that there are four primary terrace deposits along the canyon, three of which are timed with glacial epochs. Considering the relative heights of terrace straths and preliminary ages, incision rates are indeed relatively high. There is a major knickzone covering the last 15 km of the canyon that is also reflected in tributary profiles and is consistent with a wave of incision propagating upstream, favoring the second endmember of active baselevel fall downstream.",

Atmosphere density along the orbit could be derived through the change of nM. Before deriving atmosphere density, ballistic coefficient B need to be calculated. We chose satellite CHAMP as our research object, and derived atmosphere density of the year 2003-2005 from TLE data. Density derived from high-accuracy accelerometer could be referred to as real density, and used to estimate the precision of TLE-derived and NRLMSISE-00 model density. The results showed that mean error of TLE-derived density is 3.5-5.8% smaller than model density when geomagnetic was quiet, however, the results is not ideal during the period of geomagnetic storm. The most likely reason is that atmosphere density changes rapidly and was extremely complicated, another possible reason is because of the low temporal resolution of TLE.

            "abstract": "The rotation of the Sun on itself involves a flatness of the Polar Regions. The solar oblateness results from the rotation of the whole solar interior and the distribution of its mass according to the depth. Thus, possible diagnostic of the internal rotation is provided by the solar oblateness. The solar oblateness also places constraints on general relativity. Indeed, the modern era of measurements of the solar oblateness began in the 1960s with Dicke’s measurements, which were useful in understanding the perihelion precession of Mercury’s orbit, one of the classical tests of general relativity. Thus, for various reasons, it is necessary to better know the solar oblateness value and to study its dependence with the solar activity. Based on measurements collected from various instruments over the past 50 years, the measured solar equator-to-pole radius difference converges towards 8 mas (near 5.8 km). Now, with space era, we felt it was possible to obtain very accurate measurements of the solar equator-to-pole radius difference and its evolution over time. Thus, we developed an original method to estimate the solar equator-to-pole radius difference from two solar space missions (Solar Dynamics Observatory and PICARD). When analysing the solar radius versus angle data, we observed an anti-correlation between the limb brightness and the radius determined from the inflection point. The apparent radius was smaller if an active region was near the limb. The bright active regions were confined to low latitudes and never occur at the poles. The exact cause of this anti-correlation needs still to be understood but it is clear that it may cause an artefact in the determination of the solar oblateness leading to a negative bias, even if the more active regions were eliminated from the analysis. In this talk, we describe the method, and then present current results about solar oblateness variations after five years of solar observations (from 2010 to 2015) and linkages between measurements and harsh space environment.",

            "abstract": "We present an updated version of the radiosonde dataset homogenized by Iterative Universal Kriging (IUKv2), now extended through February 2013, following the method used in the original version (Sherwood et al 2008 Robust tropospheric warming revealed by iteratively homogenized radiosonde data J. Clim. 21 5336–52). This method, in effect, performs a multiple linear regression of the data onto a structural model that includes both natural variability, trends, and time-changing instrument biases, thereby avoiding estimation biases inherent in traditional homogenization methods. One modification now enables homogenized winds to be provided for the first time. This, and several other small modifications made to the original method sometimes affect results at individual stations, but do not strongly affect broad-scale temperature trends.\nTemperature trends in the updated data show three noteworthy features. First, tropical warming is equally strong over both the 1959–2012 and 1979–2012 periods, increasing smoothly and almost moist-adiabatically from the surface (where it is roughly 0.14 K/decade) to 300 hPa (where it is about 0.25 K/decade over both periods), a pattern very close to that in climate model predictions. This contradicts suggestions that atmospheric warming has slowed in recent decades or that it has not kept up with that at the surface. Second, as shown in previous studies, tropospheric warming does not reach quite as high in the tropics and subtropics as predicted in typical models. Third, cooling has slackened in the stratosphere such that linear trends since 1979 are about half as strong as reported earlier for shorter periods; this may be due to the beginning of stratospheric ozone recovery.\nWind trends over the period 1979–2012 confirm a strengthening, lifting and poleward shift of both subtropical westerly jets; the Northern one shows more displacement and the southern more intensification, but these details appear sensitive to the time period analysed. Winds over the Southern Ocean have intensified with a downward extension from the stratosphere to troposphere visible from austral summer through autumn. There is also a trend toward more easterly winds in the middle and upper troposphere of the deep tropics, which may be associated with tropical expansion.",

            "abstract": "In the past 15 years, observations and theories concerning dropouts of solar energetic particles have made it clear that the lateral spread of field lines and particles from a given location near the Sun is not a purely diffusive process. Particles of low energy from impulsive solar events exhibit abrupt changes in flux (dropouts) due to filamentation of magnetic connection from the Sun, indicating that magnetic flux tube-like structures at least partially persist to Earth orbit. Our simulations based on a corresponding spherical two-component model of Alfv\\’enic (slab) and 2D magnetic fluctuations indicate that such particles mostly follow field lines, which spread over\n∼\n25\n∘\nat Earth orbit, and exhibit dropout features. On the other hand, gradual solar events are of practical interest because they can produce greatly enhanced high-energy ion fluxes, which can cause radiation damage to satellites, spacecraft, and astronauts. While gradual events do not exhibit dropouts in the above sense, we show that the distribution of high-energy (\nE≥1\nGeV) protons is squeezed toward magnetic flux tube-like structures with a specific polarity due to the structures’ conical shape. Since it is difficult to observationally determine what polarity of flux structure the Earth is in at a given time, this transport phenomenon contributes to event-to-event variability in ground level enhancements of GeV-range ions from solar storms, presenting a fundamental uncertainty in space weather prediction.

            "abstract": "The transformations of precipitation into soil-, ground- or stream-water constitute fundamental components of the hydrologic cycle. Hydrometric data are well suited to track propagations of pressures through the landscape, but tell us little about the transport of water itself. Conversely, isotopic data track movements of molecules, providing quantitative insights into subsurface processes. This presentation reviews recent uses of isotopic data to quantify the velocity, storage and mixing of precipitation as it flushes into plants (1. transpiration), aquifers (2. recharge) and streams (3. runoff). (1) Plant transpiration comprises the largest flux of fresh water from the continents, exceeding global river flows by a factor of ~1.5. Mounting evidence suggests that water used by plants is poorly connected to water flowing into streams and aquifers, contrasting most earth system model parameterizations. (2) This partitioning of precipitation into “blue” (recharge, runoff) and “green” (transpiration) water storages is further evidenced by relating precipitation and groundwater isotope contents. Global precipitation-groundwater isotope data show that snowmelt pulses (extratropics) and intensive rainfall (tropics) lead to disproportionately large groundwater recharge fluxes—that is, recharge/precipitation ratios exceeding the local annual average. Across the low latitudes, these results mean that the ongoing intensification of precipitation brought on by global warming may serve to promote groundwater recharge in the tropics, where, by 2050, half of the world’s population is projected to live. (3) This presentation concludes by relating precipitation and streamflow isotope contents to show that ~1/3 of global river discharges are generated by precipitation that reaches the stream in less than 3 months (i.e., “young water” in rivers). Substantial and pervasive young, month(s)-old water in global rivers means that biogeochemical processes taking place in the critical zone—where landscape-stream connectivity is at a maximum—will have a disproportionately large impact on the quality of the water in the stream.",

            "abstract": "The United States Cretaceous Western Interior Basin has long been considered a foreland basin, driven by the Sevier thrust and associated basin sediment loads. However, flexural studies demonstrate that this effect exists only within a narrow band in front of the thrust belt. Most of the basin appears to be due to mantle flow-induced dynamic subsidence associated with Farallon plate subduction. Here we show how the components of evolving long-wavelength dynamic subsidence and flexural subsidence created the accommodation space and controlled the stratigraphy across the western United Sates, based on the correlated stratigraphic sections across central Utah-Colorado and southern Wyoming.These backstripped subsidence data reveal a component of continuously evolving long-wavelength dynamic subsidence, in addition to subsidence driven by the Sevier thrust belt and associated sediment loads. The loci of maximum rates of this dynamic subsidence moved eastward from ~98 to 74 Ma in phase with the west-to-east passage of the Farallon slab, as reconstructed from tomography based on quantitative inverse models. These subsidence data allow testing of existing subduction models and confirm the dynamic-topography driven nature of the Western Interior Basin. The results seem to support that the depocenters track the trough of dynamic subsidence with ca.18 Myr cycles through time and space and the stratigraphic patterns of large-scale progradation, eastward migration of depocenter, and regional clinoform-like downlap are related with the dynamic subsidence. Interpretation of these data also provides more insights into the repeated, ca.2 to 6 Myr cycles of thrust-induced subsidence in front of the thrust belt, which control the local eastward progradation of the sand bodies from the thrust belt. The dynamic, flexural subsidence and eustatic sea level changes interacted and controlled the timing and distribution of unconformities. Our work shows how the stratigraphy precisely records the timing, patterns and position of underlying mantle processes during slab subduction, and that combination of such data leads to important geophysical discoveries and supplies strict constraints for geody namic modeling.",

This study presents monthly, seasonal and annual variations in sediment transport (both suspended load and bedload) as well as dissolved loads over three consecutive water years (2008–2011) for two small forested watersheds with contrasting levels of forest disturbance in the Lesser Himalaya of Northwest India. Seasonal and annual suspended sediment yields were strongly influenced by amounts of rainfall and streamflow and showed a 10-63 fold range between wet and dry years. Of the annual load, some 93% was produced on average during the monsoon season (June–September). Sediment production by the disturbed forest catchment was 1.9-fold (suspended sediment) to 5.9-fold (bedload) higher than that for the well-stocked forest catchment. By contrast, dissolved loads varied much less between years, seasons (although minimal during the dry summer season), and degree of forest disturbance. Total mechanical denudation rates were 1.6 times and 4.6 times larger than chemical denudation rates for the little disturbed and the heavily disturbed forest catchment, respectively whereas overall denudation rates were estimated at 0.69 and 1.04 mm per 1000 years, respectively.",

            "abstract": "Orogenic processes leave pervasive and long-lasting structural and compositional heterogeneities such as suture zones, faults and magmatic intrusions in both the crust and the mantle. Intuitively, rifts are expected to take advantage of inherited weaknesses, thus to localize at former orogenic structures. This theory known asthe Wilson Cycle is well-illustrated in the northern North Atlantic, where extension follows the structural grain of the Caledonian orogen. However, the Alpine and southern North Atlantic rift systems are striking counterexamples, since both circumvent the core of the Variscan orogen to the southeast and to the west, respectively. Yet, one major distinctive feature between the Caledonides and the Variscides is the amount of post-orogenic magmatic activity. Indeed, while the Caledonian range orogenic collapse was essentially a-magmatic, widespread acidic intrusions and mafic underplating were emplaced in the Variscan continental crust.\nIn this study we investigate how mafic underplating of the continental crust and associated upper mantle depletion may impact a subsequent extensional event. We design numerical models to compare the behavior of lithospheres with various distributions of lower crust and mantle heterogeneities under different thermal states.\nWe show that the existence of a mafic layer in and / or a region of depleted mantle beneath a quartzite crust bearing weak heterogeneities results in delocalization of extension outside this area, in the case of thermally re-equilibrated lithospheres. Furthermore, the existence of a strong heterogeneity within the lower crust and / or the upper mantle triggers a necking instability, which may result in the formation of ribbons of little- or un-thinned continental crust between regions of more intense thinning. The wavelength of these ribbons compares well with the scale of the Flemish Cap and Galicia Bank, both of which developed over underplated Variscan lithosphere.",

The coastal areas are influenced by the Arabian Gulf, and have lower maximum, but higher minimum temperatures and a higher moisture percentage in the air.\nThe global warming can have profound impact on the mean climate as well as extreme weather events over the Arabian Peninsula that may affect both natural and human systems significantly. Therefore, it is important to assess the future changes in the seasonal/annual mean of temperature and precipitation and also the extremes in temperature and wind events for a country like Qatar. This study assesses the performance of the Coupled Model Inter comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations in present and develops future climate scenarios. The changes in climate extremes are assessed for three future periods 2016-2035, 2046-2065 and 2080-2099 with respect to 1986-2005 (base line) under two RCPs (Representative Concentrate Pathways) - RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. We analyzed the projected changes in temperature and precipitation extremes using several indices including those that capture heat stress. The observations show an increase in warm extremes over many parts in this region that are generally well captured by the models. The results indicate a significant change in frequency and intensity of both temperature and precipitation extremes over many parts of this region which may have serious implications on human health, water resources and the onshore/offshore infrastructure in this region. Data from a high-resolution (20km) AGCM simulation from Meteorological Research Institute of Japan Meteorological Agency for the present (1979-2003) and a future time slice (2075-2099) corresponding to RCP8.5 have also been utilized to assess the impact of climate change on regional climate extremes as well. The scenarios generated with the high-resolution model simulation were compared with the coarse resolution CMIP5 model scenarios to identify region specific features that might be better resolved in the former simulation.",

            "abstract": "Extreme coastal storms devastate heavily populated areas around the world. Our understanding of exposure to extreme storms is limited due to the short duration of the observational record, which causes difficulty in assessing their true probability of occurrence. Global climate models provide a means of simulating a much larger sample of extreme events, allowing for better resolution of the tail of the distribution. Both tropical and extratropical cyclones (ETCs) occur over the northwestern Atlantic Ocean, and the risks associated with ETCs can be just as severe as those associated with tropical storms (e.g. high winds, storm surge). Therefore, we examine the ability of a high-resolution coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation model (GFDL FLOR) to realistically simulate extreme ETCs in the northwestern Atlantic Ocean. We analyze similarities between results from a long (i.e. multi-century) FLOR simulation and several atmospheric reanalysis products. After considering differences in spatial and temporal resolution, results indicate that atmospheric measures of ETC intensity are comparable to those diagnosed from reanalyses. The full 1500-year simulation provides a higher frequency of the strongest intensity measures over the northwestern Atlantic Ocean compared with reanalyses. This illustrates that the larger number of realizations in the simulation provides a better opportunity to sample the tail of the ETC distribution. We further investigate the realism of simulated ETCs by using a tracking algorithm to conduct quantitative comparisons of feature, track, cyclogenesis, and cyclolysis densities of simulated ETC subsamples with storms from recent history (using reanalyses).",

            "abstract": "Crop residue burning is an important contributor to global biomass burning. In the North China Plain, one of the largest and densely populated world plains, post-harvest crop burning is a common agricultural management practice, allowing for land clearing from residual straw and preparation for the subsequent crop cultivation. The most extensive crop fires occur in the North China Plain in June after the winter wheat comes to maturity, and have been blamed for spikes in air pollution leading to serious health problems. Estimating harvest season burning emissions is therefore of primary importance to assess air quality and define best policies for its improvement in this sensitive region. Bottom-up approaches, either based on crop production and emission factors, or on satellite burned area and fire radiative power products, have been adopted so far, however, these methods crucially depend, among other assumptions, on the satellite skill to detect small fires, and could lead to underestimation of the actual emissions. The flux inversion of atmospheric observations is an alternative, independent approach for inferring the emissions from crop fires. Satellite column observations of formaldehyde (HCHO) exhibit a strong peak over the North China Plain in June, resulting from enhanced pyrogenic emissions of a large suite of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), precursors of HCHO. We use vertical columns of formaldehyde retrieved from the OMI instrument between 2005 and 2012 as constraints in an adjoint inversion scheme built on IMAGESv2 CTM, and perform the optimization of biogenic, pyrogenic, and anthropogenic emission parameters at the model resolution. We investigate the interannual variability of the top-down source, quantify its importance for the atmospheric composition on the regional scale, and explore its uncertainties. The OMI-based crop burning source is compared with the corresponding anthropogenic flux in the North China Plain, and is evaluated against HCHO columns from the GOME-2 instrument. The contribution of crop fires to the observed glyoxal and NO2 columns from OMI, and methanol columns from IASI is also investigated and discussed.",

            "abstract": "Carbon storage and flux in the deep Earth are moderated by oxygen fugacity and interactions with iron-bearing phases. The amount of carbon stored in Earth’s mantle versus the core depends on carbon-iron chemistry at the core-mantle boundary. Oxidized carbonates subducted from Earth’s surface to the lowermost mantle may encounter reduced Fe0 metal from disproportionation of Fe2+ in lower mantle silicates or mixing with the core. To understand the fate of carbonates in the lowermost mantle, we have performed experiments on sandwiches of single-crystal (Ca0.6Mg0.4)CO3 dolomite and Fe foil in the laser-heated diamond anvil cell at lower mantle conditions of 49-110 GPa and 1800-2500 K. Syntheses were conducted with in situ synchrotron X-ray diffraction to identify phase assemblages. After quench to ambient conditions, samples were sectioned with a focused Ga+ ion beam for composition analysis with transmission electron microscopy. At the centers of the heated spots, iron melted and reacted completely with the carbonate to form magnesiowüstite, iron carbide, diamond, magnesium-rich carbonate and calcium carbonate. In samples heated at 49 and 64 GPa, the two carbonates exhibit a eutectoid texture. In the sample heated at 110 GPa, the carbonates form rounded ~150-nm-diameter grains with a higher modal proportion of interspersed diamonds. The presence of reduced iron in the deep lower mantle and core-mantle boundary region will promote the formation of diamonds in carbonate-bearing subducted slabs. The complete reaction of metallic iron to oxides and carbides in the presence of mantle carbonate supports the formation of these phases at the Earth’s core-mantle boundary and in ultra-low velocity zones.",

            "abstract": "Glyoxal is, like formaldehyde, a short-lived intermediate in the oxidation of non-methane VOCs emitted by plants, vegetation fires and anthropogenic activities. It is also a precursor of secondary organic aerosols. Both compounds absorb in the UV-visible spectral region and have been measured by the SCIAMACHY satellite sensor since 2003, and more recently, by OMI and GOME-2. Previous modelling studies using SCIAMACHY data have pointed to the existence of large additional sources, in particular over forests (Stavrakou et al. 2009), and more recently over Eastern China, most likely due to aromatic hydrocarbons (Liu et al. 2012), suggesting that glyoxal can serve as an indirect estimator of urban VOC sources. The current study is motivated by (i) recent advances in our understanding of chemical pathways leading to glyoxal formation, in particular from the oxidation of isoprene, the most largely emitted NMVOC, (ii) the existence of numerous in situ concentration measurements for the key anthropogenic glyoxal precursors (e.g. acetylene, aromatics) over industrialized areas, which can be used to narrow down the anthropogenic emission estimates in these regions, and (iii) substantial improvements in retrieval algorithms for glyoxal columns from UV-visible satellite instruments, which has led to an significant reductions of the number of unphysical negative columns over the oceans as well as to generally lower glyoxal columns over continents. In this study, the chemical mechanism and NMVOC emission inventories of the global CTM IMAGESv2 are revised based on recent investigations. The relative importance and possible uncertainties of different chemical pathways leading to glyoxal formation in the oxidation of isoprene are determined by box model simulations. Next, OMI (also possibly GOME-2) glyoxal and formaldehyde data are used to constrain the emissions of biogenic, pyrogenic and anthropogenic VOCs. To that effect, the inverse modelling technique using the adjoint model of IMAGESv2 is used. The role of model uncertainties is explored through a number of sensitivity studies. The model results are evaluated against ground-based measurements (MAX-DOAS, SOAS, CABINEX) and aircraft observations (SENEX) for HCHO, OCHCHO and their ratio (R_GF).",

            "abstract": "A detailed picture of global dust emissions at low latitudes has been achieved through the use of remote sensing. However most surveys have been restricted to latitudes between 50°N and S and have not considered dust from high latitude regions. Field studies have shown that dust emissions, particularly from glacierised areas, at high latitudes can be extremely intense and extensive, but the potential for exploring this at larger spatial scales and longer temporal scales using remote sensing remains unrealised.\nAccepted and reliable remote sensing methodologies for quantifying low latitude dust have provided information on the geomorphological characteristics of dust sources and insights into spatial and temporal patterns of dust release. However, these methodologies have not been widely tested at high latitudes; possible limitations to their use are that most remote sensing retrievals are optimised for low latitudes and cloud cover in high latitudes tends to be persistent and extensive.\nThis research examines whether approaches to the remote sensing of dust that have been successful at low latitudes can be applied at high latitudes and adopts a scale of enquiry appropriate to identify patterns and trends in Icelandic dust emissions from 2003-2014. In particular, we evaluate the utility of broad-scale aerosol products (Aerosol Optical Depth retrievals from MODIS at 10x10 km and 1 degree) for obtaining information on the dynamics of dust source regions and transport pathways associated with southern Iceland. Daily data make it difficult to establish spatial and temporal trends because they are incomplete due to cloud cover. To increase data retrievals we used 8-day averages of AOD for each cell and this made it possible to identify a clear seasonal pattern in the AOD during the decade with highest values occurring April and May. Examination of AOD over land indicates that the frequency and intensity of dust emissions varies spatially, with the glacial outwash plains of Skeiđarásandur identified as a particularly persistent dust source which is in accordance with other research. Results suggest that the MODIS AOD retrievals can be used to identify spatial and temporal patterns in high latitude dust emissions provided appropriate scales of enquiry are used.",

This body of observation has shaped our contemporary view on ion outflows and their important role in magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. The variety of ion outflows may be categorized into thermal and suprathermal outflows. Both categories of outflows are strongly influenced by solar EUV irradiance and solar wind energy input, and the state of the magnetosphere, ionosphere, thermosphere, and (at times) plasmasphere. Several important challenges remain in our quest for a fully quantitative, multi-scale understanding of ion outflows. These include the detection of the lowest-energy ions in the tenuous sunlit magnetosphere; the influence of these hidden ions in the magnetosphere; ion transit between low and high altitudes at quiet times; the role of microscale processes; the simultaneous monitoring of different outflow populations and their circulation and redistributions in the magnetosphere; the influence of solar energy input, the thermosphere and the plasmasphere on outflow composition, characteristics, and variability; and the effects of this variability on the coupling between thermal and suprathermal outflows and on the overall magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling.",

            "abstract": "A large number of processes are involved in the chain from emissions of aerosol precursor gases and primary particles to impacts on cloud radiative forcing. Those processes are manifest in a number of relationships that can be expressed as sensitivity factors dlnX/dlnY driving aerosol effects on cloud radiative forcing. These factors include the sensitivity of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentration to emissions, droplet number to CCN concentration, cloud optical depth to droplet number, and cloud radiative forcing to cloud optical depth. The relationship between cloud optical depth and droplet number can be further decomposed into the sum of two terms involving the sensitivity of droplet effective radius and cloud liquid water path to droplet number. These relationships can be constrained using observations of recent spatial and temporal variability of CCN concentration, droplet number concentration, droplet effective radius, cloud liquid water path, cloud optical depth, and cloud radiative forcing. However, analysis of AeroCom model simulations suggests the relevance of such constraints to anthropogenic aerosol impacts on cloud radiative forcing is doubtful for some terms. Proxies connecting recent spatial/temporal variability to anthropogenic change, or sustained measurements in regions where emissions have changed, are needed to constrain estimates of anthropogenic aerosol impacts on cloud radiative forcing.",

Agriculture is the largest consumptive water user in the US, and irrigation plays a vital role in ensuring a stable food supply by buffering against climate extremes. However, it also plays a negative role in inducing water stress in many regions. Much research has focused on reducing agricultural water use, but this needs to be complemented by better quantifying the benefit of irrigation on crop yields under a range of climate conditions. Regions are identified with significant irrigation benefits with and without water stress to parse apart the role of climate, crop choice, and water usage to then evaluate tradeoffs with food production in a climate-water-food nexus.",

Many wells have been drilled in the Central North Sea but it still remains a challenge to understand its high pressure, high temperature geopressure regimes. This lack of understanding complicates the development of the deep Jurassic and Triassic aged prospects. Most of these concerns arise because the nature of the pressure transition from relatively low pressures at the top of the Chalk Group, to extremely high pressures in the deep Jurassic / Triassic reservoirs is not well known. Consequently, several models of the pressure transition zone have been proposed and tried by industry operators but with mixed success. In this study, well logs and measured pressure data have been analysed by several methods including a new tool: the Late Geopressure Indicator (LGI). It is shown that overpressure is generated by both disequilibrium compaction and late geopressure mechanisms. Disequilibrium compaction is dominant in the Cenozoic mudstones where its magnitude is related to recent burial while late geopressure dominates in deeper and older successions that lie beneath the Chalk. In the sub-Chalk settings, both the total overpressure and the prevalence of late geopressure are higher in the deeper Central Graben area (up to 8000 psi overpressure, 80% from late geopressure mechanisms) than in the basin margins (approximately 2000 psi overpressure, 15% due to late mechanisms). Contrary to some schools of thought that prefer the Chalk as the main reservoir seal, it is demonstrated that the top unit of a pressure cell can be situated anywhere between the Chalk and Heather Formation. This new approach to geopressure study offers better understanding of the cause of overpressure, shape of pressure transition zones and the location of the top of reservoir pressure cells which will help open a new window of opportunities for HPHT prospects.",

The centerpiece of the course is a 10-day field excursion to California featuring a broad cross-section of the geology of the state, from the San Andreas Fault to Death Valley. Here we describe results from a large-scale eye-tracking experiment aimed at understanding how experts and novices acquire visual geologic information. One ultimate goal of the project is to determine whether expert gaze patterns can be quantified to improve the instruction of beginning geology students. Another goal is to determine if aspects of the field experience can be transferred to the classroom/laboratory. Accordingly, ultra-high resolution segmented panoramic images have been collected at key sites visited during the field excursion. We have found that strict controls are needed in the field to obtain meaningful data; this often involves behavior atypical of geologists (e.g. limiting the field of view prior to data collection and placing time limits on scene viewing). Nevertheless some general conclusions can be made from a select data set. After an initial quick search, experts tend to exhibit scanning behavior that appears to support hypothesis testing. Novice fixations appear to define a scattered search pattern and/or one distracted by geologic noise in a scene. Noise sources include modern erosion features and vegetation. One way to quantify noise is through the use of saliency maps. With the caveat that our expert data set is small, our preliminary analysis suggests that experts tend to exhibit top-down behavior (indicating hypothesis driven responses) whereas novices show bottom-up gaze patterns, influenced by more salient features in a scene. We will present examples and discuss how these observations might be used to improve instruction.",

            "abstract": "Thermodynamic modeling indicated that Ceres has experienced planetary processes, including extensive melting of its ~25% water and differentiation, (McCord and Sotin, JGR, 2005; Castillo and McCord, Icarus, 2009). Early telescopic studies showed Ceres’ surface to be spectrally similar to carboneous-chondrite-like material, i.e., aqueously altered silicates darkened by carbon, with a water-OH-related absorption near 3.06 µm. Later observations improved the spectra and suggested more specific interpretations: Structural water in clay minerals, phyllosilicates, perhaps ammoniated, iron-rich clays, carbonates, brucite, all implying extensive aqueous alteration, perhaps in the presence of CO2. Telescopic observations and thermodynamic models predicted Dawn would find a very different body compared to Vesta (e.g. McCord et al., SSR, 2011), as current Dawn observations are confirming. Ceres’ original water ice should have melted early in its evolution, with the resulting differentiation and mineralization strongly affecting Ceres’ composition, size and shape over time. The ocean should have become very salty and perhaps may still be liquid in places. The surface composition from telescopes seems to reflect this complex history. The mineralization with repeated mixing of the crust with the early liquid interior and with in-fall from space would create a complex surface that will present an interpretation challenge for Dawn. The Dawn spacecraft is currently collecting observations of Ceres’ landforms, elemental and mineralogical/molecular composition and gravity field from orbit. Early results suggest a heavily cratered but distorted and lumpy body with features and composition consistent with internal activity, perhaps recent or current, associated with water and perhaps other volatiles. We will present and interpret the latest Dawn Ceres findings and how they affect our earlier understanding of Ceres evolution from modeling and telescope observations.",

            "abstract": "US public acceptance/rejection of science on the topic of climate change has become highly polarized, with a demographic profile well established through survey research. Trust in scientists for information about climate change tends to increase with education, decrease with age, and is higher among self-identified liberals and moderates than among conservatives. Demographic profiles of people who do or do not trust scientists regarding other disputed topics are less well established. Some observers have argued that certain domains such as vaccines, nuclear power or genetically modified organisms (GMOs) could present a mirror image of climate change, with liberals instead of conservatives disproportionately rejecting science on that topic. Evidence for this mirror-image hypothesis has been mainly anecdotal, however. Here we test it systematically using statewide survey data on more than 1200 interviews, comparing five similarly worded questions that ask respondents whether they trust, don't trust, or are unsure about scientists as a source of information about ... climate change, vaccines, evolution, nuclear power safety, or GMOs. Climate change proves to be the most polarized of these topics, but all five exhibit roughly similar age, education and ideological effects -- contrary to the mirror-image hypothesis. The common patterns across five science domains, chosen for their hypothetical contrasts, map out an unexpectedly cohesive picture of who trusts scientists for information, and who does not. Implications of these survey results for public outreach and science communication are explored.",

            "abstract": "The low intensity area in Earth’s recent magnetic field that spans the southern Atlantic Ocean, Africa and South America is commonly called the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). Many believe the SAA is linked to the dramatic decay of the dipole geomagnetic field intensity during the last 160 years, and the growth of a reversed core flux patch beneath South Africa. The dipole field decay has even motivated speculation that Earth is heading toward a geomagnetic field reversal. But understanding these phenomena within the context of longer-term geomagnetic history has been limited by a lack of Southern Hemisphere archeomagnetic data. We have recently presented the first archeomagnetic data from Iron Age sites of southern Africa (~1000-1650 AD) (Tarduno et al., 2014, 2015). Magnetic data show a sharp intensity drop at ~1300 AD, at a rate comparable to modern field changes in the SAA, (but to lower values). These changes motivated our conceptual model whereby the recurrence of low field values reflects magnetic flux expulsion from the core, promoted by the unusual core-mantle boundary composition and structure beneath southern Africa defined by seismology (specifically the African Large Low Velocity Seismic Province, or LLVSP). Because the African LLVSP is a longstanding structure, we expect this region to be a steady site of flux expulsion, and perhaps the triggering site for reversals, on time scales of millions of years. Here we discuss our ongoing efforts to extend the archeomagnetic record from southern Africa back in time, and further develop the flux expulsion- African LLVSP hypothesis, through new sampling and paleomagnetic analyses of Iron Age burnt huts, grain bins and kraals from South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana.",

This development opens doors for improving novel scientific applications utilizing remotely sensed low-level visible light, for purposes ranging from estimating population to inferring factors relating to economic development. For example, the success of future international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions will be dependent on mechanisms to monitor remotely for compliance. Here, we discuss implementation and evaluation of the VRCE system (VIIRS Remote Carbon Estimates), developed at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, which provides monthly independent, unbiased estimates of per-capita carbon emissions. Cloud-free global composites of Earth nocturnal lighting are generated from VIIRS DNB at full spatial resolution (750 meter). A population equation is derived from a linear regression of DNB radiance sums at state level to U.S. Census data. CO2 emissions are derived from a linear regression of VIIRS DNB radiance sums to U.S. Department of Energy emission estimates. Regional coefficients for factors such as percentage of energy use from renewable sources are factored in, and together these equations are used to generate per-capita CO2 emission estimates at the country level.",

            "abstract": "Species distribution shift (or referred to as “fingerprint of climate change”) as a primary mechanism to adapt climate change has been of great interest to ecologists and conservation practitioners. Recent meta-analyses have concluded that a wide range of animal and plant species are already shifting their distribution. However majority of the literature has focused on analyzing recent poleward and elevationally upward shift of species distribution. However if measured only in poleward shifts, the fingerprint of climate change will be underestimated significantly. In this study, we demonstrate a centroid model for range-wide analysis of distribution shifts using the North American Breeding Bird Survey. The centroid model is based on a hierarchical Bayesian framework which models population change within physiographic strata while accounting for several factors affecting species detectability. We used the centroid approach to examine large number of species permanent resident species in North America and evaluated the dreiction and magnitude of their shifting distribution. To examine the inferential ability of mean temperature and precipitation, we test a hypothesis based on climate velocity theory that species would be more likely to shift their distribution or would shift with greater magnitude in in regions with high climate change velocity. For species with significant shifts of distribution, we establish a precipitation model and a temperature model to explain their change of abundance at the strata level. Two models which are composed of mean and extreme climate indices respectively are also established to test the influences of changes in gradual and extreme climate trends.",

Although snow processes are relatively well represented in current generation land surface models, at least at large scales for deep mountain snowpacks, the representation of high latitude snow processes remain complicated by the role of snow redistribution, and of sublimation during the shoulder (especially spring) season. Most credible land surface models now include representations of permafrost, some of which perform well when forced with local climate data; however their performance over large areas is limited by spatial variability of key processes, including soil thermal characteristics. Likewise, many land surface models now represent the hydrology and energetics of lakes, which cover a substantial portion of the landscape in many high latitude environs. However, accurate representation of lakes requires knowledge of certain characteristics of their bathymetry and hydrological connectivity, information which is not always available. Likewise, the representation of wetlands in models, although improved in many cases, is limited by topography (and the role of microtopography, even at large scales). Nonetheless, increased attention to high latitude hydrological processes has demonstrably improved the fidelity of land surface representations over the last decade or so.",

            "abstract": "There are good reasons to expect feedback strengths to alter with changes in background climate, but empirically constrainting such changes is difficult. Earth System Sensitivity (ESS) --- which accounts for both fast and slow feedbacks in the climate system, including those associated with ice sheets and vegetation --- is relatively well constrained for the Late Pleistocene because of accurate and well-resolved records of temperature and greenhouse gas concentration. The Pliocene offers the geologically most recent epoch during which to examine ESS in warmer climates, but empirical estimates have come to conflicting results. Estimates relying on mean changes in Pliocene temperature and CO$_2$ concentration find ESS values consistent with those from the Late Pleistocene, whereas more recent estimates from variability within the Pliocene find ESS values of half the magnitude, implying that ESS bends downward with increased global temperature. This set of observations might be physically self-consistent, for example, if within-Pliocene ESS reflects a smaller ice-albedo feedback, whereas average Pliocene temperature reflects warmer conditions brought about by a singular ocean-atmospheric transition resulting from higher greenhouse gas concentrations. Another possibility is that discrepancies result from errors in some or all of the ESS estimates. ESS may be overestimated if temperature changes are misattributed to greenhouse gases, when instead, for example, they are driven by changes in orbital variations or opening of oceanic passages. Alternatively, ESS may be underestimated because errors in forcing and misalignment of age models generally result in a statistical bias termed regression dilution. Here a method for optimally aligning age models is coupled with a spectral regression technique in order to account for age model uncertainty and delineate contributions from orbital variations. The method is applied to within-Pleistocene and within-Pliocene temperature and greenhouse gas variations, and preliminary results indicate lower Pleistocene ESS, higher Pliocene ESS, and greater uncertainties than previously indicated, all of which make ESS estimates across colder and warmer climates less inconsistent.",

Mantle global circulation models that include deep subduction and compositional heterogeneity similar to the observed large low seismic velocity provinces in the lower mantle predict that the present-day global average heat flux at the core-mantle boundary exceeds 90 mW.m-2. This is sufficient to drive the present-day geodynamo by thermochemical convection and implies a very young inner core, with inner core nucleation between 400 and 1000 Ma, plus heterogeneous heat flux at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) with peak-to-peak lateral variations exceeding 100 mW.m-2. Extreme lateral variations in CMB heat flux indicate that the liquid outer core is thermally unstable beneath the high seismic velocity regions in the lower mantle and thermally stable beneath the large low seismic velocity provinces. Numerical dynamo simulations show how this pattern of boundary heat flux affects the flow in the outer core below the CMB, tends to align the time average geomagnetic dipole axis with the rotation axis, while promoting polarity reversals. It also contributes to longitudinal variations in the solidification rate on the inner core boundary, a possible cause of the hemispherical pattern of seismic heterogeneity observed in the inner core.",

This was followed by approximately 10 days of dwindling activity.\nIn April-May 2015, at the ridge-hotspot Axial Seamount, an eight-OBS array captured the second in situ seismic data, and first real-time data, from a mid-ocean ridge eruption. This eruption was also preceded by high seismicity rates, though data were only available for ~6 months prior to the eruption. An ~10 hr seismic crisis on April 24thwas followed by almost a month of dwindling activity. Immediately following the end of the crisis, previously unknown impulsive waterborne signals were observed coming from two sites along the north rift of Axial Seamount (Wilcock et al., this meeting; Garcia et al., this meeting). The signals were interpreted as being associated with lava reaching the seafloor, and subsequent multibeam mapping and an ROV dive confirmed the presence of fresh lava at these sites (Kelley et al., this meeting).\nRe-examination of the East Pacific Rise eruption data has shown that the same impulsive waterborne signals were also observed there starting ~3 hrs after the beginning of the 2006 seismic crisis (Tan et al., this meeting). The locations of these signals track the mapped lava flow associated with this eruption (Soule et al., 2007), further supporting their association with lava extrusion onto the seafloor.\nThese two eruptions show similar characteristics including ~6-10 hr seismic crises, and lava likely reaching the surface within ~3 hrs (EPR) and ~10 hrs (Axial) of the initiation of seismic crisis activity. They also show similar tremor activity, likely suggesting similar magma movement processes at depth. However, all phases of the Axial activity lasted longer, and it appears that the magma may have migrated some distance, whereas the EPR lava appear more likely to have erupted primarily above existing axial magma lenses, with thinner flow over a larger area. Seismic and acoustic characteristics of these two eruptions will be compared.",

SSI is constructed from models that determine the changes from quiet Sun conditions arising from bright faculae and dark sunspots on the solar disk using linear regression of proxies of solar magnetic activity with observations from the SOlar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SIM); the measurements are assumed to be reliable on solar rotational time scales. We extend the SSI record to longer time scales by reproducing the integral of the SSI with independent measurements of Total Solar Irradiance (TSI) measurements made by the SORCE Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM); TSI can be separately modeled to within TIM’s measurement accuracy from solar rotational to solar cycle time scales. We discuss the model formulation, uncertainty estimates, and operational implementation and present comparisons of the modeled SSI with the measurement record and with other solar irradiance models. We also discuss future work to improve the Solar Irradiance Climate Data Record with new measurements from the Total and Spectral Solar Irradiance Sensor (TSIS), different proxy representations of sunspot darkening and facular brightening, including the improved composite record of Mg II index being developed as part of the European-led SOlar Irradiance Data exploitation (SOLID) project, and to expand the uncertainty estimates to include model assumptions.",

Atmospheric CO2 provides a constraint on carbon fluxes at spatial scales compatible with the resolution of ESMs due to the fact that atmospheric mixing renders a single site representative of fluxes within a large spatial footprint. The variations in atmospheric CO2 at both seasonal and interannual timescales largely reflect terrestrial influence.\nI discuss the use of atmospheric CO2 observations to benchmark model carbon fluxes over a range of spatial scales. I also discuss how simple models can be used to test functional relationships between the CO2 growth rate and climate variations. In particular, I show how atmospheric CO2 provides constraints on ecosystem sensitivity to climate drivers in the tropics, where tropical forests and semi-arid ecosystems are thought to account for much of the variability in the contemporary carbon sink.",

To better connect with learners, CIMSS facilitated 21 discussion groups at public libraries around Wisconsin each week. Participants discussed climate change impacts in their communities as well as strategies to mitigate climate change. Not surprisingly, initial survey results show library participants were more committed, engaged, climate literate, and community minded.

            "abstract": "The stratigraphic sequence within the frontal accretionary prism of the Japan Trench, the site of large slip during the Tohoku earthquake, is unique due to horst and graben subduction. Boreholes at IODP Site C0019, penetrating the toe of the Tohoku accretionary prism, document a younger over older intraprism thrust contact with a 9 Ma age gap across the basal plate boundary fault. The anomalously young (Quaternary to Pliocene), fault-bounded sediment package is 130 m thick, of a total of 820 m of sediment above the plate boundary fault. In contrast, typical accretionary prism structure consists of stacked sediment packages on imbricate faults above the basal decollement resulting in an overall increase in age downward. Site C0019 penetrates the prism directly above a horst of the subducting Pacific oceanic crust. Here the plate-boundary fault consists of a thin, weak smectitic pelagic clay that is probably the principal slip surface of ~50 m offset in the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. The fault continues seaward deepening off the seaward edge of the horst and beneath the sediment fill of the adjacent graben, dying out at the landward base of the next incoming horst. The plate boundary fault and its splays in the graben form a narrow-taper protoprism and a small sedimentary basin of trench fill marking the seaward edge of the upper plate. The modern fault and sediment distributions within the graben are used to motivate a viable model for the presence of anomalously young sediments directly above the plate boundary fault. In this model sediments in the trench are thrust over the incoming horst by propagation of the plate boundary thrust up the landward-dipping fault of the incoming horst and along the smectitic clay layer to emplace Quaternary and Pliocene trench deposits directly on top of the incoming horst. These young deposits are in turn overlain by sediments 9 Ma or older that have been transported out of the graben along imbricate faults associated with the necessary increase in the taper of the prism above the graben. The Quaternary to Pliocene units thicken due to internal deformation accounting for the 130 m thickness now observed over the plate boundary fault at Site C0019. Conversely emplacement of very young sediment directly above a basal detachment would be unexpected in accretionary prisms subducting smoother oceanic crust.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies based on observed statistical properties indicate that the bulk of Iijima and Potemra's region 1 (R1) system of currents is generated by diversion of diamagnetic current in the magnetosphere. Inertial currents flowing in the low-latitude boundary layer have been estimated to contribute at most 20% to the dayside R1 currents, but they do play a special role in diverting field-aligned currents across the magnetopause and through magnetosheath to close in the primary solar wind dynamo acting at the bow of the magnetosphere. Observations and models have been less definitive in interpreting the sources of overlapping upward and downward “sheets” of R1 current flowing into Harang reversal region in the midnight sector. This highly dynamic region continues to challenge our understanding of plasmasheet current generators which typically violate the assumption made in the aforementioned observational studies that the plasma state is in near equilibrium.\nLong duration, global MHD simulations driven by actual, variable interplanetary conditions are shown to give average field-aligned current distributions at the ionosphere that closely resemble Iijima and Potemra’s patterns, especially when simulation grids with relatively high resolution are used. This similarity suggests that simulation results can be compared with observationally inferred sources of R1 currents to evaluate the conditions under which equilibration is approximately valid or when the current generators are strongly time-varying and deviate from statistical averages. The differences are shown to be especially significant in the nightside plasmasheet at distances of 10 Re or more from Earth where axial/meridional current systems are closely connected with spatially varying inertial currents.",

Previous studies confirmed the existence of such electric fields. However, the present study shows that upward field-aligned electric field can be found within upward field-aligned current (FAC) region. In the upward FAC region, upward electric field that accelerates electron downward is seen with the occurrence rates of 82%–96%. In contrast, the occurrence rates in the downward FAC regions are 3%–11%. Polar rain electrons located in the upward FAC region adjacent to closed field lines often show a ramping up of energy with increasing latitude before reaching a plateau. This plateau may be attributed to the magnetosheath electrons that progressively have higher anti-sunward velocity and lower density with increasing distance from the subsolar point before they asymptotically reach the solar wind values.",

            "abstract": "Observations make clear that some earthquakes radiate relatively more high frequency energy that others of the same moment. But translating these differences into traditional source parameter measures, such as stress drop and radiated energy, can be problematic. Some of the issues include: (1) Because of directivity and other rupture propagation details, theoretical results show that recorded spectra will vary in shape among stations. Observational studies often neglect this effect or assume it will average out when multiple stations are used, but this averaging is rarely perfect, particularly considering the narrow range of takeoff angles used in teleseismic studies. (2) Depth phases for shallow events create interference in the spectra that can severely bias spectral estimates, unless depth phases are taken into account. (3) Corner frequency is not a well-defined parameter and different methods for its computation will yield different results. In addition, stress drop estimates inferred from corner frequencies rely on specific theoretical rupture models, and different assumed crack geometries and rupture velocities will yield different stress drop values. (4) Attenuation corrections may be inaccurate or not fully reflect local 3D near-source attenuation structure. The use of empirical Green's function (EGF) events can help, but these often have signal-to-noise issues or are not very close to the target earthquake. (5) Energy estimates typically rely on some degree of extrapolation of spectra beyond their observational band, introducing model assumptions into what is intended to be a direct measure of an earthquake property. (6) P-wave spectra are analyzed much more than S-wave spectra because of their greater frequency content, but they only carry a small fraction of the total radiated seismic energy and thus total energy estimates may rely on poorly known Es/Ep scaling relations. We will discuss strategies to address these problems and to compute improved source parameter estimates with more realistic error bounds.",

Some of the systems continue to develop after crossing the coastline and may ultimately develop into tropical cyclones, while others do not. Understanding the lifecycle behavior of these convective systems and the factors that contribute to their continuous development as they transition from a continental environment to a marine environment poses a challenge. We examine the difference between two MCSs, one that continued to develop when it crossed the West African coast and one that did not, using European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Re-Analysis (ERA Interim) and Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) 3B42 data. The non-developing MCS that intensified briefly while over land, weakened as soon as it crossed the coast. Preliminary results show that the developing MCS interacted with two cyclonic vortices, one associated with an African Easterly Wave that was propagating towards the coast and the other vortex generated by the topography near the coast.

            "abstract": "The Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) established an Expert Group on Short-Lived Climate Forcers (SLCFs) in 2009 with the goal of reviewing the state of science surrounding SLCFs in the Arctic and recommending science tasks to improve the state of knowledge and its application to policy-making. In 2011, the result of the Expert Group’s work was published in a technical report entitled The Impact of Black Carbon on Arctic Climate (AMAP, 2011). That report focused entirely on black carbon (BC) and co-emitted organic carbon (OC). The SLCFs Expert Group then expanded its scope to include all species co-emitted with BC as well as tropospheric ozone. An assessment report, entitled Black Carbon and Tropospheric Ozone as Arctic Climate Forcers, was published in 2015. The assessment includes summaries of measurement methods and emissions inventories of SLCFs, atmospheric transport of SLCFs to and within the Arctic, modeling methods for estimating the impact of SLCFs on Arctic climate, model-measurement inter-comparisons, trends in concentrations of SLCFs in the Arctic, and a literature review of Arctic radiative forcing and climate response. In addition, three Chemistry Climate Models and five Chemistry Transport Models were used to calculate Arctic burdens of SLCFs and precursors species, radiative forcing, and Arctic temperature response to the forcing. Radiative forcing was calculated for the direct atmospheric effect of BC, BC-snow/ice effect, and cloud indirect effects. Forcing and temperature response associated with different source sectors (Domestic, Energy+Industry+Waste, Transport, Agricultural waste burning, Forest fires, and Flaring) and source regions (United States, Canada, Russia, Nordic Countries, Rest of Europe, East and South Asia, Arctic, mid-latitudes, tropics, southern hemisphere) were calculated. To enable an evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of regional emission mitigation options, the normalized impacts (i.e., impacts per unit emission from each sector and region) were also calculated. Key findings from the 2015 assessment will be presented.",

Average annual rainfall ranges from as high as 1900 mm in the sub-humid southeast to as low as 250 mm in the arid north. There are three distinct crop seasons- rainy (June to September), winter (Oct.-Nov. through Feb.-March) and summer (Feb-March through May-June). Wheat and mustard are grown during winter seasons.\nThe past climatic records suggested increasing trends in rainfall( 2 to 5 mm per year), maximum (0.03 to 0.05 0C per year) and minimum temperatures (0.02 to 0.05 0C per year) at most of places in Gujarat. But the minimum temperature is fould to be increasing significantly at all the locations. This affects the winter season crops viz. wheat and mustard adversely. Simulation results with DSSAT CERES-wheat model revealed that with increase in temperature by 2 0C in different months (November to February) the decrease in wheat yield is observed between 7 to 29 per cent. The impact of increase in maximum temperature during early (November) and late (February) is less (<12.5 %) than that during active vegetative and reproductive period (December and January; >24.8 %).\nThe climate change projections during 2071-2100 using PRECIS output suggested that there would be increase in maximum temperature by 3.2 to 5.2 0C in different districts of Gujarat over baseline period of 1961-1990 while minimum temperature is project to increase by 2.8 to 5.8 0C. Rainfall is also projected to increase by 28 to 70 per cent in different districts. The impact of climate change on wheat would be reduction in its duration by 14-20 days and the grain yield would be reduced by 20-55 per cent in different districts. In case of mustard crops the duration of crop would be reduced by 11 to 16 days and seed yield would be reduced by 32-50 per cent. In order to mitigate the ill effect of climate change, various adaptation strategies vis change in dates of sowing, change in variety, additional irrigation and fertilizer applications were simulated. Shifting of sowing dates of wheat by 15 days from its normal sowing (Nov 15), 5 to 10 per cent higher yield could be obtained. Similarly commonly grown cv. GW 496 is to be replaced by GW 322 to obtain 4-11 per cent higher yield. Two additional irrigation would increase the wheat yield by 5-15 per cent in different districts of Gujarat.",

This paper proposes a multiscale entropy method using wavelet transform and K-means based hybrid approach for clustering of hydrologic catchments. Multi-resolution wavelet transform of a time series reveals structure which is often obscured in streamflow records, by permitting gross and small features of a signal to be separated. Wavelet-based Multiscale Entropy (WME) is a measure of randomness of the given time series at different timescales. In this study, streamflow records observed during 1951–2002 at 530 selected catchments throughout the United States are used to test the proposed regionalization framework. Further, based on the pattern of entropy across multiple scales, each cluster is given an entropy signature which provides an approximation of the entropy pattern of the streamflow data in each cluster. The test for homogeneity reveals that the proposed approach works very well in regionalization.\nKeywords-Hydrologic regionalization, Ungauged catchments, Wavelet Transform, K-means clustering, Multiscale entropy.",

Thus, this time period is important for the discovery of new oil reserves in Iran. The Arabian passivecontinental margin has undergone lithospheric extension during the Permian–Triassic, which led to the formation of theNeo-Tethys. The aim of this paper is to describe the development of the continental rift basin in the Zagros region basedon the tectono-sedimentological evolution. We have studied well-log data to specify the distribution of synrift depositsin the Zagros and have related this information to the modelling. Environmental changes indicated by various sedimentarysequences, from a siliciclastic basin to a carbonate platform setting, are described. The Cambrian Hormuz salt, whichoverlies the metamorphosed Precambrian basement, becomes effective as a basal detachment layer influencing the styleof overburden deformation during the Permian–Triassic extension event. We have investigated the formation of variousstructures linked to the presence or absence of the Hormuz layer by analogue modelling and relating these structures to theLate Palaeozoic sedimentation. Based on results of the analogue modelling, we argue that the basal detachment layer (Hormuzseries) has contributed to the various structural styles of the extensional basin development in the Fars domain and theLorestan domain.",

            "abstract": "Mesozoic magmatisms in NE China can be subdivided into seven stages, i.e., Late Triassic, Early Jurassic, Middle Jurassic, Late Jurassic, early Early Cretaceous, late Early Cretaceous, and Late Cretaceous. Late Triassic magmatisms consist of calc-alkaline igneous rocks in the Erguna Massif, and bimodal igneous rocks in eastern margin of Eurasian continent. The former reveals southward subduction of the Mongol-Okhotsk oceanic plate, the latter reveals an extensional environment (Xu et al., 2013). Early Jurassic magmatisms are composed of calc-alkaline igneous rocks in the eastern margin of the Eurasian continent and the Erguna Massif, revealing westward subduction of the Paleo-pacific plate and southward subduction of the Mongol-Okhotsk oceanic plate (Tang et al., 2015), respectively. Middle Jurassic magmatism only occur in the Great Xing’an Range and the northern margin of the NCC, and consists of adakitic rocks that formed in crustal thickening, reflecting the closure of the Mongol-Okhotsk ocean (Li et al., 2015). Late Jurassic and early Early Cretaceous magmatisms only occur to the west of the Songliao Basin, and consist of trackyandesite and A-type of rhyolites, revealing an extensional environment related to delamination of thickened crust. The late Early Cretaceous magmatisms are widespread in NE China, and consist of calc-alkaline volcanics in eastern margin and bimodal volcanics in intracontinent, revealing westward subduction of the Paleo-pacific plate. Late Cretaceous magmatisms mainly occur to the east of the Songliao Basin, and consist of calc-alkaline volcanics in eastern margin and alkaline basalts in intracontinent (Xu et al., 2013), revealing westward subduction of the Paleo-pacific plate. The Heilongjiang complex with Early Jurassic deformation, together with Jurassic Khabarovsk complex in Russia Far East and Mino-Tamba complex in Japan, reveal Early Jurassic accretionary history. Additionally, the Raohe complex with the age of ca. 169 Ma was intruded by the 110-130 Ma massive granitoids, suggesting late Early Cretaceous accretionary event. From late Early Cretaceous to Late Cretaceous, the spatial extent of magmatisms was reduced from west to east, revealing roll-back of subducted slab.

Methodolgy of processing water level data came down to allocating tectonic-seismic stress taking into account the following factors: atmosphere pressure, precipitations, size of snow cover and tidal variations. The overall picture of the stress-strain state of the territory yearly was defined by calculated value of deformations around each hydrogeodynamic borehole taking into account the number of seismic events which occurred during that period. Maps of the isolines of equal values of deformations were drawn which reflect space-time regularity of the modern geodynamics of Armenia. The resluts of the correlation between parametres of hydrogeochemical effects and charaectreristics of earthquakes have shown that statistically significant connection between effect parametres (effect time, extremum time) and characteristics of seismic events (energetic class, epicentral distance ) was determined for the changes of parameters of the chemical composition of underground water. Histogram of changes of values of geochemical components of waters of mineral springs in space was drawn for the period of monitoring observations. The analysis of data allowed allocating more informative parameters of chemical composition of mineral water: gas component-carbon dioxide (СО2). Magnesium –Mg2+, chloride –Cl- where allocated from the macrocomponenet composition. According to the catalogue of seismic data there was drawn diagram of the frequency of earthquakes, reflecting the distribution of the earthquake number according to magnitude M (according to rule LgN=a-bM) in logarithmic scale. Coefficient of seismic activity was calculated – а, by which variations seismic activity of the region is evaluated.\nThus, modern tectonic movements of earth crust of Armenia are conditioned by seismic processes of earth crust. Formation of geological structures and changes of hydrogeodynamics and geochemistry of underground water are the results of geodynamic movements.",

            "abstract": "The African Humid Period (AHP), ca. 11,000 to 5,000 years ago, is a major phase that had significant impacts on the environments, ecosystems, and human occupation of Africa over several millennia. One of the most marked aspects stemming from an increase in rainfall during this climate period was the creation of numerous regional lakes and the recording of highstands for these waterbodies. The termination of the AHP is known to have been time-transgressive depending on the location, being either abrupt or gradual, thereby highlighting the complex interaction among multiple forcings and responses. Lake Turkana is one of the great lakes of the East African Rift where chronology of the AHP termination has already been investigated. In this study, the delta complex of the Turkwel River is analyzed using trajectory analysis in order to provide modalities of lake level decline during that time.\nTrajectories reveal six slightly descending (slope gradient: >0° to 0.4°) plateaus separated by four abrupt steps having higher slope gradients (1° to 3.8°). These abrupt steps reveal repeated short-lived strong increases in the rate of lake level decline that are superimposed on the relatively steady lake level decrease characterizing this period. This marks a stepwise forced regression at the end of the AHP in the Lake Turkana.\nWe correlate the short-lived increases in the rate of lake level decline with short-lived abrupt decreases of solar irradiance. Through the termination of the AHP, the abrupt decreases in solar irradiance modulated the continuous precessional-based reduction of solar insulation that drastically impacted monsoon activity (i.e. rainfall) and led to variations in lake levels as a response. This suggests that short-term solar variability is able to modulate longer-term orbitally-driven climate trends having significant impacts in terms of hydrology and the regional continental environments.",

            "abstract": "Stability of nano-scale or micro-scale titanium dioxide particles (nTiO2) and their attachment to sediment grains have important implications to the fate and transport of nTiO2 in subsurface environments. nTiO2 may carry either positive or negative charges in natural water, therefore, environmental factors such as pH, humic substances, and Fe oxyhydroxide coatings on sediment grains, which are known to control the stability and transport of negatively charged colloids, may influence nTiO2 in different manners. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of pH and humic acid (HA) on the stability and attachment of nTiO2 to sand, with special attention to low HA concentration ranges that are relevant to groundwater conditions. Stability and attachment of nTiO2 to quartz sand and Fe oxyhydroxide coated quartz sand were experimentally measured under a range of low HA concentrations at pH 5 and 9. Results showed that HA can either promote or hinder nTiO2 stability, depending on pH and HA concentration. We also found that HA can either enhance or reduce nTiO2 attachment to Fe oxyhydroxide coating at pH 5, depending on HA concentration. Results further showed that at pH 5, Fe oxyhydroxide coating reduced nTiO2 attachment to sand in the absence of HA but increased nTiO2 attachment in the presence of low concentration of HA. Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) theory was invoked to analyze particle-to-particle and particle-to-sand interactions in order to elucidate the roles of pH, HA, quartz, and Fe coating in nTiO2 stability and attachment. Overall, this study showed that changes in zeta potential of nTiO2 and Fe coating due to pH changes and/or HA adsorption are the key factors that influence stability and attachment of nTiO2.",

Whereas numerous moderate storms (Dst < -50 nT) have occurred, there have been only a small number of large (Dst < - 100 nT) and extreme (Dst < -200 nT) storms. Throughout this sequence of storms, the Two Wide-angle Imaging Neutral-atom Spectrometers (TWINS) mission has since 2008 observed the inner magnetosphere. TWINS consists of two ENA cameras flown aboard two separate spacecraft in Molniya orbits. TWINS images the ENA emissions from the inner magnetosphere across a broad range of energies (1 to 100 keV for H, 16 to 256 keV for O). This allows TWINS to observe the evolution in space and time of the trapped and precipitating particles most relevant for storm time dynamics on very high time scales (i.e., minutes). Here we will present the differences seen between moderate storms and the two large storms of 17 March 2015 (Dst < -223, St. Patrick's day storm) and 22 June 2015 (Dst < -195 nT).

We present a comprehensive hydrographic data set from a west Greenland fjord, Godthåbsfjord, a fjord in contact with the Greenland Ice Sheet through tidewater outlet glaciers. We analyze with respect to water masses, dynamics, seasonal and interannual hydrographic variability. Through seasonal observations of hydrographic and moored observations we recognize a seasonal pattern in the fjords circulation system, where an intermediate baroclinic circulation mode driven by tidal currents at the fjord entrance is associated as an important local heat source for the fjord. Four distinct circulation modes are observed in the fjord of which all can contribute to glacial ice melt. In water observation of a subglacial plume core will be presented and discussed with respect to vertical distribution of water masses and local heat budget in the fjord. The example of the extreme case of subglacial plume will be discussed (ice-dammed lake drainage).",

We also examined the distribution of U, which is immobile in its reduced state but mobile when it is oxidized. Elevated U/Th ratios (mean U/Th ratio of 0.70 ± 0.29) in these BIFs relative to the contemporary crust, also signal oxidative mobilization of U. We suggest that reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulated in Earth’s surface environment inducing the oxidative weathering of rocks during the deposition of the Isua BIFs. The precise threshold atmospheric O2 concentrations for the induction of Cr isotope fractionation remain uncertain, but we argue that our data are consistent with the very low levels of oxygen or other ROS indicated by other proxies. Importantly, any trace of Cr that cycled through redox reactions on land would tend both to be heavy, and to mobilize into the contemporaneous run-off more readily than Cr weathered directly as Cr(III). Once having reached the oceans, this fractionated Cr would have been stripped from seawater by Fe (oxy)hydroxides formed during the deposition of BIFs from low oxygen oceans. The reactive oxygen species recorded in Isua sediments may also have been sufficient to support aerobic metabolisms, which are known to occur in extant bacteria at oxygen concentrations as low as 10-8 atm.",

            "abstract": "Changes in Asian summer (June to August) monsoon in response to aerosol and greenhouse gas forcing are examined using observations and the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project - Phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-model, multi-realization ensemble. Results show that during the historical period, CMIP5 models show a predominantly drying trend in Asian monsoon, while in the 21st Century under representative concentration pathway 8.5 (rcp8.5) scenario, monsoon rainfall enhances across the entire Asian domain. The thermodynamic and dynamic mechanisms causing the changes are evaluated using the moisture budget analysis. The drying trend in the CMIP5 historical simulations and the wetting trend in the rcp8.5 projections can be explained by the relative importance of dynamical and thermodynamical contributions to the total moisture convergence. While thermodynamic mechanism dominates in the future, the historical rainfall changes are dominated by the changes in circulation. The relative contributions of aerosols and greenhouse gases (GHGs) on the historical monsoon change are further examined using CMIP5 single-forcing simulations. Rainfall reduces under aerosol forcing and increases under greenhouse gas (GHG) forcing. Aerosol forcing dominates over the greenhouse effect during the historical period, leading to the general drying trend in the all-forcing simulations. While the thermodynamic change of mean moisture convergence in the all-forcing case is dominated by the GHG forcing, the dynamic change in mean moisture convergence in the all-forcing case is dominated by the aerosol forcing. Further analysis using atmospheric GCM with prescribed aerosol and GHG radiative forcing versus those with the prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) warming suggests that the weak circulation changes due to GHG forcing is a result of the cancellation between CO2 radiative forcing and the SST warming, while aerosol radiative effect tends to enhance the circulation response due to SST forcing.",

This is particularly critical for the viability of renewable energy extraction through engineered geothermal systems, which aim at enhancing permeability through controlled fault slip. Existing empirical relations and models for Mmax lack a link between rupture size and the characteristics of the triggering stress perturbation based on earthquake physics. We aim at filling this gap by extending results on the nucleation and arrest of dynamic rupture.\nWe previously derived theoretical relations based on fracture mechanics between properties of overstressed nucleation regions (size, shape and overstress level), the ability of dynamic ruptures to either stop spontaneously or run away, and the final size of stopping ruptures. We verified these relations by comparison to 3D dynamic rupture simulations under slip-weakening friction and to laboratory experiments of frictional sliding nucleated by localized stresses. Here, we extend these results to the induced seismicity context by considering the effect of pressure perturbations resulting from fluid injection, evaluated by hydromechanical modeling. We address the following question: given the amplitude and spatial extent of a fluid pressure perturbation, background stress and fracture energy on a fault, does a nucleated rupture stop spontaneously at some distance from the pressure perturbation region or does it grow away until it reaches the limits of the fault? We present fracture mechanics predictions of the rupture arrest length in this context, and compare them to results of 3D dynamic rupture simulations. We also conduct a systematic study of the effect of localized fluid pressure perturbations on faults governed by rate-and-state friction. We investigate whether injection induces seismic or aseismic slip, depending on the timing of the perturbation relative to the earthquake cycle. Our previous slip-weakening and fracture mechanics analysis provides insight on the results of the rate-and-state models. Implications for the maximum magnitude of seismicity induced by fluid injection are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Two salient features of the 2015 Gorkha, Nepal, earthquake provide new opportunities to evaluate models of earthquake cycle and dynamic rupture.\nThe Gorkha earthquake broke only partially across the seismogenic depth of the Main Himalayan Thrust: its slip was confined in a narrow depth range near the bottom of the locked zone. As indicated by the belt of background seismicity and decades of geodetic monitoring, this is an area of stress concentration induced by deep fault creep. Previous conceptual models attribute such intermediate-size events to rheological segmentation along-dip, including a fault segment with intermediate rheology in between the stable and unstable slip segments. We will present results from earthquake cycle models that, in contrast, highlight the role of stress loading concentration, rather than frictional segmentation. These models produce “super-cycles” comprising recurrent characteristic events interspersed by deep, smaller non-characteristic events of overall increasing magnitude. Because the non-characteristic events are an intrinsic component of the earthquake super-cycle, the notion of Coulomb triggering or time-advance of the “big one” is ill-defined.\nThe high-frequency (HF) ground motions produced in Kathmandu by the Gorkha earthquake were weaker than expected for such a magnitude and such close distance to the rupture, as attested by strong motion recordings and by macroseismic data. Static slip reached close to Kathmandu but had a long rise time, consistent with control by the along-dip extent of the rupture. Moreover, the HF (1 Hz) radiation sources, imaged by teleseismic back-projection of multiple dense arrays calibrated by aftershock data, was deep and far from Kathmandu. We argue that HF rupture imaging provided a better predictor of shaking intensity than finite source inversion. The deep location of HF radiation can be attributed to rupture over heterogeneous initial stresses left by the background seismic activity. Earthquake cycle and dynamic rupture models containing deep asperities reproduce the slower spectral decay found in teleseismic spectra of the Gorkha earthquake and in subduction events in the deeper edge of the seismogenic zone.",

            "abstract": "If a Carrington-type CME event of 1859 hit Earth how might the thermosphere, ionosphere, and plasmasphere respond? To start with, the response would be dependent on how the magnetosphere reacts and channels the energy into the upper atmosphere. For now we can assume the magnetospheric convection and auroral precipitation inputs would look similar to a 2003 Halloween storm but stronger and more expanded to mid-latitude, much like what the Weimer empirical model predicts if the solar wind Bz and velocity were -60nT and 1500km/s respectively. For a Halloween-level geomagnetic storm event, the sequence of physical process in the thermosphere and ionosphere are thought to be well understood. The physics-based coupled models, however, have been designed and somewhat tuned to simulate the response to this level of event that have been observed in the last two solar cycles. For an extreme solar storm, it is unclear if the response would be a natural linear extrapolation of the response or if non-linear processes would begin to dominate. A numerical simulation has been performed with a coupled thermosphere ionosphere model to quantify the likely response to an extreme space weather event. The simulation predict the neutral atmosphere would experience horizontal winds of 1500m/s, vertical winds exceeding 150m/s, and the “top” of the thermosphere well above 1000km. Predicting the ionosphere response is somewhat more challenging because there is significant uncertainty in quantifying some of the other driver-response relationships such as the magnitude and shielding time-scale of the penetration electric field, the possible feedback to the magnetosphere, and the amount of nitric oxide production. Within the limits of uncertainty of the drivers, the magnitude of the response can be quantified and both linear and non-linear responses are predicted.",

We argue that satellite observations not currently used for operational drought monitoring, such as near-surface air relative humidity data from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) mission, provide opportunities to improve early drought warning. Current and future satellite missions offer opportunities to develop composite and multi-indicator drought models. While there are immense opportunities, there are major challenges including data continuity, unquantified uncertainty, sensor changes, and community acceptability. One of the major limitations of many of the currently available satellite observations is their short length of record. A number of relevant satellite missions and sensors (e.g., the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, GRACE) provide only a decade of data, which may not be sufficient to study droughts from a climate perspective. However, they still provide valuable information about relevant hydrologic and ecological processes linked to this natural hazard. Therefore, there is a need for models and algorithms that combine multiple datasets and/or assimilate satellite observations into model simulations to generate long-term climate data records. Finally, the study identifies a major gap in indicators for describing drought impacts on the carbon and nitrogen cycle, which are fundamental to assessing drought impacts on ecosystems.",

Sources of sediment widely considered include agricultural land uses, channel banks and geological zones. There has been a tendency in the literature for sediment fingerprinting to be presented as a technique that can deliver accurate and precise information on source contributions to sediment across a range of environments. However, recent research indicates that such a view of sediment fingerprinting cannot presently be supported. Furthermore, many past papers lack transparency in data processing and presentation that prevents the critical assessment of results and hinders wider uptake of the technique. Therefore, this contribution aims to delve ‘under the hood’ of sediment fingerprinting to promote further discussion and debate over future research needs and method limitations. It draws on important developments from the last two years concerning the effect of (i) tracer selection, (ii) tracer behaviour during transport, (iii) corrections to tracer datasets and (iv) the choice of mixing model on predictions of sediment source contributions. Sediment fingerprinting has the potential to make a very significant contribution to the measurement of contemporary sediment sources in watersheds, but cannot be viewed as an ‘off-the-shelf’ technique for widespread application until important challenges have been addressed.",

            "abstract": "Concentration times in small and medium-sized watersheds (~100–1000 km2) are commonly less than 24 hours. Flood-forecasting models then require data at sub-daily time scales, but time-series of input and runoff data with sufficient lengths are often only available at the daily time scale, especially in developing countries. This has led to a search for time-scale relationships to infer parameter values at the time scales where they are needed from the time scales where they are available. In this study, time-scale dependencies in the HBV-light conceptual hydrological model were assessed within the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) approach. It was hypothesised that the existence of such dependencies is a result of the numerical method or time-stepping scheme used in the models rather than a real time-scale-data dependence. Parameter values inferred showed a clear dependence on time scale when the explicit Euler method was used for modelling at the same time steps as the time scale of the input data (1 to 24 h). However, the dependence almost fully disappeared when the explicit Euler method was used for modelling in 1−hour time steps internally irrespectively of the time scale of the input data. In other words, it was found that when an adequate time-stepping scheme was implemented, parameter sets inferred at one time scale (e.g., daily) could be used directly for runoff simulations at other time scales (e.g., 3 h or 6 h) without any time scaling and this approach only resulted in a small (if any) model performance decrease, in terms of Nash-Sutcliffe and volume-error efficiencies. The overall results of this study indicated that as soon as sub-daily driving data can be secured, flood forecasting in watersheds with sub-daily concentration times is possible with model parameter values inferred from long time series of daily data, as long as an appropriate numerical method is used.",

Some parameters appear to be well monitored, while in other cases, our understanding is directly limited by the lack of quality observations. Detecting trends, attributing change and understanding climate feedbacks require a variety of observations. Making use of historical datasets, we can identify the most critical needs for continued and new observing systems. Decisions about accuracy, spatial resolution, and temporal frequency need to be made judiciously with a careful analysis of the requirements needed to specific scientific questions. This presentation will show initial results from comparing natural variability to the specific questions of detecting trends and addressing climate feedback questions. Combining the high resolution weather Observing System Simulation Exkperiments with the longer timescale needs of climate research, we can make responsible recommendations on future observing systems as well as identify the necessary continuation of existing observing systems.",

            "abstract": "The paradox of the rapid reduction of Arctic sea ice versus the stability (or slight increase) of Antarctic sea ice remains a challenge in the cryospheric science research community. Here we start by reviewing a number of explanations that have been suggested by different researchers and authors. One suggestion is that stratospheric ozone depletion may affect atmospheric circulation and wind patterns such as the Southern Annular Mode, and thereby sustaining the Antarctic sea ice cover. The reduction of salinity and density in the near-surface layer may weaken the convective mixing of cold and warmer waters, and thus maintaining regions of no warming around the Antarctic. A decrease in sea ice growth may reduce salt rejection and upper-ocean density to enhance thermohalocline stratification, and thus supporting Antarctic sea ice production. Melt water from Antarctic ice shelves collects in a cool and fresh surface layer to shield the surface ocean from the warmer deeper waters, and thus leading to an expansion of Antarctic sea ice. Also, wind effects may positively contribute to Antarctic sea ice growth. Moreover, Antarctica lacks of additional heat sources such as warm river discharge to melt sea ice as opposed to the case in the Arctic. Despite of these suggested explanations, factors that can consistently and persistently maintains the stability of sea ice still need to be identified for the Antarctic, which are opposed to factors that help accelerate sea ice loss in the Arctic. In this respect, using decadal observations from multiple satellite datasets, we examine differences in sea ice properties and distributions, together with dynamic and thermodynamic processes and interactions with land, ocean, and atmosphere, causing differences in Arctic and Antarctic sea ice change to contribute to resolving the Arctic-Antarctic sea ice paradox.",

            "abstract": "We present a reactive transport (RT) approach to link hydrologic transport, geochemical transformations and microbial activity influencing the magnitude and residence time of different carbon pools under variably saturated conditions. This model explicitly simulates the simultaneous transport, transformation, fractionation and decay of the three isotopes of carbon (12C, 13C and 14C) through a mechanistic framework. This is demonstrated with a modification of the CrunchTope multi-component RT software to extend the isotope-specific versions of both microbially-mediated and transition state theory (TST) rate laws to accommodate a three-isotope system. In addition both aqueous and solid phase decay of 14C are tracked, yielding in an implicit means of accounting for the 13C/12C correction in normalized radiocarbon ages.\nThe capacity of this approach to quantify the storage and flux of carbon through subsurface compartments is demonstrated using two examples distinguished by timescale. The first considers a simplified flow path in which an influent containing labile organic carbon is distributed by biogenic reduction and mineralization into a suite of reaction products. The residence time of these pools and their characteristic stable isotope ratios are tracked through a variety of transient processes occurring at short timescales (e.g. months). These include a change in fluid flow rate, a limitation of ammonium supporting anabolic growth and an influx of oxygenated fluid. The second example considers the distribution of carbon over the timescale of soil development (e.g., millennia), using a dataset of stable isotope ratios and radiocarbon ages of organic and inorganic carbon present in both dissolved and solid phases from a soil chronosequence near Santa Cruz, CA. The results of these model simulations suggest the promise of this tool for improving our understanding of coupling between hydrologic transport and biogeochemical reactions in soils.",

            "abstract": "Thousands of landslides (predominantly rock slides and rock falls) were triggered as a result of the 2015 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake sequence. Given the steep, high relief of the epicentral zones and the widely distributed population of Nepal in these regions, hundreds of fatalities occurred as a direct result of landsliding. Further, roads, hydroelectric plants, and other critical infrastructure were subjected to considerable secondary hazards including highly weakened slopes and inundation from lake impoundments that formed upslope of valley-blocking landslide dams. As part of a humanitarian and scientific mission to Nepal supported by the U.S. Agency for International Development, Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, we conducted landslide assessments throughout earthquake-affected areas (report available at \nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3133/ofr20151142\n) and, in the process, developed a sense for the overall landslide distribution resulting from the earthquakes. Whereas landslides were abundant near the major earthquake epicenters, few landslides were observed in many steep areas of the country where effects would normally have been expected. For example, although avalanches and ice and rock falls occurred near Mt. Everest, located approximately 220 km from the April 25 epicenter, we noted few landslides in a similar area of steep terrain located 40 km closer to the epicenter. Similarly, although we noted entire mountainsides covered by landslides within 20 km of the mainshock epicenter, we observed many other mountainsides within this same region lacking any indication of ground disturbance. Observations of shattered ridgetops with ridge parallel fractures at several locations indicate that topographically-amplified ground shaking occurred in some areas. This, along with the complex geology and the asymmetric directionality of rupture, could help explain the landslide distribution and thus where hazards are most likely from similar future earthquakes in central Nepal.",

However, not all landscapes are equally susceptible to fire-induced change. As fire frequency is expected to increase in the high latitudes, methods to understand the vulnerability and resilience of different landscapes to permafrost degradation are needed. We present a combination of multi-scale remote sensing, geophysical, and field observations that reveal details of both near-surface (<1 m) and deeper impacts of fire on permafrost. Along 11 transects that span burned-unburned boundaries in different landscape settings within interior Alaska, subsurface imaging indicates locations where permafrost appears to be resilient to disturbance from fire, areas where warm permafrost conditions exist that may be most vulnerable to future change, and also where permafrost has thawed. High-resolution geophysical data corroborate remote sensing interpretations of near-surface permafrost, and also add new high-fidelity details of spatial heterogeneity that extend from the shallow subsurface to depths of about 10 m. Data collected along each transect include observations of active layer thickness (ALT), organic layer thickness (OLT), plant species cover, electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), and downhole Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements. Results show that post-fire impacts on permafrost can be variable, and depend on multiple factors such as fire severity, soil texture, and soil moisture.",

Central to Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, Lake Clark is an important nursery lake for sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in the headwaters of Bristol Bay, Alaska, the most productive wild salmon fishery in the world. Lake Clark water clarity is seasonally influenced by a dynamic glacier fed sediment plume. We reconstructed lake-wide water clarity for Lake Clark using the Landsat TM and ETM+ Climate Data Record archive. Our study period consisted of May – October for 1985-2015. We found 151 (98 partial- and 53 whole-lake) Landsat scenes that captured the lake and/or sediment plume. Water clarity fluctuated on an annual basis with specific conditions common to certain months. Plume development and peak turbidity dates could be estimated for a number of years and mid-season gyres appear to represent wind-induced mixing of lake water. Our results showed short term (sub-decadal) trends in water clarity but little to no long term trend between 1991 and 2014. We did, however, detect interannual variation that exhibited a non-significant (r2 = 0.20) but positive correlation (r = 0.20) with regional mean summer air temperature and found the month of May exhibited a significant positive trend (r2 = 0.68, p-value = 0.02) in turbidity between 2000 and 2014. These results are important because reductions in water clarity within Alaska lake systems as a result of increased glacial runoff have been shown to reduce salmon production via reduced abundance of preferred prey items of juvenile salmon, such as zooplankton and macroinvertebrates.",

A primary component of this volume change is firn compaction, or the rate at which snow compresses into glacial ice. Firn densification models simulate this process, but model outputs vary widely, and Greenland’s rapidly changing climate challenges many of the steady-state assumptions held in most of these models. Contemporary measurements of firn compaction rates are extremely sparse across Greenland in both time and space and are nonexistent in many large regions. Here we present initial results from Greenland’s Firn Compaction Verification and Reconnaissance (FirnCover) Project, a network of real-time strain gauges at over thirty boreholes that continuously monitor compaction rates at eight locations in Greenland’s accumulation zones, ranging from areas of heavy percolation to dry snow. Initial results from these stations indicate a strong seasonality in compaction, especially in regions where heavy melt and refreezing release latent heat into the firn column, a process that will intensify as melt increases across Greenland. We also discuss the substantial challenge of measuring firn compaction in regions of heterogeneous percolation, and other challenges encountered when validating firn models and monitoring contemporary mass changes of the Greenland ice sheet.",

            "abstract": "The oldest signs of animal life appear in the geologic record 600 to 700 million years ago. For the four billion years prior, our planet experienced dramatic changes that paved the way for this milestone. Beyond the establishment of Earth’s earliest oceans 4.3 billion years ago (Ga), the single most important environmental transformation in history may have been the first permanent rise of atmospheric oxygen around 2.3 Ga. Before this Great Oxidation Event (GOE), Earth’s atmosphere and oceans were virtually devoid of this gas, which forms the basis for all macroscopic life. Yet full oxygenation was a long, drawn out process. This talk will lay out the state-of-the-art in our understanding of Earth’s early oxygenation, with an emphasis on the delay between the first biological oxygen production, tentatively placed at 3 Ga, and the appearance of animals almost 2.5 billion years later. Recent work suggests transient oxygenation episodes occurred prior to the GOE. Once permanently present in the atmosphere, oxygen may have risen to very high levels and then nose-dived. Then, at least a billion years of dominantly oxygen-free conditions in the deep ocean followed, beneath an atmosphere and shallow oceans much leaner in oxygen than previous estimates indicated. Deficiencies in oxygen and associated nutrients may have, in turn, set a challenging course for many of the oceans’ inhabitants, explaining persistently low populations and diversities of eukaryotes. The latest data suggest these billion-plus years of intermediate oxygen were followed by increases in both ocean and atmosphere oxygen contents and eukaryotic diversity 750 to 800 million years ago. Novel, rock-bound proxies and complementary numerical models are now steering our views of co-evolving life and marine and atmospheric chemistry, including greenhouse gas controls on climate. New findings are revealing various states of planetary habitability that differ greatly from the Earth we know today. These ‘Alternative Earths’ are helping to guide our search for life elsewhere in the universe at a time of rapid discovery of extrasolar planets.",

However, because monitoring stations are costly, they typically provide only limited spatial coverage, especially in rural and remote areas. We will demonstrate how data from the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument that has been flying on NASA’s Terra Earth Observing System satellite since early 2000 can be used to provide estimates of surface PM types. The current MISR operational aerosol retrieval uses a combination of multi-spectral and multi-angle data to retrieve aerosol optical depth (AOD) and particle property information (including dust AOD) globally at 17.6 km spatial resolution. Using the same algorithm with data collected in all 36-channels at 275 m resolution (Local Mode), which is available over greater Los Angeles area, and also was activated during 2013 DISCOVER-AQ California field campaign, high-resolution 4.4 km aerosol retrievals were performed in addition to the standard 17.6 km retrievals. The 4.4 km spatial resolution of the PM information data is fine enough to be able to resolve local differences in PM loading that may be important for understanding regional health effects of pollution in the region. In particular, we demonstrate that MISR high-resolution AOD retrievals are in better agreement with ground-based aerosol observations and reveal more details about the aerosol spatial variability compared to the MISR standard 17.6 km product. Then we will discuss techniques and show examples of the application of high-resolution MISR data to provide estimates of surface PM for the greater Los Angeles area in 2008 and for California San Joaquin Valley during the 2013 DISCOVER-AQ field campaign. Finally, we will discuss future NASA instruments that will provide new information allowing for better estimates of speciated (size- and particle type- stratified) surface PM from space and improve studies of air pollution on human health.",

However, this possibility has not been fully exploited yet, and right now the data C3 are not included into tomographic inversions to refine seismic structures. Here we show for the first time how to incorporate the data of C1 and C3 to calculate dispersion maps of Rayleigh waves in the range period of 10-120s, and how the merging of these datasets improves the resolution of the structures imaged.\nTomographic images are obtained for an area covering Mexico, the Gulf of Mexico and the southern U.S. We show dispersion maps calculated using both data of C1 and the complete dataset (C1+C3). The latter provide new details of the seismic structure of the region allowing a better understanding of their role on the geodynamics of the study area. The resolving power obtained in our study is several times higher than in previous studies based on ambient noise. This demonstrates the new possibilities for imaging the Earth’s crust and upper mantle using this enlarged database.",

We provide governing equations that predict the porosity distribution as a function of soil water content and six additional parameters, all of which can be determined using laboratory measurements conducted on individual soil samples. We next derive new expressions for the hydraulic properties of such soils, which can be used to model infiltration at the plot scale. Finally, we incorporate these expressions into new models that can be used to predict and quantify surface runoff (i.e., overland flow) thresholds, and which may be used to reveal the dominant mechanisms by which water moves through clayey soils. Altogether, these models successfully link small-scale shrinkage/swelling behaviors with large-scale processes, and can be applied to such practical applications as converting measurements between gravimetric and volumetric water contents, as well as to predicting field-scale processes such as the sealing of individual cracks.",

            "abstract": "At Mt. Ontake, central Japan, a phreatic eruption took place on 27 September 2014. The eruption was preceded for 25 s by a very long period (VLP) seismic event and for 450 s by an accelerated tilt change showing summit uplift. To deepen our understanding of the initiation of the phreatic eruption, we conducted waveform inversion and time series analyses of these preceding events.\nOur waveform inversion of the VLP event pointed to an SSE-NNW strike subvertical tensile crack at around 600 m beneath the eruptive vent region. This crack orientation was subparallel to alignments of volcano-tectonic earthquake hypocenters (Kato et al., 2015) and eruptive vents (Geospatial Information Authority of Japan, 2014) as well as one of the maximum shear directions of the regional stress field (Terakawa et al., 2015). These observations suggest that the VLP source crack was one of the preexisting faults along the maximum shear direction that opened due to passage of ascending gas from depth to the surface.\nOur waveform inversion of the tilt change pointed to an E-W to SE-NW strike subvertical tensile crack at around 1000 m below the surface. To investigate a background physics of the tilt change, we calculated the first and second order integrals of the tilt waveforms (I1(t) and I2(t), respectively, where t is time). The ratio I2(t)/I1(t) initially increased linearly with time and then reached an almost constant value. This time evolution is well modeled by a linear increase of the source crack volume\nV(t)=V0t/t0 (t<t0)\nfollowed by an exponential growth\nV(t)=V0exp{(t-t0)/τ} (t>t0),\nwhere V0 is constant, τ≈84 s, and t0/τ≈2. The initial linear growth of the crack volume may be explained by inflation of water vapor in the vertical crack under constant pressure and heat supply conditions. The latter exponential crack growth may be modeled by a force balance between an overpressure of 104–105 Pa and a viscous resistance of the water vapor near the crack tip (Lister and Kerr, 1991). These models, although tentative, would provide observation-based constraints on a heat-rock-fluid interaction leading up to the phreatic eruption of Mt. Ontake in 2014.",

The Sirdal Magmatic Belt (SMB) and the Hornblende-Biotite Granite (HBG) Suite were emplaced between 1050-1020 Ma and 980-930 Ma, respectively. Geochronology of the Rogaland Anorthosite Province (RAP) indicates that magmatism began at 1041 Ma (high pressure, cogenetic megacrysts) and culminated in anorthosite emplacement at ±930 Ma. Decompression exsolution ages for these high-P megacrysts indicate that decompression during anorthosite ascent took place ±80-100 m.y. after crystallization at the Moho. The contact aureole of the RAP shows concordant arrays of zircon ages between 1050-930 Ma, recording continuous, long-lived high temperature magmatic events in southwestern Norway. Zircon ages from outside the contact aureole show a metamorphic event at ±1035 Ma, but show no younger concordant arrays. Metapelites from the contact aureole of the RAP also show a spread of monazite ages, where monazite inclusions in garnet record ages of 1038-992 Ma, while groundmass monazite preserve ages of 952±10 Ma, indicative of multiple and/or long-lived thermal events. Age coincidence for several events, including matrix monazite formation, megacryst decompression (and anorthosite emplacement) and HBG granite crystallization suggest a dynamic system with multiple feedback loops. Varying isotopic signatures recorded in the region hint at changing sources and processes associated with the genesis of the magmas. These observations indicate that the Sveconorwegian orogeny was a long-lived magmatic system that featured slowly ascending magmas, punctuated periods of magmatism and temporal geochemical variation – features analogous to younger Cordilleran systems. When estimating magmatic tempos in arc environments, factors such as large degrees of differentiation in the lower crust, polybaric magma evolution and slow magma ascent rates should be considered.",

The largest of aftershocks, the M7.3 of May 12, 2015, originated from the same rupture area, caused further damages and casualties. A field investigation of the earthquake affected areas provided an opportunity to study the vulnerability of the built environment and re-assessment of the present day risk exposure of the region which was worst affected in the M8.1 1934 Bihar-Nepal earthquake.\nThe recent earthquake exposed the seismic vulnerability of the built-environment caused by lack of earthquake-resistant construction practices. Heavy damages were observed to old masonry buildings including several heritage structures. Even recent constructions of RC buildings in Kathmandu suffered moderate damage to complete collapse due to many unique and inherently poor construction features, such as open ground storey, inadequate size and poor reinforcement detailing of columns, poor geometric configuration of the buildings, insufficient spacing between adjacent buildings, projection of walls beyond the column lines, weak and slender masonry infill walls, lack of proper site investigation for constructions on sloping ground, etc.\nThe combination of high hazards due to large earthquakes of the Himalayan collision boundary and ever-growing vulnerable built and human environment creates a situation of unacceptably high levels of risk in the Nepal and densely populated IG basin. Since maximum shaking intensity in the heavily populated IG basin was between VI and VII, most structures did escape serious damage, but they continue to remain vulnerable for future design level earthquakes. Moreover, the large scale of liquefaction and soil instability observed in the larger shaking of M8.1 1934 earthquake, may have multiplying effect on structural damages.\nDespite the available knowledge base of effective risk mitigation strategies, it is unfortunate that societies are not adequately prepared due to lack of implementation and, therefore, the seismic risk in the region capable of large to great earthquakes has risen to unacceptable levels which may lead to a large-scale disaster, if not mitigated.",

The reanalysis calculation was conducted using a global CTM and an EnKF data assimilation approach that simultaneously optimises the chemical concentrations of various species and emissions of several precursors. The optimisation of both the multiple species concentration and the emission fields is an efficient method to correct the entire tropospheric profile and its year-to-year variations, and to adjust various tracers chemically linked to the species assimilated, while taking their feedbacks into account. Comparisons against independent aircraft, satellite, and ozonesonde observations demonstrate the quality of the analysed O3, NO2, and CO concentrations on regional and global scales and for both seasonal and year-to-year variations from the lower troposphere to the lower stratosphere. The northern/southern hemisphere OH ratio was modified considerably due to the multiple species assimilation and became closer to an observational estimate, which played an important role in propagating observational information among various chemical fields and affected the emission estimates. In comparison to the a priori emissions based on bottom-up inventories, the optimized surface NOx emissions were higher over eastern China, the eastern United States, southern Africa, and central-western Europe, suggesting that the anthropogenic emissions are mostly underestimated in the inventories. In addition, the seasonality and year-to-year variability of the estimated emissions differed from that of the a priori emission over both industrial and biomass burning areas. The assimilation of multiple chemical data sets with different vertical sensitivity profiles also provides comprehensive constraints on the global lightning NOx source while improving the representations of the entire chemical system affecting atmospheric NOx, including surface emissions and inflows from the stratosphere. The ten-year consistent concentration and emission products provide unique information on year-to-year variations of the atmospheric environment.",

However, understanding of these sediments are essential first to better-constrain early extensional phase and second in term of potential resources.\nThe Turkana depression is a rift system active since the Paleogene, which makes the connection between Kenyan and Ethiopian domes. The southern area consists of four asymmetrical and juxtaposed grabens: the Lokichar, Turkwell, Kerio and South Lake Basin, which have been intensively documented through oil exploration. The northern part is structured into a single asymmetrical graben, the North Lake basin, less-known even oil exploration started. In this contribution, a sedimentary system preserved on the rift shoulder of the North Lake Basin is presented. Referred to as the Topernawi Fm, it is interpreted as recording the earliest phase of Cenozoic rifting in the area.\nThe Topernawi Fm delineates a relic sedimentary basin of limited extension (3 – 5 km). Boundaries of the basin are inherited from basement structures, more precisely from the reactivation during Late Oligocene to Early Miocene of a previous transfer zone producing N40-50° border faults. Basin fills is up to 80 m thick and includes first alluvial fan associated with the reactivation of these faults and then braided fluvial deposits from axial system. Above, several volcanic events recurrently emplaced pyroclastic deposits, repeatedly reworked by fluvial channels. Subsequently, N-S trend faulting cut the Topernawi system during the development of the North Lake Basin and led to its partial preservation over the present-day rift shoulder.\nGeological maps, structural sections across Topernawi basin and sedimentary facies are presented. An integrated model is proposed to illustrate the basin evolution. Implications for rifting in Northern Turkana depression are discussed.",

The observations suggest that small-scale local dynamic and orographic effects, from both the Arabian and African sides, strongly contribute to dust plume formation. To better understand and quantify these processes we present here the first high resolution modeling study of the dust outbreak phenomena in June 2012 over East Africa, the Red Sea, and the Arabian Peninsula using the WRF-Chem model. We identified several dust generating dynamical processes that range from convective to synoptic scales, including: synoptic cyclones, nocturnal low-level jets, and cold pools of mesoscale convective systems. The simulations reveal an eastward transport of African dust across the Red Sea. Over the northern part of the Red Sea most of the dust transport occurs beyond 2 km above ground level and is strengthened by a pressure gradient formed by low pressure over the eastern Mediterranean and high pressure over the Arabian Peninsula. Across the central and southern parts of the Red Sea dust is mostly transported below 2 km height. During the study period dust is a dominant contributor (87%) to aerosol optical depth (AOD), producing a domain average cooling effect of -12.1 W m-2 at surface, a warming of 7.1 W m-2 in the atmosphere, and a residual cooling of -4.9 W m-2 at the top of the atmosphere. WRF-Chem simulations demonstrate that both dry and wet deposition processes contribute significantly to dust removal from the atmosphere. During the dust outbreak 49.2 Tg of dust deposits within the calculation domain, which is approximately 90% of the total dust emission of 54.5 Tg. Model results compare well with available ground-based and satellite observations but generally underestimate the observed AOD maximum values.",

Typically, the result is given in form of the mean recurrence time and a standard deviation as a range of uncertainty, assuming a normally distributed recurrence. We present a 5.5 ka long coastal lake paleotsunami record from south central Chile, which contains 17 tsunami deposits, 9 of which were previously unknown. Our record matches all 3 of the historically known tsunami, as well as all of the 5 known paleotsunami in the region without over- or underrepresentation. We used Bayesian age-depth modelling to calculate an age-depth model and extracted recurrence intervals for 16 recurrence intervals. Our findings confirm the previously published mean tsunami recurrence time on the Valdivia seismic segment of ~300 years. However, our analyses show a strongly bimodal recurrence pattern with one mode at ~115 years and the other mode at ~490 years. The least likely recurrence time between the modes is at ~300 years and coincides with the mean recurrence time. The reasons for the bimodal distribution remain speculative. They can be attributed to either spatial variability, e.g. incomplete segment rupture, splay fault rupture, up- or down-dip rupture, or to temporal variability, e.g. megathrust earthquake clustering, earthquake supercycles. Our findings highlight the importance of recognising the variability in tsunami recurrence patterns before using mean recurrence time for tsunami risk assessment.",

            "abstract": "Deep convective clouds (DCCs) associated with tropical convection, are significant sources of precipitation in Equatorial East Africa. The DCCs play a fundamental role in hydrological and energy cycle. Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model with detailed bin-resolved microphysics are used to explore the diurnal variation of DCCs under maritime/clean and continental/polluted conditions. The sign and magnitude of the Twomey effect, droplet dispersion effect, cloud thickness effect, Cloud Optical Depth (COD) susceptibility to aerosol perturbations, and aerosol effects on clouds and precipitation is evaluated. Twomey effect emerges as dominant in total COD susceptibility to aerosol perturbations. The dispersion effect is positive and accounts for 3-10% of the total COD susceptibility at nighttime, with greater influence on heavier drizzling clouds. The cloud thickness effect is positive (negative) for a moderate/heavy drizzling (light thickness) clouds. The cloud thickness effect results in 5-22% of the nighttime total cloud susceptibility. Cloud microphysical properties and accumulated total precipitation show a complex relationship under varied aerosol conditions. The mean of core updraft and maximal vertical velocity increased (decreased) under low (high) CCN scenarios. Overall, the total COD susceptibility ranges from 0.28-0.53 at night; an increase in aerosol concentration enhances COD, especially with heavier precipitation and in a clean environment. During the daytime, the range of magnitude of each effect is more variable owing to cloud thinning and decoupling. The ratio of the magnitude of cloud thickness effect to that of the Twomey effect depends on cloud thickness and base height in unperturbed clouds while the response of precipitation to increase in aerosol concentration was non-monotonic",

            "abstract": "Fluoride contamination is mainly induced in ground water by chemical interaction between water and fluoride bearing rocks and natural fluoridation is further catalyzed by anthropogenic activities. Elevated fluoride concentrations in the water bodies above the permissible limits are not only degrading water for drinking purposes but also to the agricultural, industrial as well as daily household needs. Fluoride content in water has been constantly a subject of serious concern to the concerned authorities. It is significantly contributing in increasing tolls of arthritis, brain and kidney diseases, cancer, male fertility issues and cases of thyroid diseases. Hence, the present study has been conducted to investigate the possibility of treating fluorinated water using zeolites. The capabilities of natural zeolites are attributed to their catalytic, molecular sieve, adsorption and ion-exchange properties which have been utilized in our laboratory experiment. The experiment was carried out in two phases. In the first phase of the experiment, the properties of zeolites were tested in solid and liquid phases using ICP-OES, SEM, EDX and IC tests. Physio-chemical alterations induced by zeolites in the fluid chemistry were monitored by analyzing fluid sample regularly for pH, redox potential, electrical conductivity and total dissolved solids, and by conducting metal and anion tests. In second phase, zeolite was used for treatment of fluorinated water with known concentration of fluoride, and the geochemical processes associated with fluoride remediation were monitored by conducting non-invasive, invasive geochemical and physical measurements at regular time periods on the water samples collected from both control column and the experiment column. Results thus obtained in this study showed decrease in fluoride concentration over time, indicating the possibility of use of zeolites in treatment of fluorinated water.",

            "abstract": "Observations show that marine-terminating glaciers respond to climate forcing nonlinearly, with periods of slow or negligible glacier advance punctuated by abrupt, rapid retreat. Once glacier retreat has initiated, glaciers can quickly stabilize with a new terminus position. Alternatively, retreat can be sustained for decades (or longer), as is the case for Columbia Glacier, Alaska where retreat initiated ~1984 and continues to this day. Surprisingly, patterns of glacier retreat show ambiguous or even contradictory correlations with atmospheric temperature and glacier surface mass balance. Despite these puzzles, observations increasingly show that intrusion of warm subsurface ocean water into fjords can lead to glacier erosion rates that can account for a substantial portion of the total mass lost from glaciers. Here we use a simplified flowline model to show that even relatively modest submarine melt rates (~100 m/a) near the terminus of grounded glaciers can trigger large increases in iceberg calving leading to rapid glacier retreat. However, the strength of the coupling between submarine melt and calving is a strong function of the geometry of the glacier (bed topography, ice thickness and glacier width). This can lead to irreversible retreat when the terminus is thick and grounded deeply beneath sea level or result in little change when the glacier is relatively thin, grounded in shallow water or pinned in a narrow fjord. Because of the strong dependence on glacier geometry, small perturbations in submarine melting can trigger glaciers in their most advanced—and geometrically precarious—state to undergo sudden retreat followed by much slower re-advance. Although many details remain speculative, our model hints that some glaciers are more sensitive than others to ocean forcing and that some of the nonlinearities of glacier response to climate change may be attributable to variations in difficult-to-detect subsurface water temperatures that need to be better understood.",

It has been found (Khazanov et al. [2014, 2015]) that in order\nto fully understand the formation of this flux at the upper ionospheric boundary, ~ 700 – 800 km, it is important to\nconsider the coupled ionosphere-magnetosphere system. In the diffuse aurora, precipitating electrons initially injected\nfrom the plasma sheet via wave-particle interaction processes degrade in the atmosphere toward lower energies and\nproduce secondary electrons via impact ionization of the neutral atmosphere. These initially precipitating electrons\nof magnetospheric origin can be additionally reflected back into the magnetosphere by the two magnetically\nconjugated atmospheres, leading to a series of multiple reflections that can greatly influence the initially precipitating\nflux at the upper ionospheric boundary (700-800 km) and the resultant population of secondary electrons and electrons\ncascading toward lower energies. In this talk we present the solution of the Boltzman-Landau kinetic equation that\n uniformly describes the entire electron distribution function in the diffuse aurora, including the affiliated production\nof secondary electrons (E < 600eV) and their energy interplay in the magnetosphere and two conjugated ionospheres.\nThis solution takes into account, for the first time, formation electron distribution function in the region of diffuse\naurora starting with the primary injection of plasma sheet electrons via both electron cyclotron harmonic waves and\nwhistler mode chorus waves to the loss cone, and their follow up multiple atmospheric reflections in the two magnetically\nconjugated ionospheres. It is demonstrated that magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling is the key element in the formation\nof electron distribution function in the region of diffuse aurora.",

            "abstract": "The longest records of temperature data from active volcanoes in southern Italy are presented. One dataset comes from continuous monitoring of fumaroles temperature of la Fossa cone of Vulcano (Aeolian Islands), it runs from 1990 to 2014, but the first measurements started in 1984. Another dataset is from thermal aquifers of Mount Etna volcano, since 1989 the acquisition period has been one month, more recently data with hourly frequency are registered on the continuous monitoring network. Both monitoring systems are still ongoing. In 1984 at Vulcano the monitoring of fumaroles suffered of a pioneering approach, our technicians faced for the first time with extreme condition, absence of energy power, temperature range covering up to 2 order of magnitude (from normal ambient to several hundreds °C), steam, corrosive acidic fluids released by fumaroles (Sulphur and Chlorine compounds, Carbon dioxide). The experience matured in the high temperature fumarole field of Vulcano can be useful to support new surveillance programs on other volcanoes around the world. Time series analysis applied to fumaroles temperature highlighted the cyclic character of the main observed variations and major trends, lasting some years. Long term monitoring allowed comparisons of many temperature subsets with other validated geochemical and geophysical dataseries and highlighted common source mechanisms accounting for endogenous processes. Changes in the magma source and/or seismo-tectonic activity are the primary causes of the main time variations. A similar comparative approach has been applied to time series of temperature data recorded on Etna volcano. Time relationships have been found with the eruptive activity, particularly with the emission rates of volcanic products, although the monitoring sites are far from the eruptive vents. The collected data show confirmation about the effectiveness of the geochemical approach to follow in real time changes from the source, even being far from estimation of magmatic energy release retrieved by surface temperature monitoring.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the dynamics of fluvial floods is paramount to accurate flood hazard and risk modeling. Currently, economic losses due to flooding constitute about one third of all damage resulting from natural hazards. Given future projections of climate change, the anticipated increase in the World’s population and the associated implications, sound knowledge of flood hazard and related risk is crucial.\nFluvial floods are cross-border phenomena that need to be addressed accordingly. Yet, only few studies model floods at the large-scale which is preferable to tiling the output of small-scale models. Most models cannot realistically model flood wave propagation due to a lack of either detailed channel and floodplain geometry or the absence of hydrologic processes. This study aims to develop a large-scale modeling tool that accounts for both hydrologic and hydrodynamic processes, to find and understand possible sources of errors and improvements and to assess how the added hydrodynamics affect flood wave propagation.\nFlood wave propagation is simulated by DELFT3D-FM (FM), a hydrodynamic model using a flexible mesh to schematize the study area. It is coupled to PCR-GLOBWB (PCR), a macro-scale hydrological model, that has its own simpler 1D routing scheme (DynRout) which has already been used for global inundation modeling and flood risk assessments (GLOFRIS; Winsemius et al., 2013). A number of model set-ups are compared and benchmarked for the simulation period 1986-1996: (0) PCR with DynRout; (1) using a FM 2D flexible mesh forced with PCR output and (2) as in (1) but discriminating between 1D channels and 2D floodplains, and, for comparison, (3) and (4) the same set-ups as (1) and (2) but forced with observed GRDC discharge values. Outputs are subsequently validated against observed GRDC data at Óbidos and flood extent maps from the Dartmouth Flood Observatory.\nThe present research constitutes a first step into a globally applicable approach to fully couple hydrologic with hydrodynamic computations while discriminating between 1D-channels and 2D-floodplains. Such a fully-fledged set-up would be able to provide higher-order flood hazard information, e.g. time to flooding and flood duration, ultimately leading to improved flood risk assessment and management at the large scale.",

            "abstract": "Resource development, whether in agriculture, mining and/or energy, is set to have significant consequences for the groundwater resources of Australia in the short to medium term. These industry sectors are of significant economic value to the country and consequently their support remains a priority for State and Federal Governments alike. The scale of potential developments facilitated in large part by the Government Programs, like the West Australian (WA) Government’s “Water for Food” program, and the South Australian’s Government’s PACE program, will result in an increase in infrastructure requirements, including access to water resources and Aboriginal lands to support these developments. However, the increased demand for water, particularly groundwater, is likely to be compromised by the limited information we have about these resources. This is particularly so for remote parts of the country which are targeted as primary development areas. There is a recognised need to expand this knowledge so that water availability is not a limiting factor to development. Governments of all persuasions have therefore adopted geophysical technologies, particularly airborne electromagnetics (AEM), as a basis for extending the hydrogeological knowledge of data poor areas.\nIn WA, the State Government has employed regional-scale AEM surveys as a basis for defining groundwater resources to support mining, regional agricultural developments whilst aiming to safeguard regional population centres, and environmental assets. A similar approach is being employed in South Australia. These surveys are being used to underpin conceptual hydrogeological frameworks, define basin-scale hydrogeological models, delimit the extent of saltwater intrusion in coastal areas, and to determine the groundwater resource potential of remote alluvial systems aimed at supporting new, irrigation-based, agricultural developments in arid parts of the Australian outback. In the absence of conventional hydrogeological information, geophysical methods are demonstrably a cost and time effective approach to upscaling local hydrogeological information, thereby fast tracking groundwater resource assessments that would otherwise take decades to complete.",

The data are acquired by avionics magnetometers of the Iridium satellites and allow measurements from 66 satellites in near-polar circular, low altitude orbits. The configuration of the Iridium satellite constellation determines the longitude sampling spacing of ~ 2 hours and the re-sampling cadence of the system which is 9 minutes. From 2008 to 2013 the AMPERE system was developed which included new flight software on the Iridium satellites to allow telemetry of higher rate data to the ground and the Science Data Center to derive Birkeland current perturbations from the data and invert these signals to derive the global distributions of the currents using data windows of ten minutes. There were many challenges in developing AMPERE including automating inter-calibration between satellites and the baseline determination and removals. The results of AMPERE provide stunning confirmation of many of the statistical estimates for the distribution of currents but more significantly open a new window to understand their instantaneous distribution and dynamics. Examples of new features of the currents and their dynamics revealed by AMPERE are presented. In addition, prospects for new data products and increased data quality anticipated from AMPERE-NEXT to be implemented on the Iridium-NEXT generation of satellites are discussed.",

            "abstract": "The first statement from the US Geological Survey to the California Office of Emergency Services quantifying the probability of a possible future earthquake was made in October 1985 about the probability (approximately 5%) that a M4.7 earthquake located directly beneath the Coronado Bay Bridge in San Diego would be a foreshock to a larger earthquake. In the next 30 years, publication of aftershock advisories have become routine and formal statements about the probability of a larger event have been developed in collaboration with the California Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council (CEPEC) and sent to CalOES more than a dozen times. Most of these were subsequently released to the public. These communications have spanned a variety of approaches, with and without quantification of the probabilities, and using different ways to express the spatial extent and the magnitude distribution of possible future events. The USGS is re-examining its approach to aftershock probability statements and to operational earthquake forecasting with the goal of creating pre-vetted automated statements that can be released quickly after significant earthquakes. All of the previous formal advisories were written during the earthquake crisis. The time to create and release a statement became shorter with experience from the first public advisory (to the 1988 Lake Elsman earthquake) that was released 18 hours after the triggering event, but was never completed in less than 2 hours. As was done for the Parkfield experiment, the process will be reviewed by CEPEC and NEPEC (National Earthquake Prediction Evaluation Council) so the statements can be sent to the public automatically. This talk will review the advisories, the variations in wording and the public response and compare this with social science research about successful crisis communication, to create recommendations for future advisories",

The ability to quantitatively predict C cycling in TDFs under global change is constrained by tremendous spatial heterogeneity in soil parent material, land-use history, and plant community composition. To explore this variation, we examined soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics in 18 permanent plots spanning orthogonal gradients of stand age and soil fertility. Soil C and N pools, microbial biomass, and microbial extracellular enzyme activities were most variable at small (m2) spatial scales. However, the ratio of organic vs. inorganic N cycling was consistently higher in forest stands dominated by slow-growing, evergreen trees that associate with ectomycorrhizal fungi. Similarly, although bulk litter stocks and turnover rates varied greatly among plots, litter decomposition tended to be slower in ectomycorrhizae-dominated stands. Soil N cycling tended to be more conservative in older plots, although the relationship between stand age and element cycling was weak. Our results emphasize that microscale processes, particularly interactions between mycorrhizal fungi and free-living decomposers, are important controls on ecosystem-scale element cycling.",

Near-global aquaplanet simulations with 4 km horizontal resolution and no cumulus or boundary-layer parameterization are used to test the importance of these feedbacks to realistically organized tropical convection. A 20480x10240 km equatorially centered channel with latitudinally varying SST is used. Realistic midlatitude and tropical cloud structures develop (see attached image). The natural zonal variability of humidity and convection are studied in a 30 day control simulation. A small white-noise humidity perturbation is then added to explore temporal perturbation growth. Atmospheric column budgets of moist static energy (MSE) quantify its covariability with precipitation, surface heat flux and radiative energy loss. Zonal Fourier analysis partitions these budgets by length scale.\nRadiative feedbacks on MSE natural variability and perturbation growth are found to be positive, broadly similar across scales, and comparable to limited-area CRMs, capable of e-folding a column MSE perturbation in 10 days. In contrast, in the presence of horizontal SST gradients, synoptic-scale dry intrusions with enhanced surface latent heat fluxes damp tropical MSE perturbations and inhibit aggregation. Over sub-10-day timescales, dynamically-driven feedbacks dominate. The tropics and midlatitudes have similar timescales for loss of large-scale deterministic predictability.\nThis work is under review:\nBretherton, C. S., and M.

The outstanding performance is enabled by: (1) a revolutionary new type of high flux x-ray source designed to be >10X brighter than the brightest rotating anode x-ray source available; (2) an axially symmetric x-ray mirror lens with large solid angle collection and high focusing efficiency; and (3) a detector configuration that enables the collection of 10X more x-rays than current microXRF designs. The sensitivity will be ppm-scale, far surpassing charged particle analysis (e.g. EPMA and SEM-EDS), and >1000X throughput over the leading micro-XRFs.\nDespite the introduction of a number of laboratory microXRF systems in the past decade, the state-of-the-art has been limited primarily by low resolution (~30 µm) and low throughput. This is substantially attributable to a combination of low x-ray source brightness and poor performance x-ray optics. Here we present our initial results in removing the x-ray source bottleneck, in which we use a novel x-ray source using Fine Anode Array Source Technology (Sigray FAAST™). When coupled with our proprietary high efficiency x-ray mirror lens, the throughput achieved is comparable to that of many synchrotron microXRF beamlines.\nPotential applications of the x-ray microprobe include high throughput mapping of mineralogy at high resolution, including trace elements, such as rare earth metals, and deposits (e.g. siderite, clays), with ppm sensitivity, providing information for properties such as permeability and elastic/mechanical properties, and to provide compositional information for Digital Rock. Additional applications include those in which the limited penetration of electrons limits achieving adequate statistics, such as determining the concentration of precious minerals in mine tailings.",

Few paleomagnetic studies have been carried out, and whether the bending is a primary curvature or a true orocline is still matter of controversy; also the mechanism of its formation. We have conducted a paleomagnetic study between 50°S to ~56°S, where 146 sites were drilled. Paleomagnetic data were obtained in 44 sites. Results in Early Cretaceous sediments and volcanics rocks confirm a remagnetization event during the mid-Cretaceous and record ~90° of counterclockwise rotation. Paleomagnetic results in mid-Cretaceous intrusives rocks record large counterclockwise rotation (>90°) while Late Cretaceous-Early Eocene intrusive rocks only record ~45° to ~30°. The paleomagnetic results reveal a systematic pattern of rotation—the Fueguian rotation pattern—suggesting that the curvature of Patagonia would have occurred in two stages: the first stage during the collapse and obduction of the Rocas Verdes basin in the mid-Cretaceous and a second stage between the Late Cretaceous and the Paleocene, concomitant with exhumation of Cordillera Darwin and propagation of the fold and thrust belt into the Magallanes foreland. Integrating this result in plate reconstructions shows the Antarctic Peninsula as a prolongation of Patagonia and would have acted as a non-rotational rigid block, facilitating the development of the Patagonia Bend. This land bridge could be a dispersal mechanism for fauna between Australia and South America and would have restricted deep ocean water circulation.",

A number of Budyko functions have been proposed to describe such a relationship between E0/P and E/P. There is, however, no simple method to generate Budyko functions that meet the water and energy constraints. This study showed analytically that for any Budyko function, the sum of elasticity of evapotranspiration with respect to potential evapotranspiration and that with respect to precipitation equals to unity. This complementary relationship for sensitivity of evapotranspiration has important implications for evaluating hydrologic impact of change in climate and/or catchment characteristics. More importantly, this study found a function that is monotonically increasing with simple limiting properties. This function can be used to generate numerous valid Budyko functions, and can also be used to test the validity of the existing Budyko functions.",

During each encounter, reconnection jets were observed with their velocities up to more than 500 km/s, significantly higher than the background flow in the magnetosheath. The fast flows match the theoretical prediction of Alfvenic acceleration well. The medium temperature and density of ions in the boundary layer indicate the open magnetic field topology inside this layer. The mainly southward and tailward flows of the plasma jets alongside with the negative slopes of the Walén test indicate that the spacecraft was located south of the reconnection site, consistent with both anti-parallel and component reconnection models. The accelerated flows were observed lasting for about one hour, with some modulations by the oscillations of the magnetopause, but no reversals in the direction of Vz were found during the interval. The significantly enhanced flows in the boundary layer compared to the adjacent magnetosheath indicate that the reconnection was quasi-continuously active at the magnetopause northward of the spacecraft under such IMF conditions. At the same time, the bipolar signatures in BN with enhancements of the magnetic field indicated the occurrence of the Flux Transfer Events (FTEs). The observed reconnection was quasi-continuous, whereas the simultaneously accompanied FTEs were time-dependent under the IMF Bz≈0 nT. For this event, however, it is not possible to identify whether the reconnection was anti-parallel or component because the TC-1 was far away from the reconnection site.",

            "abstract": "Water use efficiency (WUE) is a crucial parameter to describe the interrelationship between gross primary production (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET). Incorporating the nonlinear effect of vapor pressure deficit (VPD), underlying WUE (uWUE=GPP·VPD0.5/ET) is better than inherent WUE (IWUE=GPP·VPD/ET) at the half-hourly time scale. However, appropriateness of uWUE has not yet been evaluated at the daily time scale. To determine whether uWUE is better than IWUE, daily data for 7 vegetation types from 34 AmeriFlux sites were used to validate uWUE at the daily time scale. First, daily mean VPD was shown to be a good substitute for the effective VPD that was required to preserve daily GPP totals. Secondly, an optimal exponent, k*, corresponding to the best linear relationship between GPP·VPDk* and ET, was about 0.53 both at half-hourly and daily time scales. Thirdly, correlation coefficient between GPP·VPDk and ET showed that uWUE (k=0.5 & r=0.85) was a better approximation of the optimal WUE (k=k* & r=0.86) than IWUE (k=1 & r=0.81) at the daily scale. Finally, when yearly uWUE was used to predict daily GPP from daily ET and mean VPD, uWUE worked considerably better than IWUE. Comparing observed and predicted daily GPP, the average correlation coefficient and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency were 0.81 and 0.59, respectively, using yearly uWUE, and only 0.59 and -0.83 using yearly IWUE. As a nearly optimal WUE, uWUE consistently outperformed IWUE, and could be used to evaluate the effects of global warming and elevated atmosphere CO2 on carbon assimilation and evapotranspiration.",

Linked data for the System for Earth Sample Registration (SESAR) is the first effort of IEDA to show how linked data enhance the presentation of IEDA data system architecture. SESAR Linked Data maps each table and column in SESAR database to RDF class and property based on GeoLink view, which build on the top of GeoLink ODPs. Then, uses D2RQ dumping the contents of SESAR database into RDF triples on the basis of mapping results. And, the dumped RDF triples is loaded into GRAPHDB, an RDF graph database, as permanent data in the form of atomic facts expressed as subjects, predicates and objects which provide support for semantic interoperability between IEDA and other GeoLink partners. Finally, an integrated browsing and searching interface build on Callimachus, a highly scalable platform for publishing linked data, is introduced to make sense of data stored in triplestore. Drill down and through features are built in the interface to help users locating content efficiently. The drill down feature enables users to explore beyond the summary information in the instance list of a specific class and into the detail from the specific instance page. The drill through feature enables users to jump from one instance to another one by simply clicking the link of the latter nested in the former region. Additionally, OpenLayers map is embedded into the interface to enhance the attractiveness of the presentation of instance which has geospatial information. Furthermore, by linking instances in the SESAR datasets to matching or corresponding instances in external sets, the presentation has been enriched with additional information about related classes like person, cruise, etc.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that changes in cloud microphysical processes can have a significant effect on the structure and evolution of cloud systems. In particular, changes in water phase and the associated energy sources and sinks have a direct influence on cloud mass and precipitation, and an indirect effect on cloud system thermodynamic properties and dynamics. The details of cloud particle nucleation and growth, as well as the interactions among vapor, liquid, and ice phases, occur on scales too small to be explicitly simulated in the vast majority of numerical models. These processes are represented by approximations that introduce uncertainty into the simulation of cloud mass and spatial distribution and by extension the simulation of the cloud system itself.\nThis presentation demonstrates how Bayesian methodologies can be used to explore the relationships between cloud microphysics and cloud content, precipitation, dynamics, and radiative transfer. Specifically, a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is used to compute the probability distribution of cloud microphysical parameters consistent with particular mesoscale environments. Two different physical systems are considered. The first example explores the multivariate functional relationships between precipitation, cloud microphysics, and the environment in a deep convective cloud system. The second examines how changes in cloud microphysical parameters may affect orographic cloud structure, precipitation, and dynamics. In each case, the Bayesian framework can be shown to provide unique information on the inter-dependencies present in the physical system.",

We analyzed the seismic potential sections of the fault zones combining with the spatial distribution of b-values and the spatial-temporal pattern of earthquake rupture. The results show that before the Wenchuan earthquake the southernmost segment of Xianshuihe fault is completely locked to 25km, the middle-southern segment is tightly locked from the surface to 10-15km depth, and the middle-northern segment is in creeping state. The southernmost segment of Anninghe fault is weakly locked, while the locking depth of other segments are between 10km to 15km. Zemuhe fault is completely locked except the locking fraction of the southernmost segment being about 0.8. Xiaojiang fault is weakly locked in four regions including the south of Qiaojia, the south of Dongchuan, the neighborhood of Yiliang and the north of Huaning, while other segments are tightly locked. The fault locking inverted by GPS velocity between 10 years indicates that the Daofu-Bamei segment of Xianshuihe fault, the middle segment of Anninghe fault, the middle-northern segment of Zemuhe fault, the northern segment of Xiaojiang fault around Dongchuan, and the Huaning-Jianshui segment of Xiaojiang fault are seismic potential segments, which is consistent with the potential segments indicated by seismic gaps along the fault zones of geological scale and the spatial distribution of b-values during 30 years. The velocity distribution far and near fault zone and the block movement changed after the Wenchuan earthquake, and such adjustment of regional crustal movement made the fault locking state inverted by the negative dislocation model change.\nKeywords: The eastern boundary of the Sichuan-Yunnan rhombic block; The Wenchuan earthquake; Negative dislocation inversion of DEFNODE; Fault locking; Slip deficit",

            "abstract": "In the context of hydrologic designs, robust assessment and communication of risk is crucial to ascertain a sustainable water future. Traditional methods for defining return period, risk or reliability assumes a stationary regime which may no longer be valid because of natural or man-made changes. Reformulations are suggested in recent literature to account for non-stationarity in the definition of hydrologic risk, as time evolves. This study presents a comparative analysis of design levels under non-stationarity based on time varying annual exceedance probabilities, waiting time of a hazardous event, number of hazardous events and probability of failure. A case study application is shown for peak streamflow in the flood-prone delta area of the Krishna River in India where an increasing trend in annual maximum flows are observed owing to persistent silting. Considerable disagreement is found between the design magnitudes of flood obtained by the different definitions of hydrologic risk. Such risk is also found to be highly sensitive to the assumed design life period and projections of trend in that period or beyond. Additionally, some critical points on the assumption of a deterministic non-stationary model for an observed natural process are also discussed. The findings highlight the necessity for a unifying framework for assessment and communication of hydrologic risk under transient hydro-climatic conditions. The concepts can also be extended to other applications such as regional hydrologic frequency analysis or development of precipitation intensity-duration-frequency relationships for infrastructure design.",

We use a catalog of more than 1.8 million LFEs regrouped into more than 1000 families observed over 2 years in the Guerrero subduction zone in Mexico, considering each family as an individual repetitive source or asperity. We develop a statistical analysis to determine whether the subcatalogs corresponding to different sources represent random Poisson processes or if they exhibit scale-invariant clustering in time, which we interpret as a manifestation of collective behavior. For each individual LFE source, we compare their level of collective behavior during two time periods: during the six-month-long 2006 Mw 7.5 slow-slip event and during a calm period with no observed slow slip. We find that the collective behavior of LFEs depends on distance from the trench and increases when the subduction interface is slowly slipping. Our results suggest that the occurrence of strong episodes of tectonic tremors cannot be simply explained by increased rates of low frequency earthquakes at every individual LFE source but correspond to an enhanced collective behavior of the ensemble of LFE asperities.",

A series of simulations was carried out for the 2001-2010 period either with all urban emissions included (base case) or without considering urban emissions. Further, the sensitivity of ozone production to urban emissions was examined by performing reduction experiments with -20% emission perturbation of NOx and/or\nNMVOC. The model was validated using surface measurements of key pollutants.\nSelected air-quality measures were used as metrics describing the cities emission impact on regional air pollution. Due to urban emissions, significant ozone titration over occurs over cities while over rural areas futher from them, ozone production os modeled, mainly in terms of number of exceedances and accumulated exceedances over the threshold of 40 ppbv. Urban NOx, SO2 and PM2.5 emissions\nalso significantly contribute to concentrations in the cities themselves (up to 50-70% for NOx and SO2 , and up to 55% for PM2.5), but the contribution is large over rural areas as well (10-20%).\nAlthough air pollution over cities is largely determined by the local urban emissions, considerable (often a few tens of %) fraction of the concentration is attributable to other sources from rural areas\nand minor cities.\nThe radiative impact of the perturbed air chemistry (gases/aerosols) due to urban emissions is dominated mainly by the aerosol direct/indirect effect and is characterized by decrease of temperatures up to -0.08 K at the surface but the decrease concerns the whole PBL. Decreases are modeled for the PBL height as well, while the impact on total precipitation and wind speed is statistically insignifcant. The impact of all (urban and non-urban) emissions is about up to -0.2, so considerable part of the radiative effects of all emissions is attributable to urban emissions. The partial climate impact of urban emissions induced ozone, sulfate and nitrate changes are presented as well.",

            "abstract": "That Earth owes its oxygenated atmosphere to its presently unique claim on life is clear, but how its atmosphere evolved from an initially oxygen-free state remains unresolved. Here, we show that continents underwent a transformation from mafic to felsic compositions at about 2.7-2.5 Ga. We show that the generation of large amounts of felsic magmas requires hydrous parental magmas, which can only be generated by introduction of water into the mantle source of the hydrous parents. This suggests that this compositional shift in crust marked a switch from stagnant lid to a mobile lid (plate tectonics) convective regime. This compositional transformation resulted in a decrease in the oxidative weathering efficiency of the Earth’s surface, which allowed atmospheric O2 to rise rapidly to a new steady state after ~2 Ga. Over the next billion years, steady accumulation of carbon deposited on continental shelves resulted in a gradual increase in the total CO2 inputs into the ocean and atmosphere system as metamorphic and magmatically induced degassing of the growing continental carbon reservoir amplified that from the mantle. Because oxygen production is formed by net organic carbon burial, which scales with total CO2 production, the increasing CO2 inputs to the ocean and atmosphere results in increasing O2 production. This causes slow build-up of atmospheric O2 until a threshold is reached at which atmospheric O2 levels run away, culminating in the oxygenated atmospheric conditions of the Phanerozoic. A two-step rise in atmospheric O2 is thus a necessary consequence of plate tectonics, continent formation and the growth of a crustal carbon reservoir. A provocative prediction of this work is that atmospheric CO2 concentrations may not have been as high in the Archean and Proterozoic as seems required to compensate for the faint young sun.",

            "abstract": "The Early Toarcian Oceanic Anoxic Event (T-OAE, ~182 Ma ago) represents an episode of organic-rich deposition that was accompanied by a substantial (up to 7‰) negative carbon-isotope excursion (CIE), suggesting a perturbation in the carbon cycle likely driven by the addition of \"light\" carbon to the ocean-atmosphere system. Paired δ13Corg-ratios and hydrogen-indices provide evidence for major changes in organic-matter sourcing which quantitatively affect CIE-magnitude. Underpinning the relationship between this carbon-cycle perturbation, ocean anoxia and primary productivity feedbacks thus remains a major challenge.\nWe here present palynological- and organic-matter analysis data from outcrop sections in Yorkshire (UK) and three drill-cores from the Netherlands. In addition, elemental ratios and iron speciation data aid to constrain bottom-water oxygenation and euxinia. Stratigraphic calibrations were achieved with high-resolution δ13Corg-data. The iron-speciation and trace-element data indicate that persistent euxinic bottom-water conditions incept at the base of- and remarkably persist after the T-OAE. By employing extremely careful palynological preparation and UV-fluorescence microscopy, we assessed changes in phytoplankton communities and organic-matter types. At the base of the T-OAE a major increase in abundance of prasinophycean vegetative cysts indicates chemocline shoaling into the photic zone. During the T-OAE, all localities are characterized by organic-matter associations dominated by dense Structureless Organic Matter (SOM) that contain abundant characteristic sphaerical palynomorphs.\nThese results confirm changes in organic-carbon sourcing, which exaggerate the magnitude of the CIE. The palynological and organic-matter data indicate that primary productivity did not collapse and that TOC-accumulations were not merely an effect of inhibited remineralization duirng anoxia. In contrast, we present a scenario in which cyanobacterial anoxygenic photosynthesis proliferated in a stratified and nutritious surface-water environment. Since these patterns are recorded synchronously across large distance, we conclude that the restricted NW-European basin was strongly perturbed by changes in run-off, likely as a consequence of the CIE.

By 1999 oil refineries had implemented selenium removal processes that dramatically dropped the concentrations of total dissolved selenium and selenite by over 65% in the estuarine water column. Surprisingly, the concentrations of selenium in suspended particles did not drop as dramatically. We suspect that changes in the ecosystem, including the abundance of certain phytoplankton species and changes in benthic grazing affect the abundance of selenium in suspended particles.

            "abstract": "A persistent spread in winter albedo has been found in Phase 3 and Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) simulations, and is particularly pronounced in boreal forest regions. The primary goal of this study is to investigate the role of leaf area index (LAI) specification in the large spread in winter albedo simulated by the CMIP5 models. Simulated LAI and surface albedo from the CMIP5 models are compared with satellite observations. The results show that improper plant functional type specification and erroneous LAI parameterization in some models can explain an observed positive bias in winter albedo over boreal forest regions of the Northern Hemisphere. This contributes to a large intermodel spread in simulated surface albedo in the presence of snow over these regions and is largely responsible for uncertainties in simulated snow-albedo feedback strength. The errors are largest (+20-40 %) in models with large underestimation of LAI and are typically within ±15% when simulated LAI is within the observed range. This is confirmed by sensitivity tests with the Canadian Atmospheric Global Climate Model coupled with the Canadian Land Surface Scheme version 3.6.",

            "abstract": "Geological expertise and petrophysical relationships can be brought together to provide prior information while inverting multiple geophysical datasets. The merging of such information can result in more realistic solution in the distribution of the model parameters, reducing ipse facto the non-uniqueness of the inverse problem. We consider two level of heterogeneities: facies, described by facies boundaries and heteroegenities inside each facies determined by a correlogram. In this presentation, we pose the geophysical inverse problem in terms of Gaussian random fields with mean functions controlled by petrophysical relationships and covariance functions controlled by a prior geological cross-section, including the definition of spatial boundaries for the geological facies. The petrophysical relationship problem is formulated as a regression problem upon each facies. The inversion of the geophysical data is performed in a Bayesian framework. We demonstrate the usefulness of this strategy using a first synthetic case for which we perform a joint inversion of gravity and galvanometric resistivity data with the stations located at the ground surface. The joint inversion is used to recover the density and resistivity distributions of the subsurface. In a second step, we consider the possibility that the facies boundaries are deformable and their shapes are inverted as well. We use the level set approach to perform such deformation preserving prior topological properties of the facies throughout the inversion. With the help of prior facies petrophysical relationships and topological characteristic of each facies, we make posterior inference about multiple geophysical tomograms based on their corresponding geophysical data misfits. The method is applied to a second synthetic case showing that we can recover the heterogeneities inside the facies, the mean values for the petrophysical properties, and, to some extent, the facies boundaries using the 2D joint inversion of gravity and galvanometric resistivity data. For this 2D synthetic example, we note that the position of the facies are well-recovered except far from the ground surfce where the sensitivity is too low. The figure shows the evolution of the shape of the facies during the inversion itertion by iteration.",

Hydrate distribution in sediments may cause the bulk physical properties of their host sediments varying several orders of magnitude even with the same amount of hydrate. In natural sediments, hydrate morphology is inherently governed by the burial depth and the grain size of the host sediments. Compare with patchy hydrate, uniformly distributed hydrate is more destructive to fluid flow, yet leads to higher gas and water permeability during hydrate dissociation due to the easiness of forming percolation paths. Water and hydrate have similar thermal conductivity values; the bulk thermal conductivity of hydrate-bearing sediments depends critically on gas-phase saturation. 60% of gas saturation may result in evident thermal conductivity drop and hinder further gas production. Sediments with patchy hydrate yield lower stiffness than that with cementing hydrate but higher stiffness than that with pore filling and loading bearing hydrate. Besides hydrate distribution, the stress state and loading history also play an important role in the mechanical behavior of hydrate-bearing sediments.",

It comes in various varieties manifested as compositional sub groups, erupts from a wide variety of volcanic systems and tectonic settings, and its eruptions span many order of magnitude in duration and volume. Igneous petrology, thermodynamics, geochemistry, and geodynamical modelling have been used to develop a sophisticated understanding of source lithologies, compositions and formation conditions (e.g., pressure and temperature) for parent melts and their subsequent transport, storage and evolution. These demonstrate some striking systematics as a function of volcano tectonic setting (on Earth). Yet much like Whisky, what makes it into the bottle, or the eruption, is a mixture of different liquids with unique characteristics, sometimes stirred so well that successive batches are indistinguishable, and sometimes stirred more incompletely, preserving small batch characters that are unique. Recently, geochemical and petrological studies in high spatial density within the products of individual eruptions have shown chemical and mineralogical evidence for incompletely mixed heterogeneous magmas in a majority of systems examined, begging the question of when, if ever, is it realistic to speak of a single parent magma composition, and even in cases where it apparently is, if these are instead just more thoroughly stirred multi-parent magmas. For instance, do monogenetic fields really erupt basalts of more varied parent melt compositions than large hot spot and flood basalt eruptions, or are they just more poorly stirred? This presentation will focus on work by ourselves and others constraining spatial and temporal single-eruption basaltic magma histories at different settings, using them to unravel the time and space scales of magma formation and mixing, how these translate to the assembly of an erupted basalt magma, and the implications for deducing things about and from presumed parents.",

            "abstract": "Establishing a commercially viable extraction technique for methane gas production from hydrate-bearing sediments has been a major challenge. Hydrates, existing as solids in pores, make the host soil stronger, stiffer and more dilatant. Hydrates also occupy pore space, inhibiting fluid flow. Transforming them into gas phase through hydrate dissociation would therefore alter geomechanical as well as hydraulic characteristics of the hydrate-bearing sediments. These changes may cause sand migration, often excessively as has been found in the past field trials, and lead to termination of gas production operations. A better understanding of causes and effects of sand migration during gas production in hydrate-bearing sediments is therefore a vital step towards successful long-term operations.\nThis abstract presents an overview of the developed thermo-hydro-mechanical sand migration model in hydrate-bearing sediments. The highlights of the developed model include [1] sand (solid) status changes from intact, flowing to settled based on hydraulic gradient; [2] multiphase media for grain flow; [3] pressure and temperature field change due to grain flow; and [4] effective stress reduction induced by grain detachment.",

            "abstract": "Snow cover is a critical driver of the Earth’s surface energy budget, climate change, and water resources. Variations in snow cover not only affect the energy budget of the land surface but also represent a major water supply source. In California, US estimates of snow depth, extent, and melt in the Sierra Nevada are critical to estimating the amount of water available for both California agriculture and urban users. However, accurate estimates of snow cover and snow melt processes in forested area still remain a challenge. Canopy structure influences the vertical and spatiotemporal distribution of snow, and therefore ultimately determines the degree and extent by which snow alters both the surface energy balance and water availability in forested regions. In this study we use the Advanced Canopy-Atmosphere-Soil algorithm (ACASA), a multi-layer soil-vegetation-atmosphere numerical model, to simulate the effect of different snow-covered canopy structures on the energy budget, and temperature and other scalar profiles within different forest types in the Sierra Nevada, California. ACASA incorporates a higher order turbulence closure scheme which allows the detailed simulation of turbulent fluxes of heat and water vapor as well as the CO2 exchange of several layers within the canopy. As such ACASA can capture the counter gradient fluxes within canopies that may occur frequently, but are typically unaccounted for, in most snow hydrology models. Six different canopy types were modeled ranging from coniferous forests (e.g. most biomass near the ground) to top-heavy (e.g. most biomass near the top of the crown) deciduous forests to multi-layered forest canopies (e.g. mixture of young and mature trees). Preliminary results indicate that the canopy shape and structure associated with different canopy types fundamentally influence the vertical scalar profiles (including those of temperature, moisture, and wind speed) in the canopy and thus alter the interception and snow melt dynamics in forested land surfaces. The turbulent transport dynamics, including counter-gradient fluxes, and radiation features including land surface albedo, are discussed in the context of the snow energy balance.",

            "abstract": "Rejuvenation of previously intruded silicic magma is an important process leading to effusive rhyolite, which is the most common product of volcanism at calderas with protracted histories of eruption and unrest such as Yellowstone caldera (Wyoming), Long Valley caldera (California), and Valles caldera (New Mexico) in the United States. Although orders of magnitude smaller in volume than rare caldera-forming supereruptions, these relatively frequent effusions of rhyolite are comparable to the largest eruptions of the 20th century and pose a considerable volcanic hazard. However, the physical pathway from rejuvenation to eruption of silicic magma is unclear, particularly because the time between reheating of a subvolcanic intrusion and eruption is poorly quantified. This study uses trace element diffusion in sanidine crystals measured at nanometer-scale with NanoSIMS to reveal that rejuvenation of a near-solidus or subsolidus silicic intrusion occurred within ~10 months following a protracted period (220 k.y.) of volcanic repose, and resulted in effusion of ~3 km3 of high-silica rhyolite lava at the onset of Yellowstone’s last volcanic interval. In addition we find that the frequently made assumption in geospeedometry of a step-function initial condition can be inaccurate despite petrographic evidence for resorption, and can be addressed by interrogating diffusion time scale concordance between multiple trace elements that are geochemically similar. The results of this study reveal that a sufficiently energetic rejuvenation of Yellowstone’s shallow crystal-melt mush and/or hydrothermally altered wall rock could lead to an effusive eruption within months. Fortunately, any significant rejuvenation of the reservoir is likely to be associated with deformation or seismicity and identifiable by geophysical monitoring.",

The turbulent field is a high-resolution three dimensional velocity field that reproduces a by-pass transition to turbulence on a flat plate due to free-stream turbulence passing above de plate. In order to reduce computational costs, a decoupled approached is used, i.e., the turbulent flow is simulated independently from the tracking model, and then used to feed the 3D Lagrangian particle model. The simulations are carried using the point-particle approach. The particle tracking model contains three sub-models, namely, particle free-flight, a post-collision velocity and bed representation sub-models. The free-flight sub-model considers the action of the following forces: submerged weight, non-linear drag, lift, virtual mass, Magnus and Basset forces. The model also includes the effect of particle angular velocity. The post-collision velocities are obtained by applying conservation of angular and linear momentum. The complete model was validated with experimental results from literature within the sand range. Results for particle velocity time series and distribution of particle turbulent intensities are presented.",

Later versions of T-SASBE will extend the time period and include further measurements made at Lauder.\nThe temperature profiles measured at Invercargill are included in T-SASBE to provide an estimate of the vertical structure in temperature at times between the once-weekly radiosonde flights at Lauder. Corrections to the Invercargill measurements were derived by applying a regression model to temperature profiles measured at Lauder and Invercargill within 12 hours of each other. Different predictor variables, including wind speed and surface pressure, were tested and the quality of the regression model was evaluated. The regression model with the best combination of the predictor variables was used to correct the Invercargill temperature profiles and use them as a valid proxy for 12-hourly temperature profiles at Lauder.\nWhile the version of T-SASBE presented here is the first milestone in the process of building the T-SASBE above the GRUAN site at Lauder, further improvements to be implemented in the future are expected to provide a SASBE that includes robust estimates of the uncertainty suitable for e.g. validating space-based measurements over Lauder.",

Tweeks were recorded on 5 quiet nights per month. The occurrence of tweeks with mode number m = 2 - 3 is more dominant. Tweeks with higher modes (m ≥ 4) appear less than other tweeks due to the higher attenuation of wave energy for higher modes reflected at the ionospheric D region. The results show that electron densiy varies from 25.2 – 187.1 cm-3 corresponding the tweeks with m = 1 - 8 at the reflection height from 81.7– 86.6 km. The variation of tweek reflection hight during the solar maximum year, 2013, could be caused by the hydrogen Lyman-α and Lyman-β emissions from the geocorona, galactic cosmic rays, variations of neutral density, direct lightning coupling to the ionsphere and electron precipitaion. The reference height h’ is low in January – April and high in May – December. The exponential sharpness factor β of electron density profile are higher during summer seasons as compared to those during winter and equinox seasons.

To mitigate the damage of severe dust storms, it is crucial to develop a forecasting and early warning system for Asian dust.

The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) launched a numerical forecasting system for Asian dust in 2004, and completed a major renovation of the system in November 2014. In the renovation, we replaced a general circulation model (the JMA98 GCM) and dust emission scheme (based on wind velocity at 10 m) with new ones (the GSMUV GCM and a friction velocity based emission scheme). A 5-year validation exhibits that the renovation achieves better forecasting score (especially in short range forecast). Our group has resolution improvement (up to ~40 km) and implementation of data assimilation with satellite observations in the upcoming updates. A feasibility study on involving observations from Himawari-8 (JMA’s new geostationary meteorological satellite) into the system is also conducted for better forecasting skill and toward robust early warning.",

The K–Ar ages from the matrix shale of the mélange range from 85 to 48 Ma and decrease with decreasing grain size, indicating that they record a mixture of authigenic illite and detrital mica. In contrast, the K–Ar ages of an ultracataclasite within the fault core are significantly younger, ranging from 29 to 23 Ma, and are unrelated to grain size. This indicates that 40Ar diffused completely from the ultracataclasite between 29 and 23 Ma, which postdates the formation of authigenic illite by about 20 Myr. The diffusion of 40Ar in the ultracataclasite was probably caused by frictional heating or high-temperature fluid migration that occurred when the fault was reactivated. The results indicate that seismogenic faults that separate tectonic mélange from coherent strata in accretionary complexes may slip, not only during accretion, but also long after accretion.",

            "abstract": "Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a critical component of the carbon (C) cycle of both terrestrial and aquatic systems. For small headwater allochthonous streams, terrestrial C delivery fuels the metabolism of receiving waters and significantly influences biotic diversity and function. While nutrient fluxes in streams have long been used as indicators of terrestrial ecosystem processes, less attention has been given to terrestrial controls on DOC export. We used the long-term stream chemistry records from the H.J. Andrews Forest LTER to examine forest management, climatic, and hydrologic controls on both seasonal and annual DOC fluxes. Within a watershed, annual DOC flux was highly related to annual discharge (Q), although considerable variability in higher discharge years suggested a role for indices of storminess, especially early in the water year. Among watersheds, younger, previously harvested watersheds generally had significantly lower DOC fluxes for a given Q than old-growth watersheds, even 4+ decades after harvest. The exception to this pattern was a harvested watershed that had significant downed wood retained on site, and had densities of coarse woody debris (CWD) close to that of the old-growth watersheds even though live tree biomass was similar to the other harvested watersheds. Other climatic factors did not appear to have significant roles in predicting either seasonal or annual fluxes of DOC. This is in sharp contrast to fluxes of nitrate at our site, which appears to be related most significantly to the presence of alder within the watershed. Taken together, our data suggest a persistent and cascading role for CWD in old-growth forest ecosystems.",

When CB occurred, a gigantic large-scale forced convection system (LFCS) began to create space-time including gravitons and gluons in more than light speed. Then, simultaneously by a swirling wild wind, created inflation process including many quantum convection loops (QCL) in locations which had more density of temperature and energetic particles like gravitons. QCL including fundamental particles, grew and formed black holes (BHs) as the core of galaxies.\nLFCSs of heat and mass in planets, stars, BHs and galaxies generate gravity and electromagnetic fields and change the properties of matter and space-time around the systems.\nMechanism: Samples: 1- Due to gravity fields of Sun and Moon, Earth's inner core is dislocated toward them and rotates around the Earth's center per day and generates LFCSs, Gholibeigian [AGU, 2012]. 2- Dislocated Sun's core due to gravity fields of planets/ Jupiter, rotates around the Sun's center per 25-35 days and generates LFCSs, Gholibeigian [EGU, 2014]. 3- If a planet/star falls into a BH, what happens? It means, its dislocated core rotates around its center in less than light speed and generates very fast LFCS and friction, while it is rotating/melting around/inward the center of BH.\nObservable Factors: 1- There is not logical relation between surface gravity fields of planets/Sun and their masses (general relativity); see Planetary Fact Sheet/Ratio to Earth Values-NASA: Earth: mass/gravity =1/1, Jupiter=317.8/2.36, Neptune=17.1/1.12, Saturn=95.2/0.916, Moon=0.0128/0.166, Sun=333000/28. 2- Convective systems in thunderstorms help bring ozone down to Earth [Brian-Kahn]. 3- In 12 surveyed BHs, produced gravity force & magnetic field strength were matched (unique LFCS source) [PhysOrg - June 4, 2014].\nJustification: After BB/CB, gravitons were created without any other masses and curvature of space-time (general relativity), but by primary gigantic convection process.",

            "abstract": "Oceanic lithosphere is generally interpreted as mantle residue after MORB extraction. It has been proposed, however, that metasomatism could take place at the interface between the low-velocity zone and the cooling and thickening oceanic lithosphere or by the percolation of low-degree melts produced in periphery of Mid Ocean Ridges. This later process is observed in slow spreading ridges and ophiolites where shallow oceanic lithospheric mantle could be metasomatized/refertilized during incomplete MORB melt extraction. Nevertheless, direct evidence for metasomatic refertilization of the deep part of the oceanic lithospheric mantle is still missing. Xenoliths and xenocrysts sampled by petit-spot volcanoes interpreted as low-degree melts extracted from the base of the lithosphere in response to plate flexure, provide important new information about the nature and the processes associated with the evolution of oceanic lithospheric mantle.\nHere, we report, first, the presence of a garnet xenocryst in petit-spot lavas from Japan characterized by low-Cr, low-Ti content and mostly flat MREE-HREE pattern. This garnet is interpreted as formed during subsolidus cooling of pyroxenitic or gabbroic cumulates formed at ~1 GPa during the incomplete melt extraction at the periphery of the Pacific mid-ocean ridge. It is the first time that such processes are documented in fast spreading context. Second, we report petit-spot mantle xenoliths with cpx trace element “signatures” characterized by high U, Th, relative depletion in Nb, Pb, Ti and high but variable LREE/HREE ratio suggesting equilibration depth closed to the Gt/Sp transition zone. Such “signatures” are unknown from oceanic settings and show unexpected similarity to melt-metasomatized gt-peridotites sampled by kimberlites. This similarity suggests that metasomatic processes are not restricted to continental setting, but could correspond to a global mechanism at the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary. As plate flexure represents a global mechanism in subduction zone, a portion of oceanic lithospheric mantle is likely to be metasomatized; recycling of these enriched domains into the convecting mantle is fundamental to understand the generation of small scale mantle isotopic and volatile heterogeneities sampled by OIBs and MORBs.",

Freely available global data sets allow us to build more quickly models for bigger areas. By linking the right data, models, and tools we gain significant insight at scales that hadn't considered possible a few decades ago. However, by increasing the spatial extent of our models, we risk missing regionally important critical elements by limitations of model resolution, processes selected, or blind spots in our big data world. At the same time we are pushing the time scales of our models from events and seasonal scale out to decades, centuries, or millennia to simulate the dynamics of the earth surface under varying external conditions. Also here we simplify and ignore to gain performance to resolve bigger time and space domains; are we including all the relevant elements in our models? These elements are often easy to spot from the right perspective. However, what is that perspective when you try to comprehend the results of baffling integrated global models and the amount of data is overwhelming? At the same time we want to know results with an ever increasing accuracy and detail: Will my house flood? Can we reduce flood risk, increase shipping capacity here, and at the same time reduce the maintenance costs by optimizing our dredging strategy? Can we build a number of interoperable cyberinfrastructures that when combined address all these questions?

            "abstract": "At the magnetopause, the location of the magnetic reconnection sites depends on the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) in the solar wind: on the dayside magnetosphere for an IMF southward, on the lobes for an IMF northward and on the flanks for an IMF in the East-West direction. Since most of observations of reconnection events have sampled a limited region of space simultaneously it is still not yet know if the reconnection line is extended over large regions of the magnetosphere or if is patchy and made of many reconnection lines. We report a Cluster crossing on 5 January 2002 near the exterior cusp on the southern dusk side where we observe multiple sources of reconnection/injections. The IMF was mainly azimuthal (IMF-By around -5 nT), the solar wind speed lower than usual around 280 km/s with the density of order 5 cm-3. The four Cluster spacecraft had an elongated configuration near the magnetopause. C4 was the first spacecraft to enter the cusp around 19:52:04 UT, followed by C2 at 19:52:35 UT, C1 at 19:54:24 UT and C3 at 20:13:15 UT. C4 and C1 observed two ion energy dispersions at 20:10 UT and 20:40 UT and C3 at 20:35 UT and 21:15 UT. Using the time of flight technique on the upgoing and downgoing ions, which leads to energy dispersions, we obtain distances of the ion sources between 14 and 20 RE from the spacecraft. The slope of the ion energy dispersions confirmed these distances. Using Tsyganenko model, we find that these sources are located on the dusk flank, past the terminator. The first injection by C3 is seen at approximately the same time as the 2nd injection on C1 but their sources at the magnetopause were separated by more than 7 RE. This would imply that two distinct sources were active at the same time on the dusk flank of the magnetosphere. In addition, a flow reversal was observed at the magnetopause on C4 which would be an indication that reconnection is also taking place near the exterior cusp quasi-simultaneously. A three-dimensional global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation will be used to determine the global topology of the magnetic field during the event.",

Goryaeva, Philippe Carrez, Patrick Cordier\nUMET, Université de Lille 1, 59655 Villeneuve d'Ascq, France\nalexandra.goryaeva@ed.univ-lille1.fr\nThe discovery of the so-called “last mantle phase transition” [1] immediately became promising to shed light on the puzzling properties of the D′′ layer and to provide new insights into our understanding of the dynamics of the lowermost Earth’s mantle. The MgSiO3 post-perovskite (Cmcm) exhibits unusual for high-pressure phases layer-like structure which may be responsible for the observed seismic anisotropy of the D'' layer. However, information about mechanical properties, probable slip systems, dislocations and their behavior under stress are not well known still. This work represents a full atomistic study of dislocations in MgSiO3post-perovskite based on the pairwise potential previously derived by [2].\nLattice friction opposed to the dislocation glide in MgSiO3 post-perovskite is shown to be highly anisotropic. Thus, remarkably low values of Peierls stress (1 GPa) are found for the glide of [100] screw dislocations in (010), while glide in (001) requires almost 18 times larger stress values. In general, (010) plane is characterized by the lowest lattice friction. Mobility of edge dislocations is found to be much higher than that of screw dislocations, and the latter will control plastic behavior of MgSiO3 post-perovskite. Comparison of our results with previous study of MgSiO3 perovskite (bridgmanite) [3], based on similar simulation approach, clearly shows that monotonous increase in Peierls stress of bridgmanite will be followed by a dramatic drop after the phase transition to the post-perovskite phase, which consequently suggests the D′′ located at the CMB to be weaker than the overlying mantle.\n",

An approach that has recently gained popularity for modeling fracture systems is the Discrete Fracture Network (DFN) model. This approach consists in applying a stochastic boolean simulation method, also known as object simulation method, where fractures are represented as simplified geometric objects (line segments in 2D and polygons in 3D). One of the shortcomings of this approach is that it usually does not consider the dependency relationships that may exist between the geometric properties of fractures (direction, length, aperture, etc), that is, each property is simulated independently.\nIn this work a method for modeling such dependencies by copula theory is introduced. In particular, a nonparametric model using Bernstein copulas for direction-length fracture dependency in 2D is presented. The application of this method is illustrated in a case study for a fractured rock sample from a carbonate reservoir outcrop.",

These beach ridges can be observed up to 20 km inland and at 200 m above sea level. Previous dating performed in fossils extracted from the oldest beach ridges yielded ages of 400 ka (Victor et al., 2011). However, numerical ages for younger beach ridges have not been determined, therefore a complete time record is not available. InSar data show that the Mejillones Peninsula was uplifted several centimeters during the last two subduction earthquakes (Antofagasta Mw 8.1, 1995 earthquake and the Mw 7.7, 2007 Tocopilla earthquake) occurred in the area (Loveless et al., 2010). A permanent GPS station deployed by CALTECH (http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~jeff/andes/) in this peninsula has measured a coseismic uplift during the 2007 Tocopilla earthquake. This data suggest that the beach ridges were abandoned as a consequence of coseismic uplift during great subduction earthquakes and therefore they represent the long-term record of past earthquakes. In order to prove this hypothesis we excavated five trenches across the beach ridges. Our idea is to look for stratigraphic evidence of the abandonment mechanism and to collect samples for dating the beach ridges using the method of optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). The ages will be used to estimate long-term uplift rate and temporal variation of this rate. By confronting short-term uplift rate provided by GPS data with long-term rate we hope to know what it is the amount of the coseismic slip that remain in the geological record.",

Here, we present a compilation of new and previously published data from a SW to NE transect of 8 sediment cores raised along the upper continental slope. This study aims to investigate the interaction between sea surface conditions and the variability seen in the British Irish Ice Sheet (BIIS) and the Fennoscandian Ice Sheet (FIS) during the last 13-40 ka BP. Ice Rafted Debris (IRD) counts, IRD flux data, grain size data, the content of the polar planktonic foraminifera Neogloboquadrina pachyderma (sin) and ∂18O measurements were compiled and combined with new Bayesian age models.\nFrom 40-24.5 ka BP the build up and consecutive confluence of the BIIS and the FIS are reflected in sediment composition and flux data. Pulses of large quantities of fine material to the southern part of the transect suggest riverine BIIS related influx. The sediment composition in cores close to the Norwegian channel indicates that the Norwegian Channel Ice Stream (NCIS) was only active between 24.5-18.5 ka BP during the last glacial stage. The planktonic foraminifera data during this period strongly suggests a dependence of NCIS extent variability and pulses in warm Atlantic water entering the Nordic Seas. In the northernmost cores rapidly deposited, laminated sediments and ∂18O spikes in planktonic foraminifera dated to 18.5 ka BP were interpreted as meltwater plume deposits. This may reflect NCIS retreat allowing BIIS and FIS to unzip and route ice dammed lake- and meltwater to the margin.\nIn conclusion, the investigation suggests a close co-variation in extent of marine based parts of the BIIS, the FIS and ocean circulation while demonstrating the strong influence of the local glacial history on standard open marine proxies. This suggests that tuning chronologies of single marine records to ice cores in some regions might be more challenging than previously anticipated.",

            "abstract": "Amalgamation of island arcs and their accretion to pre-existing continents is considered to have been one of the primary mechanisms of continental growth over the last 3 Ga, with arc terranes identified within Late Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic continental crust. Crustal-scale seismic refraction surveys can provide P wave velocity models that can be used as a proxy for crustal composition, and although they indicate some velocity variation in accreted arcs, these terranes have significantly lower velocities, and are hence significantly more felsic, than modern island arcs. Modern oceanic arcs exhibit significant variations in crustal thickness, from as little as 10 km in the Bonin arc to 35 km in the Aleutian and northern Izu arcs. Although globally island arcs appear to have a mafic composition, intermediate composition crust is inferred in central America and parts of the Izu arc. The absence of a sharp velocity contrast at the Moho appears to be a first order characteristic of island arc crust, and indicates the existence of a broad crust-mantle transition zone. Multichannel seismic reflection surveys complement refraction surveys by revealing structures associated with variations in density and seismic velocity at the scale of a few hundred meters or less to depths of 60 km or more. Surveys from the Mariana and Aleutian arcs show that modern middle and lower arc crust is mostly non-reflective, but reflections are observed from depths 5-25 km below the refraction Moho suggesting the localized presence of arc roots that may comprise gabbro, garnet gabbro, and pyroxenite within a broad transition from mafic lower crust to ultramafic mantle. Such reflective, high velocity roots are likely separated from the overlying arc crust prior to, or during arc-continent collision, and seismic reflections within accreted arc crust document the collisional process and final crustal architecture.",

Supporting photochemical tidal modeling using TIME-GCM and the empirical CTMT model reproduces the general amplitude structures and phases. Furthermore, it indicates that the main tidal coupling mechanism is the temperature dependence of the collisional excitation of the CO2 (01101) fundamental band transition (ν2). The response to neutral density variations is as important as temperature above 115 km as such explaining an unexpected tidal phase behavior in the observation. The contribution of vertical advection is comparatively small. In order to test the sensitivity of the modeled DE2 and DE3 CO2 VER tides to the solar cycle and to the specific choice of mean temperature, atomic oxygen, and CO2 density, we extend the modeling by using background from MSIS, SABER, and SCIAMACHY. The results indicate that the current uncertainties in the background temperature and atomic oxygen used for the photochemical modeling do not impact our conclusion about the relative importance of the tidal coupling mechanisms. Our results quantify the response of the CO2 15 μm infrared cooling of the lower thermosphere to tropospheric tides and delineate the coupling mechanisms that lead to the observed strong longitudinal and local time variability.",

            "abstract": "Explosive cyclones are rapidly intensifying low pressure systems generating severe wind speeds and heavy precipitation primarily in coastal and marine environments, such as the March 2014 nor'easter which developed along the United States coastline, with hurricane force winds in eastern Maine and the Maritimes. This study presents the first analysis on how explosive cyclones respond to climate change in the extratropics of the Northern Hemisphere. An objective-feature tracking algorithm is used to identify and track cyclones from 23 CMIP5 climate models for the recent past (1981-1999) and future (2081-2099). Explosive cyclones are projected to shift northwards by about 2.2° latitude on average in the northern Pacific, with fewer and weaker events south of 45°N, and more frequent and stronger events north of this latitude. This shift is correlated with a poleward shift of the jet stream in the inter-model spread (R = 0.56). In the Atlantic, the total number of explosive cyclones is projected to decrease by about 17% when averaging across models, with the largest changes occurring along North America's East Coast. This reduction is correlated with a decline in the lower-tropospheric Eady growth rate (R = 0.51), and is stronger for models with smaller frequency biases (R = -0.65). The same region is also projected to experience a small intensification of explosive cyclones, with larger vorticity values for models that predict stronger increases in the speed of the jet stream (R = 0.58). This strengthening of the jet stream is correlated with an enhanced sea surface temperature gradient in the North Atlantic (R = -0.63). The inverse relationship between model bias and projection, and the role of model resolution are discussed.",

Unlike the ensemble mean that is affected by both the wet-get-wetter and warmer-get wetter mechanisms, moisture budget analyses reveal that model uncertainties in tropical rainfall change is dominated by intermodel discrepancies in the dynamical contribution by the atmospheric circulation change. Intermodel Singular Value Decomposition analyses further show a tight coupling between the ocean warming pattern and tropical circulation change. Two robust modes emerge: one with an inter-hemispheric asymmetric structure and one with an equatorial peak. The interhemispheric-asymmetric mode is accompanied by trade wind changes consistent with wind-evaporation-SST feedback. We suggest that the tropical coupled asymmetric mode is triggered by the muted surface warming in the Southern Ocean due to the locally enhanced heat uptake. Zonally asymmetric circulation adjustments will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Unique geographic location and geo-morphological conditions of Bangladesh have made the wetlands of this country one of the most vulnerable to climate change. Wetland plays a crucial role in maintaining the ecological balance of ecosystems and cultural figures and which occupy around 50% of the area. Drought, excessive temperature, mountain snowfields and glaciers melting, riverbank erosion, salinity intrusion, flashflood, storm surges, higher water temperatures, precipitation anomalies, coastal cyclones, seasonal anomalies and extremes are main threats to the wetland ecosystem. Enhanced UV-B radiation and increased summer precipitation will significantly increase dissolved organic carbon concentrations altering major biogeochemical cycles and also will result into the expansion of range for many invasive aquatic weeds. Generally, rising temperature will lower water quality through a fall in oxygen concentrations, release of phosphorus from sediments, increased thermal stability, and altered mixing patterns. As a result biodiversity is getting degraded, many species of flora and fauna are getting threatened, and wetland-based ecosystem is getting degenerated. At the same time, the living conditions of local people are deteriorating as livelihoods, socioeconomic institutions, and extensive cultural values as well. For conserving and managing wetlands technology, legislation, educational knowledge, action plan strategy and restoration practices are required. In order to address the human needs in the changing climate community-based adaptation approaches and wetland restoration, practices had been taken in almost every type of wetlands in Bangladesh. Therefore, Bangladesh now needs a comprehensive strategy and integrated system combining political, economic, social, technological approaches and institutional supports to address sustainable wetland restoration, conservation and the newly added crisis, climate change.",

Climate change analysis based on human activities should not neglect the driving force of human society. Different countries or regions have different legal culture traditions and legal systems that can greatly influence regional carbon emissions. This will lead to differences in implementation way and implementation intensity of the law and policies. Without understanding the social and legal background, it is not enough to understand how the climate change rules work and what the effects enforce. Using the panel data of 71 countries from 1996-2010, this study analyzes the effects of macro channels influencing mitigation policies, which contains rules and regulations including value, religion, genealogy of law, public participation, regulatory, government effectiveness, corruption, rule of law, etc. The results show that the interaction between legal variables and economic variables is very important for carbon emissions reduction. The law affects the carbon emissions by adjusting the economic and other related variables, and vice verse, economic and other variables will also impact the level of the rule of law. The study also reveals that developing national economy is most countries’ urgent current task, and there are not sound strategies or strong enforcement to guarantee the achievement of the emissions reduction commitment. It is not enough to make justice dominant by cultivating a fair attitude. Practical measures and institutional means for social justice must be promoted. These results will give insight to policy makers in creating feasible and practical climate polices.",

We analyzed planktic foraminiferal samples from Sulu Sea (ODP Site 769B) spanning the Quaternary.\nThe Sulu Sea participates in inter ocean exchange with the South China Sea, Pacific Ocean and Celebes Sea through a number of shallow straits. It is directly affected by the variation of the WPWP. These events can be easily identified by analyzing the relative abundance of key planktic foraminiferal species records.\nWe discovered seven PMEs, which have been interpreted as a result of the reduction in the WPWP. These events are: PME7 (0.04-0.02 Ma), PME6 (0.16-0.13 Ma), PME5 (0.48-0.44 Ma), PME4 (0.79-0.65 Ma), PME3 (0.90-0.87 Ma), PME2 (1.8-1.36 Ma) and PME1 (2.21-2.08 Ma). The PMEs are associated with an increased abundance of N. dutertrei, which is associated with increase in fertility of the water. We have also found the occurrence of temperate fauna during PME7, PME6, PME5 and PME4, which indicates the influx of cool polar waters in the Sulu Sea. The most plausible mechanism for this event could be the southward advancement of the Arctic front, which caused the southward enhancement of Oyashio Current. The cool nutrient rich waters of the Oyashio Current caused a decline in the SST of the Sulu Sea and increased the fertility.\nThe PME3, PME2 and PME1 do not show presence of temperate fauna. The very high relative abundance of N. dutertrei indicates the influx of nutrient rich waters from the Western Pacific Ocean via Luzon strait. These events suggest the development of El Niño like conditions.\nThe PMEs have been correlated with the relative abundance of upwelling indicators (Gg. bulloides and Ga. glutinata) from the equatorial Indian Ocean (ODP Site 716A). Each PME is accompanied by an increase in the relative abundance of upwelling indicators, thereby suggesting enhanced equatorial upwelling due to the convergence of trade winds at the ODP site 716A. This explains the northward migration of ITCZ during the reduction in WPWP due to strengthening of the temperature pressure gradient in the Indian Ocean.",

            "abstract": "Land Surface Temperature (LST) is defined as the temperature of the interface between the Earth’s surface and its atmosphere and thus it is a critical variable to understand land-atmosphere interactions and a key parameter in meteorological and hydrological studies, which is involved in energy fluxes. Air temperature (Tair) is one of the most important input variables in different spatially distributed hydrological, ecological models.\nThe estimation of near surface air temperature is useful for a wide range of applications. Some applications from traffic or energy management, require Tair data in high spatial and temporal resolution at two meters height above the ground (T2m), sometimes in near-real-time. Thus, a parameterization based on boundary layer physical principles was developed that determines the air temperature from remote sensing data (MODIS). Tair is commonly obtained from synoptic measurements in weather stations. However, the derivation of near surface air temperature from the LST derived from satellite is far from straight forward. T2m is not driven directly by the sun, but indirectly by LST, thus T2m can be parameterized from the LST and other variables such as Albedo, NDVI, Water vapor and etc.\nMost of the previous studies have focused on estimating T2m based on simple and advanced statistical approaches, Temperature-Vegetation index and energy-balance approaches but the main objective of this research is to explore the relationships between T2m and LST in Berlin by using Artificial intelligence method with the aim of studying key variables to allow us establishing suitable techniques to obtain Tair from satellite Products and ground data. Secondly, an attempt was explored to identify an individual mix of attributes that reveals a particular pattern to better understanding variation of T2m during day and nighttime over the different area of Berlin. For this reason, a three layer Feedforward neural networks is considered with LMA algorithm. Considering the different relationships between T2m and LST for different land types enable us to improve better parameterization for determination of the best non-linear relation between LST and T2m over Berlin during day and nighttime. The results of the study will be presented and discussed.",

Using a new reconstruction of ALCC during the Holocene era by\nKaplan et al. [2011]\n, we quantify the local and global temperature response induced by Holocene ALCC in the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4). With 1-degree resolution of the CCSM4 slab-ocean model,we find that Holocene ALCC cause a global cooling of 0.17 °C due to the biogeophysical effects of land-atmosphere exchange of momentum, moisture, radiative and heat fluxes. On the global scale, the biogeochemical effects of Holocene ALCC from carbon emissions dominate the biogeophysical effects by causing 0.9 °C global warming. The net effects of Holocene ALCC amount to a global warming of 0.73 °C during the pre-industrial era, which is comparable to the ~0.8 °C warming during industrial times. On local to regional scales, such as parts of Europe, North America and Asia, the biogeophysical effects of Holocene ALCC are significant and comparable to the biogeochemical effect.\nThe lack of ocean dynamics in the 1° CCSM4 slab-ocean simulations could underestimate the climate sensitivity because of the lack of feedbacks from ocean heat transport [Kutzbach et al., 2013; Manabe and Bryan, 1985]. In 1° CCSM4 fully coupled simulations, the climate sensitivity is ~65% larger than the 1° CCSM4 slab-ocean simulations during the Holocene (5.3 °C versus 3.2 °C) [Kutzbach et al., 2013]. With this greater climate sensitivity, the biogeochemical effects of Holocene ALCC could have caused a global warming of ~1.5 °C, and the net biogeophysical and biogeochemical effects of Holocene ALCC could cause a global warming of 1.2 °C during the preindustrial era in our simulations, which is 50% higher than the global warming of ~0.8 °C during industrial times.",

Disaster induced losses often obligate socio-economic dislocation from rural areas to large urban centers. After incurring what type/amount of losses people migrate is still unknown. In this paper we focus on migrants who migrated due to natural disasters. Thus, the objectives of this paper are, first, ascertaining the proportion of disaster migrants in Dhaka city; second, determining types of natural disasters which compel rural out-migration; third, assessing the resource and economic losses stem from these disasters at household level. Using the slum database (N = 4966), we select eight slums randomly with a purpose to include migrants from maximum districts available. In order to identify the proportion of disaster affected migrants a census is conducted in 407 households of those 8 slums and the result demonstrates that 18.43% of the migrants are disaster affected, which was only 5% in 1993. Out of all hydro-meteorological disasters, river bank erosion (RBE), followed by flood, drives most people out of their abode. However, unlike RBE migrants, migrants affected by flood usually return to their origin after certain period. In-depth interviews on the disaster migrants reveal that RBE claims total loss of homestead land & agricultural land while flood causes 20% and 23% loss respectively. Agricultural income decreases 96% because of RBE whereas flood victims encounter 98% decrease. People also incur 79% & 69% loss in livestock owing to RBE and flood severally. These disasters cause more than eighty percent reduction in total monthly income. Albeit RBE appears more vigorous but total economic loss is greater in flood- on average each household experiences a loss of BDT 350,555 due to flood and BDT 300,000 on account of RBE. Receiving no substantial support from community or government the affected people are compelled to migrate.",

The study revealed that lowlanders and highlanders are employing agricultural and non agricultural responses at various levels to climate variability. However, relatively, highlanders have more coping and adaptation options both in agricultural and non-agricultural livelihoods practices. Moreover, the majority of maladaptation options are practiced by highlanders. Similarly, thought, female headed households had more response options than their counterparts they did not practice due to cultural prejudice. Some of the existing adaptation practices are hardly useful in times of severe drought where smallholder farmers suffer partial or total crop failure and mass death of livestock. In the context of the study sites, the view that readiness to take adaptation strategies is determined by age, income, gender, education, extension and credit facilities. The adverse effects of climate variability could be stronger on the poor, female, older and illiterate smallholder farmers. Besides, only the rich, educated and the young had positively perceived the success of their responses to climate variability. In other words, not all smallholder farmers possess the subjective factor (motivation) of adaptation to climate variability.",

Assessment of smallholder farmers’ vulnerability to climate variability revealed the importance of comprehending exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity induces. Due to differences in level of change in rainfall, temperature, drought frequency, their environmental interaction and variations on adaptive capacity the nature and magnitude of smallholder farmers vulnerability to physical, biological and epidemiological challenges of crop and livestock production varied within and across agro-ecologies. Highlanders’ sensitive relates with high population density, erosion and crop disease and pest damage occurrence. Whereas lowlanders will be more sensitive to high crop disease and pest damage, provenance of livestock disease, absence of alternative water sources, less diversified agricultural practices. However, with little variations in the magnitude and nature of vulnerability, both highlanders and lowlanders are victims of climate variability and change.\nGiven the ever increasing population, temperature and unpredictable nature of rainfall variability, the study concluded that future adaptation strategies should capitalize on preparing smallholder farmers for both extremes- excess rainfall and flooding on the one hand and severe drought on the other.

Here we review the capabilities and results from this first operational C-band radar, and discuss the prospects for using Sentinel-1 for routine monitoring of tectonic and volcanic areas.\nThe Sentinel-1 constellation (the 1B satellite will be launched in early 2016) has several advantages over previous radar missions for InSAR applications: (1) Data are being acquired systematically for tectonic and volcanic areas, (2) Images cover a wide footprint, 250 km from near to far range in Interferometric Wide Swath (TOPS) mode, (3) Small perpendicular and temporal baselines greatly improve interferometric coherence at C-band, (4) The mission is planned to be operational for 20 years, with 1C and 1D planned for future launches, (5) Data are freely available to all users.\nSince reaching its operational orbit in August 2014, Sentinel-1A has provided valuable data for a number of geological events. These include earthquakes in Napa (August 2014) and Nepal (April 2015), and eruptions at Fogo (November 2014) and Calbuco (April 2015). We will show results from these events, as well as the ongoing monitoring of postseismic deformation following the earthquakes. In COMET (* http://comet.nerc.ac.uk), we are building a system to routinely produce Sentinel-1 interferograms and time series for tectonic and volcanic areas. We will make the results available to the community. In this presentation we will describe progress to date in building this system, which we aim to launch in 2016, and will discuss the anticipated scientific results.\n* COMET is the UK Natural Environment Research Council’s Centre for the Observation and Modelling of Earthquakes, Volcanoes, and Tectonics.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in numerical wave propagation modeling and station coverage have permitted robust inversion of infrasound data from volcanic explosions. Complex topography and crater morphology have been shown to substantially affect the infrasound waveform, suggesting that homogeneous acoustic propagation assumptions are invalid. Infrasound waveform inversion provides an exciting tool to accurately characterize emission volume and mass flux from both volcanic and non-volcanic explosions. Mass flux, arguably the most sought-after parameter from a volcanic eruption, can be determined from the volume flux using infrasound waveform inversion if the volcanic flow is well-characterized. Thus far, infrasound-based volume and mass flux estimates have yet to be validated. In February 2015 we deployed six infrasound stations around the explosive Sakurajima Volcano, Japan for 8 days. Here we present our full waveform inversion method and volume and mass flux estimates of numerous high amplitude explosions using a high resolution DEM and 3-D Finite Difference Time Domain modeling. Application of this technique to volcanic eruptions may produce realistic estimates of mass flux and plume height necessary for volcanic hazard mitigation.\nSeveral ground-based instruments and methods are used to independently determine the volume, composition, and mass flux of individual volcanic explosions. Specifically, we use ground-based ash sampling, multispectral infrared imagery, UV spectrometry, and multigas data to estimate the plume composition and flux. Unique tiltmeter data from underground tunnels at Sakurajima also provides a way to estimate the volume and mass of each explosion. In this presentation we compare the volume and mass flux estimates derived from the different methods and discuss sources of error and future improvements.",

            "abstract": "The mid-Pliocene warm period (MPWP; ~ 3Ma), characterized by globally elevated temperatures (2-3º C) and carbon dioxide levels of ~400ppm, is commonly used as a testing ground for investigating ice sheet stability in a slightly warmer world. The central, unanswered question in this regard is the extent of East Antarctic melting during the MPWP. Here we assess the potential role of dynamic topography on this issue.\nModel reconstructions of the evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet during the ice age require an estimate of bedrock elevation through time. Ice sheet models account for changes in bedrock elevation due to glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA), often using simplified models of the GIA process, but they generally do not consider other processes that may perturb subglacial topography. One such notable process is dynamic topography, i.e. the deflection of the solid surface of the Earth due to convective flow and buoyancy variations within the mantle and lithosphere. Paleo-shorelines of Pliocene age reflect the influence of dynamic topography, but the impact of these bedrock elevation changes on ice sheet stability in the Antarctic region is unknown.\nIn this study we use viscous flow simulations of mantle dynamics to predict changes in dynamic topography and reconstruct bedrock elevations below the Antarctic Ice Sheet since the MPWP. We furthermore couple this reconstruction to a three-dimensional ice sheet model in order to explore the impact of dynamic topography on the extent of the Antarctic Ice Sheet during the Pliocene. Our modeling indicates that uplift occurred in the area of the Transantarctic Mountains and the adjacent Wilkes Basin. This predicted uplift, which is consistent with geological inferences of uplift in the Transantarctic Mountains, implies a significantly (~100-200 m) lower elevation of the Wilkes Basin in the Pliocene. This lower elevation leads to ~400 km of additional retreat of the grounding line in this region relative to simulations that do not include dynamic topography, a result that is consistent with inferences from offshore sediment core data.",

It is essential that scientists are engaged and active in this effort. Scientists can be more effective communicators about climate change to non-scientific audiences if we recognize that some of the normal “boundary conditions” under which we operate do not need to apply. From how we are trained to how we think about our audience, there are some specific skills and practices that allow us to be more effective communicators. The author will review concepts for making our communication more effective based upon his experience from over 60 presentations about climate change to public audiences. These include expressing how your knowledge makes you feel, anticipating (and accepting) questions unconstrained by physics, respecting beliefs and values while separating them from evidence, and using the history of climate science to provide a compelling narrative. Proper attention to presentation structure (particularly an opening statement), speaking techniques for audience engagement, and effective use of presentation software are also important.",

            "abstract": "In much of western North America, snow and snowmelt provide the primary means for storage of winter precipitation, effectively transferring water from the relatively wet winter season to the typically dry summers. A common assumption is that high-elevation catchments in the western United States behave like \"Teflon basins\" and that water released from seasonal storage in snow packs flows directly into streams with little or no interaction with underlying soils. Here I present information from a variety of catchments in the Colorado Front Range on snowmelt/soil interactions using isotopic, geochemical, nutrient and hydrometric data in 2- and 3- component hydrograph separations, along with end-member mixing analysis (EMMA). For most catchments we measured these parameters in weekly precipitation, the seasonal snowpack, snowmelt before contact with the ground, discharge, springs, soil solution, and groundwater.\nWe ran EMMA at the catchment scale for catchments that represent the rain-snow transition zone in the montane forest, the seasonally snow covered sub-alpine to alpine transition zone, and a high-elevation alpine zone near the continental divide. In all catchments three end-members were the source waters for about 95% of discharge. Two end-members were the same in all catchments, snow and groundwater. For the alpine catchment talus springs was the third water source, while rain was the third water source in the two lower-elevation catchments. For all three catchments, soil solution plotted with stream waters along or near a line connecting the snow and groundwater end-members. Thus, for seasonally snow-covered catchments from montane to alpine ecosystems, snowmelt infiltrates underlying soils before snowmelt recharges groundwater reservoirs and contributes to surface flows. Seasonally snow-covered catchments are not Teflon basins. Rather, snowmelt infiltrates soils where solute concentrations are changed by biological and geochemical processes.",

The region of Inner Asia has long been characterised by important cultural, economic, and ecological ties that transcend international borders, including a common steppe environment, a long history of mobile pastoralism, as well as comparable experiences of socialist and postsocialist transformation. In this research, we focused on the study of the Mongolian Plateau located in eastern Inner Asia, since climate change has already had large impacts on grassland and local households. We explored how the vegetation and animal husbandry responses to climate change in comparison between Inner Mongolia and Mongolia. Our central question then was: how are people in different parts of Inner Mongolia and the Republic of Mongolia are experiencing and responding to climate change across a common grassland environment as a result of the differing social, economic, political, and ecological conditions within each particular state? We believe that comparative and interdisciplinary investigation offers the best prospect for the evaluation of the differing trajectories currently being followed by each Inner Asian state, and the anticipation of the likely effects on the societies and environment of the region in the future.",

            "abstract": "In northern Chile (24.5°-26°S) two Pre-Andean depocenters crop out: the Cifuncho basin in the Coastal Cordillera and the Profeta basin in the Precordillera. These basins have been classically interpreted as a continental rifting unrelated to subduction during the period prior to the Andean orogenic cycle. However, recent petrographic and geochemical data suggest the development of these basins in an active subduction system. In order to test this hypothesis and to establish the geologic evolution of the basins and the strain field during the rifting process, we present preliminary U-Pb geochronological and geochemical data together with structural analyses of synrift structures.\nThe geochronological data along the Cifuncho and Profeta basins, show a main continental sedimentary deposition during the Norian to Raethian. Volcanosedimentary rocks show a main detrital supply of Early Permian age (~297-283 Ma). This input can be associated with the volcanic La Tabla Formation and/or the exhumation of Permian granitoids. A minor supply close to ~478 Ma is related to a source from the Lower Ordovician arc (~480 Ma), suggesting the tectonic exhumation of this source to the east of the Profeta basin during the Late Triassic.\nOn the other hand, structural analysis was carried in third and four order extensional faults (<10 m of slip) along the Profeta basin. Most of the faults show a clear synrift character with the development of fault controlled growing strata. The kinematic analyses evidence a variability in the orientation of the maximum strain axes from a main northwest to a subordinate northeast direction of extension.\nThus, the intimate relation between the continental sedimentary deposition and a proximal volcanism of intermediate composition and calk-alkaline affinity, suggests the development of these basins in a supra-subduction setting during the Late Triassic. Structural data probably reflect local variation in the strain field across the basins.",

            "abstract": "Microbia plays an outstandingly important role in many hydrologic compartments, such as e.g. the benthic community in sediments, or biologically active microorganisms in the capillary fringe, in ground water, or soil. Oxygen, pH, and CO2 are key factors and indicators for microbial activity. They can be measured using optical chemical sensors. These sensors record changing fluorescence properties of specific indicator dyes. The signals can be measured in a non-contact mode, even through transparent walls, which is important for many lab-experiments. They can measure in closed (transparent) systems, without sampling or intruding into the sample. They do not consume the analytes while measuring, are fully reversible and able to measure in non-stirred solutions. These sensors can be applied as high precision fiberoptic sensors (for profiling), robust sensor spots, or as planar sensors for 2D visualization (imaging).\nImaging enables to detect thousands of measurement spots at the same time and generate 2D analyte maps over a region of interest. It allows for comparing different regions within one recorded image, visualizing spatial analyte gradients, or more important to identify hot spots of metabolic activity.\nWe present ready-to-use portable imaging systems for the analytes oxygen, pH, and CO2. They consist of a detector unit, planar sensor foils and a software for easy data recording and evaluation. Sensors foils for various analytes and measurement ranges enable visualizing metabolic activity or analyte changes in the desired range. Dynamics of metabolic activity can be detected in one shot or over long time periods. We demonstrate the potential of this analytical technique by presenting experiments on benthic disturbance-recovery dynamics in sediments and microbial degradation of organic material in the capillary fringe.\nWe think this technique is a new tool to further understand how microbial and geochemical processes are linked in (not solely) hydrologic systems.",

            "abstract": "Land use plays an important role in the climate system. Many ecosystem processes are directly or indirectly climate driven, and together with human driven land use changes, they determine how the land surface will evolve through time. To assess the effects of land cover changes on the climate system, models are required which are capable of simulating interactions between the involved components of the Earth system. Since driving forces for global environmental change differ among regions, a geographically (spatially) explicit modeling approach is called for, so that it can be incorporated in global and regional (climate and/or biophysical) change models in order to enhance our understanding of the underlying processes and thus improving future projections.\nSome researchers suggest that mankind has shifted from living in the Holocene (~emergence of agriculture) into the Anthropocene (~humans capable of changing the Earth’ atmosphere) since the start of the Industrial Revolution. But in the light of the sheer size and magnitude of some historical land use changes (e.g. the Black Plague in the 14th century and the aftermath of the Colombian Exchange in the 16th century), some believe that this point might have occurred earlier in time. There are still many uncertainties and gaps in our knowledge about the importance of land use (change) in the global biogeochemical cycle, and it is crucial that researchers from other disciplines are involved in decreasing the uncertainties.\nThus, integrated records of the co-evolving human-environment system over millennia are needed to provide a basis for a deeper understanding of the present and for forecasting the future. This requires the major task of assembling and integrating regional and global historical, archaeological, and paleo-environmental records. Humans cannot predict the future.\nHere I present a tool for such long term global change studies; it is the latest update (v 3.2) of the History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE), which tries to incorporate many of these cross-disciplinary records and create thus new and more accurate estimates of the underlying demographic and agricultural driving factors for the whole Holocene. Estimates include population, cropland, pasture, rangeland, irrigation, rice, and built-up area.",

P of the different soil layers ([1] 0 cm – -10 cm / [2] -10 cm – -20 cm / [3] -20 cm – -40 cm) and their isotopic signature can be computed from continuous measurements of the vertical soil CO2 concentration profile and its isotopic signature and combined to simultaneous measurements of the soil efflux, trunk efflux, their respective isotopic signature and eddy flux measurements. The field campaign was conducted at the beech forest of Hesse (France) in 2011 from April to September.\nThe results show significant temporal variations in P and δ13P. For P, large intra and inter day fluctuations are observed and are explained by a dependence on temperature specific to each layer. For δ13P, the horizon 2 show significant daily fluctuations which are related to lag-timed soil moisture and water use efficiency. These fluctuations dependency appears to be consistent with a response of P sources to environment and to the impact of photosynthetic δ13C fluctuations on δ13P.\nComparison of isoprod, defined as the product of CO2 production and its isotopic composition, and soil and trunk isofluxes shows that horizon 2, the largest contributor to soil P (50 % to 77 % of total soil P depending on the period) is mainly affected by root respiration. The fluctuations of horizon 1 isoprod are influenced both by autotrophic and heterotrophic sources. Moreover, some fluctuations can be generated by other physical processes inducing P and δ13P variability, highlighting methodological issues that need to be taken into account to improve FGA.",

The SAFE (Swarm for Earthquake study) project (funded by ESA in the framework “STSE Swarm+Innovation”, 2014) aims at applying the new approach of geosystemics to the analysis of Swarm data for investigating the preparatory phase of earthquakes. The main objective is to explore the possible link between magnetic/ionospheric anomalies and large earthquakes analysing Swarm as well as ground based data (seismic, magnetic, GNSS, etc.). This presentation will show the state of the art in lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling (LAIC) and the expected contribution of SAFE in the field, showing some recent case studies.",

            "abstract": "A large earthquake of around 8 magnitude occurred on 25 April 2015, 06:26 UTC, with epicenter in Nepal, causing more than 9000 fatalities and devastating destruction. The contemporary orbiting in the topside ionosphere of the three Swarm satellites by ESA makes it possible to look for possible pre-earthquake magnetic anomalous signals, likely due to some lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere (LAI) coupling. First, a wavelet analysis has been performed during the same day of the earthquake (from the external magnetic point of view, an exceptionally quiet day) with the result that a ULF anomalous and persisting signal (from around 3 to 6 UTC), is clearly detected before the earthquake. After this single-spot analysis, we performed a more extensive analysis for two months around the earthquake occurrence, to confirm or refute the cause-effect relationship. From the series of the detected magnetic anomalies (during night and magnetically quiet times) from Swarm satellites, we show that the cumulative numbers of anomalies follows the same typical power-law behavior of a critical system approaching its critical time, in our case, the large seismic event of 25 April, 2015, and then it recovers as the typical recovery phase after a large earthquake. The impressive similarity of this behavior with the analogous of seismic data analysis, provides strong support to the lithospheric origin of the satellite magnetic anomalies, as due to the LAI coupling during the preparation phase of the Nepal earthquake.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the effect of a single large impact during the Late Veneer and Late Heavy Bombardment on the evolution of the mantle and atmosphere of Venus. We use a coupled interior/exterior numerical code based on StagYY and developed in Gillmann and Tackley [2014]. Single vertical impacts are simulated as instantaneous events affecting both the atmosphere and mantle of the planet by (i) eroding the atmosphere, causing atmospheric escape, and (ii) depositing energy in the crust and mantle of the planet. Main impactor parameters include timing, size/mass, velocity and efficiency of energy deposition.\nWe observe that volatile delivery by the impactor and impact erosion of the atmosphere are both minor effects compared to melting and degassing triggered by the energy deposited in the mantle and crust.\nSmall collisions (under 100 km radius) have only local and time-limited effects. Medium-sized impactors (100-300 km) will not have much more consequences unless the energy deposition is enhanced, for example by a fast collision. In that case, it will have comparable effects to the larger category of impacts (400-800 km): a strong thermal anomaly affecting both crust and mantle and triggering melting and a change in mantle dynamics patterns.\nSuch an impact is a global event and can be responsible for volcanic events focused at the impact location and near the antipode. Depending on the timing of the impact, it can also have major consequences on the long-term evolution of the planet and its surface conditions by either (i) efficiently depleting the upper mantle of the planet, leading to the early loss of its water or (ii) imposing a volatile rich and hot atmosphere for billions of years. Due to the coupled nature of the evolution, both cases can affect the evolution of the whole planet (atmosphere and interior) on the long term.",

Due to its high mass resolution (m/Δm > 4200) and temporal resolution (1 minute), 71 ion peaks were detected in the PTR-TOF-MS mass scan data, highlighting the chemical complexity of ambient air in the Valley. Of the 71, 38 species were found to have campaign average concentrations > 200 ppt and were identified based on their spectral characteristics, ambient diel profiles and correlation with specific emission tracers. Distinct diel profiles were observed for the nominal isobaric compounds isoprene (m/z=69.070) and furan (m/z=69.033). Comparison with several sites elsewhere in the world showed mixing ratios of acetaldehyde (~ 9 ppb), acetonitrile (~1 ppb) and isoprene (~ 1 ppb) to be among the highest measured anywhere in the world. Two “new” ambient compounds namely, methanamide (m/z = 46.029) and acetamide (m/z=60.051) which can photochemically produce isocyanic acid in the atmosphere, are reported in this study alongwith nitromethane (a tracer for diesel exhaust) and ketene (a very reactive compound). Two distinct periods were identified during the campaign based on high daytime biogenic emissions of isoprene even in winter and biomass fired brick kiln emissions of acetonitrile, benzene and isocyanic acid. Biomass burning and biomass fired brick kiln emissions were found to be the dominant source for compounds such as propyne, propene, benzene and propanenitrile which correlated strongly with biomass burning tracer acetonitrile (r2 > 0.7). The calculated total VOC OH reactivity was dominated by acetaldehyde (20.1%), ketene (ethenone) (17.1%), isoprene (16.8 %) and propene (15.6%), while oxygenated VOCs and isoprene collectively contributed to more than 70% of the total ozone production potential. The first ambient measurements from any site in South Asia of compounds with significant health effects such as isocyanic acid, formamide, acetamide, naphthalene and nitromethane are reported in this study.",

            "abstract": "To study the influence of size and geometry of hydraulically perturbed rock volumes on the magnitude statistics of induced events, we compare b value and seismogenic index estimates derived from different algorithms. First, we use standard Gutenberg-Richter approaches like least square fit and maximum likelihood technique. Second, we apply the lower bound probability fit (Shapiro et al., 2013, JGR, doi:10.1002/jgrb.50264) which takes the finiteness of the perturbed volume into account. The different estimates systematically deviate from each other and the deviations are larger for smaller perturbed rock volumes. It means that the frequency-magnitude distribution is most affected for small injection volume and short injection time resulting in a high apparent b value. In contrast, the specific magnitude value, the quotient of seismogenic index and b value (Shapiro et al., 2013, JGR, doi:10.1002/jgrb.50264), appears to be a unique seismotectonic parameter of a reservoir location. Our results confirm that it is independent of the size of perturbed rock volume. The specific magnitude is hence an indicator of the magnitudes that one can expect for a given injection. Several performance tests to forecast the magnitude frequencies of induced events show that the seismogenic index model provides reliable predictions which confirm its applicability as a forecast tool, particularly, if applied in real-time monitoring. The specific magnitude model can be used to predict an asymptotical upper limit of probable frequency-magnitude distributions of induced events. We also conclude from our analysis that the physical process of pore pressure diffusion for the event triggering and the scaling of their frequency-magnitude distribution by the size of perturbed rock volume well depicts the presented relation between upper bound of maximum seismic moment and injected fluid volume (McGarr, 2014, JGR, doi:10.1002/2013JB010597), particularly, if nonlinear effects in the diffusion process are considered. The interaction of fluid volume, pressure diffusion, hydraulic properties (permeability, anisotropy), and seismotectonic state (fracture concentration, rock strength) controls geometry and size of the perturbed volume. The perturbed volume is in turn a controlling factor of the maximum magnitude of induced events.",

The radiance spectra were created from uncalibrated Galileo spacecraft Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer files archived in the Imaging Node of the NASA Planetary Data System. The NASA Galileo spacecraft observed asteroid 951 Gaspra on October 29, 1991 with the Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) at wavelengths ranging from 0.7 – 5.2 micrometers [Carlson et al., 1992]. The five radiance spectra consist of two 17, two 100, and one 329 spectral channel data sets. They record data that was acquired by NIMS at ranges between 27232.6 to 14723.8 kilometers from asteroid 951 Gaspra. The uncalibrated NIMS data were converted into radiance spectra using calibration coefficients obtained during the Galileo mission’s first Earth encounter on December 8, 1990. The archived radiance spectral data is located at the URL (Universal Record Locator):\nhttp://sbn.psi.edu/pds/resource/gaspraspec.html\nand contains radiance, solar, incidence over flux, and data documentation.\nThis archived data set contains a variety of spectral signatures. These signatures include absorptions near 1.0, 2.0, 2.8, 3.4, and 4.5 micrometers. The 1.0 and 2.0 micrometer features are indicators of olivine and pyroxene on the asteroid surface. The 2.8 micrometer feature has a shape similar to the combined spectra of multiple iron bearing phyllosilicates. The 3.4 micrometer feature is in the same location as absorptions created by a carbon-hydrogen bond. The 4.5 micrometer feature, present only in the 329 channel data set, corresponds in position to absorptions detected in sulfate minerals.\nCarlson, R. W., et al.

            "abstract": "The anomalously high magma flux in the Eggvin Bank area has triggered new research efforts to better understand the crustal development in this area. The Eggvin Bank is located between the Jan Mayen Island and the west coast of Greenland. Some proposed origins of the Eggvin Bank are: a distinct plume located beneath Jan Mayen; an extension of the Iceland plume; minor spreading or leakage along West Jan Mayen Fracture Zone (WJMFZ); intruded continental crust extending from Jan Mayen Microcontinent (JMMC); and rifted Greenland sub-continental lithospheric mantle. In this first modern refraction seismic study of the Eggvin Bank, we present a 2D velocity model based on OBS data. The OBSs were deployed approx. N-S over the Eggvin Bank with good data quality constrained by 4 OBSs. The air-gun array used during OBS shooting produced good quality reflection data. Three distinct seamounts are observed along the profile: the northern seamount (water depth 730m), has a flat top with a thin sedimentary veneer on top, which indicates it has been eroded at sea surface; while the southern two seamounts, one (water depth 550m) is less flat with around 100m thick sedimentary units on top, another one is rounded with tiny sedimentary veneer on top having the shallowest water depth (460m). This could suggest that the southern seamounts are younger, since they are shallower but without obvious signs that they were subaerially exposed. However, increased cooling of the lithosphere across the WJMFZ in the north may also contribute to depth differences. A normal fault offsetting sedimentary strata (~300 m) in the Greenland Basin indicates recent tectonic activity north of the Eggvin Bank. The velocity modeling shows crustal thickness with large variations, ranging from 8 km to 14 km, where crustal thickness changes of 4-5 km are associated with 20-30 km wide segments with thick crust under the seamounts. The crust consists of three oceanic crustal layers: upper crust (2.8km/s-4.8km/s); middle crust (5.5 km/s -6.5 km/s); lower crust (6.7 km/s - 7.35 km/s). The high crustal thickness and crustal morphology differ from the more uniform Kolbeinsey Ridge crust to the south, and it may represent oceanic crust with multiphase off-axis volcanic activity.",

            "abstract": "On April 1, 2014, the Iquique earthquake (Mw 8.1) occurred in Northern Chile. This earthquake was preceded and followed by a complex seismic sequence which was well recorded by the IPOC/CSN network, and also by a temporary network deployed by CSN a few days before the Mainshock. The precursory events were recorded since 2008; they were characterized by the episodic occurrence of clustered events of magnitudes between Ml 2.5 – 5.0. The clusters were repeated in time before and after the main Iquique earthquake. We identified the seismic clusters, we localized them and we relocalized events within the clusters using a double-difference algorithm. We also computed regional moment tensor solutions by waveform inversion of the broadband data. Most of these events were located in a within a band of 50 km width from the trench. These events were clustered around three sites inside this band which have been active before and after the main-shock. They could be caused by fracture zones, concentrated below the eroded continental wedge that extends for about 50 km landward from the trench. We propose that the spatial localization and temporal occurrence of these clustered events was associated with a complex rupture process of the Iquique earthquake, which was preceded by a slow slip event, and a complex pattern of fore- and aftershock seismicity.",

At the same time, climate change can be an important driver for land use, although its importance relative to the impact of socio-economic factors may vary significant from region to region. This study compares the contributions of climate change and socioeconomic development to potential future changes of agricultural land use in West Africa and examines various sources of uncertainty using a land use projection model (LandPro) that accounts for the impact of socioeconomic drivers on the demand side and the impact of climate-induced crop yield changes on the supply side. Future crop yield changes were simulated by a process-based crop model driven with future climate projections from a regional climate model, and future changes of food demand is projected using a model for policy analysis of agricultural commodities and trade. The impact of human decision-making on land use was explicitly considered through multiple “what-if” scenarios to examine the range of uncertainties in projecting future land use. Without agricultural intensification, the climate-induced decrease of crop yield together with increase of food demand are found to cause a significant increase in agricultural land use at the expense of forest and grassland by the mid-century, and the resulting land use land cover changes are found to feed back to the regional climate in a way that exacerbates the negative impact of climate on crop yield. Analysis of results from multiple decision-making scenarios suggests that human adaptation characterized by science-informed decision making to minimize land use could be very effective in many parts of the region.",

The evolution of the AMOC is one of the key uncertainties of future climate projections. Climate models taking part in CMIP5 showed that over the 21st century the AMOC might reduce by 20-30% under the intermediate Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 scenario and by 36-44% under the high-end RCP8.5 scenario relative to preindustrial values. However, these projections didn't include the predicted partial melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Using a combination of observations and regional climate model experiments, realistic scenarios of the future mass loss of the Greenland Ice Sheet are constructed for different RCPs that span the next three centuries. These melt water scenarios have been included in various climate models to investigate its role in the simulated future evolution of the climate in general and more specifically the AMOC. To rigorously quantify the uncertainties of the AMOC projections and the probability of a future AMOC collapse we have used an AMOC emulator. This physics-based approach allows us to include uncertainties in the AMOC's sensitivity to temperature and salinity changes, as well as uncertainties of future global warming, polar amplification and melt rates of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Based on the first AMOCMIP simulations of future AMOC evolution forced by changes in greenhouse-gas concentrations and Greenland Ice Sheet melt, we will present probabilistic projections of future AMOC changes and the probability of an AMOC collapse.",

We use the shallow seismicity data of the National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC) global catalog and Taiwan Central Weather Bureau’s (CWB) regional catalog to demonstrate the advantages of this new method. Our study shows that the standard deviation of logarithmic distribution is significantly smaller than that of arithmetic distribution for both data sets.

            "abstract": "A reliable characterization of possible pre-earthquake processes requires their rigorous formalization and testing, first in retrospect, and then in an experimental real-time mode.\nNowadays Italy represents the only region of moderate seismic activity where rigorous prospective testing of seismicity patterns at the intermediate-term middle-range scale is ongoing since more than a decade. Specifically, two different algorithms are simultaneously applied, namely CN and M8S, which are based on general concepts of pattern recognition that permit to deal with multiple sets of seismic precursors. These methods make use of detectable inverse cascade of seismic process to allow for a diagnosis of the periods of time when a strong event is likely to occur inside a given region. The results from experimental testing, regularly updated every two months since 2003, permit a routine validation of the considered patterns at the intermediate space-time scale.\nThe reduction of uncertainties about location (where) and time (when) a strong earthquake has to be expected requires the use of additional information, which may be eventually provided by different observables (e.g. GPS, gravity, geochemical and other geophysical evidences), other methods (e.g. PI), as well as by relatively lower magnitude seismicity data from high quality local catalogs. The possibilities for an integrated analysis of different data are exemplified, focusing on the North-eastern part of Italy. In particular, a formal analysis of accurate local bulletins, compiled at OGS since 1977, is carried out based on nearest-neighbor distances of events in space-time-energy domain, with the aim to verify possible pre-earthquake features of seismic clusters in the area.\nThe issues related with prospective testing of the applied methodologies are discussed, including problems with space-time homogeneity of input data, illustrating the results obtained for the recent strong earthquakes in Italy.",

This study aims to identify and quantify the fundamental mechanisms controlling the evolution of coastal quasi-linear convective systems (QLCSs) as they move offshore, as well as characterize the environmental conditions that support a phase space of life cycles. Results from this work will contribute to the improved predictability of these potentially severe warm season storms.\nThe current work uses the Cloud Model 1 (CM1; Bryan and Fritsch 2002) to systematically study the interaction between QLCSs and marine atmospheric boundary layers (MABLs) associated with the coastal ocean in an idealized numerical framework. The initial simulations are run in 2-dimensions, with a 250 m horizontal resolution and a vertical resolution ranging from 100 m in the lowest 3000 m stretched to 250 m at the top of the 20 km domain. All simulations use the Weisman-Klemp analytic sounding as the base-state sounding profile in conjunction with an RKW-type wind profile.\nTo create a numerical environment representative of a coastal region, the western half of the 800 km domain is configured to represent a land surface, while the eastern half represents a water surface. A series of sensitivity experiments are conducted to explore the influence of sea surface temperature and the associated marine atmospheric boundary layer on coastal QLCSs. Sea surface temperature values are selected to represent values observed within the Mid-Atlantic Bight coastal waters during the warm season, ranging from 14oC (‘early summer’) to 23oC (‘late summer’). The numerical MABL is allowed to develop in time through surface heat fluxes.\nThis presentation will discuss preliminary results from the ‘early summer’ and ‘late summer’ SST sensitivity experiments. Preliminary simulations indicate that the ‘early summer’ QLCS moves more quickly than the ‘late summer’ storm once the systems are over the MABL. Differences in propagation speed will be discussed in the context of lifting mechanisms along the leading edge of the QLCSs. Differences in the intensity of the convection will be discussed as well.",

The Atmospheric Infrared Sounder is a useful yet underutilized tool to study corresponding atmospheric changes and their feedbacks between 2003 and 2013. Most pronounced warming occurs between November and April, with skin and air temperatures increasing on average 2.5 K and 1.5 K over the Arctic Ocean. In response to sea ice loss, evaporation rates (i.e., moisture flux) increased between August and October by 1.5 × 10−3 g m−2 s−1 (3.8 W m−2 latent heat flux energy), increasing the water vapor feedback and cloud cover. Although most trends are positive over the Arctic Ocean, there is considerable interannual variability.

            "abstract": "Devastating floods in mountain regions of the western US and Canada can result from rapid snowmelt during mid-winter rain-on-snow (ROS) events. Key components of snowmelt flooding during ROS are conditions prior to the storm, the combination of temperature, humidity and wind during the event, and the extent to which the snowcover is exposed to the wind. The critical antecedent condition is the extension of the snowcover to lower elevations. In mountain basins this significantly increases the snow-covered area (SCA) and volume of water stored in the snowcover. During ROS events the elevation of the rain/snow transition can rise, resulting in rain over large snow-covered areas. During typical conditions the mountain snowcover is generally cooled by evaporation (latent heat flux), and warmed by sensible heat flux, such that the turbulent fluxes tend to balance, and have only modest effect on the energy state of the snowcover. However, during ROS higher humidity results in condensation on the snow, increasing melt energy by 50 – 100 times such that most of the energy for snowmelt comes from the combination of sensible and latent heat exchange. If SCA is extensive and exposed to the wind, the surface water input (SWI) can be more than doubled by the addition of melt to the rain. Data indicate that as the climate warms, higher temperatures and more humid conditions during storms may result in more frequent flooding events from mountain regions.",

            "abstract": "The classic Salar de Atacama Basin, located in the Central Andes of northern Chile, holds a remarkable yet not fully understood record of tectonic events since mid-Cretaceous times. Based on the growing amount of data collected over the last years, such as high-detail maps and U-Pb geochronology, we present an updated model for the development of this area after the Triassic. A major compressional event is recorded around the mid-Late Cretaceous (ca. 107 Ma) with the deposition of synorogenic continental successions reflecting the uplift of the Coastal Cordillera area farther to the west, and effectively initiating the foreland basin. The deformation front migrated eastwards during the Late Campanian (ca. 79 Ma), where it exhumed and deformed the Late Cretaceous magmatic arc and the crystalline basement of Cordillera de Domeyko. The K-T Event (ca. 65 Ma), recently identified in the basin, involved the same source areas, though the facies indicate a closer proximity to the source. The compressional record of the basin is continued by the Eocene Incaic Event (ca. 45 Ma), with deep exhumation of the Cordillera de Domeyko and the cannibalization of previous deposits. A change to an extensional regime during the Oligocene (ca. 28 Ma) is shown by the deposition of more than 4 km of evaporitic and clastic successions. A partial inversion of the basin occurred during the Miocene (ca.10 Ma-present), as shown by the deformation seen in the Cordillera de la Sal. As such, the basin shows that the uplift of the Cordillera de Domeyko was not one isolated episode, but a prolonged and complex event, punctuated by episodes of major deformation. It also highlights the need to take into account the Mesozoic-Cenozoic deformation events for any model trying to explain the building of the modern-day Andes.",

At the same time, recent years have seen some extremely large fires compared to the historical record, with significant areas of moderate to high severity fire (e.g., McNally 2002, Rim 2013, King 2014 fires).\nChanges to fuels and fire regimes due to fire suppression and land use, as well as warming temperatures and the occurrence of drought, are thought to be significant factors contributing to increased risks of large, severe fires in Sierra Nevada forests.\nOver 70% of the vegetated area in federally managed forests in the Sierra Nevada is classified as having altered fuels and fire regimes, while average annual temperature in the Sierra Nevada has been above the long term mean for all but four years in the past two decades.\nAs climate is expected to continue warming for decades to come, we explored fuels management scenarios as the primary tools available to modify risks of large, severe wildfires.\nWe developed experimental statistical models of fire occurrence, fire size, and high severity burned area, to explore the interaction between climate and altered fuels conditions. These models were applied to historical climate conditions, a sample of future climate projections, and to both current fuels conditions and a range of scenarios for fuels treatments. Emissions from wildfires were estimated using the Fire Inventory from the National Center for Atmospheric Research.\nOur models project that average annual burned area in the Sierra Nevada will more than double by mid-century. Similarly, particulate and other pollution emissions from Sierra Nevada wildfires are projected to more than double, even if future fire severity does not change. Fuels treatment scenarios significantly reduced simulated future burned area and emissions below untreated projections.\nHigh severity burned area responded to both climate and fuels treatments. A sensitivity analysis indicated that in areas where the fraction of highly altered fuels is high, successfully restoring fuels to prehistoric conditions could more than compensate for expected climate change effects on fire severity by mid-century.",

            "abstract": "Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are produced either in solar flares or by coronal mass ejection (CME) shocks. While a strong CME shock can be large enough to cover a significant fraction of the solar surface, a typical solar flare must be very narrow. Many SEP events with the impulsive flare signature of an enhanced He3/He4 ratio can be seen simultaneously by several spacecraft located over a wide range of longitudes and latitudes. Also, as indicated by EUV waves appearing on the solar surface, CME shock waves expand at a finite speed in the corona. All these suggest that SEP source is not uniformly injected and distributed on the sun. However, SEP often can reach a nearly uniform distribution known as SEP reservoir throughout the inner heliosphere within less than a few days. To understand these, we use our 3-d model of SEP coronal and interplanetary propagation including perpendicular diffusion to investigate the behavior of SEP intensity and anisotropy seen at 1 AU. We examine how various possible scenarios of magnetic connections to a CME or flare site and particle injection profiles on the sun might affect the results.",

            "abstract": "Accurate quantification of surface snow-accumulation over Antarctica is important for mass balance estimates and climate studies based on ice core records. Using airborne radar, lidar and thresholds of surface slope, modeled surface mass balance (SMB) and wind fields, we have predicted continent-wide distribution of wind-scour zones over Antarctica. These zones are located over relatively steep ice surfaces formed by ice flow over bedrock topography. Near-surface winds accelerate over these steeper slopes and erode and sublimate the snow. This results in numerous localized regions (typically ≤ 200 km2) with reduced or negative surface accumulation. Although small zones of re-deposition occur at the base of the steeper slope areas, the redeposited mass is small relative to the ablation loss. Total losses from wind-scour and wind-glaze areas amounts to tens of gigatons annually. Near the coast, winds often blow significant amounts of surface snow from these zones into the ocean. Large uncertainties remain in SMB estimates over East Antarctica as climate models do not adequately represent the small-scale physical processes that lead to mass loss or redistribution over the wind-scour zones.\nIn this study, we also use Operation IceBridge’s snow radar data to provide evidence for a gradual ablation of ~16-18 m of firn (~200 years of accumulation) from wind-scour zones over the upper Recovery Ice Stream catchment. The maximum ablation rates observed in this region are ~ -54 kg m-2 a-1 (-54 mm water equivalent a-1). Our airborne radio echo-sounding analysis show snow redeposition downslope of the wind-scour zones is <10% of the cumulative mass loss. Our study shows that the local mass loss is dominated by sublimation to water vapor rather than wind-transport of snow.",

            "abstract": "The global 3D MHD WSA-ENLIL model provides a time-dependent background heliospheric description, into which a spherical shaped CME can be inserted. Understanding gradual SEP events (often driven by CMEs) well enough to forecast their properties at a given location requires a realistic picture of the global background solar wind through which the shocks and SEPs propagate. Accurate descriptions of the heliosphere, and hence modeled SEPs, are achieved by ENLIL only when the background solar wind is well-reproduced and CME parameters are accurate. It is clear from our preliminary runs that the CMEs sometimes generate multiple shocks, some of which fade while others merge and/or strengthen as they propagate. In order to completely characterize the SEP profiles observed at locations spread in longitude with the aid of these simulations it is essential to include all of the relevant CMEs and allow enough time for the events to propagate and interact. ENLIL provides solar wind parameters and additionally one can extract the magnetic topologies of observer-connected magnetic field lines and all plasma and shock properties along those field lines. ENLIL “likelihood/all-clear” forecasting maps provide expected intensity, timing/duration of events at locations throughout the heliosphere with “possible SEP affected areas” color-coded based on shock strength. ENLIL simulations are also useful to drive SEP models such as the Solar Energetic Particle Model (SEPMOD) and Earth-Moon-Mars Radiation Environment Module (EMMREM). In this presentation we demonstrate case studies of SEP event modeling at locations spread in longitude based on WSA-ENLIL+Cone simulations.",

            "abstract": "The Pearl River Delta (PRD) in southeastern Louisiana is an actively deforming deltaic complex displaying surface and near-surface evidence of growth faulting. Active growth faults in these environments are rarely identified at the surface, in part because the downthrown blocks often experience increased rates of sediment deposition leading to an obscured and low-relief, or entirely absent, surface expression. Faulting can be expressed in fluvial systems as changes in channel gradient, which often result in coincident changes in channel sinuosity, migration rates, planform deflections, and/or ponding features within the deformed zone. The study area is focused on a meander bend of the West Pearl River (WPR). The nature of the meander bend suggests the likely presence of a short growth fault controlling channel morphology. This research tested the hypotheses that active near-surface growth faulting is constraining the tortuous meander bend of the WPR and that growth faults, where present and active, are strongly coupled to channel meander planform changes and marsh vertical accretion rates in the PRD. Tools including shallow lithostratigraphy, use of fallout radionuclides (210Pb, 137Cs, 7Be) to quantify marsh vertical accretion rates, and a ~75 year record of WPR channel migration show that active growth faulting exists along the northern bend of the WPR with resultant lateral channel deflection. Evidence of this growth fault suggests further, eastward extension of the Baton Rouge Fault Zone (BRFZ) into the PRD",

            "abstract": "We made a paleomagnetic study in two separate zones of the Chilean forearc, between 18-22ºS and between 28-32ºS, sampling igneous and sedimentary rocks with ages ranging from Triassic to Miocene. More than 500 samples showed a stable magnetization, with hematite and magnetite being the principal carriers of magnetism. The rotation pattern obtained, added to previously published paleomagnetic data, show a continuous database for the Chilean forearc, between 19 and 35ºS, allowing us to separate distinct patterns in 4 major rotational zones: (1) Between 18-19.5ºS there is a strong anticlockwise rotational pattern, in agreement with the data known in southern Peru. (2) Between 19.5-22.5ºS, there is little to no rotation, with the southern limit being related to a major structural feature: The Antofagasta–Calama Lineament. (3) Between 22.5-29ºS there is a strong clockwise rotation pattern of nearly 30º. (4) Between 29-32ºS there is again a little to non-rotational pattern, in the area of the Pampean flat-slab. Overlapping these zones and the recognized accreted terranes boundaries shows a clear spatial relation between these and the limits of the rotated zones. We propose that the limits of this rotational domains can be linked to basament hinge-like weakness zones that helped to create the margin curvatures observed today. Under this model, the bolivian orocline would be the result of the opening of a hinge, helped by other geodynamics features like sea mountains and ridges, at the limit between the old accreted paleozoic terranes of Antofalla and Arequipa.",

            "abstract": "A complex relationship exists between snow accumulation (e.g., net surface mass balance) and meter-scale surface roughness as represented by sastrugi and erosional structures over the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS). The morphology of the ice sheet at this scale is a result of a complex interaction between katabatic winds, synoptic storms, and the slope of the surface, all driving local patterns of snow accretion and sublimation. In megadune regions, the accumulation, surface slope, and surface roughness are highly correlated with slope. Smooth glazed surfaces are present on the steeper leeward wind-faces, and much rougher snow-accreting megadunes are present on the windward (depositional) slope. However, the highest elevation areas near the ridge crest of the EAIS (above ~3200 m) have a converse relationship between roughness and accumulation. Here, very low wind ridge crest areas are smooth and have higher accumulation than adjacent, slightly steeper regions that exhibit a slight increase in roughness. Below the main regions of megadunes (<~2000 m) wind glaze areas gradually become rougher as wind scouring and erosion dominate locally steeper regions. In coastal areas (<~1000), roughness is highly variable, and is tied to frequent synoptic storm deposition.\nWe compare roughness data derived from MISR (Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer) and Landsat 8 acquisitions with available wind and accumulation data from climate model results and field measurements. Roughness is determined by sunlight scattering relative to viewing geometry (MISR) or from the amplitude of textural characteristics tied to surface sastrugi (Landsat 8). Both are validated by comparison with meter-scale images (WorldView-1) and field observations. MISR roughness mapping shows persistent qualitative patterns of surface roughness across the EAIS, but an absolute roughness scale mapping is difficult to generate because of complex viewing, illumination, and bi-directional reflectance variations of the snow surface. Landsat 8 band 8 provides a more constrained viewing geometry (nadir, sun-synchronous observations) and has a high radiometric sensitivity and adequate resolution (15 m) to reveal textural details in a consistent and quantitative way.",

Observations (up to E ~10 MeV) show clearly the behavior of the outer electron radiation belt at different time scales: months-long periods of gradual inward radial diffusive transport and weak loss being punctuated by dramatic flux changes driven by strong solar wind transient events. Analysis of multi-MeV electron flux and phase space density (PSD) changes during key intervals in March 2013 and March 2015 are presented in the context of the first three years of Van Allen Probes operation. These March periods demonstrate the classic signatures both of inward radial diffusive energization as well as abrupt localized acceleration deep within the outer Van Allen zone (L ~4.0±0.5). Such results reveal graphically that both “competing” mechanisms of multi-MeV electron energization are at play in the radiation belts, often acting almost concurrently or at least in very rapid succession. They also show in remarkable ways how the coldest plasmas in the magnetosphere intimately control the most highly energetic particles.",

We use geochemical and geophysical data to reconstruct the evolution of the Central American Land Bridge (Costa Rica and Panama) over the last 70 Ma. We also include new preliminary data from a key turning point (~12-6 Ma) from the evolution from an oceanic arc depleted in incompatible elements to a juvenile continental mass in order to evaluate current models of continental crust formation. We also discovered that seismic P-waves (body waves) travel through the crust at velocities closer to the ones observed in continental crust worldwide. Based on global statistical analyses of all magmas produced today in oceanic arcs compared to the global average composition of continental crust we developed a continental index. Our goal was to quantitatively correlate geochemical composition with the average P-wave velocity of arc crust. We suggest that although the formation and evolution of continents may involve many processes, melting enriched oceanic crust within a subduction zone, a process probably more common in the Achaean where most continental landmasses formed, can produce the starting material necessary for juvenile continental crust formation.",

            "abstract": "The East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) is one prominent summertime circulation feature, arising from zonally asymmetric forcing, such as land-sea contrast, topographic influences and sea surface temperature (SST) patterns. In this study, we investigate the EASM regional climate change at different time scales in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project – Phase 5 (CMIP5) archive. In the greenhouse gas forced scenario, the reduction of radiative cooling and the increase in continental surface temperature occur much more rapidly than changes in SSTs. On shorter time scales, before SSTs are able to adjust, the rainfall in the monsoon region decreases (increases) over ocean (land) in most models. On longer time scales, as SSTs increase, rainfall changes have opposite sign. The total response to atmospheric CO2 forcing and subsequent SST warming is a large (modest) increase in rainfall over ocean (land) in the EASM region. Dynamic changes, in spite of significant contributions from the thermodynamic component, play an important role in setting up the spatial pattern of the precipitation response. Rainfall anomalies over East China are a direct consequence of local land-sea contrast, while changes in the broader rainfall band over the ocean are closely associated with the displacement of the larger-scale North Pacific Subtropical High. Numerical simulations with the GFDL AM2.1 GCM show that topography and SST patterns play an important role in rainfall changes in the EASM region.",

            "abstract": "Interfacial and/or surface defects are likely to be present in most naturally occuring as well as experimentally synthesized materials, including those in the Earth's interior. With regard to influence of these defects on material properties, they are suggested to enhance the diffusion and creep processes. The interfacial regions are also considered to serve as effective sinks for point defects including impurities. To assess some these properties, we have recently simulated (by employing density functional theory) native defects and impurities in Mg2SiO4 forsterite (which along with its high pressure-temperature phases constitute to be one of the most abundant materials of the Earth’s upper mantle) grain boundaries (GB). A number of energetically competitive tilt boundaries of types (0l1)/[100], (1l0)/[001] and (012)/[100] are considered for the study. In case of native defects, for all considered configurations, the results show a strong tendency to segregate to the interface region with an energy difference of (as high as) ~4 eV between the defect-in-bulk and defect-in-interface region. Similar overall trend is also observed for impurity cations (Ca and Al) and protons. Compression further facilitates segregation, supporting (our) previous results on MgO grain boundaries. In addition, finite temperature molecular dynamics data clearly shows enhanced dynamics for the impurity cations in the interface as compared to the host ions or impurity in bulk. In agreement with experimental suggestions, the present results demonstrate that GB regions can indeed serve as high-defect and high-mobility regions. The indication that the pressure enhances the stability of these interfacial defects may have profound implications for the Earth's mantle. Although the quantitative effect of temperature is not explored at this moment, it may further enhance these characteristics in the amorphous-like GB regions.",

Because of the potential seismic hazard of these faults, several surveys have focused on the paleoseismic characterization of the structures, as it has been the Mejillones Fault, which presents a 60-70° dip to the east, a 0.6 m/ka slip rate (Holocene) and a 30 km surficial trace length extending from the peninsula to about 40 km to the north, across the continental shelf. However, little is known about the geometry of this fault, a fundamental characteristic to understand the evolution that the fault has experienced since the beggining of the margin uplifting and the relationship it would have with the processes occurring in the interplate contact of the subduction zone, which is located about 25 km depth with an inclination of ~18° to the east. From data obtained by a subbotom acoustic profiler (3.5 to 12 kHz) faults that dislocate the bathymetry of the seabed and anticlines and synclines with broad wavelengths (~10 km ) were recognized in the Neogene deposits arranged on the continental shelf depth, indicating that the geometry of the Mejillones Fault not correspond completely to a planar fault. At the north end the Mejillones Fault has its tip point and it overlaps with another major fault. Both structures have a stepping geometry and convergent dip directions. This last fault dip to the trench and would be linked to tectonic erosion that occurs in the continental margin of northern Chile. The geometry and depth of these faults is a first attempt to understand how these structures would be controlled by seismic processes occurring in the margin of the outer forearc at the 23° S, where the upper crust area has been interpreted as a barrier to rupture propagation for subduction earthquakes, as the great Mw ~8.8 earthquake occurred in 1877 and the recently Mw 7.7 Tocopilla earthquake in 2007.",

The data reveal that the cold plasma short-circuits substorm-injected hot plasma jets when the cold plasma density exceeds a critical value of 5-10 c.c. The substorm-injected hot electrons stop at the pre-substorm plasmapause, thereby providing a natural explanation of the long-known dispersionless auroral precipitation boundary. A turbulent plasmaspheric boundary layer forms initially near the pre-substorm plasmapause due to interactions between the injected and plasmaspheric populations. The main sources of the greatly-enhanced wave activity are the so-called modified two-stream instability driven by the hot electron diamagnetic drift in the entry layer, ion-ring instability driven by the highly-anisotropic hot ion distribution in the central part, and the diamagnetic drift of hot ions near the inner edge. Enhanced plasma turbulence leads to heating of the cold plasma and to acceleration of suprathermal electron tails, thereby enhancing the downward heat transport and concomitant heating of the ionospheric electrons observed by the DMSP satellites.

            "abstract": "The InSight mission to Mars will launch in March of 2016, landing six months later in Elysium Planitia. In contrast to the 43 previous missions to Mars, which have thoroughly explored its surface features and chemistry, atmosphere, and searched for past or present life, InSight will focus on the deep interior of the planet. InSight will investigate the fundamental processes of terrestrial planet formation and evolution by performing the first comprehensive surface-based geophysical measurements on Mars. It will provide key information on the composition and structure of an Earth-like planet that has gone through most of the evolutionary stages of the Earth up to plate tectonics.\nThe planet Mars can play a key role in understanding early terrestrial planet formation and evolution. Unlike the Earth, its overall structure appears to be relatively unchanged since the first few hundred million years after formation; unlike the Moon, it is large enough that the P-T conditions within the planet span an appreciable fraction of the terrestrial planet range. Thus the large-scale chemical and structural evidence preserved in Mars’ interior should tell us a great deal about the processes of planetary differentiation and heat transport.\nInSight will undertake this investigation using the “traditional” geophysical techniques of seismology, precision tracking (for rotational dynamics), and heat flow measurement. The predominant challenge, in addition to the technical problems of the remote installation and operation of instruments on a distant and harsh planetary surface, comes from the practical limitation of working with data acquired from a single station. We will discuss how we overcome these limitations through the application of single-station seismic analysis techniques, which take advantage of some of the specific attributes of Mars, and global heat flow modeling, which allows the interpretation of a single measurement of a spatially inhomogeneous surface distribution.",

In our experiments, we vary the temperature and salinity of the salt water and measure the dissolution rate of the ice, the temperature of the ice-water interface, the maximum vertical velocity of the buoyant plume, and the rate at which the laboratory tank becomes stratified with buoyant fluid. Using this experimental information, we then construct a theoretical model of the turbulent buoyant plume as a function of height. The plume has a top-hat entrainment coefficient of 0.048 ± 0.006, and is found to have substantial drag. The plume model is used to calculate a plume width, velocity, buoyancy and Reynolds number for typical dissolving icebergs and ice shelf fronts.\nOur laboratory experiments also examine the effect of a linear salinity gradient on the dissolution of a vertical ice face. As the stratification is increased, the dissolution rate, the interface temperature and the maximum vertical plume velocity all decrease, and their dependence on height changes. We also outline a method of scaling the effects of stratification from our laboratory experiments to the much larger vertical scales of ice shelves and icebergs.",

Developing a turbulence scheme applicable to the gray zone is required practically because a numerical weather prediction (NWP) model with such the resolution will be achieved in the near future.\nTo explore a parameterization scheme for the gray zone, we focus on the length scales associated with the TKE dissipation and the eddy viscosity. First, dependence of these length scales on the horizontal grid size is investigated for a mixed layer through a priori analysis. The obtained length scales are highly anisotropic even though the aspect ratio between the horizontal and vertical grid sizes is close to unity.\nFurthermore, the length scales as the functions of the horizontal and vertical grid sizes are empirically determined from the results obtained from the a priori analysis, and are incorporated into the Deardorff model. The numerical experiments with the new model are performed for an ideal unstable boundary layer, and are compared with those with the original Deardorff model, which employs the isotropic length scale. The new model is capable of appropriately representing the resolved convection and the heat flux even for a model resolution corresponding to the gray zone, whereas the original Deardorff model underestimates the effect of the subgrid scale motions and artificial convections become dominant as the model resolution is coarser.",

Both events were well recorded by strong motion networks, provided valuable information to be used for forward predictions of ground motions records. In traditional finite-fault stochastic method one generic horizontal component of the synthetic accelerograms are obtained considering only incident vertical rays of S waves. The observed strong motion records show important differences among horizontal and vertical components. Then in order to generate 3 components of strong motion we improve this method to simulate the arrive to free surface of the P, SV and SH waves. We considered the incident and azimuth angles of direct seismic rays propagating for a layered velocity model including the free surface and energy partition. We validate our strong ground motion simulation by comparing the synthetic and observed data in a wide frequency range (0.1-20 Hz) for the Tocopilla (2007) and Iquique (2014) earthquakes. Finally, we use this method to propose the synthetic accelerograms for several potential rupture scenarios for mega-earthquakes in northern Chile, these scenarios were proposed considering coupling models and the historical earthquake records. The results show large PGA values near 1 g, for station located on hard rock. An important trade - off between the PGA and the proposed slip distribution was observed. The maximum slip distribution located in deeper seismogenic contact produce the large PGA in the nearest stations.",

            "abstract": "Among the crucial problems involved in the tropical energy budget are the thermodynamic effects of an ensemble of convective clouds on their environment and the large-scale influence imposed back on the convective-scale dynamics. Efforts to seek observational evidence for this problem, however, are challenged by limitations in the capability of measuring vertical motion across different horizontal scales. We have recently been exploring new analysis strategies in hopes to make this seemingly impossible possible, exploiting a suite of satellite instruments including the CloudSat and TRMM radars and Aqua AIRS.\nSince a complete vertical structure of in-cloud vertical velocity, wc, is unable to be reconstructed from satellite measurements alone, a single-column plume model is run with the environmental soundings from AIRS to obtain a set of synthetic wc profiles under a range of entrainment rates. The solutions are then narrowed down in a Bayesian manner so as to match the cloud-top vertical velocity and buoyancy estimates from A-Train infrared and radar measurements. The vertical profile of large-scale mean vertical motion, ω, is also evaluated from satellite observations in its own approach: ω as a function of pressure is determined so that it satisfies the horizontal divergence terms in the tropospheric water and thermal budget equations in which the remaining terms are constrained by satellite measurements.\nIn this talk, the methodology is briefly outlined and the results are presented and discussed in light of outstanding issues in tropical dynamics. The wc and ω estimates above, although subject to intrinsic uncertainties yet to be verified, do not involve any closure assumption as required for cumulus parameterizations and would offer a useful test bed for climate models and reanalysis data as well as a unique opportunity to study the mechanism of tropical convection.",

Global terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) can annually consume 1.483 × 1023 joules of solar energy, which is about 300 times of the annual human energy use on the earth (4.935×1020 joules). This huge amount of energy use by ET indicates that there is great potential to cool the urban by regulating ET. However, accurately measurement of urban ET is quiet difficult because of the great spatial heterogeneity in urban. This study focuses on to quantify the cooling effects ET by mobile traverse method and improve a methodology to measure the urban ET by thermal remote sensing. The verifying experiment was carried out in Shenzhen, a sub-tropical mega city in China. Results showed that ET of vegetation could obviously reduce the urban temperature in hot season. Daily transpiration rate of a small-sized Ficus tree (Ficus microcarpa, 5 m in height and 20 cm of trunk diameter, measured by sap-flow method) was 36-55 kg and its cooling effect was equivalent to a 1.6-2.4 kWh air conditioner working for 24 hours. A 10% increase in the vegetated area could decrease urban temperature by 0.60°C at hot night. Moreover, it was found that a region with a vegetated area ratio over 55% had obvious effect on temperature decreasing. In addition, a methodology by using “thermal remote sensing + three-temperature model” was improved to measure the urban ET. Results showed that the urban ET could be reasonably measured by the proposed method. The daily ET of an urban lawn was 0.01-2.86 mm and monthly ET was 21-60 mm. This result agreed well with the verification study (Bowen ratio method, r=0.953). These results are very useful for urban planning, urban lower impact development, and improving of urban thermal environment.",

They are represented mainly garnet granulites and eclogite-like rocks, which underwent by deformations and retrograde metamorphism, and younger fresh pegmatoid garnet-kaersutite-clinopyroxene (Al-Ti augite) rocks; mantle peridotites are absent in these populations. According to mineralogical geothermobarometers, forming of garnet-granulite suite rocks occurred under pressure 13.5-15.4 kbar (depths 45-54 км) and temperature 965-1115оС.\nAt the same time, among populations of mantle xenoliths in the Late Cenozoic platobasalts of the region, quite the contrary, lower crustal xenoliths are absent, however, predominated spinel lherzolites (fragments of upper cooled rim of a plume head), derived from the close depths (30-40 km: Sharkov, Bogatikov, 2015).\nFrom this follows that ancient continental crust was existed here even in the Middle Cretaceous, but in the Late Cenozoic was removed by extended mantle plume head; at that upper sialic crust was not involved in geomechanic processes, because Precambrian metamorphic rocks survived as a basement for Cambrian to Cenozoic sedimentary cover of Arabian platform. In other words, though cardinal rebuilding of deep-seated structure of the region occurred in the Late Cenozoic but it did not affect on the upper shell of the ancient lithosphere.\nBecause composition of mantle xenolithis in basalts is practically similar worldwide, we suggest that deep-seated processes are analogous also. As emplacement of the mantle plume heads accompanied by powerful basaltic magmatism, very likely that range of lower (mafic) continental crust existence is very convenient for extension of plume heads and their adiabatic melting. If such level, because of whatever reasons, was not reached, melting was limited but appeared excess of volatile matters which led to forming of lamprophyre or even kimberlite.",

Integrating textural, petrological, geochemical, and geochronological information on such deposits with geophysical signals (gravimetry, seismology, MT surveys) suggest incremental growth and evolution of subvolcanic magmas bodies that are dominated by high crystallinity mush zones, but remain in parts, and during periods of relatively high magma fluxes, sufficiently liquid to erupt. The eruptible upper portions are either extracted melt from the mush, or rejuvenated fractions of it, and constitute only a small volumetric fraction of the vertically extensive mushy batholithic magma body. The high-flux, ignimbrite flare-up phases are typically preceded by waxing magmatism that prime the crust to hold large upper crustal silicic reservoirs where the most evolved magmas, rhyolites, are likely to be generated. Ages and compositional complementarities between the silicic volcanic and plutonic lithologies suggest that they are intimately linked, although plutonic masses will be inherently more complex and longer-lived than any volcanic systems spawned from them. Gas exsolution within such mushy reservoirs, and accumulation of the low density bubbles in the most melt-rich parts of the system, will also enhance eruptibility, emphasizing some of the observed chemical differences between evolved plutonic and volcanic rocks (e.g., typically higher Rb/Sr ratios in volcanic units).",

The growing longitudinal separation of the spacecraft improved the ability to investigate the longitudinal distribution of SEP events and to unambiguously detect wide-spread events. Several of those events showing longitudinal SEP distributions of up to all around the Sun have been observed. The strongly varying characteristics of those events suggest that there must be various mechanisms which contribute to the wide angular particle spreads. On the one hand strong perpendicular diffusion is favored to explain those wide SEP spreads. In this scenario we expect isotropic fluxes at far separated observers. However, other events show significant anisotropies over broad longitudinal ranges which requires extended injection regions close to the Sun. Several processes are under discussion which would provide those exteded injections, e.g. coronal and interplanetary shocks, coronal transport processes, and EIT waves. We will discuss case studies as well as statistical investigations of wide-spread SEP observations in terms of the most important drivers of these wide particle distributions.",

The reservoir operation model is integrated with a daily water allocation model which results in daily variations of allocated water, soil moisture, and crop evapotranspiration (ET) deficits.\nA short term real time operation model is also developed for irrigation of multiple crops with the following distinguishing features with respect to the FSDP model: a) Apart from inclusion of fuzziness in reservoir storage and in soil moisture of crops, spatial variations in rainfall and soil moisture of crops are included in the model by considering gridded command area with a grid size of 0.5 degree latitude by 0.5 degree longitude, b) The water allocation model and soil moisture balance equations are integrated with the real time operation model with consideration of ponding water depth for Paddy crop, and c) The release policy is developed using forecasted daily rainfall data of each grid and is implemented for the current time period using actual 10-day inflow and actual daily rainfall of each grid.\nA case study of an existing Bhadra Reservoir in Karnataka, India is chosen for the model application. The results are found to be more acceptable for the case study than those of the classical stochastic dynamic model and the standard operating policy model, in terms of ten-day releases from the reservoir and evapotranspiration deficit.

            "abstract": "   Dark data are any data of value to society but not easily found or readily used by potential users. Dark data are typically those gathered by individual scientists in small independent projects, in contrast to visible data collected, in general, by large coordinated teams in organized projects with well-executed data management and sharing plans. Analogous to dark matter vs. visible matter in the universe, dark data may be more voluminous than visible data as majority of the scientists of the world work in small independent projects. Dark data can be easily lost to science. The scientific community has a collective responsibility to curb this wasteful loss of valuable research resources. We believe this responsibility can be carried out without adding an undue administrative burden to data contributors if an innovative information system implementing the SErvices in Exchange for Data Sharing (SEEDS) principle is available. It is a tedious and time-consuming process to make data ready for long-term archiving and for sharing with the broader scientific community. At present, this process occurs after individual scientists have already spent considerable amount of time to prepare the data for rigorous mathematical and statistical analyses to satisfy their own research objectives, which generally culminates in the publication of scientific papers. Productive scientists are busy. Even if they are willing to share their data, they may not have the time needed to take cumbersome extra steps to make the data understandable and usable to others. Lack of motivation may also become an issue after the scientific findings of interest to them have been extracted and published; for them, this is a time to look for a new exciting research frontier to attack, not a time to dwell on past research. SEEDS integrates data analyses, sharing, and management into a single IS service process, which reduces data contributors’ own research workload and also eliminates the time cost of data sharing. In this presentation, I will use LeafWeb (leafweb.ornl.gov) to demonstrate how the SEEDS principle can be implemented in the context of Earth system science and biogeochemistry.",

Here we analyze 25-year (1990-2014) annual mean ground-level ozone across the U.S. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) and linear fitting show that ozone has experienced a notable rate of growth at 0.13 ppb/yr averaged over U.S. About 74% of this growth is attributed to enhancement in nighttime ozone (at 0.19 ppb/yr), with the remaining 26% due to daytime ozone increase (at 0.07 ppb/yr). To relate ozone interannual variations to climate change, we employ the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) and Southern Oscillation (SO) indices to infer the states of climate over the U.S. We find large correlations between ozone interannual variability and these climate indices: 0.65 for SO index, 0.73 for AMO index, and 0.82 for their combined index. The correlations are much higher (0.69, 0.78 and 0.86) for daytime ozone. Sensitivity simulations conducted with the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model reveal that climate variability has determined ozone interannual variability, particularly for daytime ozone, while anthropogenic emissions reductions have particularly driven the growth in nighttime ozone. These results better connect ozone air pollution with human activity and climate change.\nFigure.

            "abstract": "Surface deformations due to loading, with yet no comprehensive representation, account for a significant part of the variability in geodetic time series. We assess effects of loading in GPS vertical displacement time series at several frequency bands. We compare displacement derived from up-to-date loading models to two global sets of positioning time series, and investigate how they are reduced looking at interannual periods (> 2 months), intermediate periods (> 7 days) and the whole spectrum (> 1day). We assess the impact of interannual loading on estimating velocities. We compute atmospheric loading effects using surface pressure fields from the ECMWF. We use the inverted barometer (IB) hypothesis valid for periods exceeding a week to describe the ocean response to the pressure forcing. We used general circulation ocean model (ECCO and GLORYS) to account for wind, heat and fresh water flux. We separately use the Toulouse Unstructured Grid Ocean model (TUGO-m), forced by air pressure and winds, to represent the dynamics of the ocean response at high frequencies. The continental water storage is described using GLDAS/Noah and MERRA-land models. Non-hydrology loading reduces the variability of the observed vertical displacement differently according to the frequency band. The hydrology loading leads to a further reduction mostly at annual periods. ECMWF+TUGO-m better agrees with vertical surface motion than the ECMWF+IB model at all frequencies. The interannual deformation is time-correlated at most of the locations. It is adequately described by a power-law process of spectral index varying from -1.5 to -0.2. Depending on the power-law parameters, the predicted non-linear deformation due to mass loading variations leads to vertical velocity biases up to 0.7 mm/yr when estimated from 5 years of continuous observations. The maximum velocity bias can reach up to 1 mm/yr in regions around the southern Tropical band.",

            "abstract": "Among VOCs, isoprene is the most largely emitted hydrocarbon in the atmosphere, with global annual emissions estimated a about 500 Tg, but with large uncertainties (Arneth et al., 2011). Here we use the source inversion approach to derive top-down biogenic isoprene emission estimates for the period between 2005 and 2013 constrained by formaldehyde columns retrieved from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). To this aim, the IMAGESv2 global chemistry-transport model and its adjoint code are adopted, and the MEGAN-MOHYCAN-v2 updated model is used as bottom-up inventory for isoprene emissions (Stavrakou et al., 2014). The inversions are performed for each year of the study period, and monthly emissions are derived for every model grid. The inversion results are compared to independent isoprene emissions from GUESS-ES (Arneth et al., 2007) and MEGAN-MACC (Sindelarova et al., 2014), to ground-based isoprene flux measurements in Amazonia and to top-down fluxes based on GOME-2 formaldehyde columns (Stavrakou et al., 2015).\nThe mean global annual OMI-based isoprene flux for the period 2005-2013 is estimated at 307 Tg, with small interannual variation between a minimum in 2008 and 2013 (294 Tg) and a maximum in 2010 (317 Tg). This estimate is by 12% lower with regard to the a priori inventory on average, and substantially lower than the MEGAN-MACC and the GUESS-ES inventory. The inferred reduction is well in line with the GOME-2 based inversion, and is found to be the strongest in tropical regions for both inversions. Flux measurements in the Amazon forest show large variability, and are generally higher than the bottom-up and top-down fluxes especially in the dry season. Top-down isoprene fluxes are available at a resolution of 0.5°x0.5° between 2005 and 2013 on the GlobEmission website (http://www.globemission.eu).",

            "abstract": "Tectonic tremor and low-frequency earthquakes (LFE) are found in the deeper crust of various tectonic environments in the last decade. LFEs are presumed to be caused by failure of deep fault patches during a slow slip event, and the long-term variation in LFE recurrence could provide crucial insight into the deep fault zone processes that may lead to future large earthquakes. However, the physical mechanisms causing the temporal changes of LFE recurrence are still under debate. In this study, we combine observations of long-term changes in LFE recurrence near Parkfield, California (Wu et al. 2013) with a brittle and ductile friction (BDF) model (Daub et al. 2011), and use the model to constrain the possible physical mechanisms causing the observed long-term changes in LFE recurrence after the 2004 M6 Parkfield earthquake. The BDF model mimics the slipping of deep fault patches by a spring-drugged block slider with both brittle and ductile friction components. Our on-going work includes testing the BDF model by varying two sets of parameters: 1) time varying shear stress caused by the postseismic relaxation of the static stress imposed by the 2004 Parkfield earthquake, and 2) gradual recovery of brittle friction strength following the strong shaking of the Parkfield earthquake. Hopefully our modeling results can help to clarify the roles of the two mechanisms, and link seismic observations of LFE to the physics of deep fault deformation.",

We develop a parameterization of the average reversal frequency from numerical dynamos in terms of the core heat flux normalized by the difference between the present-day core heat flux and the core heat flux at geomagnetic superchron onset. A low-order polynomial fit of this parameterization to the 0-300 Ma Geomagnetic Polarity Time Scale (GPTS) reveals that a decrease in core heat flux relative to present-day of approximately 30% can account for the Cretaceous Normal Polarity and Kiaman Reversed Polarity Superchrons, whereas the hyper-reversing periods in the Jurassic GPTS imply a core heat flux approximately 20% higher than at present-day. Low heat flux and slow cooling of the core inferred during the Kiaman Reversed Polarity Superchron is qualitatively consistent with predictions from mantle global circulation models (mantle GCMs) that show a reduction in mantle convective activity during the time of Pangea, whereas these same mantle GCMs and most plate motion reconstructions predict fast core cooling during the Cretaceous Normal Polarity Superchron, suggesting that the cooling rate of the core is not generally in phase with variations in plate motions.",

            "abstract": "In 2014, tropical dry forest (TDF) ecosystems in northwestern Costa Rica experienced the most severe drought on record since 1950, in which precipitation in the first four months of the rainy season (May-August) was 43% of normal. We used this opportunity to quantify the impact of soil water availability on the maintenance of diurnal leaf water potential (LWP) in a diverse set of tree and liana taxa. Across sites spanning a large soil texture and water potential gradient, we measured pre-dawn (pdLWP) and mid-day leaf water potential (mdLWP) of 79 individuals of 14 tree and 7 liana species both during the peak of the drought (early August), and well after the onset of wet season rains (late September). In addition, we quantified a suite of resource-acquisition related leaf traits for every individual. The maintenance of leaf water potential throughout the day (deltaLWP = mdLWP – pdLWP) varied dramatically among species (Figure 1). During the drought, evergreen species experienced significantly higher drought stress overall (larger deltaLWP) than deciduous species, but trees did not differ from lianas in their responses. The ability of TDF trees or lianas to maintain LWP did not depend on site-specific soil water potential, indicating that soil water retaining characteristics may not be good predictors of overall community responses to drought. We found that TDF tree and liana species have a wide range of responses to severe drought, and future integration of both leaf trait and physiological data (turgor loss point, stomatal conductance) will allow us to determine if specific leaf traits or physiological metrics are good predictors of tree and liana drought responses in TDF.",

Volcanics from these regions are well studied, but the forearc lithospheric mantle is less well understood, partly due to the limited number of locations with peridotite exposed in situ. The Tonga and Mariana trenches are non-accretionary convergent margins where peridotites have been collected from the wall of the over-riding plate. These forearc peridotites present a unique opportunity to study the processes associated with subduction initiation from an in-situ source.\nForearc peridotites from both localities show distinct chemical heterogeneity. While all samples are extremely refractory, as evidenced by low modal abundances of clinopyroxene, they differ significantly in terms of mineral compositions and accessory phases. Minerals present in a subset of samples include plagioclase, amphibole, and sulfides. Samples also vary significantly in spinel Cr# and wt% TiO2.\nWe used the spinel peridotite oxygen barometer of Bryndzia and Wood (1990) to calculate the oxygen fugacity of the samples, calculating Fe3+/ΣFe ratio in spinels using Mössbauer-calibrated electron microprobe analysis. Samples from Mariana as well as one dredge from Tonga record elevated fO2 (1-2 log units above the QFM buffer), similar to results seen from subduction xenoliths. However, three other dredges from Tonga do not show this signature of oxidation, instead trending to high Cr# at a more ridge-like oxidation state (slightly below QFM). We interpret these non-oxidized values to be representative of primary mantle at the earliest stages of subduction, suggesting that sub-arc mantle is not oxidized prior to arc initiation. Elevated oxidation signatures then develop once this primary mantle interacts with arc-like melts and fluids related to dehydration of the subducting slab.",

To address this, Atmospheric Science faculty at Lyndon State College are providing undergraduate students the opportunity to practice this important skill by reaching out to the local community. Over the past year, students have been meeting regularly to discuss climate change and its impacts, and to present this information to the general public at local schools and organizations. The group was organized with the primary goal of teaching undergraduate students about effective ways to communicate basic climate science to nonscientists, but to also improve public understanding of anthropogenic climate change while starting a conversation among young people in the community. We will identify lessons learned after one year, discuss effective strategies, and summarize student feedback.",

            "abstract": "There is increasing awareness that under-sampling may have resulted in the omission of important physicochemical information present in water quality signatures of surface waters - thereby affecting interpretation of biogeochemical processes. For dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and nitrogen this under-sampling can now be avoided using UV-visible spectroscopy measured in-situ and continuously at a fine-resolution e.g. 15 minutes (“real time”). Few methods are available to extract biogeochemical process information directly from such high-frequency data. Jones, Chappell & Tych (2014 Environ Sci Technol: 13289-97) developed one such method using optically-derived DOC data based upon a sophisticated time-series modelling tool. Within this presentation we extend the methodology to quantify the minimum sampling interval required to avoid distortion of model structures and parameters that describe fundamental biogeochemical processes. This shifting of parameters which results from under-sampling is called “aliasing”. We demonstrate that storm dynamics at a variety of sites dominate over diurnal and seasonal changes and that these must be characterised by sampling that may be sub-hourly to avoid aliasing. This is considerably shorter than that used by other water quality studies examining aliasing (e.g. Kirchner 2005 Phys Rev: 069902). The modelling approach presented is being developed into a generic tool to calculate the minimum sampling for water quality monitoring in systems driven primarily by hydrology. This is illustrated with fine-resolution, optical data from watersheds in temperate Europe through to the humid tropics.",

            "abstract": "There are several studies that clearly demonstrate that storm periods are hot moments for biogeochemical flux in headwaters (e.g. Robson et al 1993 J Hydrol: 291-310). Despite this few models have been developed that can adequately capture fast (e.g. sub-hourly) temporal dynamics through these hot moments, and an equally small proportion of monitoring stations with high-frequency observations that have been analysed systematically. We are able to show that inadequate temporal sampling of hot moments (‘aliasing’) leads to subsequent misinterpretation of biogeochemical and hydrological processes. We have addressed this through continuous deployment of state-of-the-art field sensors producing sub-hourly river data where hot moment dynamics are extracted directly using new algorithms within the CAPTAIN toolbox, following Jones, Chappell & Tych (2014 Environ Sci Technol: 13289-97). These algorithms are capable of extracting the river transport parameters associated with reactive solutes, notably carbon. We demonstrate that most of the dynamics within these biogeochemical time-series relate to individual rainstorms (the hot moments), with the shape of the storm-based response being strongly moderated by the hydrological pathways. With parsimonious modelling using CAPTAIN we are able to show that these shapes are distorted by under-sampling of stream chemistry giving rise to different interpretations of the biogeochemical pathways and associated hydrological pathways. This work provides clear evidence that researchers and practitioners should implement high-frequency water quality monitoring and associated time-series analysis.",

Of particular interest are observations of coronal field lines in the Transition Corona, the transitional region between closed and open flux systems, providing important information on eruptive instabilities and on the origin of the slow solar wind.\nWhile current instruments routinely observe the photospheric and chromospheric magnetic fields, the proposed airborne spectrometer will take a step toward the direct observation of coronal fields by measuring plasma emission in the infrared at high spatial and spectral resolution. The targeted lines are five forbidden magnetic dipole transitions between 1.4 and 4 um.

The goal of the project is to understand and document the effects of climate change on interactions between precipitation, vegetation growth, soil moisture and other landscape properties. These interactions are modeled within a framework we refer to as a virtual watershed (VW), a computer infrastructure that simulates watershed dynamics by linking scientific modeling, visualization, and data management components into a coherent whole.\nDeveloped and hosted at the Earth Data Analysis Center, University of New Mexico, the virtual watershed has a number of core functions which include: a) streamlined access to data required for model initialization and boundary conditions; b) the development of analytic scenarios through interactive visualization of available data and the storage of model configuration options; c) coupling of hydrological models through the rapid assimilation of model outputs into the data management system for access and use by sequent models. The WC-WAVE virtual watershed accomplishes these functions by provision of large-scale vector and raster data discovery, subsetting, and delivery via Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and REST web service standards. Central to the virtual watershed is the design and use of an innovative array of metadata elements that permits the stepwise coupling of diverse hydrological models (e.g. ISNOBAL, PRMS, CASiMiR) and input data to rapidly assess variation in outcomes under different climatic conditions. We present details on the architecture and functionality of the virtual watershed, results from three western U.S. watersheds, and discuss the realized benefits to watershed science of employing this integrated solution.",

            "abstract": "The surface of Mercury provides compelling insight into the planet’s interior. Excluding impact craters and basins, the most prominent landforms on Mercury are tectonic; these features are distributed globally and crosscut all major surface units. More than seven years of flyby and orbital observations by the MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) spacecraft show that tectonism on Mercury is overwhelmingly shortening in nature; extensional structures occur only within volcanically flooded impact craters and basins, in part the result of thermal contraction of thick plains units. Shortening structures show no coherent, planet-wide pattern, although many have an approximately north–south orientation, and some form fold-and-thrust belts thousands of kilometers long. Even so, their widespread distribution points to a global source of stress, primarily from global contraction in response to secular interior cooling. Some of the largest such landforms are 2–3 km in relief and hundreds of kilometers long, their underlying thrust faults penetrating 30–40 km into the lithosphere. Shortening landforms as small as hundreds of meters in length have been identified during MESSENGER’s low-altitude campaign; the crisp morphology of these features indicates that thrust faulting, and thus global contraction, continued until the geologically recent. Displacement–length scaling analysis shows that Mercury’s shortening landforms have accommodated a reduction in planetary radius of up to 7 km since the end of the late heavy bombardment. Such a magnitude of contraction is more consistent with models of global contraction from interior cooling and partial core crystallization than pre-MESSENGER estimates of tectonic shortening. Notably, the emplacement of major volcanic plains deposits on Mercury ended globally by 3.6 Ga, consistent with the onset of a state of net horizontal lithospheric compression that served to inhibit the vertical ascent and eruption of magma.",

This event corresponds to the main shock of a sequence of earthquakes that were felt from January 10, with a small earthquake of magnitude ML <3, to February 2008 as recurrent aftershocks. This area is characterized by the presence of the Liquiñe-Ofqui Fault System (LOFS), which corresponds to neotectonic feature and the main seismotectonic southern Chile. In this research we use improved sub-aqueous paleoseismological techniques with geomorphological evidence to constrain the seismogenic source of this event as cortical origin. It is established that the Punta Cola Fault, a dextral-reverse structure which exhibits in seismic profiles a complex fault zone with distinguished positive flower geometry, is responsible for the main shock. This fault caused vertical offsets that reached the seafloor generating fault scarps in a mass movement deposit triggered by the same earthquake. Following this idea, a model of surface rupture is proposed for this structure. Further evidence that this cortical phenomenon is not an isolated event in time is presented by paleoseismological trench-like mappings in sub-bottom profiles.",

            "abstract": "The greater Seattle urban area overlies a large basin subject to amplification of seismic waves during earthquakes. The depth and shape of the Seattle basin was last determined via inversion of regional gravity data in 2001; since that time, we have collected over 2000 new gravity data points across the basin. Two dimensional modeling of these gravity data with existing aeromagnetic data reveal a boundary between the two major basement rock types, the basaltic Crescent Formation (a part of Siletzia) to the west and the metamorphic western mélange belt to the east, passing beneath the middle of the basin. Our most surprising results include a westward dip for this boundary across the Seattle uplift, as opposed to an eastward dip across the Kingston arch, and steeply-dipping, deeply-rooted slices of non-magnetic Crescent included within Siletzia under the Puget lowland. We explain these results with one tectonic story: amalgamation of Siletzia with North America during the Eocene involved subduction-related duplication in a fold and thrust belt style within the Crescent and its likely obduction over the western mélange belt near the Seattle uplift. The new data also show local gravity gradients that correlate with steeply-dipping, neotectonic faults that traverse the eastern end of the Seattle basin. Prominent examples include the northwest-striking, right-lateral Rattlesnake and Whidbey Island fault systems, as well as a possible new fault striking northwest through the Lake Sammamish/Bellevue area. A simple assessment of gravity anomalies for the depth of the basin suggest it is deeper and wider to the east of Seattle than to the west. However, including the basement boundary in the gravity inversion and utilizing measured rock densities which show the western mélange belt is less dense than the Crescent Formation, we find a basement/sediment contact that is a consistent depth at a large scale across much of the basin and even shallows to the east in some areas. The new data also define local minima in basin depth that could complicate wavefields passing through it. The eventual goal of this work is generation of new simulations of ground motion amplification within the basin from both subduction zone events and crustal earthquakes on previously known and the newly-characterized faults.",

            "abstract": "Climate change impacts on vegetation distributions are typically addressed using either an empirical approach, such as a species distribution model (SDM), or with process-based methods, for example, dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). Each approach has its own benefits and disadvantages. For example, an SDM is constrained by data and few parameters, but does not include adaptation or acclimation processes or other ecosystem feedbacks that may act to mitigate or enhance climate effects. Alternatively, a DGVM model includes many mechanisms relating plant growth and disturbance to climate, but simulations are costly to perform at high-spatial resolution and there remains large uncertainty on a variety of fundamental physical processes. To address these issues, here, we present two DGVM-based case studies where i) high-resolution (1 km) simulations are being performed for vegetation in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem using a biogeochemical, forest gap model, LPJ-GUESS, and ii) where new mechanisms for simulating tropical tree-mortality are being introduced. High-resolution DGVM model simulations require not only computing and reorganizing code but also a consideration of scaling issues on vegetation dynamics and stochasticity and also on disturbance and migration. New mechanisms for simulating forest mortality must consider hydraulic limitations and carbon reserves and their interactions on source-sink dynamics and in controlling water potentials. Improving DGVM approaches by addressing spatial scale challenges and integrating new approaches for estimating forest mortality will provide new insights more relevant for land management and possibly reduce uncertainty by physical processes more directly comparable to experimental and observational evidence.",

For example in Afar there is a clear north south transition from break-up in the Erta Ale segment, where there is localised young (<1 Ma) volcanism, to the Dabbahu segment where there is the 4-1 Ma Stratoid volcanic series and distributed faulting. Along the Namibian and conjugate Argentinian margin there is evidence that surface area of seaward dipping reflectors change across segments. Such lateral changes in volcanism over a relatively short spatial scale are hard to explain by change in mantle temperature. We will demonstrate that crustal strength places a crucial control on the volume and composition of melt generated during break-up. We have compared models of extension with a weaker and strong lower crust based on observed rock rheologies. Melt composition and volume is found to be a function of the lower crustal rheology as it effects the shape of the melt zone during extension. By comparing a suite models we find that Afar volcanism can be matched by models with both a weak or strong lower crust. If however the crust is weaker then the equivalent volume and composition is created with less crustal thinning but over a greater period of time. The difference in time required to generate significant volcanic rock may explain the change in surface area of sub-areal volcanism in both Afar, where there is a transition of strong to weak crust from Erta Ale to Dabbahu, and off-shore Namibia. Lateral variation in volcanism between segments may therefore be fundamentally controlled by the crust.",

            "abstract": "Root zone soil moisture (RZSM) is the water in the soil that is within the reach of surface vegetation. When RZSM becomes sufficiently low plants are no longer able to overcome the suction force holding water in the soil. This skews the partitioning of latent and sensible heating in favor of sensible heating, thus warming the surface, and potentially invoking a positive feedback.\nFindings from Koster et al published in 2004 indicate that not only is there potential for the improvement of seasonal forecasts through tracking RZSM, but also that RZSM feedbacks are strongest in what can be thought of as wet-dry transitional zones. These are zones where surface evaporation rates average high enough to be expected to have an important influence on precipitation, and where available soil moisture is still an important constraint on how much surface evaporation takes place. In the Upper Colorado River Basin and eastern Colorado climate varies rapidly with space due to differences in elevation, and these transitional zones do exist within the domain.\nThis paper focuses on how NASA Land Data Assimilation Modeled RZSM is used to help track drought in the Upper Colorado River Basin and eastern Colorado, and addresses the additive predictive skill RZSM may have on multi-weekly and seasonal timescales across the Upper Colorado River Basin and eastern Colorado during the growing season. Daily modeled soil moisture from three land data assimilation models was correlated with North American Regional Reanalysis temperature data, and precipitation data from rain gauges interpolated using PRISM climatology in order to help answer important questions about the predictive skill of soil moisture, and its value in the drought early warning process.\nQuestions addressed here will be as follows: In what climate regimes within the domain does RZSM have the most predictive power over temperature and precipitation? Do certain predominant soil and vegetation types preferentially strengthen RZSM-atmosphere interaction? How does the behavior of RZSM during the onset of severe droughts within the domain over the last 20 years compare to normal behavior? How much do these answers vary between land surface models given the same forcing inputs?",

            "abstract": "In a bimineralic material the deformation localization is strongly dependent on the mechanical behavior of the two phases, the proportion, and the strength contrast between them. If these parameters vary at the scale of a rock sample, they also vary at lithospheric scale when units with different lithologies are juxtaposed leading to the strongly heterogeneous crust and mantle. In the lithosphere, moreover, the dependence with depth of the pressure-temperature imposes that the strength ratio between the different phases is also dependent on the depth and geotherm. Based on our previous result, we expect therefore that the compositional heterogeneities strongly influence the localization and that the resulting complex mechanisms of deformation are dependent of the geotherm and proportion of different materials constituting the lithosphere.\nTo test these ideas, we perform lithospheric scale models with a bimineralic composition in the crust and the mantle to take into account the compositional heterogeneities. We deform the model in an extensional setting and systematically change the Moho temperature and the composition of the crust and mantle.. Comparison of our models to simulations using a monomineralic crust and mantle demonstrates that a bimineralic composition assimilated to heterogeneities succeed in explaining observations related to the formation of rifted margins such as : 1) the absence of a sharp brittle ductile transition,2) the initiation of the rifting process as a wide delocalized rift system where multiple normal faults dipping in both directions; 3) the development of an anastomosing shear zone in the middle/lower crust and the upper lithospheric mantle similar to the crustal scale anastomosing pattern observed on the field or in seismic data; 4) the preservation of undeformed lenses of material leading to lithospheric scale boudinage structure and resulting in the formation of continental ribbons as observed along the Iberian-Newfoundland margin.",

In some cases, relatively simple prototypes for the dynamics underlying these distributions can assist in this characterization, pointing to key physical factors and measures to evaluate even in more complex distributions. In the case of daily temperature distributions, quantifying the widespread occurrence of non-Gaussian tails is motivated in part by tracer-advection across a maintained gradient prototypes. Substantial implications of the shape of these tails for regional changes in probabilities of temperature extremes with large-scale warming motivate measures of non-Gaussianity specific to this problem for assessing climate model present-day simulations. In the case of distributions of precipitation accumulations, simple prototypes yield insights into the form of the present-day distribution and predictions for the form of the global warming changes that can be evaluated in models and observations. Probability drops relatively slowly over a substantial range of accumulation size, followed by a key cutoff scale that limits large event probabilities in current climate but changes under global warming. Precipitation integrated over spatial clusters exhibits similar distribution features.",

            "abstract": "New geochemical and microstructural data from the Marum ophiolite in Papua New Guinea describe a piece of most depleted mantle made essentially of dunite and harzburgite showing compositions of supra-subduction zone (SSZ) peridotite. Strong olivine crystallographic preferred orientations (CPO) in dunite and harzburgite inferred the activation of both (001)[100] and (010)[100] slip systems. Clinopyroxene and orthopyroxene CPOs inferred the activation of (100)[001] and (010)[001] slip systems. This plastic deformation is interpreted to have developed at high temperature during the formation of the Marum ophiolite, prior to melt percolation. The orientation of the foliation and olivine [100] slip directions sub-parallel to the subduction zone indicates that mantle flow was parallel to the trench pointing a fast polarization direction parallel to the arc.\nMarum depleted mantle has been fertilised by diffuse crystallisation of a low proportion of clinopyroxene (1-2%) in the dunite and formation of cm-scale ol-clinopyroxenite and ol-websterite veins cross-cutting the foliation. This percolating melt shows silica-rich magnesian affinities (boninite-like) related to supra-subduction zone in a young fore-arc environment. The peridotite has also been percolated by a melt with more tholeiite affinities precipitating plagioclase-rich wehrlite and thin gabbroic veins; these are interpreted to form after the boninitic event. The small proportion of newly crystallized pyroxene distributed in the dunite shows similar orientation of crystallographic axes to the host dunite (<100>ol parallel to <001>cpx-opx). In contrast, the pyroxenes in ol-clinopyroxenite, ol-websterite and the thin gabbroic veins in the wehrlite, record their own orientation with <001> axes at 45 to 60˚ to olivine <100> axes. For low melt proportion, such as crystallization of pyroxenes in the dunite, the crystallization is governed by epitaxial growth, and when the proportion of melt is higher the newly formed minerals record syn-kinematic crystallization. This switch of crystallographic axes orientation of newly formed minerals indicates a reorientation of the constraints during the boninitic and tholeiitic melts event probably due to lateral mantle flow within the fore-arc area.",

To achieve lead times of a few days for disturbances in planetary thermospheres and ionospheres, models of the solar wind propagating through the heliosphere are required. An active research community has achieved a suite of models that describe conditions within, and coupling between, the solar wind, the Earth’s magnetosphere and the ionosphere. At least one version of each model in the suite is available for broad community use and investigation. While these models represent an important step towards the goal of achieving accurate space weather forecasts, it is recognized that certain physical processes are not represented in these models, with unknown impact on the forecasts. We suggest an approach towards improved space weather forecasts that emphasizes model evaluation techniques, providing detailed information on how the physical processes represented in the models affect forecasts based on those models. Such detailed information permits the models to be used for investigating science questions, and permits observations to be the basis for improving the models and increasing scientific understanding. In this talk, we present upper atmosphere forecasting results using community models of the coupled Sun-Earth system. We describe our approach to analyzing the physics of ionospheric storms as represented in the Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model developed at the University of Michigan. Such analysis involves both an approach to model diagnostics and the use of a comprehensive set of observations. We compare forecast results for high-speed solar wind stream storms and storms initiated by solar coronal mass ejections. First-principle and empirically based approaches to coupling between the solar wind and ionosphere are compared. These comparisons provide insight into the strengths and limitations, and areas for future improvement, of first-principles models as they are used to forecast the Sun-Earth interaction.",

Along the SLRV and the Ottawa valley, earthquakes are concentrated on three distinct zones of western Quebec along the Ottawa River, Charlevoix, and Lower Saint Lawrence. The entire area is also subject to the glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA). We studied the earth’s surface deformation of the area using the velocity field of 51 continuous GPS (CGPS) stations and the least-squares collocation method. While the intraplate horizontal velocities showed a coherent horizontal motion towards southeast with the typical magnitude of ~1.3 mm/yr for stations along the SLRV, the interpolated vertical velocities demonstrated a coherent uplift with the average rate of 3.1 mm/yr. We estimated strain rate tensors including the effect of vertical velocity. A NNW-SSE shortening with a typical rate of ~3.6–8.1 nstrain/yr was observed over Lower Saint Lawrence. In Charlevoix, an extension with a typical rate of ~3.0–7.1 nstrain/yr was oriented in ENE-WSW parallel to the SLRV. In western Quebec, the deformation has a shear straining mechanism with a typical shortening rate of ~1.0–5.1 nstrain/yr and extension rate of ~1.6–4.1 nstrain/yr. The extension over the northern model is consistent with the prediction of the GIA models. The range of the estimated strain rates of the area (~1.0–8.1 nstrain/yr) is between typical values of rigid blocks (< 0.1 nstrain/yr) and active tectonic regions (> 100 μstrain/yr). A strong correlation was observed between epicenters of earthquakes and areas with the highest rate of shear strain. We found a good agreement between the orientations of the principal axes of strain rate tensors and the maximum horizontal compressional stress σH from World Stress Map 2008 for both strike-slip and thrust faulting regimes especially those derived from focal mechanisms. This shows our CGPS intraplate velocities are representative of the current crustal deformation associated with the GIA and that they constrain the crustal strain rates in magnitude, direction and origin.",

There is a pressing need in the Ionosphere – Thermosphere - Mesosphere (ITM) community for high-resolution measurements that can characterize the effect of small-scale dynamics (i.e. Gravity Waves with wavelengths smaller than a few hundred km) in the Mesosphere-Lower-Termosphere (MLT) on a global basis. This is compelling because they are believed to be the dominant contributors to momentum transport and deposition in the MLT, which largely drive the global circulation and thermal structure and interactions with the tides and planetary waves in this region.\n A nadir-pointing spaceborne Na Doppler resonance fluorescence LIDAR on board of the International Space Station (ISS) will essentially make high-resolution, in time and space, Na density, temperature and vertical wind measurements, from 75-115 km (MLT region). Our instrument concept consisted of a high-energy laser transmitter at 589 nm and highly sensitive photon counting detector that allows for range-resolved atmospheric-sodium-temperature profiles. The atmospheric temperature is deduced from the linewidth of the resonant fluorescence from the atomic sodium vapor D2 line as measured by our tunable laser. We are currently developing a high power energy laser that allows for some day time sodium lidar observations with the help of a narrow bandpass filter based on etalon or atomic sodium Faraday filter with ~5 to 10 pm optical bandwidth. The current baseline detector for the lidar instrument is a 16-channel Photomultiplier Tube with receiver electronics that has been space-qualified for the ICESat-2/ATLAS mission. Our technique uses the 16-channels as a photon-number-resolving “single” detector to provide the required full-spectroscopic sodium lineshape waveform for recovering Mesospheric temperature profiles. In this paper, we will describe our instrument concept for a future Heliophysics space mission based on board of the ISS as well as show current progress results.",

            "abstract": "The temperature structure of ice sheet and glaciers is a fundamental control on ice flow, rheology, and stability. However, it is difficult to observationally constrain temperature structures at the catchment to ice-sheet scale. The englacial attenuation of radar sounding data is strongly dependent on the temperature structure of the ice sheets. Therefore, echo strength profiles from airborne radar sounding observation do contain temperature information. However, direct interpretation of englacial attenuation rates from radar sounding profiles is often difficult or impossible due to the ambiguous contribution the geometric and material properties of the bed to echo strength variations. To overcome this challenge, we presents techniques that treat radar sounding echo strength and ice thickness profiles as continuous signals, taking advantage of along-profile ice thickness and echo strength variations to constrain the spatial pattern of englacial attenuation and basal reflectivity. We then apply these techniques to an airborne radar sounding survey in order to characterize the englacial and subglacial temperature structure of the Thwaites Glacier catchment in West Antarctic. We then interpreted this structure in context of local ice sheet velocity, advection, force balance, and bed conditions using the ISSM ice sheet model.",

            "abstract": "Quasi-stationary Rossby waves are known to play a key role in Northern Hemisphere warm season atmospheric circulation and surface meteorology variability on subseasonal time scales. In particular, such waves have been crucial to the development of a number of recent short-term warm season heat waves and droughts over North America (e.g. the 1988 and 2012 droughts) and northern Eurasia (e.g. the 2003 heat wave over Europe). Recently, new insights have been gained based on a case study of a stationary Rossby wave event that developed during 20May-15June 1988. Simulations with the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System model (GEOS-5) atmospheric general circulation model highlight the crucial importance of the mean jet streams in guiding and constraining the path and speed of wave energy propagation. In particular, in the presence of the strong north Pacific jet, convective anomalies that developed over the western Pacific in late May 1988 produce a predilection for persistent upper-level high anomalies to occur over central North America about one to two weeks later, leading to the rapid development of severe dry conditions there. There are indications of continued downstream wave energy propagation that reaches northern Eurasia about two weeks later, leading to the development of dry conditions over eastern Europe and western Russia, and cool and wet conditions over western Europe and central northern Eurasia. The local soil moisture feedback moderately amplifies surface warming anomalies, but exerts an overall small effect on the overlying atmospheric circulation anomalies and associated precipitation deficits. These results suggest that stationary Rossby waves can serve as a source of predictability for subseasonal development of droughts over North America and northern Eurasia. They also imply that a proper representation of stationary Rossby waves and their effects in a model could improve considerably the model skill in forecasting subseasonal drought development.",

            "abstract": "Clustering techniques have been used in the last few decades to classify cloud types automatically from satellite observations, most commonly using cloud top pressure and cloud optical depth. The underlying assumption is that the resulting clusters, called \"cloud regimes\" or \"weather states\", represent some type of basic states of the atmosphere, and thus that their occurrence can be used as a proxy for related variables such as radiative balance or precipitation.\nWe have examined the validity of these assumptions by using independent measurements from the CloudSat and CALIPSO satellites. The CloudSat radar yields a reflectivity product that is sensitive to many aspects of the physics of the clouds, while CloudSat together with the CALIPSO lidar can retrieve the vertical structure of the cloud column, including multi-layer clouds. These observations have been separated into groups according to the recently published cloud regimes based on data from the MODIS instrument, deployed on the Aqua satellite orbiting in the same constellation with CloudSat and CALIPSO. The distributions of these observations have been constructed both globally and in a number of regions in different parts of the Earth. By analyzing the differences in the distributions between these regions, we can evaluate the usefulness of the cloud regimes as a proxy for the measured variables.\nSome cloud regimes have been found to be rather stable between regions, while others display considerable variability. Moreover, some cloud regimes appear much more similar to each other in CloudSat observations than they do using the MODIS regimes. We analyze the implications of these differences for the usability of the cloud regimes as climate indicators. We also explore various filtering techniques and different clustering methods that can potentially be used to reduce these differences, and thus to improve the universality of the cloud regimes.",

The aircraft based soil moisture data provided by the passive/active microwave sensor PALS (Passive and Active L and S band System) has a nominal spatial resolution of 1500 m. In this study, a change detection algorithm is used for disaggregation of coarse passive microwave soil moisture retrievals with radar backscatter coefficients obtained with the higher spatial resolution UAVSAR (Unmanned Air Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar). The accuracy of the disaggregated change in soil moisture was evaluated using ground based soil moisture measurements. Results show that the disaggregation products are well correlated to in situ measurements. Based on the R2, the highest resolution disaggregated product at 5 m exhibits soil moisture heterogeneity that reflects the distribution of the crops. The difference of spatial standard deviation between the disaggregated and in situ soil moisture ranges from <0.001-0.131 m3/m3 also proves the spatial capability of the change detection algorithm at 5 m scale.",

In one approach, the model assumed the radiative effective radii of cloud water, cloud ice, and snow were represented by values assigned a priori, whereas a second, “coupled” approach utilized known cloud particle assumptions in the microphysics scheme that evolved during the simulations to diagnose the radii explicitly. This led to differences in simulated infrared (IR) brightness temperatures, radiative fluxes through clouds, and resulting surface temperatures that ultimately affect model-predicted diurnally-driven convection. The combined approach of evaluating simulated versus observed IR brightness temperatures, radiation reaching the ground, and surface temperature forecasts revealed the root model biases better than evaluating any single variable. This study found that the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model predicted less overall clouds than was observed, particularly in the mid‑troposphere, but that properly connecting the assumptions of particle sizes in the microphysics scheme to the radiation scheme resulted in sensible cloud-radiation indirect effects and modest improvements in simulated IR brightness temperature, amount of solar radiation reaching the ground, and surface temperature.",

            "abstract": "Introduction: Because the health risks of climate variability and change are not new, it has been assumed that health systems have the capacity, experience, and tools to effectively adapt to changing burdens of climate-sensitive health outcomes with additional climate change. However, as illustrated in the Ebola crisis, health systems in many low-income countries have insufficient capacity to manage current health burdens. These countries also are those most vulnerable to climate change, including changes in food and water safety and security, increases in extreme weather and climate events, and increases in the geographic range, incidence, and seasonality of a variety of infectious diseases. The extent to which they might be able to keep pace with projected risks depends on assumptions of the sustainability of development pathways. At the same time, the magnitude and pattern of climate change will depend on greenhouse gas emission pathways.\nMethods: Review of the success of health adaptation projects and expert judgment assessment of the degree to which adaptation efforts will be able to keep pace with projected changes in climate variability and change.\nResults: Health adaptation can reduce the current and projected burdens of climate-sensitive health outcomes over the short term in many countries, but the extent to which it could do so past mid-century will depend on emission and development pathways. Under high emission scenarios, climate change will be rapid and extensive, leading to fundamental shifts in the burden of climate-sensitive health outcomes that will challenging for many countries to manage. Sustainable development pathways could delay but not eliminate associated health burdens.\nConclusions: To prepare for and cope with the Anthropocene, health systems need additional adaptation policies and measures to develop more robust health systems, and need to advocate for rapid and significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.",

            "abstract": "While thermoelectric power generation accounts for only 3-5% of the nation’s consumptive use of freshwater, its future potential to exert pressure on limited water supplies is of concern given projected growth in electric power generation. The corresponding thermoelectric water footprint could look significantly different depending on decisions concerning the mix of fuel type, cooling type, location, and capacity, which are influenced by such factors as fuel costs, technology evolution, demand growth, policies, and climate change. The complex interplay among these disparate factors makes it difficult to identify where water could limit siting choices for thermoelectric generation or alternatively, thermoelectric development could limit growth in other water use sectors. These arguments point to the need for joint coordination, analysis and planning between energy and water managers. Here we report on results from a variety of planning exercises spanning scales from the national, interconnection, to the utility. Results will highlight: lessons learned from the integrated planning exercises; the broad range in potential thermoelectric water use futures; regional differences in the thermoelectric-water nexus; and, opportunities for non-traditional waters to ease competition over limited freshwater supplies and to harden thermoelectric generation against drought vulnerability. \nSandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.",

Unlike other subduction zones that produce great earthquakes and ETS, the CSZ is notable for the lack of small and moderate magnitude earthquakes recorded.\nThe seismogenic zone extent is currently estimated to be primarily offshore, thus the lack of observed small, interplate earthquakes may be partially due to the use of only land seismometers. The Cascadia Initiative (CI) community seismic experiment seeks to address this issue by including ocean bottom seismometers (OBS) deployed directly over the locked seismogenic zone, in addition to land seismometers. We use these seismic data to explore whether small magnitude earthquakes are occurring on the plate interface, but have gone undetected by the land-based seismic networks. We select a subset of small magnitude (M0.1-3.7) earthquakes from existing earthquake catalogs, based on land seismic data, whose preliminary hypocentral locations suggest they may have occurred on the plate interface. We window the waveforms on CI OBS and land seismometers around the phase arrival times for these earthquakes to generate templates for subspace detection, which allows for additional flexibility over traditional matched filter detection methods. Here we present event detections from the first year of CI deployment and preliminary locations for the detected events. Initial results of scanning the first year of the CI deployment using one cluster of template events, located near a previously identified subducted seamount, include 473 detections on OBS station M08A (~61.6 km offshore) and 710 detections on OBS station J25A (~44.8 km northeast of M08A). Ongoing efforts include detection using additional OBS stations along the margin, as well as determining locations of clusters detected in the first year of deployment.",

            "abstract": "The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences climate and weather worldwide, so uncertainties in its response to external forcings contribute to the spread in global climate projections. Theoretical and modeling studies have argued that such forcings may affect ENSO either via the seasonal cycle, the mean state, or extratropical influences, but these mechanisms are poorly constrained by the short instrumental record. Here we synthesize a pan-Pacific network of high-resolution marine biocarbonates spanning discrete snapshots of the Holocene (past 10, 000 years of Earth's history), which we use to constrain a set of global climate model (GCM) simulations via a forward model and a consistent treatment of uncertainty. Observations suggest important reductions in ENSO variability throughout the interval, most consistently during 3-5 kyBP, when approximately 2/3 reductions are inferred. The magnitude and timing of these ENSO variance reductions bear little resemblance to those sim- ulated by GCMs, or to equatorial insolation. The central Pacific witnessed a mid-Holocene increase in seasonality, at odds with the reductions simulated by GCMs. Finally, while GCM aggregate behavior shows a clear inverse relationship between seasonal amplitude and ENSO-band variance in sea-surface temperature, in agreement with many previous studies, such a relationship is not borne out by these observations. Our synthesis suggests that tropical Pacific climate is highly variable, but exhibited millennia-long periods of reduced ENSO variability whose origins, whether forced or unforced, contradict existing explanations. It also points to deficiencies in the ability of current GCMs to simulate forced changes in the tropical Pacific seasonal cycle and its interaction with ENSO, highlighting a key area of growth for future modeling efforts.",

            "abstract": "To overcome the problem of on farm point sources of pollution, environmental friendly and low cost technology filter systems are under development. Processes like sorption-desorption, dissipation behavior of three radiolabeled pesticides (Bentazone, Boscalid and Pyrimethanil) has been investigated at lab scale. Biochar and digestate mixtures with two types of soil (sandy and silt loam) had been used as a biofilter test material for a respiration study (over three month’s time period) instead of conventional soil, peat and straw mixtures. The results show that digestate is an easily available C-source leading to highest release of CO2-C. It was found that with the addition of even a small amount (1 % W/W) of biochar there is a profound suppression in the CO2-C release.The driving mechanism for this suppression can be manifold like negative priming, chemisorption of CO2-C on biochar or combinations of all.\nFurther, the fate of applied organic contaminants to biomixtures depends on factors like soil properties as well as biological degradation by soil microbes. To analyze the degradation potential of the different soil/amendment mixtures on pesticides a degradation study was performed. The results from the 14C labelled pesticides study indicated that a mixture of digestate (5%) and biochar (5%) well balanced the mineralization (~20% for bentazone, ~6% for boscalid and ~2% for pyrimethanil) and sorption process (>85% non-extractable residues for all pesticides) resulting in favorable dissipation process. To investigate the sorption-desorption potential of the above pesticides a batch equilibrium study was carried out with selected biomixtures. A higher Kd (>1500 L kg-1), kf (>400 µM1-1/nf L1/nfkg-1) and KL (>40 L kg-1) was obtained for all pesticides for the soil/digestate/biochar mixtures, which had a higher organic matter content. SUVA254 values justified the aromatic character of digestate (5%) and biochar (5%) mixture which showed highest Koc values among all mixtures. This mixture found to be the most promising substrate amongst the tested ones for a biobed setup.",

A joint NASA-FIA inventory pilot project was carried out in 2014 to evaluate the utility of state-of-the-art high-resolution remote sensing information (lidar, hyperspectral and thermal airborne imaging) to support a future FIA inventory program in interior Alaska.\nFIA plots were established at a 1:4 intensity (or 1 plot per 9,715 hectares) on a regular (i.e. systematic) hexagonal grid across the Tanana Valley State Forest and Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge; both of which fall within the Tanana valley of interior Alaska. The relatively sparse FIA field plot sample collection was augmented with samples of airborne remotely sensed data acquired with Goddard’s Lidar Hyperspectral and Thermal (GLiHT) imager to increase the precision of inventory parameter estimates. G-LiHT is a portable, airborne imaging system, developed at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, that simultaneously maps the composition, structure, and function of terrestrial ecosystems. G-LiHT data supports local-scale mapping and regional-scale sampling of plant biomass, photosynthesis, and disturbance. The data is accurately georeferenced and can be matched precisely with field plot data that are georeferenced using survey-grade GPS. G-LiHT data was acquired in July-August, 2014 along single swaths (250 meters wide) spaced 9.3 km apart over the entire Tanana inventory unit (135,000 km2).\nWe examine three methodological approaches to estimate forest inventory variables of interest; focusing initially on aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation. The three estimation procedures include 1) the standard, fully design-based approach currently used by the FIA; 2) A model-assisted technique; and 3) a Bayesian multi-level modeling approach where the sampling design can be explicitly accommodated within the modeling framework. We plan to assess the accuracy and bias of the three approaches experimentally via simulation and using the field and remote sensing data collected during the 2014 Tanana Inventory Pilot project.",

            "abstract": "We present a new model for anhydrous melting in the spinel and plagioclase stability fields that provides enhanced predictive capabilities for the major element compositional variability found in mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORBs). The melting model is coupled to geodynamic simulations of mantle flow and mid-ocean ridge temperature structure to investigate global variations in MORB chemistry and crustal thickness as a function of mantle potential temperature, spreading rate, mantle composition, and the pattern(s) of melt migration. To constrain global variations in mantle melting parameters we incorporate evidence from both MORB major element compositions and seismically determined crustal thicknesses. Specifically, we show that to explain the global data set of crustal thickness, Na8, Fe8, Si8, Ca8/Al8, and K8/Ti8 (oxides normalized to 8 wt% MgO) requires a relatively narrow zone over which melts are pooled to the ridge axis. In all cases, our preferred model involves melt transport to the ridge axis over relatively short horizontal length scales (~25 km), implying that although melting occurs over a wide region, up to 20–40% of the total melt volume is not extracted, and will eventually refreeze and refertilize the lithosphere. We further incorporate constraints from melt inclusion datasets to constrain the global mid-ocean ridge CO2 degassing flux. Our estimates indicate that ~3.4 x1014 g/yr of CO2 are released by MORB melting, however, more than half of this CO2 may remain trapped in the lithospheric mantle.",

The Ursa basin lies in the center of late Pleistocene Mississippi River deposition, received the sediment deposition during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 2- 4. The Brazos-Trinity Basin IV belongs to a part of the Brazos-Trinity fan, it recorded the turbidite deposition and hemiplegic deposition during MIS1- 5. The Sr and Nd isotopic composition of the detrital composition of the sediment in both basins indicates the change of the sediment provenance during the basin-filled process. In the Ursa basin, The difference of 87Sr/86Sr ratio and εNd of the detrital component between MIS1,2 (87Sr/86Sr ~ 0.7219 - 0.7321, εNd ~ -12 - -13.4) and MIS3,4(87Sr/86Sr ~ 0.7310 - 0.7354, εNd ~ -16 - -17.9) is suggested to be related with the provenance change of the detrital particles since LGM. The addition of detrital particle from Appalachians with less radiogenic 87Sr/86Sr and positive εNd altered the character of the sediment of the Mississippi River during the last glaciation and deglaciation. In the Brazos-Trinity Basin IV, the narrow range of 87Sr/86Sr and εNd indicate that the sediment source of Brazos-Trinity Basin IV had not changed obviously during MIS5e to MIS2, mostly from coastal rivers such as Brazos River, Trinity River and Sabine River. The pre-fan with 87Sr/86Sr ~0.735 and εNd ~ -14.5 to -16.9, which is very similar to the deep sediment in the Ursa Basin with 87Sr/86Sr ~0.733 to 0.735 and εNd ~ -16 to -18. It is suggested that sediments of the pre-fan of the Brazos-Trinity Basin IV were supplied from the ancestral Mississippi River Delta during the low sea level (MIS 6). During the MIS5, the discharge of Mississippi River is thought switched to its present course, ~300 km to the east.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic flux ropes at the magnetopause are generated as a result of magnetopause reconnection involving more than one X-line, and constitute a subgroup of flux transfer events which are believed to result from transient, localized, and/or multiple X-line reconnection, i.e., time-dependent forms of magnetopause reconnection. Single X-line reconnection at the low-latitude magnetopause erodes the dayside closed field lines and contributes to magnetic flux transport into the magnetotail, which forms the basis for dynamic phenomena in the magnetosphere such as substorms and storms. On the other hand, multiple X-line reconnection can produce the field lines of various topologies and/or can cause complex interactions of reconnection jets or reconnected flux tubes, thus possibly reducing the efficiency of magnetic energy transfer into the tail. This presentation discusses in situ observations at the terrestrial, Hermean, and Kronian magnetopauses and models for the generation, of magnetic flux ropes. In particular, we emphasize that magnetic field (e.g., bipolar) signatures alone cannot be taken as evidence for the flux ropes, and plasma signatures (Alfvenic ion jets, electron pitch-angle anisotropy, etc.) help identify their topological structure. We also present our recent studies using multi-spacecraft (Cluster or THEMIS) measurements at the terrestrial magnetopause for the reconstruction of their two-dimensional and three-dimensional structures based on the Grad-Shafranov and magneto-hydrostatic equations, respectively.",

            "abstract": "The M-7.8 Gorkha (Nepal) earthquake on the 25th April, 2015 has shaken the central Himalayan front and immediately raised concerns for the severity of future triggered earthquakes. Here, we implement standard and innovative forecast models to predict the spatio-temporal distribution of triggered events. Key challenges addressed are: 1) the limited information on early aftershocks, 2) the low-productivity aftershock sequence in the near-source area, 3) the off-fault (>250 km) triggered events exemplified by the M=5.4 Xegar event, 3 hrs after the mainshock. We apply short-term empirical/statistical ETAS and physical forecast models, the latter based on the combination of rate/state friction law and Coulomb stresses. Within the physics-based model implementation we seek to evaluate the uncertainty related with the rupture style of triggered events by considering: 1) the geometry of active structures, 2) optimally oriented for failure faults and 3) all-potential faults described by the total stress field. The latter is represented by the full stress tensor before and after the mainshock and our analysis suggests that the preseismic stress magnitudes are still sufficient to cause earthquakes even after modification by the mainshock. The above remark reveals that there are no “stress shadows” affecting the spatial distribution of near-field aftershocks. It is also noted that the method allows for an a-priori determination of the rupture plan of the M=7.3 event, within the limit of uncertainty (20˚). The results show that: (1) ETAS models underestimate the number of observed events, since they heavily base their good performance in small magnitude earthquakes, not available in the first few weeks after the mainshock, (2) far field triggered events are captured only by physics-based forecasts, and (3) the total stress method improves the predictability of larger magnitude events. We conclude that frontier regions benefit from the implementation of physics-based models since they have comparable to improved performance when compared with empirical/statistical models with the advantage of less demanding input parameters at real-time experiments.",

            "abstract": "Passive treatment system has been widely used for remediation of mine drainage since its advantage of low installation and maintenance cost. The system, however, has also a disadvantage in assuring remediation and management efficiency if the drainage is highly acidic mine drainage. To remediate acid mine drainage (AMD) especially showing high acidity, passive treatment system which consists of successive alkalinity producing system (SAPS) and subsequent aeration pond was proposed and its mechanisms and efficiency was evaluated in this research. Target AMD was obtained from Waryong coal mine and showed typical characteristics of AMD having high metal concentration and low pH (acidity > 300 mg/L as CaCO3). Four experimental cases were conducted; untreated, treated with SAPS, treated with aeration, treated with SAPS and aeration to compare role and mechanism of each unit. Between organic matter and limestone layer which constitute SAPS, the former eliminated most of Fe(III) and Al in the AMD so that the latter was kept from being clogged by precipitates. Net acidity of the AMD rapidly decreased by supplement of alkalinity at the limestone layer. A primary function of SAPS, producing alkalinity constantly without clogging, was attained due to addition a portion of limestone particle into the organic matter layer. The discharge from SAPS had low ORP and DO values because of an anaerobic environment formed at the organic matter layer although its alkalinity was increased. This water quality was unfavorable for Fe(II) to be oxidized. Installation of aeration pond after SAPS, therefore, could be effective way of enhancing oxidation rate of Fe(II). Among the experimental cases, the combination of SAPS and aeration pond was only able to remediate the AMD. This concluded that to remediate highly acidic mine drainage with passive treatment system, three critical conditions were required; pre-precipitation of Fe(III) and Al at organic matter layer in SAPS, constant alkalinity producing without clogging at limestone layer, and water quality recovery to oxidative environment for Fe(II) by aeration pond.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - CALON_General AGU Poster 2015.pdf\nSince 2012, the physical and biogeochemical properties of ~60 lakes in northern Alaska have been investigated under CALON, a project to document landscape-scale variability of Arctic lakes in permafrost terrain. The network has ten nodes along two latitudinal transects extending inland 200 km from the Arctic Ocean. A meteorological station is deployed at each node and six representative lakes instrumented and continuously monitored, with winter and summer visits for synoptic assessment of lake conditions. Over the 4-year period, winter and summer climatology varied to create a rich range of lake responses over a short period. For example, winter 2012-13 was very cold with a thin snowpack producing thick ice across the region. Subsequent years had relatively warm winters, yet regionally variable snow resulted in differing gradients of ice thickness. Ice-out timing was unusually late in 2014 and unusually early in 2015. Lakes are typically well–mixed and largely isothermal, with minor thermal stratification occurring in deeper lakes during calm, sunny periods in summer. Lake water temperature records and morphometric data were used to estimate the ground thermal condition beneath 28 lakes. Application of a thermal equilibrium steady-state model suggests a talik penetrating the permafrost under many larger lakes, but lake geochemical data do not indicate a significant contribution of subpermafrost groundwater. Biogeochemical data reveal distinct spatial and seasonal variability in chlorophyll biomass, chromophoric dissolved organic carbon (CDOM), and major cations/anions. Generally, waters sampled beneath ice in April had distinctly higher concentrations of inorganic solutes and methane compared with August. Chlorophyll concentrations and CDOM absorption were higher in April, suggesting significant biological/biogeochemical activity under lake ice. Lakes are a positive source of methane in summer, and some also emit nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. As part of the Indigenous Knowledge component,76 Iñupiat elders, hunters and berry pickers have been interviewed and over 75 hours of videotaped interviews produced. The video library and searchable interview logs are archived with the North Slope community. All field data is archived at ACADIS, and further information is at www.arcticlakes.org.",

            "abstract": "The permafrost landscape of Central Yakutia is subject to rapid modifications as a result of intensive land use, extreme weather, and the current global warming. With regard to the predicted increase in precipitation and temperature due to climate change, quantitative knowledge of the small-scale variability of active thermokarst processes is required. Here, we analyzed size and frequency distribution of lakes >0.1ha on different geomorphological ice-rich permafrost terraces east of Yakutsk using Landsat 8 data and we mapped the change of thermokarst and alas lakes since 1944 at the Yukechi study site using historical airborne and current satellite data and analyzed growth rates and thaw subsidence. Generally, larger lakes in higher frequency are dominating lower and younger terraces, while higher and older terraces are dominated by smaller lakes. In particular, smaller lakes in less density are distributed on older and more ice-rich terraces while the younger and less ice-rich terraces are characterized by highest lake densities and larger lakes. Remote sensing analysis at the Yukechi study site indicate that lake-level changes of residual alas lakes during the past 70 years were mainly affected by the winter precipitation and the annual water balance. In the meanwhile, extensive agricultural use in the post-war period led to the disturbance of the thermal and hydrological balance of the permafrost and results in rapid and sustained growth of young thermokarst lakes on undegraded ice-rich permafrost deposits. Climatic parameters, however, are affecting only growing rates within certain time periods. The mean growth rate of all mapped thermokarst lakes at Yukechi is 0.8 ±0.6 m a-1, with a mean thaw subsidence of 7.0 ±1.6 cm a-1. Our results indicate that topography, geomorphology, and surficial cryolithology are important controlling factors on the distribution of lakes. Furthermore, thermokarst activity is influenced by climatic parameters but it is accelerated by anthropogenic land use. Further studies of multi-temporal images are necessary to validate these results.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s long-term climate states – icehouses and greenhouses – are largely governed by shifts in the concentration of atmospheric CO2. Silicate weathering and the burial of organic matter are primary sinks for CO2 and metamorphic and volcanic degassing are the primary sources. Continental magmatic arcs, in particular, have the ability produce large CO2 fluxes by liberating C preserved in continental bedrock. Assessment of a large compilation of detrital zircon U-Pb age data demonstrates systematic shifts in global zircon production that correspond with major shifts in icehouse–greenhouse climates: zircon generation is highest during greenhouses and lowest during icehouses. As zircon is predominantly produced in felsic melts in continental arc systems, these data demonstrate a first-order relationship between spatiotemporal variation in continental magmatism and major transitions in climate state. Since no clear consistent relationship can be discerned between long-term climate shifts and the paleogeographic location of continents or the global extent of uplift with regard to silicate weathering, it appears that the volcanic CO2 flux exerts a dominant control on shifts in baseline climate. The most prominent lulls in arc magmatism coincide with dramatic glaciations (e.g, Proterozoic Snowball Earth events), whereas extensive global volcanism and magmatic flare-ups correspond with intervals of documented environmental stress and mass extinctions, illustrating the fundamental influence of plate tectonic processes on Earth’s surface environment and the evolution of the biosphere. In addition, the carbon cycle model LOSCAR is used to quantify the potential leverage of varying volcanic CO2 flux on equilibrium atmospheric CO2 under varying strengths and formulations of the silicate weathering feedback, which demonstrates the importance of the volcanic flux on baseline atmospheric CO2.",

PCA provides an objective and robust statistical framework for unmixing, because it represents data variability as a linear combination of a limited number of principal components that are derived purely on the basis of natural variations contained within the dataset. For PCA we have resampled FORC distributions on grids that capture diagnostic signatures of magnetic domain states. Individual FORC diagrams were then recast as linear combinations of end-member (EM) FORC diagrams, located at user-defined positions in PCA space. The EM selection is guided by constraints derived from physical modeling, and is imposed by data scatter. To test our model, we have investigated temporal variations of two EMs in bulk North Atlantic sediment cores collected from the Rockall Trough and the Iberian Continental Margin. Sediments from these sites contain a mixture of magnetosomes and granulometrically distinct detrital magnetite. We have also quantified the spatial variation of three EM components in surficial sediments along the flow path of the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW). These samples were separated into granulometric fractions, which also assisted in constraining EM definition. The unmixing model reveals systematic variations in EM relative abundance as a function of distance along NADW flow. Finally, we have applied PCA to the combined dataset of Rockall Trough and NADW sediments, which can be recast as a four-EM mixture, providing enhanced discrimination between components. Our method forms the foundation of a general solution to the problem of unmixing multi-component magnetic mixtures, a fundamental task of rock magnetic studies.",

We used CALIPSO nighttime datasets to examine the vertical structure and evolution of Saharan dust during transatlantic transport. The results show that most Saharan dust is lifted to high altitude and descends after traveling thousands of km-s. Initially, the depolarization ratio and color ratio of Saharan dust are uniformly distributed along altitude, suggesting vertically constant particle size and shape distributions. During transport, the depolarization ratio of Saharan dust drops at lower altitudes, suggesting that particle shapes become less irregular; while at relatively high altitudes, the depolarization ratio of dust increases during transport. The changes observed during transport likely come from the effects of gravitational sorting caused by variations in particle shape and size. A simple model with only two shapes qualitatively captures these features and confirms that shape-induced differential settling contribute significantly to the observed vertical stratification of dust properties. In addition, the effect of clouds on dust properties will be also discussed.",

There are two NASA Earth observing instruments onboard: the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology Advanced Radiometer (NISTAR). EPIC views the entire sunlit Earth from sunrise to sunset at the backscattering direction (scattering angles between 165° and 176°) with 10 narrowband filters: 317, 325, 340, 388, 443, 552, 680, 688, 764 and 779 nm. The expected main EPIC products will be total ozone amount, UV aerosol properties, scene reflectivity, vegetation properties, and cloud height. NISTAR is a set of 3 high-precision cavity radiometers and one diode detector designed to detect the total emitted and reflected energy from the Earth (from UV to IR) in the near backscatter direction. Its goal is to study the Earth’s energy balance from this unique view angle of L1 and use the data to fill in a missing portion of similar data obtained in low earth orbit. In our presentation, we discuss the uniqueness of L1 observations of diurnal variation of aerosols, clouds, and vegetation for the entire globe and show the first preliminary science results.",

            "abstract": "Projected changes in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) mid-latitude near-surface westerly winds and associated storm tracks are key influences on Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, with, for example, significant implications for ice sheet stability. Climate model projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) multi-model ensemble generally exhibit a poleward shift of the SH tropospheric westerly jet under increased greenhouse gas concentrations. However, the picture is more complex over the South Pacific in winter, when the climatological tropospheric jet is split into two components: a sub-tropical jet (STJ) (at around 25-30°S) and a higher-latitude polar front jet (PFJ) (at around 55-60°S) which is more directly related to the main mid-latitude lower-tropospheric storm track. On average the CMIP5 models project an equatorward shift of the winter PFJ which consequently becomes more merged with a poleward-shifted STJ. A key question is the extent to which this ensemble-mean picture is robust across the CMIP5 models, many of which poorly reproduce the observed split jet structure.\nTo address this question CMIP5 output has been used to conduct the first detailed evaluation of future projections of the winter split jet. The PFJ dominates the surface signature of the split jet, but is too weak in historically-forced simulations of most CMIP5 models. It is found that this has important implications for future projections, since the ensemble mean projected equatorward shift is mainly attributable to models with weak PFJs. A subset of 10 CMIP5 models with the weakest surface expression of the PFJ (on average 39% weaker than reanalysis estimates) exhibit an equatorward shift of 2.5° over the 21st century following the high emissions RCP8.5 scenario. In contrast, a subset of 10 models with the smallest historical biases (on average 6% weaker than reanalysis) exhibit no shift in the PFJ, but do show a strengthening of approximately 1 m/s that extends polewards to the coast of West Antarctica. The more historically-skilful CMIP5 models therefore exhibit a less distinct merging of the split jet in the future, with results indicating a more general poleward shift and strengthening of the westerly wind structure. Broader implications of these results for the Southern Ocean and Antarctica will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Many factors have conspired to make Earth a home to complex life. Earth has abundant water due to a combination of factors, including orbital distance and the climate regulating feedbacks of the long-term carbon cycle. Earth has plate tectonics, which is crucial for maintaining long-term carbon cycling and may have been an important energy source for the origin of life in seafloor hydrothermal systems. Earth also has a strong magnetic field that shields the atmosphere from the solar wind and the surface from high-energy particles. Synthesizing recent work on these topics shows that water, a temperate climate, plate tectonics, and a strong magnetic field are linked together through a series of negative feedbacks that stabilize the system over geologic timescales. Although the physical mechanism behind plate tectonics on Earth is still poorly understood, climate is thought to be important. In particular, temperate surface temperatures are likely necessary for plate tectonics because they allow for liquid water that may be capable of significantly lowering lithospheric strength, increase convective stresses in the lithosphere, and enhance the effectiveness of “damage” processes such as grainsize reduction. Likewise, plate tectonics is probably crucial for maintaining a temperate climate on Earth through its role in facilitating the long-term carbon cycle, which regulates atmospheric CO2 levels. Therefore, the coupling between plate tectonics and climate is a feedback that is likely of first order importance for the evolution of rocky planets. Finally, plate tectonics is thought to be important for driving the geodynamo. Plate tectonics efficiently cools the mantle, leading to vigorous thermo-chemical convection in the outer core and dynamo action; without plate tectonics inefficient mantle cooling beneath a stagnant lid may prevent a long-lived magnetic field. As the magnetic field shields a planet’s atmosphere from the solar wind, the magnetic field may be important for preserving hydrogen, and therefore water, on the surface. Thus whole planet coupling between the magnetic field, atmosphere, mantle, and core is possible. We lay out the basic physics governing whole planet coupling, and discuss the implications this coupling has for the evolution of rocky planets and their prospects for hosting life.",

The data used is for 2010 t0 2012. The pre storm effects appeared as either NmF2 depletions or enhancements or even both, when the Dst and Kp indicates a geomagnetically quiet condition (i.e. Dst > -10 nT, Kp < 3). Our results reveal a simultaneous response of the Ionospheric F2 layer and the auroral indices, e.g. AL, AU and AE indices. This suggest their connection to sub storms and a possibility of penetration of the aurora electric field to the mid and low latitudes, leading to the modification of the zonal electric field which in turn affects the drift of electrons from these regions. This and other observations from this study have further shown that Dst and Kp which are indices that have been most widely used in academic research to describe the behavior of geomagnetic storms, are not sufficient for storm time analysis in the equatorial and low latitude. Therefore, it is suggested that AU, AL and AE indices should always be used alongside Dst and Kp or Ap indices for proper and effective storm analysis.",

In analogy to their large-scale counterparts, the small-scale flux ropes of durations about tens of minutes to a few hours when traversed by a spacecraft exhibit typical signatures, especially in magnetic field measurements, i.e., elevated magnetic field magnitude and significant rotation in field direction. The plasma parameters, however, may possess greater variability, in particular, not necessarily of low plasma beta value. Therefore the Grad-Shafranov reconstruction technique, which is non-force free in general, is applied to examine their configuration in two and a half dimensional geometry. We will examine several cases of such structures, occuring in the solar wind at different locations, namely, in the ambient solar wind, inside large-scale ICMEs, behind a travelling shock wave and near stream interface, or the Heliospheric Current Sheet (HCS). We will derive their topological configuration, and physical parameters characterizing these structures. Detailed comparison will be made to show possibly distinct features among these events.

Seasonal average temperatures are found to be non-stationary at most parts of South America over the 1949-2012 period. Simple persistence and lagged regression methods have considerable correlation skill in forecasting next season temperature using previous season temperature as predictor. However, the presence of trends in both predictor and predictand temperature variables can affect correlation skill. Models that can account for non-stationarity in these variables may do better in modelling and forecasting seasonal temperatures known to have trends. A novel method (cointegration), introduced here for empirical seasonal climate forecasting, is found to perform better than the traditional persistence and regression forecasts for places where the predictor and predictand temperatures have stochastic trends. Potential skill pairwise comparisons between temperature forecasts produced with cointegration and those produced using persistence and lagged regression have shown that the alternative cointegration method performs significantly better than the other two.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the evolution of the Earth's surface chemistry is one of the most exciting challenges in modern geoscience. The Great Oxidation Event occurred ~2.5 Ga, when the concentration of oxygen in the atmosphere increased from <0.001% of the present atmospheric level (PAL) to within 1-10%. Following the initial rise, concentrations of O2 in the atmosphere and oceans remained well below present-day atmospheric levels through the Proterozoic until a second rise ~0.6 Ga to levels around those observed today. Thus, for much of Earth’s history, deep oceans probably remained oxygen-poor until the most recent increase in atmospheric O2. In addition to low levels of O2, at least portions of the oceans were euxinic (sulfide-rich) with H2S often reaching the photic zone. Oxygenic photosynthesis is the largest source of O2 in the atmosphere. Primary productivity and the remineralization of organic matter are intimately linked to planetary redox and thus to levels of O2. As a result, biologic carbon isotope fractionation and other biomarkers (i.e. hopanoids) facilitate our interpretation of biogeochemical cycling during the Proterozoic Eon.\nHere, we describe the isolation and characterization of two photoautotrophs—the dominant primary producers—from a Proterozoic Ocean analog. We examined the 13C fractionation in the microbial mat and employed in situ microcosms to estimate primary productivity. In addition, we deployed diver-operated microsensors to determine oxygen production and sulfide consumption over a 24-hour cycle and sequenced total RNA from 4 time points. Using these data, we examined primary production in pure cultures of the dominant Cyanobacteria and green sulfur bacteria from the mat under conditions that mimic those observed in situ. We use this information to begin to build a model of oxygen production and organic carbon burial in a Proterozoic-like environment where Cyanobacteria can contribute to primary productivity in the absence of oxygen production. Furthermore, we examined the differences between 13C fractionation in cultures maintained under “ideal” conditions compared to those observed in situ. Collectively, the RNA sequencing data, the in situ primary productivity data and pure culture information were necessary to interpret the 13C signal from the mats.",

Footprint models are often used to bridge these scales, for interpretation of flux-tower measurements, to derive location and size of the source area, to estimate the contribution of passive scalar sources to these measured fluxes, and to combine measured fluxes with remotely sensed data. With increasing numbers of flux towers within large monitoring networks (e.g., AMERIFLUX, ICOS, NEON), span of observations from these towers, and availability of airborne flux measurements, there has been an increasing demand for reliable footprint models that can be applied for long time series and outside the surface layer.\nIn this contribution, we present a two-dimensional footprint parameterisation and example applications. The footprint parameterisation is based on a novel scaling approach for the lateral distribution of the flux footprint and on an updated version of the footprint parameterisation of Kljun et al. (2004). The footprint parameterisation has been developed and evaluated using simulations of the Lagrangian stochastic particle dispersion model LPDM-B (Kljun et al., 2002), covering a broad range of boundary layer conditions and measurement heights. The new footprint parameterisation requires inputs that can be determined from flux-tower measurements. It can be easily applied to data of long-term monitoring programmes as well as for quick footprint estimates in the field.",

The composition in stable isotopes of water (δ18O, δD, δ17O) permits to reconstruct the past climatic conditions over the ice sheet and also at the evaporation source. Paleothermometer accuracy relies on good knowledge of processes affecting the isotopic composition of surface snow in Polar Regions. Both simple models such as Rayleigh distillation and global atmospheric models with isotopes provide good prediction of precipitation isotopic composition in East Antarctica but post deposition processes can alter isotopic composition on site, in particular exchanges with local vapour. To quantitatively interpret the isotopic composition of water archived in ice cores, it is thus essential to study the continuum water vapour – precipitation – surface snow – buried snow.\nWhile precipitation and snow sampling are routinely performed in Antarctica, climatic conditions in Concordia, very cold (-55°C in average) and very dry (less than 1000ppmv), impose difficult conditions to measure the water vapour isotopic composition. New developments in infrared spectroscopy enable now the measurement of isotopic composition in water vapour traces (down to 20ppmv). Here we present the results of a campaign of measurement of isotopic composition in Concordia in 2014/2015. Two infrared spectrometers have been deployed or the first time on top of the East Antarctic Plateau allowing a continuous vapour measurement for a month. Comparison of the results from infrared spectroscopy with cryogenic trapping validates the relevance of the method to measure isotopic composition in dry conditions. Identification of different behaviour of isotopic composition in the water vapour associated to turbulent or stratified regime indicates a strong impact of meteorological processes in local vapour/snow interaction.",

Thus the present-day mantle as sampled by MORB and OIB is pervasively contaminated by recycled material. We here develop a model to quantify how the continuous incorporation of recycled material changed the Nd-Hf isotopic composition of the mantle through time.\nThe Nd-Hf isotopic compositions of Archean sediments were decoupled - high εHf for a given εNd - due to the contribution of radiogenic Hf from cherts. From these observations, the possible compositions for recycled material currently into the mantle can be estimated. Assuming that modern MORB and OIB contain ~3-5% and ~10-15% recycled material, respectively; we calculate that a mantle reservoir free of recycled material would be significantly more radiogenic than the most extreme MORB and would lie well below the Nd-Hf mantle array. Such a Nd-Hf isotopic composition is not sampled by modern mantle-derived rocks. Crustal rocks formed at ~3.8 Gyr (compilation of granites and TTG), however, have low εHf for a given εNd, consistent with our estimated composition for the mantle without recycled material. We thus suggest that Eoarchean mantle-derived rocks sampled depleted mantle that was not yet contaminated by recycled material and that the slope of the Nd-Hf mantle array changed through time due to continuous recycling of sedimentary material in subduction zones.",

            "abstract": "Tectonic motions that give rise to destructive earthquakes and enigmatic transient slip events are commonly explained by friction laws that describe slip on fault surfaces and gouge-filled zones. Friction laws with the added effects of pore fluid pressure, shear heating, and chemical reactions as currently applied do not take into account that over a wide range of pressure and temperature conditions rocks deform following a complex mixed brittle-ductile rheology. In semi-brittle materials, such as polymineralic rocks, elasto-plastic and visco-elastic defamation can be observed simultaneously in different phases of the material. Field observations of such semi-brittle rocks at the mesoscale have shown that for a given range of composition, temperature, and pressure, the formation of fluid-filled brittle fractures and veins can precede and accompany the development of localized ductile flow. We propose that the coexistence of brittle and viscous behavior controls some of the physical characteristics of strain transients and slow slip events. Here we present results from shear experiments on semi-brittle rock analogues investigating the effect of yield stress on fracture propagation and connection, and how this can lead to reoccurring strain transients. During the experiments we monitor the evolution of fractures and flow as well as the force development in the system. We show that the nature of localized slip and flow in semi-brittle materials depends on the initiation and formation of mode I and II fractures and does not involve frictional behavior, supporting an alternative mechanism for the development of tectonic strain transients.",

            "abstract": "The Earth’s atmosphere and oceans have seen fundamental changes in its oxidation state in response to the climatic, tectonic and geochemical variations. Over the past decade, several geochemical proxies have led to significant progress in understanding the paleredox states of ancient oceans. However, a quantitative interpretation of these data for atmospheric O2 levels remain unclear because the relationship between atmospheric O2 levels (pO2) and oceanic redox state depends on several environmental factors, such as terrestrial weathering rate, sea-level stands, and sinking rate of particulate organic matter (POM) in the water column and so on. It is widely thought that the redox-dependent P cycling also plays a crucial role in regulating pO2 because it acts as a negative feedback on a geological timescale. It is important that strength of this feedback for a given pO2 is also modulated by environmental factors, affecting not only O2 levels at steady state but also its susceptibility to environmental changes. In this study, a quantitative role of environmental factors in the oxidation state of Earth’s surface environment is evaluated with an oceanic biogeochemical cycle model (CANOPS) coupled with global C cycle model, which enables us to understand the ancient CO2 and O2 evolution. Our results demonstrate that atmospheric O2 level at steady state is affected by CO2 input flux from Earth’s interior via changes in biogeochemical cycles, but its response is modulated by several internal factors such as shelf area and POM sinking rate. We also found that early Paleozoic atmospheric O2 levels before the advent of land plant would be determined so that oceans may locate at the “edge of anoxia (EoA)” where the redox-dependency of marine P cycle plays a crucial role in regulating O2 cycle, and that POM sinking rate has a great impact on the EoA. Our findings provide insights into the O2 cycle over the Phanerozoic in response to the climatic and tectonic variations and also shed light on the causal linkage between the critical biological evolution (such as an establishment of biological pump and advent of land plant) and the oxidation state of the atmosphere and oceans.",

The FRW directly drains into the Tennessee River, which is a major source of water supply for the Southern States. The observed precipitation and temperature data are obtained from the Alabama Mesonet Stations which are also a part of National Resources Conservation Service (USDA NRCS) Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN). The GCM simulated climate data are obtained from the WCRP CMIP5 ensemble that consists of 234 downscaled climate projections from four emission scenarios and 37 GCMs. The hydrologic model SWAT is calibrated and validated for a period of 2004 to 2014, based on daily meteorological forcing and monthly streamflow data for the FRW. A total of 15 parameters that directly influences the surface/base flow and basin response are selected and calibrated. The anticipated change in future climate (2030s, 2050s, 2070s, 2090s) with respect to baseline period (2004-2014/2010s) for each emission scenario are introduced into baseline climate to perturb it to future climate pattern. Various climate scenarios based on future climate are forced into the calibrated SWAT model to quantify future water availability over the basin and compared with the baseline period. This is a part of the Geospatial Education and Research Center (GERC) project and the major research findings from this project will help decision makers in evaluating the combined impacts of climate change and land use change on water availability, and developing strategies to sustain available natural resources.",

We compare the satellite data with the new surface data produced by Karl et al. (2015) who denies the reality of the climate hiatus. The difference in the regional trends can help to explain why the global surface temperature remains almost unchanged but the frequency of occurrence of the extreme events increases under rising anthropogenic forcing.

However, radio frequency interference (RFI) is one of the fastest growing sources of error in these retrievals. RFI can originate from broadcasting satellites, as well as from ground-based instrumentation that makes use of the microwave range.\nThe microwave channel bandwidths used by passive satellite radiometers are often wider than the protected bands allocated for this type of remote sensing, a common practice in microwave radiometer design used to reduce the effect of instrument noise in the observed signal. However, broad channel bandwidths allow greater opportunity for RFI to affect these observations and retrievals.\nFor ground-based RFI, a signal is broadcast directly into the atmosphere which may interfere with the radiometer – its antenna, cold mirror, hot load or the internal workings of the radiometer itself. It is relatively easy to identify and flag RFI from large sources, but more difficult to do so from small, sporadic sources. Ground-based RFI has high spatial and temporal variability, requiring constant, automated detection and removal to avoid spurious trends leaching into the geophysical retrievals.\nAscension Island in the South Atlantic Ocean has been one of these notorious ground-based RFI sources, affecting many microwave radiometers, including the AMSR2 radiometer onboard JAXA’s GCOM-W1 satellite. Ascension Island RFI mainly affects AMSR2’s lower frequency channels (6.9, 7.3, and 10.65 GHz) over a broad spatial region in the South Atlantic Ocean, which makes it challenging to detect and flag this RFI using conventional channel and geophysical retrieval differencing techniques.\nThe authors have developed a new method of using the radiometer’s earth counts and hot counts, for the affected channels, to detect an Ascension Island RFI event and flag the data efficiently and accurately, thereby reducing false detections and optimizing retrieval quality and data preservation.",

As part of the ERC funded “VeWa” project, we combined a conceptual rainfall-runoff model and input-output relationships of stable isotopes to understand ecohydrological influences on hydrological partitioning in in six high-latitude experimental catchments located in the UK, USA, Sweden and Canada. We used stable isotope records from precipitation and stream flow to examine the effects of soils and landcover. A meta-analysis was carried out using the HBV-model to estimate the main storage changes characterising annual water balances. Annual snowpack storage importance was ranked differently across the sites, and the subsequent rate and longevity of melt was reflected in calibrated parameters that determine partitioning of waters between more rapid and slower flowpaths and associated variations in soil and groundwater storage. Variability of stream water isotopic composition depends on: (i) rate and duration of spring snowmelt; (ii) significance of summer/autumn rainfall; (iii) relative importance of near-surface and deeper flowpaths in routing water to the stream. Flowpath partitioning also regulates influences of summer evaporation on drainage waters. Deviations of isotope data from the Global Meteoric Water Line showed subtle effects of internal catchment processes on isotopic fractionation most likely through evaporation. After accounting for climate, evaporative fractionation is strongest at sites where lakes and near-surface runoff processes in wet riparian soils can mobilize isotopically-enriched water during summer and autumn. Given close soil-vegetation coupling, this may result in spatial variability in soil water isotope pools available for plant uptake. We argue that stable isotope studies are crucial in addressing the many open questions on hydrological functioning of northern environments.",

If scientists remain on the sidelines, they insure that others with an axe to grind will fill the void, game the process of risk assessment, and insure sub-optimal policy decision-making. But simple participation is not adequate either. Scientists, when they communicate climate change risk, must resist the temptation to downplay high-risk and high-cost scenarios in an effort simply to avoid criticism by contrarians. Otherwise, the net affect is the same, with bad faith actors achieving their goal of minimizing the emphasis placed on mitigation efforts in the policymaking process.

This basic climate forcing is modulated by a host of chemical reactions at the Earth’s surface, the pace of which are in turn regulated by tectonic forces. Together, these various pieces in the puzzle of the global carbon cycle have been identified for decades, but understanding of how they fit together has remained elusive and continues to be much debated. In particular, we now know the climate-dependence of silicate mineral weathering may vary as a function of denudation rate, which is related to tectonic drivers. This variation suggests that the strength of the weathering feedback may have varied in the past, with consequent implications for the past state of global climate. This work will survey and synthesize approaches to representing changes in the weathering feedback, showing that relatively simple parameterizations yield similar results as recently developed reactive transport approaches. This similarity gives confidence in applying the simple parameterizations to reconstructing changes in feedback strength in the geologic past, at least over Phanerozoic timescales, and allows inclusion of this effect explicitly in carbon cycle models.",

Individual faults have a broad and continuous spectrum of slip sense ranging from endmember dextral strike slip to normal slip, and even faults with thrust sense of dip slip were commonly observed in the aftershock sequence. Patterns of coseismic slip are consistent with three-dimensional constrictional strain and show that integrated transtensional shearing can be accommodated in a single earthquake. Stress inversions of coseismic surface rupture and aftershock focal mechanisms define two coaxial, but permuted stress states. The maximum (σ1) and intermediate (σ2) principal stresses are close in magnitude, but flip orientations due to topography- and density-controlled gradients in lithostatic load along the length of the rupture. Although most large earthquakes throughout the world activate slip on multiple faults, the mechanical conditions of their genesis remain poorly understood. Our work attempts to answer several key questions. 1) Why do complex fault systems exist? They must do something that simple, optimally-oriented fault systems cannot because the two types of faults are commonly located in close proximity. 2) How are faults with diverse orientations and slip senses prepared throughout the interseismic period to fail spontaneously together in a single earthquake? 3) Can a single stress state produce multi-fault failure? 4) Are variations in pore pressure, friction and cohesion required to produce simultaneous rupture? 5) How is the fabric of surface rupture affected by variations in orientation, kinematics, total geologic slip and fault zone architecture?",

            "abstract": "The climate and weather general circulation models (GCMs) of the 1980's were primitive and unrealistic, and this at a time when more was being demanded of them for weather forcasting and climate prediction. A couple of seminal workshops kicked off the effort to (i) improve the representation of land surface-atmosphere interactions in GCMs and, (ii) develop new methods for using satellite data to initilaize and validate the improved parameterizations. The First ISLSCP Field experiment, (ISLCSP=International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project), was the pioneer effort to address these problems. The field phase involved 5 satellites, 8 aircraft and around 150 scientists, aircrew and students in five intensive field campaigns (IFCs) in the period 1987-1989. Significant gains were made in improving and testing land surface models and in using satellite data to scale the models up to continental scales as a result. FIFE was followed by BOREAS - the Boreal Ecosystem Atmosphere Study - which had a field phase 1993-1996 in Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Canada. BOREAS was joint US-Canadian enterprise and expanded on the two original ISLSCP goals to encompass carbon exchange and terrestrial ecosystem processes in the context of climate change. Two large study areas, some 500 kilometers apart and at opposite ends of the boreal forest, were investigated using satellites, aircraft, flux towers and a wide range of surface observations. 300 people were involved and 10 field campaigns were executed. The data from these two experiments were used and are still being used to refine land surface parameterizations, including treatments of the carbon cycle, for GCMs and other large scale modeling work.\nThese field experiments, conducted within a single decade, mark the boundary between the eras of primitive \"bucket\" models of the land surface in GCMs and the biophysically realistic Earth System models of the 21st century.",

            "abstract": "Sulfur (S) isotope signatures of sedimentary pyrite preserved in marine rocks provide a rich suite of information about changes in biogeochemical cycling associated with the evolution of microbial metabolisms and oxygenation of Earth surface environments. Conventionally, these S isotope records are based on bulk rock measurements. Yet, in modern microbial mat environments, S isotope compositions of sulfide can vary by up to 40‰ over a spatial range of ~ 1 mm. Similar ranges of S isotope variability have been found in Archean pyrite grains using both Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry and other micro-analytical techniques. These micron-scale patterns have been linked to changes in rates of microbial sulfate reduction and/or sulfide oxidation, isotopic distillation of the sulfate reservoir due to microbial sulfate reduction, and post-depositional alteration. Fine-scale mapping of S isotope compositions of pyrite can thus be used to differentiate primary environmental signals from post-depositional overprinting – improving our understanding of both. Here, we examine micron-scale S isotope patterns of pyrite in microbialites from the Mesoproterozoic-Neoproterozoic Sukhaya Tunguska Formation and Neoproterozoic Draken Formation in order to explore S isotope variability associated with different mat textures and pyrite grain morphologies. A primary goal is to link modern observations of how sulfide spatial isotope distributions reflect active microbial communities present at given depths in the mats to ancient processes driving fine-sale pyrite variability in microbialites. We find large (up to 60‰) S isotope variability within a spatial range of less than 2.5cm. The micron-scale S isotope measurements converge around the S isotope composition of pyrite extracted from bulk samples of the same microbialites. These micron-scale pyrite S isotope patterns have the potential to reveal important information about ancient biogeochemical cycling in Proterozoic mat environments with implications for interpreting S isotope signatures from the geological record.",

In addition, small streams have been replaced by denuded agricultural waterways to convey irrigation drainage high in nitrate (NO3). A variety of strategies are being used to increase riparian vegetation along agricultural waterways, but many of the ecological functions of these novel habitat features are unknown. An extensive study was conducted in summer 2014 to investigate which riparian ecosystem features are associated with variable NO3 levels in waterways draining irrigated cropland. Eighty sites were selected to represent a wide range of riparian vegetation, hydrogeomorphic features, and agricultural contexts. Sites were visited three times to correspond to the early, mid, and late irrigation season. At each visit, water samples were taken 300m apart and analyzed for turbidity, pH, temperature, and NO3. To characterized hydrogeomorphic complexity, the frequency of features associated with transient storage and increased retention time were quantified. Vegetation cover and structure on banks, foreshores, and in channels was also measured. Using a generalized linear model, we tested for the interaction of upstream [NO3-N] with vegetation and hydrogeomorphic variables to predict downstream [NO3-N], the dependent variable. As expected, upstream [NO3-N] strongly predicted downstream [NO3-N] and no features directly predicted downstream [NO3-N]. The frequency of hydrogeomorphic features, however, interacted with upstream [NO3-N] to predict downstream [NO3-N], indicating an effect of hydrogeomorphic complexity on NO3 from up to downstream. Vegetation factors did not interact with upstream [NO3-N], but woody vegetation cover was positively correlated with the frequency of hydrogeomorphic features. These findings support the use of woody riparian vegetation to increase NO3 retention in agricultural waterways, via an indirect association with hydrogeomorphic complexity.",

            "abstract": "In portions of the circumpolar north, there are documented cases of increases in annual inorganic nitrogen loading. Confounding the explanation of this phenomenon is a lack of accompanying annual trends in streamflow, precipitation or atmospheric nitrogen deposition. Evidence from Canada’s subarctic suggests this dichotomy could be due to three key non-linearities in the predominant biogeochemical and hydrological processes. Because snowfall changes to rainfall near the zero degree air temperature isotherm, there has been an increase in late autumn rainfall across the region due to earlier passage of precipitation generating cold fronts. Runoff generation in cold regions is often a storage threshold-mediated process, and the enhanced rainfall results in more common exceedance of these thresholds and higher winter streamflow. Finally, net mineralization rates in regional lakes peak in winter following the onset of ice cover. Subtle increases in monthly rainfall at specific times of the year can permit hydro-chemical process synchrony within watersheds that enhances annual inorganic nitrogen loading, implying that the impacts of process synchrony transcend scale. The presence of shifts in nitrogen export suggests that sustained regular process synchrony can modify system states. Sound understanding of system processes and interactions across scales will be needed to properly predict impacts and make sound decisions when managing watersheds and competing resource demands.",

Many validation studies have been established to understand the strengths and limitations of these satellite precipitation retrievals. In this study, an object-based validation approach is adopted to evaluate several satellite precipitation retrievals focusing on the spatial and geometric patterns of precipitation. This object-based validation approach identifies precipitation objects using an image processing technique referred to as watershed transform. Several object attributes are diagnosed and analyzed based on the distance measurement. Three object-based verification scores are summarized to determine the overall performances of satellite precipitation retrievals. The Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) and Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN) were evaluated using the object-based approach. The NOAA stage IV MPE multi-sensor composite rain analysis was utilized as the ground observations. The comparative assessments were conducted at 0.25° by 0.25° on a daily scale in the summer season of 2014 over the continental United States (CONUS). The results suggest that IMERG possesses the similar spatial pattern of local-scale precipitation areas against stage IV observations. In addition, IMERG depicts the sizes and locations of precipitation areas more accurately against stage IV.",

AIRS acquires hyperspectral infrared radiances in 2378 channels ranging in wavelength from 3.7-15.4 um with spectral resolution of better than 1200, and spatial resolution of 13.5 km with global daily coverage. The AIRS was designed to measure temperature and water vapor profiles for improvement in weather forecast and improved parameterization of climate processes. Currently the AIRS Level 1B Radiance Products are assimilated by NWP centers worldwide and have shown considerable forecast improvement. AIRS L1 and L2 products are widely used for studying critical climate processes related to water vapor feedback, atmospheric transport and cloud properties. AIRS trace gas products include ozone profiles, carbon monoxide, and the first global maps of mid-tropospheric carbon dioxide. The global daily coverage of AIRS allows scientists to follow the transport of these gases to aid in validation of chemical/weather transport models.\nThe AIRS radiances are calibrated using a uniform on-board blackbody and full aperture space view and are recognized to have stability and accuracy for most channels of better than 200 mK for most scene types. The AIRS pre-flight tests that impact the radiometric calibration include a full system radiometric response (linearity), polarization response, and response vs scan angle (RVS). We compare the AIRS instrument radiometric calibration coefficients from the pre-flight polarization measurements, the response vs scan (RVS) angle tests as well as the linearity tests, and lunar roll test taken in orbit that allowed the AIRS to view deep space. New methods are employed using MODIS to correct the AIRS radiances in non-uniform scenes for channels with non-uniform spatial response, and PC reconstruction to evaluate the accuracy of the calibration in orbit that can ultimately be used to improve the calibration. The data and method for deriving the coefficients and evaluating the calibration is discussed and the stability and accuracy of the radiometric calibration compared pre-launch with current estimates in orbit.",

Evidence for the persistence of large inland lakes in western North America during the Pliocene and Pleistocene provides first-order constraints on regional water balance. The spatial distribution of terminal lakes records the interaction between regional moisture delivery dynamics and topography. We investigate the climatological conditions driving lake levels in western North America during the mid-Pliocene warm period and Pleistocene glacial maxima. Geologic evidence suggests wet conditions persisted in this region during both periods despite dramatically different boundary conditions and pCO2 levels.\nWe modify the pluvial hydrologic index, a dimensionless measure of lake surface area to the draining tributary area, to include watershed rainfall-runoff relationships and basin-scale vapor recycling. We do so by including water isotope constraints and calibrated Budyko curves at the individual watershed scale. We apply this modeling framework to the spatial distribution of terminal lakes documented in the Basin and Range during Pleistocene glacials and during the Pliocene. The results are quantitatively compared to climate model simulations of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, ~21 ka) and mid-Pliocene (~3 to 3.3 Ma) from the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project (PMIP and PlioMIP). Reduced evaporation and moderate increases in precipitation, relative to modern, drive lake levels during the LGM, while large precipitation increases are the primary driver during the Pliocene. Water isotope constraints in our lake mass balance model bring precipitation estimates in closer agreement with those from climate model simulations. Future inclusion of lakes in climate model boundary conditions will improve both the simulation of inland vapor recycling and proxy-model agreement in western North America.",

            "abstract": "The plasma wave instruments on the Voyager 1 and 2 spacecraft can detect the impact of high velocity dust particles when they strike the spacecraft body. The impacts are recognizable by a characteristic voltage pulse that they produce in the wideband electric field waveform data. Although the wideband receiver on Voyager 2 is no longer working, Voyager 1 has been collecting wideband data for over 37 years, starting near the Jupiter flyby at 5 AU and continuing to the most recent data beyond 132 AU. During this time a persistent level of dust impacts have been detected at a rate of about 3 to 7 impacts/ hour. We interpret these impacts as being due to interstellar dust. Using the cross-sectional area of the spacecraft high-gain antenna, 10.75 m2, as the effective impact area, and the velocity of the spacecraft relative to the 26 km/s arrival velocity of the interstellar dust, this impact rate corresponds to a flux of about (0.75 to 1.65) x 10-4 m-2 s-1. Although we do not have good knowledge of the mass of the dust particles, this flux agrees well with the interstellar dust flux published by Grün et al. [1993] from the dust detector on the Ulysses spacecraft at 5 AU. The Ulysses dust instrument showed that the mass of the interstellar dust particles ranged from about 10-15 to 10-10 grams (roughly 0.1 to 10 µm). We presume that Voyager 1 is detecting these same particles. The heliocentric radial variation can be fit within the error bars by a constant flux of about 1.2 x 10-4 m-2s-1. However, the plot of the average count rates in 20 AU bins increases steadily from 10 to 100 AU, with a notable decrease beyond 100 AU, suggesting that there might be a slightly higher flux (by a factor of two) in the outer regions of the heliosphere than in the interstellar medium.

            "abstract": "Traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) induced by acoustic-gravity waves in the neutral atmosphere have significant impact on trans-ionospheric radio waves such as Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS, including Global Position System (GPS)) measurements. Natural hazards and solid Earth events, such as earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions are actual sources that may trigger acoustic and gravity waves resulting in traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs) in the upper atmosphere. Trans-ionospheric radio wave measurements sense the total electron content (TEC) along the signal propagation path. In this research, we introduce a novel GPS-based detection and estimation technique for remote sensing of atmospheric wave-induced TIDs including space weather phenomena induced by major natural hazard events, using TEC time series collected from worldwide ground-based dual-frequency GNSS (including GPS) receiver networks.\nWe demonstrate the ability of using ground- and space-based dual-frequency GPS measurements to detect and monitor tsunami wave propagation from the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake and tsunami. Major wave trains with different propagation speeds and wavelengths were identified through analysis of the GPS remote sensing observations. Dominant physical characteristics of atmospheric wave-induced TIDs are found to be associated with specific tsunami propagations and oceanic Rayleigh waves. In this research, we compared GPS-based observations, corresponding model simulations and tsunami wave propagation. Results are shown to lead to a better understanding of the tsunami-induced ionosphere responses. Based on current distribution of Plate Boundary Observatory GPS stations, the results indicate that tsunami-induced TIDs may be detected about 60 minutes prior to tsunamis arriving at the U.S. west coast. It is expected that this GNSS-based technology will become an integral part of future early-warning systems.",

            "abstract": "The thermal state of an ice sheet’s bed (frozen or thawed) is an important control upon its history, present dynamics and future vulnerability to external forcings. However, this thermal state can only be either observed directly within sparse boreholes or inferred from the presence of subglacial lakes. Hence, indirect inferences of this state are required for the vast majority of an ice sheet. Here we synthesize new and existing spatially extensive inferences of the present thermal state of the bed of the Greenland Ice Sheet to better constrain this state, identify the most poorly constrained regions and inform ice-flow modeling. New remote inferences of this basal thermal state are derived from modeling of this ice sheet’s radiostratigraphy, analysis of surface imagery and interpretation of surface-velocity patterns. Existing inferences include outputs from thermomechanical ice-flow models with varied spin-ups, forcings and underlying assumptions. Between similarly forced models, there is general agreement regarding the thermal state of the bed, except where this state transitions from frozen to thawed. Both observations and modeling generally agree that the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS) and significant portions of the southwestern ice-drainage basins are thawed at the bed, while the vicinities of central ice divides, particularly their west-facing slopes, are frozen. There is poor agreement regarding the basal thermal state within the NEGIS drainage basin outside of NEGIS itself, above ~2000 m surface elevation in the southern drainage basins and along the eastern ice-sheet margin. Further, remote inferences and modeling rarely represent the observed basal thermal state accurately at NorthGRIP, DYE-3 and near northeastern subglacial lakes. This synthesis identifies large regions of the Greenland Ice Sheet where additional observations could significantly improve assessment of its basal thermal state, and where the ice sheet is likely most sensitive to millennial-scale external forcings. Finally, we discuss the possible sources of disagreement between the observed and modeled basal thermal state.",

They are highly productive ecosystems and contribute about 30% of the global\nterrestrial net primary productivity and potentially contain 20% of the world's soil\norganic carbon. Global circulation models have predicted that many savannas will\nbecome warmer and drier during the twenty-first century. The impacts of the projected\nclimatic trend on the productivity and biogeochemical cycles of savannas are not fully\nunderstood. Here, we assessed the abundance of stable carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N)\nisotopes in soil profiles at four sites along a 1000 km transect with a strong south-north\nprecipitation gradient in southern Africa. The south receives about 180 mm of rainfall per\nyear and dominated by grass species (C4) whereas the north receives 540 mm·yr-1 and\ndominated by woody plants (C3). Soil surface δ13C showed that woody vegetation contributed\nmore than 75% of soil carbon input in the wet sites whereas grasses contributed about\n65% of soil carbon input in the dry sites. The soil profile δ13C indicated that intermediate\nsites have shifted from grass dominated to woody-shrub-dominated states\nduring recent past. The dry sites had relatively higher δ15N (~10‰) compared to the wet\nsites (~5‰) indicating significantly greater N2 fixation in the wetter sites or high rates of\nNH3 volatilization in the drier sites. Our results suggest that as savannas become warmer\nand drier due to climate change, woody shrubs are likely to be the dominant form of\nvegetation structure, a process that could alter biogeochemical processes and results in\nsavannas becoming net carbon sink or source.",

            "abstract": "The extent and thickness of sea ice and snow play a critical role in the Earth’s climate system. Both sea ice and snow have high albedo and control the heat exchange between the atmosphere and ocean and atmosphere and land. In terms of hydrology, the presence of sea ice and snow modulates the flow and the salinity of ocean water. This in turn can modify the weather patterns around the globe. Understanding the formation, coverage and the properties of sea ice and snow are important for both short-term and long-term climate modeling.\nThe advancements in high-frequency electronics and digital signal processing enabled the development of ultra-wideband radars by the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS) for airborne measurements of snow and ice properties over large areas. CReSIS recently developed and deployed two ultra-wideband airborne radars, namely the Multichannel Coherent Radar Depth Sounder/Imager (MCoRDS/I) and the Snow Radar. The MCoRDS/I is designed to operate over the frequency range of 180-450 MHz for sounding land ice and imaging its ice-bed interface. We also took advantage of the deployment to explore the potential of UWB MCoRDS/I in sounding sea ice and collected data on flight lines flown as part of NASA Operation IceBridge mission during Spring 2015. Preliminary results show we sounded sea ice under favorable conditions. We will perform detailed processing and analysis of data over the next few months and we will compare results obtained are compared with existing altimetry-derived data products. The new snow radar, on the other hand, operating from 2 to 18 GHz, was deployed on the NRL Twin Otter aircraft in Barrow, AK. It was shown to have a vertical resolution of down to 1.5 cm which opens up the potential for thin snow measurement on both sea ice and land. Both of these new radars will be further optimized for future airborne missions to demonstrate their capabilities for sea ice and snow measurements. We will also show new technical advances in hardware and signal processing techniques useful for airborne measurements of snow and sea ice.",

            "abstract": "Episodic landslides and debris flows play a key role in sculpting many steep landscapes, and they also pose significant natural hazards. Field evidence, laboratory experiments, and theoretical analyses show that variations in the quantity, speed, and distance of sediment transport by landslides and debris flows can depend strongly on nuanced differences in initial conditions. Moreover, initial conditions themselves can be strongly dependent on the geological legacy of prior events. The scope of these dependencies is revealed by the results of landslide dynamics experiments [Iverson et al., Science, 2000], debris-flow erosion experiments [Iverson et al., Nature Geosci., 2011], and numerical simulations of the highly destructive 2014 Oso, Washington, landslide [Iverson et al., Earth Planet. Sci. Let., 2015]. In each of these cases, feedbacks between basal sediment deformation and pore-pressure generation cause the speed and distance of sediment transport to be very sensitive to subtle differences in the ambient sediment porosity and water content. On the other hand, the onset of most landslides and debris flows depends largely on pore-water pressure distributions and only indirectly on sediment porosity and water content. Thus, even if perfect predictions of the locations and timing of landslides and debris flows were available, the dynamics of the events – and their consequent hazards and sediment transport – would be difficult to predict. This difficulty is a manifestation of the nonlinear physics involved, rather than of poor understanding of those physics. Consequently, physically based models for assessing the hazards and sediment transport due to landslides and debris flows must take into account both evolving nonlinear dynamics and inherent uncertainties about initial conditions. By contrast, landscape evolution models that use prescribed algebraic formulas to represent sediment transport by landslides and debris flows lack a sound physical basis.",

            "abstract": "The use of many carbonate-derived geochemical proxies is underpinned by the assumption that tracer elements are incorporated ‘ideally’ as impurities the mineral lattice, following relatively straightforward kinetic and thermodynamic drives. This allows comparison to inorganic precipitation experiments, and provides a systematic starting point from which to translate geochemical tracers to environmental records.\nBiomineral carbonates are a prominent source of geochemical proxy material, and are far from an ideal inorganic system. They are structurally and compositionally heterogeneous mineral-organic composites, produced in tightly controlled biological environments, possibly via non-classical crystal growth mechanisms. Biominerals offer numerous opportunities for tracers to be incorporated in a ‘non-ideal’ state. For instance, tracers could be hosted within the organic component of the structure, in interstitial micro-domains of a separate mineral phase, or in localized high-impurity clusters. If a proxy element is hosted in a non-ideal state, our understanding of its incorporation and preservation is flawed, and the theoretical basis behind the proxies derived from it must be reevaluated. Thus far, the assumption of ideal tracer incorporation has remained largely untested, owing to the spatial resolution and sensitivity limits of available techniques.\nDevelopments in high-resolution, high-sensitivity X-ray spectroscopy at Scanning Transmission X-Ray Microscopes (STXMs) have allowed us to measure trace element coordination in foraminiferal calcite, at length-scales relevant to biomineralisation processes and tracer incorporation. This instrument has allowed us to test the fundamental assumptions behind several geochemical proxy elements. We present a summary of four STXM studies, assessing the chemical state and distribution of Mg (Branson et al, 2014), B (Branson et al, 2015), S and Na (unpub.), and highlight the implications of these data for the use of these elements as geochemical tracers.\n",

This agreement includes comparison of structures seen in the passage of a simulated BBF with observations made by the THEMSIS mission. A superposed epoch analysis of the high-speed flows seen in the simulation using the same selection criteria used to analyze Geotail observations found excellent agreement in structure of the flow profile, dipolarization of the field, and reduction of the density after BBF passage. In this work we extend the analysis of BBFs in LFM simulations to include a range of solar wind conditions and IMF directions. We begin by holding the solar wind speed constant and vary the IMF direction from northward to southward in 30-degree steps. We then hold the IMF constant in its southward IMF direction and vary the solar wind speed from 200 to 800 km/s. In the final set of experiments we leave the IMF southward, hold the speed constant, and vary the strength of IMF between 2.5 and 10 nT. We will report on the differences these conditions and statistical nature of the BBFs seen in the simulation using the same superposed epoch analysis tools developed for the southward IMF results previously analyzed. This analysis will include comparison of the features at lunar distances with those closer to the Earth. In addition, we will examine the distribution of the BBFs in the simulation as function of the solar wind and IMF parameters.",

            "abstract": "Although the terrestrial aurora is often regarded as 2 dimensional projection of the 3 dimensional magnetosphere there are fundamental limitations in observing magnetospheric processes through their auroral footprints. It has been shown that most electron auroras are produced in the auroral acceleration region at lower altitudes (<2Re) in the last steps of processing the auroral particles. From FAST, IMAGE , Cluster and THEMIS data we can distinguish between four fundamentally different types of auroral acceleration regions. A primary task is to distinguish (1) the upward current, (2) downward current, (3) diffuse aurora and (4) Alfven wave accelerated types of auroral acceleration regions. Type (1) contains the “inverted V” type electron precipitation distinguishable by several keV mono-energetic electron spectra, and low number flux consistent with the source population in the plasma sheet. Our understanding of how these auroras relate to magnetospheric processes is still vague, probably associated with convection sheer. Alfven wave electron auroras (4) are of low average energy (<2 keV) high electron flux consistent with ionospheric electron source predominantly occurring during substorms, and they are generated by wave energy carried from the magnetosphere into the ionosphere, where it is converted into electron energy. These are most promising candidates for observing the footprints of source regions associated with reconnection sites or magnetospheric dB/dt events. Optical measuring techniques of electron energy use the atmosphere as a spectrometer, obtaining the penetration altitude as a proxy for energy, that can be obtained from atmospheric composition, quenching lifetime of the emitters, UV absorption pass-length of O2 to the source or the local atmospheric temperature. Precipitating protons are usually an order of magnitude more energetic and less affected by fields in the low altitude auroral acceleration region. Energetic proton precipitation is a more direct mapping tool of highly stretched closed field lines, the high latitude open-closed-field-line and the low latitude isotropic boundary. Ground and satellite based spectral imaging of the aurora will remain a significant tool in understanding space plasma physics in the magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "Bedrock fractures in the critical zone influence the rates of surface processes that drive landscape evolution, and are also influenced by topography, which perturbs ambient tectonic and gravitational stress fields. Previous studies examined connections between topographic stress and bedrock fractures using two-dimensional topographic profiles across ridges and valleys in plane strain. In this study, we calculate three-dimensional elastic stress fields beneath topography using a boundary element model and examine how the stress fields vary with topographic shape and horizontal tectonic stress magnitude, orientation, and anisotropy. We illustrate the general effects of these factors using synthetic landforms consisting of elongated ridges with different aspect ratios, and then consider natural landscapes from two critical zone observatories. From the modeled stress fields, we calculate two stress proxies—the least compressive principal stress and the failure potential (a normalized measure of differential stress)—that represent the potential for generating new fractures and dilating or shearing existing fractures. If the ratio of horizontal tectonic compressive stress to gravitational stresses associated with topographic relief is small, the base of a zone where more abundant open fractures are predicted generally parallels the land surface. If the ratio of stresses is large, the base of the fracture-rich zone generally mirrors the land surface. We find that these topographic stress perturbations are most sensitive to the tectonic stress magnitude perpendicular to the long axis of elongated landforms such as ridges and valleys, and are most pronounced beneath landforms with higher mean curvatures, such as channel junctions and ridge crests. We use the three-dimensional distributions of stress proxies to infer spatial patterns of weathering and erodibility in scenarios with different topography and tectonic settings, and examine how topographic stress and landscapes might co-evolve.",

            "abstract": "Biofuel feedstocks are being developed and evaluated in the United States and Europe to partially offset petroleum transport fuels. Accurate accounting of upstream and downstream greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is necessary to measure the overall carbon intensity of new biofuel feedstocks. Changes in direct soil organic carbon (SOC) can have a major impact on estimating overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from biofuels when using life-cycle assessment (LCA). Estimating changes in SOC, when accounted for in a LCA, is largely derived from near-surface soil depths , typically to a depth of 30 cm or less. The majority of soil models do not model SOC changes below near-surface soil depths. Perennial herbaceous roots often extend much deeper than 30 cm and changes in cumulative SOC stocks may not be fully accounted for. Further, there is limited empirical data to validate SOC changes at soil depth from bioenergy crops with soil C models. Further calibration, validation, and intercomparisons of soil C models with long-term, field-based bioenergy studies are needed to accurately predict SOC stock changes at depth under variable soil types, climates, and cropping systems. From a LCA perspective, determining SOC stock changes at sub-surface depths would be a logical step to accurately quantify biofuel GHG emissions especially in bioenergy cropping systems with high potential for soil C storage. Presentation objectives will look at developing linkages and determining research needs from field-based SOC changes to modeling and looking at future landscapes with increased bioenergy feedstocks.",

Previous studies have reported single “nose-like” structures occurring alone and simultaneous nose-like structures (up to three). These ion structures are named after the characteristic shapes of energy bands or gaps in the energy-time spectrograms of in situ measured ion fluxes. They constitute the observational signatures of ion acceleration, transport, and loss in the global magnetosphere. The HOPE mass spectrometer onboard the Van Allen Probes measures energetic hydrogen, helium, and oxygen ions near the inner edge of the plasma sheet, where these ion structures are observed. We present a statistical study of nose-like structures, using 2-years measurements from the HOPE instrument. The results provide important details about the spatial distribution (dependence on geocentric distance), spectral features of the structures (differences among species), and geomagnetic conditions under which these structures occur.",

A standard covariance matrix EOF analysis of filtered wind along the equator at 50 hPa is used to isolate MRG and Kelvin waves, using ERA Interim analyses for the entire period 1979-2012. This approach uses 2-6 day meridional wind for MRG waves and 10-25 day eastward zonal wind for Kelvin waves as a basis for the two independent EOF analyses, respectively. Raw wind, geopotential height and CLAUS brightness temperature are then projected onto the EOF PCs at all levels from 1000 to 1 hPa to obtain the structure and evolution of the waves. In all cases EOF pairs are obtained corresponding to propagating modes. The classical Yanai MRG waves are readily identified, and have periods of around 4 days and zonal wavenumber four meridional wind and streamfunction structures centered on the equator, with antisymmetric zonal wind and geopotential as expected. However a faster mode, with a period of around three days is also identified, with a zonal wavenumber three structure. This latter mode is actually much more coherent in cross spectra between antisymmetric zonal wind, geopotential and temperature at 10 degrees north and south. This scale matches the equatorial Rossby radius expected of a disturbance with an equivalent depth of about 120 meters, as identified in space-time spectra of various dynamical quantities obtained from lower stratospheric radiosonde and reanalyses. Strong modulation of this MRG activity by the QBO is also seen for both modes. Kelvin waves are similarly identified using equatorial zonal wind filtered for 10-25 day eastward travelling fluctuations. Two scales are evident here: a wave one and also a wave two disturbance, each with periods of around 14 days. Evidence that the Kelvin and MRG modes are excited by tropical convection is presented, whereby coherent OLR anomalies over the central Pacific peak several days before the stratospheric MRG activity. The convection itself appears to be associated with the central Pacific standing mode in OLR that we have recently identified by, which is itself identified as a convectively coupled MRG-type disturbance in the troposphere.",

            "abstract": "Anomalous large-scale circulation patterns often play a key role in the occurrence of temperature extremes. For example, large-scale circulation can drive horizontal temperature advection or influence local processes that lead to extreme temperatures, such as by inhibiting moderating sea breezes, promoting downslope adiabatic warming, and affecting the development of cloud cover. Additionally, large-scale circulation can influence the shape of temperature distribution tails, with important implications for the magnitude of future changes in extremes. As a result of the prominent role these patterns play in the occurrence and character of extremes, the way in which temperature extremes change in the future will be highly influenced by if and how these patterns change. It is therefore critical to identify and understand the key patterns associated with extremes at local to regional scales in the current climate and to use this foundation as a target for climate model validation. This presentation provides an overview of recent and ongoing work aimed at developing and applying novel approaches to identifying and describing the large-scale circulation patterns associated with temperature extremes in observations and using this foundation to evaluate state-of-the-art global and regional climate models. Emphasis is given to anomalies in sea level pressure and 500 hPa geopotential height over North America using several methods to identify circulation patterns, including self-organizing maps and composite analysis. Overall, evaluation results suggest that models are able to reproduce observed patterns associated with temperature extremes with reasonable fidelity in many cases. Model skill is often highest when and where synoptic-scale processes are the dominant mechanisms for extremes, and lower where sub-grid scale processes (such as those related to topography) are important. Where model skill in reproducing these patterns is high, it can be inferred that extremes are being simulated for plausible physical reasons, boosting confidence in future projections of temperature extremes. Conversely, where model skill is identified to be lower, caution should be exercised in interpreting future projections.",

            "abstract": "Since the World Economic Forum highlighted the Water-Energy-Food-Climate nexus of issues, with examples that distinguised between the developing and developed country manifestations, there has been a tremendous interest in exploring related topics by academics, the media, industry, the public sector and leading politicians. It is clear that there is interdependence across these systems and exigencies in one can lead to impacts in the other. By and large, we have seen case studies exposing attributes of the nexus, and broad generalizations of the potential inersections. Some have proposed network models, others have spoken to the fact that the fragmentation of these issues across many institutions restricts the ability to manage these as an integrated control system. Given that hydroclimatic systems are globally connected dynamical systems that influence social systems that manage the production and consumption of water, food and energy, and are in turn influenced by them, one direction that needs to emerge is an understanding of the multiscale and bidirectional links between climate and the managed earth systems. However, a challenge in this regard is that our managed systems are not explicitly managed. We have market processes for food and energy, but with regulatory intervention and subsidies and incentives that often distort market outcomes. For water, we typically have disjunctive public sector managementof resources, with very limited market like approaches. How then can one understand the interlinked functioning of these systems, seek predictabiliy and develop rules that allow adaptive management across the nexus while developing a regulated market structure that stimulates innovation and cost reduction/efficiency improvements. This may be one of the more significant challenges facing those who wish to be earth system managers and postulate future scenarios, regulate emissions and foster life cycle thinking as part of green engineering. In this talk, I will try to lay out what I think are some possible directions for the associated science, and speculate on ways in which the world may evolve to address this nexus. In particular, I will highlight the importance of diverse data sources and their analysis to establish such directions, as opposed to a purely model based approach.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_Poster.pdf\nThe Mediterranean climate of Northern California imposes significant water stress on ecosystems and water resources during the dry summer months. During summer, frequently the only water inputs occur as occult precipitation, in the form of fog and dew. In this study, we characterized the role of coastal fog, a dominant feature of Northern Californian coastal ecosystems and a widespread phenomenon associated with deep marine upwelling in west coast, arid, and Mediterranean climates worldwide. We monitored fog occurrence and intensity, throughfall following canopy interception of fog, soil moisture, streamflow, and meteorological variables, and made visual observations of the spatial extent of fog using time-lapse imagery in Upper Pilarcitos Creek Watershed (managed by San Francisco Public Utilities Commission as part of the San Francisco area water supply). We adopted a stratified sampling design that captured the watershed’s elevation gradient, forest-edge versus interior locations, and different vegetation cover. The point-scale observations of throughfall inputs and transpiration suppression, estimated from the Penman equation, were upscaled using such watershed features and the observed fog “footprint” identified from the time-lapse images. When throughfall input and fog-induced transpiration suppression were incorporated into the operational watershed model, they improved estimates of summer baseflow, which remained persistently higher than could be explained without the fog effects. Fog, although providing relatively small volumetric inputs to the water balance, appears to offer significant relief of water stress throughout the terrestrial and aquatic components of the coastal Californian ecosystem and thus should be accounted for when assessing water stress availability in dry ecosystems.",

The reflectivity variation is interpreted to associate with discharging magma. Sakurajima Volcano is the target of this study, which is one of the most active volcanoes in Japan. Seven rounds of the seismic experiment with controlled sources have been conducted annually in the volcano. Two seismic reflection profiles tied up are obtained from the datasets under successful reproduction during rounds. Clear annual variation in seismic reflectivity at 6.2km depth is detected in the northeastern part of Sakurajima during the rounds. The reflectivity marked its maximum on December 2009 on the first intrusion of magma and decreased gradually until December 2013, which coincides with inflation and following deflation in Sakurajima Volcano. The active reflector at 6.2km depth occupies a part of embedded clear reflector. A sandwich structure is invoked as the reflector model. Intrusion of fresh and high temperature magma into the intermediate layer of the model and its decline explains the variation range of reflectivity successfully. Our study presents one of new approaches for sensing magma properties instantaneously and for monitoring active volcanoes.",

TANSO-FTS onboard GOSAT has wide spectral coverage from SWIR to TIR and an agile pointing system at the expense of spatial context, while OCO-2 targets CO2with higher spatial resolution using imaging grating spectrometers. Since the early phase of the two projects, both teams have worked in calibration and validation to demonstrate the effectiveness of satellite greenhouse gases observation. In 2008, the pre-launch cross-calibration agreement between GOSAT and OCO radiometers was better than 2% when measuring the traceable GOSAT calibration sphere (Sakuma et. al, 2010). Since GOSAT’s launch in 2009, annual joint vicarious calibration campaigns at the Railroad Valley (RRV) playa have estimated radiometric degradation factors with time at an uncertainty of 7%. (Kuze et al., 2014).\nAfter OCO-2 launch, two independent measurements can now be compared to distinguish common forward calculation errors such as molecule absorption line parameters, solar lines and light-path modification by aerosol scattering from instrument-specific errors. On 25 Mach 2015, both GOSAT and OCO-2 targeted RRV simultaneously. The measured radiance spectra at the top of the atmosphere agree within 5% for all common bands. On June 29 and July 1 during the 7th RRV campaign, coincidence observation of GOSAT, OCO-2, AJAX airplane, radiosonde, and FTS and radiometers on the ground, provided surface albedo, BRDF, temperature, humidity CO2 and CH4 density to demonstrate consistency between forward radiative transfer calculation and satellite measured data. Both GOSAT and OCO-2 have been regularly targeting the TCCON site at Lamont and large emission sources such as mega cities and oil fields and glint over the ocean. Retrieved parameters such as surface albedo, pressure, column averaged mole fraction and aerosol related parameters can be compared firstly where aerosol optical thickness is low and topography is flat, and then over aerosol-thick regions. Globally consistent observation from space is still challenging especially at high latitude and over very bright desert surfaces with thick aerosol. More robust retrieval algorithm and optimized observation patterns have been investigated toward detecting emissions using satellite data and for understanding missing sinks.",

            "abstract": "The 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake and its associated tsunami clearly showed the need for an accurate tsunami early warning system. Real-time GNSS data have an advantage over the short-time seismograms because robust estimations of location and dimension of coseismic faults can be derived from spatial patterns of permanent coseismic displacement measured by real-time GNSS data. Based on these backgrounds, GSI and Tohoku University has been developed the real-time GNSS analysis system. GSI named this system as REGARD (real-time GEONET Analysis for Rapid Deformation Monitoring), which consists three subsystems: (1) Real-time GPS positioning for all of the GEONET site in every one second, (2) automated extraction of displacement fields due to the large earthquake, and (3) automated estimation of Mw by an approximated single rectangular fault or slip distribution in the assumed plated interface. In contrast, lack of the geodetic observation in the offshore region should cause the resolution degrading of the coseismic fault estimation or coseismic slip distribution. In fact, GNSS/Acoustic (GNSS/A) geodetic measurements have revealed the unexpectedly large extent of the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake rupture near the Japan Trench (e.g., Kido et al. 2011). To reveal the earthquake mechanisms and occurrence, as well as co- and post-seismic behaviours, the observation of seafloor crustal deformation in the offshore region is very important. Thus, we are now developing a continuous horizontal and vertical crustal deformation and tsunami observation system based on the moored buoy by a slack cable. This system measures the horizontal and vertical coseismic displacement just after the large earthquake deduced from GNSS/Acoustic measurement and ocean bottom pressure measurement, respectively (Takahashi et al., 2014, 2015). We will introduce the current development status of the quasi real-time crustal deformation monitoring deduced from these onshore and offshore systems based on the assessment of the actual acquired data.",

            "abstract": "Bark beetles increased conifer tree mortality across western North America due to past land use interacting with climate change. For both mountain pine and spruce beetles, the mechanism of mortality is hydraulic failure due to xylem occlusion by beetle-carried blue stain fungi, which causes the trees to die from symptoms that are the same as extreme drought. As the mortality event peaked in the last decade, the hypothesized effects on forest biogeochemical processes were 1) lower forest water use from xylem occlusion, 2) less carbon uptake from limited canopy gas exchange, 3) increased nitrogen cycling from increased litterfall and soil moisture and 4) increased streamflow and organic N and C loading at the watershed scale from the first three consequences. The stand-scale effects during mortality were as predicted with transpiration falling by 10-35% in proportion to the occluded xylem, carbon uptake declining by > 50% due to lack of canopy gas exchange and nitrogen cycling increasing from elevated litter inputs and stimulated organic matter decomposition. Some stands, especially mid-elevation lodgepole pine, did not follow these trends because of residual vegetation taking advantage of the increased resources from the dead trees and rapid succession within 5 years of new grasses, shrubs and tree seedlings as well as increased resource use by surviving canopy trees. In a high elevation spruce stand, the lower water use lasted for only three years while summer carbon uptake was only significantly reduced for a year. At the scale of small to medium-sized watersheds, the impact of mortality was not detectable in stream flow due to the spatial and temporal scale muting of the mortality signal as temporal and spatial scales increase. Current ecosystem and watershed models miss these compensating mechanisms with increasing scale and thus over predict the impact of bark beetle mortality.",

The main shock was followed by hundreds of aftershocks including M6.6 and M6.7 within 48 hours and M7.3 on May 12, 2015. According to the Government of Nepal, a total of 8,686 people lost their lives, 16,808 people injured, over 500,000 buildings completely collapsed and more than 250,000 building partially damaged.\nThe National Society for Earthquake Technology – Nepal (NSET), a not-for-profit civil society organization that has been focused on earthquake risk reduction in Nepal for past 21 years, conducted various activities to support people and the government in responding to the earthquake disaster. The activities included: i) assisting people and critical facility institutions to conduct rapid visual building damage assessment including the training; ii) information campaign to provide proper information regarding earthquake safety; iii) support rescue organizations on search and rescue operations; and iv) provide technical support to common people on repair, retrofit of damaged houses. NSET is also involved in carrying out studies related to earthquake damage, geotechnical problems, and causes of building damages. Additionally, NSET has done post-earthquake detail damage assessment of buildings throughout the affected areas.\nPrior to the earthquake, NSET has been working with several institutions to improve seismic performance of school buildings, private residential houses, and other critical structures. Such activities implemented during the past decade have shown the effectiveness of risk reduction. Retrofitted school buildings performed very well during the earthquake. Preparedness activities implemented at community levels have helped communities to respond immediately and save lives. Higher level of earthquake awareness achieved including safe behavior, better understanding of building code, and improvement of skills towards safer construction, helped in saving lives and assets, and also helped to understand better the gaps and shortcomings for better defining the future course of action.\nThis paper will discuss key achievements, lessons learned and optimal directions for future activities.",

            "abstract": "Due to the increasing pressure on water resources, water stress monitoring has become one of the most significant issues in water resources planning and management, especially during periods of extreme climate conditions. The present study compares the performance of four currently used data fusion based drought indices (DFDIs) to evaluate the weekly water stress at the Howard Springs OzFlux Tower in Northern Australia, covering a 3-year period from January 2011 to December 2013. In addition, a new DFDI has been developed and applied to address the individual shortcomings of the traditional indices. The proposed DFDI comprehensively considers all types of drought through a selection of indices and proxies associated with each drought type (water, vegetation etc). Here, weekly data from three different data sources (OzFlux Network, Asia-Pacific Water Monitor, and MODIS-Terra satellite) were utilized for the evaluations.\nTo derive the new DFDI, an appropriate set of individual standardized drought indices (SDIs) was derived, that are categorized through an advanced clustering method. For two groups in which the clustered SDIs best reflected the water availability and vegetation conditions, the variables are aggregated based on an averaging between the standardized first principal components of three different multivariate methods of PCA, FA and ICA. Then, considering those aggregated indices as well as the classifications of months into dry/wet and active/non-active, the time series of the proposed DFDI is finalized. A comparison, employing the Spearman correlation coefficient, between the proposed index and the traditional data fusion based indices shows a range of correlations from 0.46 to 0.85. The results underline that the proposed index can be more reliable in compare to the previous indices, due to simultaneously relating hydro-meteorological and ecological concepts to define the actual water stress throughout the study area.",

LULCC also modifies aerosol and reactive gas emissions, modifying ozone and methane lifetimes, as well as directly emitting methane and nitrous oxide. Finally, LULCC modifies land albedos. Here we consider multiple land use scenarios within the context of the CESM, and the net impact of LULCC on climate and compare to other anthropogenic forcings.

            "abstract": "The fast coronal mass ejection (CME) from July 23, 2012 raised special attention due to its short propagation time of less than 21hrs from Sun to 1 AU. In-situ data from STEREO-A revealed the arrival of a fast forward shock having a velocity of more than 2200 km/s followed by a magnetic structure with a speed of almost 1900 km/s. We study the evolution of the CME in interplanetary (IP) space using the drag based model to reproduce the short propagation time and high impact speed as derived from in-situ data. We find that the ambient density must have been exceptionally low due to which the drag force is reduced such that the CME experienced almost no deceleration. The density is found to be rather low due to the weak solar activity and was lowered even more by a previous CME event.",

            "abstract": "Olivine is the main constituent mineral in Earth’s upper mantle, and its crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) controls the seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle. Because the relationship between fabric strength and seismic anisotropy shows an exponential form (Ismail and Mainprice, 1998), seismic anisotropy in the upper mantle is expected to have an upperlimit value.\nHansen et al., (2014) demonstrated that a steady-state fabric of olivine is not reached until a very large shear strain (γ> 10) and fabric strength of olivine increases up to the J-index of 10−30 at 0.3 GPa. However, the strain dependency on the fabric strength of olivine needs to be evaluated at asthenospheric upper mantle pressures (2-13 GPa) because the relative activity of each slip system in olivine changes depending on pressure (e.g., Raterron et al., 2007).\nWe experimentally evaluated the strain dependency of fabric strength of olivine in simple-shear geometry under upper mantle conditions (pressures of 1.3−3.8 GPa and temperatures of 1223−1573 K). The CPO of olivine was calculated from in-situ two-dimensional X-ray diffraction patterns. In the calculation, we simulated the optimized CPO which reproduces the two-dimensional X-ray diffraction pattern adopted from the experiments. The steady-state fabric strength of the A-type fabric was achieved within total shear strain of γ = 2. At strains higher than γ = 1, an increase in concentration of the [010] axes mainly contributes to an increase in fabric strength. At strains higher than γ = 2, the magnitude of VSH/VSV (i.e., ratio of horizontally and vertically polarized shear wave velocities) scarcely increased in most of the runs. The VSH/VSV of peridotite having the steady-state A-type olivine fabric coincides with that of recent global one-dimensional models under the assumption of horizontal flow, suggesting that the seismic anisotropy observed in the shallow upper mantle is mostly explained by the development of A-type olivine fabric.",

            "abstract": "Long-term trends are an important aspect of atmospheric variability. Examples are:\nTemperature trends indicating climatic changes\nTrace gas trends like increasing CO2\nStratospheric ozone trends (declining from the 1970s to the late 1990s, possibly increasing since about 2000) due to changes in atmospheric chlorine and bromine loading. \nOften these trends are small compared to other modes of variability. Multilinear regression is the standard method to account for the various modes of variability (e.g. annual cycle, quasi-biennial oscillation, solar cycle, meteorological influences) and to estimate the trends. Using ozone as an example, we will discuss this approach, its uncertainties and their estimation.\nAnother major aspect is availabilty of the necessary long-term data sets. Instrument lifetimes, as well as changes in instruments and methods usually mean that long-term records have to be constructed from multiple and inhomogeneous data sources. Again using ozone, we will discuss uncertainties arising from this, and explain a simple practical approach.\nThe Figure shows, as an example, anomalies (=deviation from average annual cycle) of ozone in the upper stratosphere as measured by various instruments at/near five stations of the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change. Ozone at these altitudes decreases/ increases due to the long-term increase/decrease of effective stratospheric chlorine (ESC, inverted magenta line near the bottom). Ozone is also affected by the quasibiennial oscillation of stratospheric winds near the Equator (black line at the top), and by the 11-year cycle of solar activity (black line near the bottom). The grey range in the background shows results from chemistry climate models. The challenge of trend dectection is to separate the long-term trends (e.g. due to ESC) from the other variations and from the underlying uncertainties.",

            "abstract": "Marine magnetotelluric (MT) and controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) sounding methods were developed in the early 1980's as deep-water academic tools to study the oceanic lithosphere and mantle. Electrical conductivity is a strong function of porosity, temperature, melting, and volatile content, and so marine MT and CSEM data can be used to address a variety of geological questions related to plate tectonics. These include the distribution of melt at mid-ocean ridges, the fate of fluids in subduction zones, and the nature of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. With the advent of deepwater oil and gas drilling in the late 1990's, marine EM methods were embraced by the exploration community, and are now routinely used to assist in exploration and make drilling decisions for wells costing $100M or more. For countries without conventional hydrocarbon resources, gas hydrate offers the potential for energy production, and marine CSEM methods may be the only effective way to explore for and characterize this resource. The use of EM methods to map geothermal, groundwater, and mineral resources also has application in the marine environment. Water and electricity has proved to be a very successful mix!",

            "abstract": "Lidar observations of stratiform mid-level clouds were used to investigate the efficiency of heterogeneous ice nucleation as a function of cloud top temperature. The long-term lidar-based cloud datasets were collected in Germany (51°N,12°E), in southeastern China (22°N,112°E), Cape Verde (15°N,24°W), the Amazon Basin (1°N,60°W), South Africa (34°S,19°E), and southern Chile (53°S,71°W). They thus cover a variety of northern- and southern latitudinal belts from the midlatitudes to the tropics. Observations of the depolarization ratio were used to categorize the observed cloud layers into either ice-free (no depolarized signals observed) or ice-containing clouds (signals depolarized by scattering at ice crystals).\nStrong hemispheric and regional differences were observed in the heterogeneous ice formation efficiency at the different sites, especially in the high-temperature range between -20 and 0 °C. The fraction of ice containing clouds in this temperature range is highest at the northern-latitudinal sites of Germany and southeastern China. Over Leipzig, 50% of all clouds contain ice at -10 °C. In contrast, over southern Chile virtually no ice-containing clouds were observed between -20 and 0 °C. Seasonal differences in the ice-cloud fraction were found over Germany and the Amazon Basin. The observed regional, hemispheric and seasonal contrasts can be explained by differences in the aerosol concentration at cloud level above the different sites. Cloud vertical motion (observed with Doppler lidar), which also determine the microphysical cloud evolution, were found to be similar for all cloud layers.\nFrom combined observations of cloud radar and lidar at Leipzig it was in addition found that ice water contents of below approx. 10-6kg/m³ cannot be detected with lidar. Clouds classified as pure liquid from the lidar-only observations thus could contain ice water contents of below that threshold.\nConsidering the hemispheric differences in heterogeneous freezing efficiencies, the formation of precipitation via the ice phase (cold rain) is possibly affected as well. This may especially be the case for the approximately 50% of precipitation formed at T > -30°C, as it was found for the Leipzig dataset.",

            "abstract": "According to Courtillot et al. (2003), the mantle plume that forms the Réunion hot spot originates from the deepest part of the lower mantle. Based on the isotopic compositions of the lavas, this long-lived plume appears relatively homogeneous during the last 65 My (e.g Fisk et al., 1988), and is believed to correspond to an ubiquitous mantle component common to ocean island basalts (e.g Bosch et al., 2008). Here, we give additional information on the nature of the Réunion mantle plume by studying the chemical composition of silicate melt inclusions trapped within early-formed, primitive olivine crystals (Fo>85%) from the adventive cones of the Piton de la Fournaise Volcano. These cones have emitted distinct magmas from the historical lavas. In particular, we focus on very incompatible trace element ratios, which reflect the long-term characteristics of the basalt sources and do not depend on the age of the source. The results indicate that the trapped melts have very primitive compositions (up to 11.93 wt% MgO) relative to the lavas. They also suggest that the magmas found in the adventive cones originate from a common chemical source, corresponding to either (1) a homogeneous mixed source between different mantle components (HIMU, EM 1, EM 2 and DMM), or (2) a near-primitive less-differentiated mantle source. Some very incompatible trace element ratios (e.g Th/La, Nb/La) display values similar to the primitive mantle ones, giving thus further support for hypothesis (2), as also inferred by Vlastélic et al. (2006) and Schiano et al. (2012). If based on Ce/Pb and Nb/U systematics, Hofmann et al. (1986) argued that the sources of all oceanic basalts (MORB and OIB) have undergone continental crust extraction, we propose an intermediate origin for the Réunion plume, between a primitive-like mantle domain and a depleted one, almost not affected by the recycling processes.",

            "abstract": "In this study we present climatology of vertical ion drift and its relationship with large-scale field-aligned current (LSFAC) in the Northern Hemisphere cusp region using the superposed epoch analysis (SEA) method. The dependence on the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) Bycomponent orientation and the local season is also investigated. The three local seasons of 130 days each are defined as follows: local winter (1 January ± 65 days), combined equinoxes (1 April and 1 October ± 32 days), and local summer (1 July ± 65 days). Our results are based on DMSP (F13 and F15) and CHAMP satellite observations and NASA/GSFC’s OMNI online data set during the years 2001-2005. The time and location of the vertical ion velocity peaks (> 100 m/s for upflow and <-100 m/s for downflow) in the cusp region are used as reference parameters (time and location of the event) for the SEA method.\nEvent number distribution based on the ion velocity peaks shows no significant variations for IMF By component orientation and local season. Corresponding averaged profiles of total magnetic field Bt and IMF components, taken for flow events from both DMSP satellites and all seasons together, also show no differences in temporal variations (only negligible changes in amplitude) between upflow and downflow events. There is no systematic sign change related to flow direction in any of the three IMF components and IMF Bz is always negative. IMF By and Bz components are peaking about half an hour before the event for all considered cases.\nThe main findings of our SEA analysis, can be summarized as follows:\nVertical plasma flow, taken for both DMSP satellites together, shows no dependence on IMF By component orientation. Its amplitude is increasing towards local summer.\nVertical plasma velocity is much higher in winter than during combined equinox or summer. It seems the ion density is low in winter and increases towards local summer.\nThe plasma upflow is generally stronger than the downflow in all given cases.\nLSFAC shows a clear dependence on IMF By component orientation and local season. Amplitude of LSFAC is also increasing towards local summer.\nLSFAC shows an IMF By dependent regular pattern for upflow cases. Conversely, there are no regular patterns for downflow cases in all seasons and both IMF By signs. The peak in upward flow occurs at latitudes of the Region 1 FACs.",

            "abstract": "When a storm event pushes water up and over a coastal barrier, cross-shore flow transports sediment from the barrier face to the back-barrier environment. This natural physical process is called \"overwash\", and \"washover\" is the sedimentary deposit it forms. Overwash and washover support critical coastal habitats, and enable barriers to maintain their height and width relative to rising sea level. On developed barrier coasts, overwash constitutes a natural hazard, which sea-level rise will exacerbate. Overwash is also a prerequisite for barrier breaching and coastal flooding. Predicting occurrence and characteristics of overwash and washover has significant societal value.\nHazard models typically assume that pre-storm barrier morphology determines how the barrier changes during a storm. However, classic work has documented the absence of a relationship between pre/post-storm topography in some cases, and has also identified rhythmic patterns in washover alongshore. Previous explanations for these spatial patterns have looked to forcing templates, forms that get imprinted in the barrier shape. An alternative explanation is that washover patterns self-organize, emerging from feedbacks between water flow and sediment transport. Self-organization and forcing templates are often framed as mutually exclusive, but patterns likely form across a continuum of conditions. Here, I use data from a new physical experiment to suggest that spatial patterns in washover can self-organize within the limit of a forcing template of some critical \"strength\", beyond which pre/post-storm morphologies are highly correlated.\nQuantifying spatial patterns in washover deposits opens exciting questions regarding coastal morphodynamic response to storms. Measurement of relative template strength over extended spatial (and temporal) scales has the potential to improve hazard assessment and prediction, particularly where template strength is low and self-organization dominates barrier change.",

            "abstract": "In the archetypal \"tragedy of the commons\" narrative, local farmers pasture their cows on the town common. Soon the common becomes crowded with cows, who graze it bare, and the arrangement of open access to a shared resource ultimately fails. The \"tragedy\" involves social and physical processes, but the denouement depends on who is telling the story. An economist might argue that the system collapses because each farmer always has a rational incentive to graze one more cow. An ecologist might remark that the rate of grass growth is an inherent control on the common's carrying capacity. And a geomorphologist might point out that processes of soil degradation almost always outstrip processes of soil production.\nInterdisciplinary research into human–environmental systems still tends to favor disciplinary vantages. In the context of Anthropocene grand challenges – including fundamental insight into dynamics of landscape resilience, and what the dominance of human activities means for processes of change and evolution on the Earth's surface – two disciplines in particular have more to talk about than they might think. Here, I use three examples – (1) beach nourishment, (2) upstream/downstream fluvial asymmetry, and (3) current and historical \"land grabbing\" – to illustrate a range of interconnections between physical Earth-surface science and common-pool resource economics. In many systems, decision-making and social complexity exert stronger controls on landscape expression than do physical geomorphological processes. Conversely, human–environmental research keeps encountering multi-scale, emergent problems of resource use made 'common-pool' by water, nutrient and sediment transport dynamics. Just as Earth-surface research can benefit from decades of work on common-pool resource systems, quantitative Earth-surface science can make essential contributions to efforts addressing complex problems in environmental sustainability.",

Based on multichannel and chirp seismic data, temperature profiles, and high-resolution bathymetric data collected during several oceanographic expeditions, the present study investigates factors controlling mud volcano morphology, the geometry of feeder channels, and the origin of emitted fluids (Dupré et al. 2014). The active Cheops and Chephren mud volcanoes are 1,500 m wide with subcircular craters at their summits, about 250 m in diameter, generally a few tens of metres deep, and filled with methane-rich muddy brines with temperatures reaching 42 °C and 57 °C respectively. Deployments of CTDs and corers with attached temperature sensors tracked these warm temperatures down to almost 0.5 km depth below the brine lake surface at the Cheops mud volcano, in a feeder channel probably only a few tens of metres wide. Thermogenic processes involve the dissolution of Messinian evaporites by warm fluids likely sourced even deeper, i.e. 1.7 and 2.6 km below the seabed at the Cheops and Chephren MVs respectively, and which ascend along listric faults. Seepage activity appears broadly persistent since the initiation of mud volcanism in the Early Pliocene, possibly accompanied by lateral migration of feeder channels.",

However, non-thermal effects might perturb this idealized linear seismic-thermal mapping. Here we use a probabilistic tomography model to isolate the thermal part of the seismic anomaly in order to impose a more realistic core-mantle boundary heat flux pattern on the outer boundary of numerical dynamo simulations. We demonstrate that on time-average these dynamo models have more low-latitude convective and magnetic activity than corresponding models with conventional tomographic heat flux. In addition, the low-latitude magnetic flux and kinetic energy contributions are more time-dependent in the dynamo models with a probabilistic tomography heat flux, and thus may recover the observed latitudinal distribution of geomagnetic flux on the core-mantle boundary, which we propose as a morphological criterion for Earth-like dynamo models.",

It is also a question of interest in understanding earthquakes source, and recently the hydraulic behavior of clay faults under a potential reactivation around nuclear underground depository sites. Fault and fractures dynamics studies face two key problems (1) the up-scaling of laboratory determined properties and constitutive laws to the reservoir scale which is not straightforward when considering faults and fractures heterogeneities, (2) the difficulties to control both the induced seismicity and the stimulated zone geometry when a fault is reactivated. Using instruments dedicated to measuring coupled pore pressures and deformations downhole, we conducted field academic experiments to characterize fractures and fault zones hydromechanical properties as a function of their multi-scale architecture, and to monitor their dynamic behavior during the earthquake nucleation process. We show experiments on reservoir or cover rocks analogues in underground research laboratories where experimental conditions can be optimized. Key result of these experiments is to highlight how important the aseismic fault activation is compared to the induced seismicity. We show that about 80% of the fault kinematic moment is aseismic and discuss the complex associated fault friction coefficient variations. We identify that the slip stability and the slip velocity are mainly controlled by the rate of the permeability/porosity increase, and discuss the conditions for slip nucleation leading to seismic instability.",

We provide observational evidence that energy diffusion is negligible. The main dynamic processes, then, are radial diffusion and elastic pitch angle scattering. We use a coordinate system in which these two modes of diffusion are separable. Then we integrate over pitch angle to obtain a field line content whose dynamics consist of radial diffusion and loss to the atmosphere. We estimate the loss timescale from periods of exponential decay in the time series. We then estimate the radial diffusion coefficient from the temporal and radial variation of the field line content. We show that our diffusion coefficients agree well with previously determined values. Our coefficients are consistent with diffusion by electrostatic impulses, whereas outer zone radial diffusion is thought to be dominated by electromagnetic fluctuations.",

Here we present a study of Os-Sr-Mg isotopes on the Oligocene-Miocene ultrapotassic rocks aimed at better understanding geochemical evolution of mantle lithosphere beneath southern Tibet. Isotopic data confirm that ultrapotassic rocks in southern Tibet are of mantle origin, but underwent crustal contamination as evidenced by variably high 187Os/188Os that obviously deviates from normal mantle reservoir. Still some samples with mantle-like 187Os/188Os exhibit variably lower δ26Mg than mantle and crustal lithologies, suggesting that the isotopically light Mg may not be the result of crustal contamination but retain specific fingerprint of carbonate-related metasomatism in mantle sources. Mantle carbonatite metasomatism is also manifested by the inverse δ26Mg-87Sr/86Sr correlation, as well as the relative depletion of high field strength elements and the enrichment of CaO in ultrapotassic rocks. The positive co-variation between δ26Mg and Hf/Sm in low-187Os/188Os ultrapotassic rocks further highlights the potential of recycled dolomites to change mantle Mg isotopic compositions. The correlated spatial variations of δ26Mg and Hf/Sm indicate that the carbonatitic metasomatism during the northward subduction of the Neo-Tethyan slab may have laid the framework for generating postcollisional ultrapotassic rocks in southern Tibet.",

            "abstract": "Distributions of REE between mantle minerals depend on temperature, pressure and mineral compositions, and can be used as thermobarometers. We have developed a REE-in-two-pyroxene thermometer, a REE-in-garnet-clinopyroxene thermobarometer, and a REE-in-plagioclase-augite thermometer for ultramafic and mafic rocks. These trace element based two-mineral thermobarometers are built on parameterized lattice strain models for mineral-melt REE partitioning that we independently calibrated using published data from mineral-melt partitioning experiments. The physical meanings of calculated temperatures and pressures can be understood in terms of the average closure temperatures and closure pressures of REE in cooling bi-mineralic systems. Because trivalent REE diffuse slower than divalent Ca-Fe-Mg in minerals, the REE-based thermobarometers may record early thermal event(s), whereas the major element based thermometers may record more recent thermal events in closed systems that experienced cooling. A number of geological and geodynamic processes can result in decreases in temperature and possibly pressure over time: mantle upwelling beneath mid-ocean ridge spreading centers or in response to lower crust delamination, exhumation, heat loss to country rock from crustal magma chambers. For shallow level intrusive or extrusive mafic rocks, temperatures derived from the REE-in-plagioclase-augite thermometer may correspond to plagioclase saturation temperature. Hence application of REE- and Ca-Fe-Mg based thermobarometers to the same samples can shed new insight into the thermal history of mafic and ultramafic rocks.\nInitial applications of the REE-in-two-mineral thermobarometers to Earth and planetary samples have lead to a number of interesting observations which we will summarize in this presentation. However, care and caution must be exercised when processing and interpreting data from REE-in-two-mineral thermobarometers. Common issues include inaccuracies in REE data, deviation of LREE data from a linear regression line, rotation in the inversion diagram, and abnormally high temperature and/or low pressure. We will address these common problems through examples from actual samples and numerical simulations.",

            "abstract": "Over the coming century, climate change has the potential to impact infrastructure in many different ways, particularly in population-dense areas that depend on transportation and built environments. Many of these impacts may occur via changes in the frequency and magnitude of extremes: high and low temperature, heat waves, precipitation, coastal flooding, and storm events.\nHaving a better idea of how the climate might change locally, both within the near future as well as toward the end of the century, can give city planners and engineers guidance when designing new structures and when repairing and fortifying existing components of buildings, bridges, highways, sewers, ports, etc. However, the type of event and the amount of damages that may be incurred are often highly specific to a given location.\nOver the last 10 years, we have worked with a broad range of cities, states, non-profit organizations, and federal agencies to integrate climate projections into ongoing resiliency, sustainability, and management processes. Drawing on that experience, we describe the broad steps in assimilating climate information into existing decision-making frameworks relevant to most applications, as well as highlighting many of the unique aspects of these analyses using examples from our most recent work with three very different cities – Austin TX, Boulder CO and Washington DC. From initial conversations with local experts to identify relevant thresholds to final integration of projected changes into the planning processes of these cities, these case studies highlight the utility of including future climate projections into infrastructure planning, the challenges to doing so, and the over-arching importance of communication and interaction between infrastructure experts, engineers, and scientists.",

            "abstract": "Mixing between convective clouds and its environment, usually parameterized in terms of entrainment and detrainment, are among the most important processes that determine the strength of the climate model sensitivity. This notion has led to a renaissance of research in exploring the mechanisms of these mixing processes and, as a result, to a wide range of seemingly different parameterized formulations. In this study we are aiming to synthesize these results as to offer a solid framework for use in parameterized formulations of convection.\nDetailed LES analyses in which clouds are subsampled according to their size show that entrainment rates are inversely proportional to the typical cloud radius, in accordance with original entraining plume models. These results can be shown analytically to be consistent with entrainment rate formulations of cloud ensembles that decrease inversely proportional with height, by making only mild assumptions on the shape of the associated cloud size distribution. In addition there are additional dependencies of the entrainment rates on the environmental thermodynamics such as the relative humidity and stability but these are of second order.\nIn contrast detrainment rates do depend to first order on the environmental thermodynamics such as relative humidity and stability. This can be understood by realizing that i) the details of the cloud size distribution do depend on these environmental factors and ii) that detrainment rates have a much stronger dependency on the shape of the cloud size distribution than entrainment rates.",

            "abstract": "Paleointensity methods have seen a large improvement in the 21th century. This included optimizing classic Thellier-style protocols along with establishing stringent sets of quality criteria, developing microwave excitation as an alternative to thermal treatment, selecting sample material that contains the most suitable remanence carriers (i.e. single domain magnetic particles), calibrating non-heating paleointensity methods, and the introduction of the multispecimen paleointensity (MSP) protocol. An MSP experiment is carried out at one specific temperature selected to avoid thermochemical alteration; a series of specimens is heated and cooled in various applied furnace fields oriented parallel to the specimen’s NRM. The furnace field value at which no change in NRM occurs is the paleofield. While the rationale of the MSP approach is surprisingly straightforward, some of the original claims (Dekkers and Böhnel, 2006) are by now shown to be untenable. This pertains to the claimed domain state independence in the original MSP method, although the Fabian and Leonhardt (2010) extended protocol largely corrects for domain state effects.\nHere we describe the optimal workflow for MSP experiments derived from our collection of historic flows from four volcanic edifices: Mt. Etna, Hawaii, the Canary Islands, and the Azores. By comparing the experimental outcome derived from historic flows with known paleointensities we found that technically acceptable experiments may yield overestimates, correct determinations, as well as underestimates of the paleofield. The so-called “ARM test” (de Groot et al., 2012) can distinguish between those three options. Based on TRM and ARM being analogues, this test compares ARM acquisition curves of sister samples before and after heating to the MSP experiment temperature. Simulated paleointensity experiments following this workflow consistently deliver the correct answer (Monster et al., submitted).",

            "abstract": "Frozen seawater is a composite material with a sponge-like structure. The framework of the structure is comprised of pure ice, and within the pores exists a concentrated seawater brine. When the temperature is reduced, the volume of this residual brine decreases, whilst its salinity increases. As a result of the paired changes to temperature and salinity, the brine eventually becomes supersaturated with respect to a mineral, resulting in the precipitation of microscopic crystals throughout the ice structure. Due to experimental constraints, the current understanding about the formation of these minerals relies on the analysis of the residual brine, rather than the mineral phase. Here, in-situ synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction was used to assess the dynamics that occur between ice, brine and mineral phases within frozen seawater brines that were subjected to cooling and warming at sub-zero temperatures. The method was able to detect crystalline phases of ice, mirabilite (Na2SO4.10H2O) and hydrohalite (NaCl.2H2O). Results illustrate a highly dynamic geochemical environment where ice-brine-mineral interactions tend towards an equilibrium crystallisation process, which supports the process of seawater freezing that is described by the Gitterman Pathway and FREZCHEM model. This study highlights the power of in-situ synchrotron techniques in observing the mineralogical dynamics of inaccessible environmental systems.",

            "abstract": "The current model inter-comparison studies highlight the difference in projections between crop models when they are applied to warmer climates, but these studies do not provide results on how the accuracy of the models would change in these projections because the adequate observations under largely diverse growing season temperature (GST) are often unavailable. Here, we investigate the potential changes in the accuracy of rice phenology models when these models were applied to a significantly warmer climate. We collected phenology data from 775 trials with 19 cultivars in 5 Asian countries (China, India, Philippines, Bangladesh and Thailand). Each cultivar encompasses the phenology observations under diverse GST regimes. For a given rice cultivar in different trials, the GST difference reaches 2.2 to 8.2°C, which allows us to calibrate the models under lower GST and validate under higher GST (i.e., warmer climates). Four common phenology models representing major algorithms on simulations of rice phenology, and three model calibration experiments were conducted. The results suggest that the bilinear and beta models resulted in gradually increasing phenology bias (Figure) and double yield bias per percent increase in phenology bias, whereas the growing-degree-day (GDD) and exponential models maintained a comparatively constant bias when applied in warmer climates (Figure). Moreover, the bias of phenology estimated by the bilinear and beta models did not reduce with increase in GST when all data were used to calibrate models. These suggest that variations in phenology bias are primarily attributed to intrinsic properties of the respective phenology model rather than on the calibration dataset. Therefore we conclude that using the GDD and exponential models has more chances of predicting rice phenology correctly and thus, production under warmer climates, and result in effective agricultural strategic adaptation to and mitigation of climate change.\n ",

            "abstract": "North Inlet is a pristine estuary within a small coastal watershed with minimal surface water input or human impact. North Inlet exchanges its water with the coastal ocean with a turnover time of about 0.5 per day. Its marshes are dominated by the grass Spartina alterniflora. Growth rates of Spartina have been measured monthly on permanent plots in North Inlet since 1984, and concentrations of porewater ammonium and phosphate, and sulfide have been measured monthly over depth (10-100 cm) since 1994. The salt marsh shows pronounced seasonal biogeochemical cycles that are highly correlated. Ammonium, phosphate and sulfide concentrations all peak in August-October and are minimal during February-April. Mean monthly ammonium concentration varies between 42 and 87 μM, phosphate between 3 and 18 μM, and sulfide between 8 and 87 μM. Monthly growth rates of Spartina range from 91 to 111 g dry weight m-2 between April and September. The integrated total aboveground production is 25 mol C m-2 yr-1. The inventories of N and P in porewater are small fractions of what is required to support primary production. Primary production is N-limited and this is consistent with the N:P ratio declining from 14 during early spring to 5 in late summer. There are losses, especially of N, from drainage, denitrification, and export of organic production. These have to be compensated by gains from N fixation, most likely from coupled sulfate reduction. There is also a coupling between sulfide, iron, and phosphorous that appears to conserve P during the winter and generate soluble P during the active growing season. These couplings coordinate the biogeochemical cycles, and this extends to the tidal creeks that are dominated by benthic sources of nutrients.",

In the nearly three years that the spacecraft has been in interstellar space, three notable particle and field disturbances have been observed, each apparently associated with a shock wave propagating outward from the Sun. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the third and most impressive of these disturbances, with brief comparisons to the two previous events, both of which have been previously reported. The shock responsible for the third event was first detected on 2014 February 17 by the onset of narrowband radio emissions from the approaching shock, followed on 2014 May 13 by the abrupt appearance of intense electron plasma oscillations generated by electrons streaming outward ahead of the shock. Finally, the shock arrived on 2014 August 25, as indicated by a jump in the magnetic field strength and the plasma density. Various disturbances in the intensity and anisotropy of galactic cosmic rays were also observed ahead of the shock, some of which are believed to be caused by the reflection and acceleration of cosmic rays by the magnetic field jump at the shock, and/or by interactions with upstream plasma waves. Comparisons to the two previous weaker events show somewhat similar precursor effects, although differing in certain details. Many of these effects are very similar to those observed in the region called the \"foreshock\" that occurs upstream of planetary bow shocks, only on a vastly larger spatial scale.",

            "abstract": "Lakes were abundant and active on early Mars for 100s millions of years. As global climate change prevented liquid water from remaining stable at the surface, they left behind key evidence of their past existence and duration in the landscape morphology, mineralogy, composition, and topography. As significant markers of environmental change, they have become critical exploration targets for our understanding of Mars past habitability potential, and the preservation potential of their sediments make them high-priority candidate landing sites for the upcoming NASA and ESA rover missions that will search for evidence of biosignatures on early Mars.\nIdentifying and caching the most valuable samples with these missions will require to both recognize these signatures, the geological and environmental processes that may have modified them through time, the spatiotemporal constraints these processes could have imposed on a biogeological record, and their significance for biosignatures and their preservation potential.\nTo help us understand where, what, and how to search on Mars, the Chilean Atacama desert, Altiplano, and the High Andes have provided robust analog study sites over the past 20 years. Exposed to the strongest solar irradiance measured so far on our planet, from sea level up to 6,000 m elevation, and from glacial regions to some of the most arid conditions on Earth, these unique sites allow us to perform a space-for-time substitution experiments that shows the likely evolution of martian lake habitats over time from the early Noachian to the Hesperian. The observed changes provide critical clues about plausible scenarios for the evolution of habitability and life potential. They also give us pointers on how increased environmental extremes linked to a thinning unstable atmosphere, increasing UV, desiccation, and geological and climate changes, may have impacted biodiversity at local and global scale.",

Aerosol deposition on snow is amongst the different causes of glacier retreat around the world as well as the reduction of snow albedo. We have observed a long range transport of dust and pollution aerosols from China to the U.S. In this paper we compared summer and winter seasons glacier changes between 2000 and 2013, and how the dust aerosol change over this 13 years. Multiple images, acquired from Landsat-5 TM, Landsat-7 ETM+ and Landsat-8 OLI were used in the study. The change detection analysis was employed to identify the glacier changes for two seasons. The results suggest that the glacier decreased dramatically over 13 years in both seasons.",

            "abstract": "As is well known a sufficient density of free electrons and strong electric fields are the basic requirements to start any electrical discharge. In the context of thunderstorm discharges it has become clear that in addition droplets and or ice particles are required to enhance the electric field to values above breakdown. In our recent study [1] we have shown that these three ingredients have to interplay to allow for lightning inception, triggered by an extensive air shower event. The extensive air showers are a very stochastic natural phenomenon, creating highly coherent sub-nanosecond enhancements of the atmospheric electron density.\nPredicting these electron density enhancements accurately one has to take the uncertainty of the input variables into account. For this study we use the initial energy, inclination and altitude of first interaction, which will influence the evolution of the shower significantly. To this end, we use the stochastic collocation method, [2] to post-process our detailed Monte Carlo extensive air shower simulations, done with the CORSIKA [3] software package, which provides an efficient and elegant way to determine the distribution of the atmospheric electron density enhancements.\n[1] Dubinova, A., Rutjes, C., Ebert, E., Buitink, S., Scholten, O., and Trinh, G.

            "abstract": "Methane hydrates hold a vast amount of methane globally, and have huge energy potential. Methane hydrates in gas-rich environments are the most promising production targets. We develop a one-dimensional analytical solution based on the method of characteristics to explore hydrate formation in such environments (Figure 1). Our solution shows that hydrate saturation is constant with time and space in a homogeneous system. Hydrate saturation is controlled by the initial thermodynamic condition of the system, and changed by the gas fractional flow. Hydrate saturation increases with the initial distance from the hydrate phase boundary. Different gas fractional flows behind the hydrate solidification front lead to different gas saturations at the hydrate solidification front. The higher the gas saturation at the front, the less the volume available to be filled by hydrate, and hence the lower the hydrate saturation. The gas fractional flow depends on the relative permeability curves, and the forces that drive the flow. Viscous forces (the drive for flow induced from liquid pressure gradient) dominate the flow, and hydrate saturation is independent on the gas supply rates and the flow directions at high gas supply rates. Hydrate saturation can be estimated as one minus the ratio of the initial to equilibrium salinity. Gravity forces (the drive for flow induced from the gravity) dominate the flow, and hydrate saturation depends on the flow rates and the flow directions at low gas supply rates. Hydrate saturation is highest for upward flow, and lowest for downward flow. Hydrate saturation decreases with the flow rate for upward flow, and increases with the flow rate for downward flow. This analytical solution illuminates how hydrate is formed by gas (methane, CO2, ethane, propane) flowing into brine-saturated sediments at both the laboratory and geological scales (Figure 1). It provides an approach to generalize the understanding of hydrate solidification in gas-rich environments, although complicated numerical models have been developed previously. Examples of gas expulsion into hydrate stability zones and the associated hydrate formation in both laboratory and geological scales, and CO2 sequestration into CO2-hydrates near the seafloor and under the permafrost will be presented.",

The precise monitoring data of LST can provide crucial support for further ecological researches such as the environment change and urban heat island. The Wireless Sensing Network (WSN) is a kind of modern information technology which integrates sensor technology, automatic control technology with data network transmission, storage, processing and analysis technology. As a new kind of data collection method, WSN is innovatively applied to monitor regional LST in different land cover types of city in this study. The LST data with high temporal resolution is obtained from temperature sensors of WSN. The land cover types of city are extracted from WorldView-II image with high resolution. The Southeast University Wuxi Branch campus and its surroundings which covers 2 km2 is chosen as the study area in Wuxi city, Jiangsu province, China. WSN is established to continuously monitor LST in real-time for one week. Then, the heterogeneous pattern of LST is investigated at a fine spatial and temporal scale based on different land cover types. The result shows LST of streets is higher than LST of campus in the daytime, but lower than LST of campus at night. The spatial heterogeneity of LST in the campus is not significant. This is because the number of vehicle was larger in the daytime than that at night, while the population of campus in day and night almost having little change. Notably, the influence of plant activities (e.g. photosynthesis and respiration) on LST can be detected by WSN. This study is a new attempt to monitor regional environment of city by WSN technology. Moreover, compared to traditional methods, WSN technology can improve the detection of LST with finer temporal and spatial resolution.",

This study investigates the use of global nighttime environmental products as derived from the Suomi-NPP satellite’s Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) to identify and track the location and timing of regional conflicts in the Middle East as reflected in changes to the region’s energy infrastructure. The study focuses on a 43-month period (c. Jan 2012 – Aug 2015) over major urban centers in Iraq, Syria, Egypt, and Lebanon. The new daily dynamic products captured a series of striking downturns in energy service supply and demand that occurred in 2012 in the Syrian cities of Damascus (-50%) and Aleppo (-94%) corresponding to the onset of major military confrontations (The Battle of Aleppo on 7/15/2012 and The Damascus Bombing on 7/23/2012, respectively). Iraqi cities recently captured by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) (e.g. Mosul, Tikrit, Tal Afor, Ramadi), also showed marked average decreases in energy service provision (-84% since 4/1/2014) compared to their unoccupied counterparts (e.g., Baghdad and Sulaimaniya at +6%). A seasonal trend decomposition analysis is used to disentangle climactic, social, and political factors affecting the VIIRS time-series, distinguishing between energy patterns associated with conflict and those associated with cultural festivals, load shedding, seasonal weather, and socioeconomic factors.",

The T96 encounter constitutes the only event of the Cassini era during which Titan was exposed to the supersonic solar wind upstream of Saturn’s bow shock. Cassini plasma and magnetic field observations revealed a Venus/Mars-like plasma interaction, including the formation of a bow shock and a magnetic barrier upstream of Titan. However, it has also been suggested that the ambient solar wind conditions were not stationary at the time of the T96 encounter: around closest approach Cassini probably passed through a region of fossilized magnetic fields, arising from Titan’s interaction with a previously encountered, high-pressure solar wind regime. To substantiate this hypothesis, we carry out simulation runs for different ram pressures of the incident solar wind. The model reveals the interaction region to be dominated by kinetic effects, such as a splitting of the bow shock due to large ion gyroradii (shocklets). The simulation results are compared against Cassini magnetic field data from T96.",

            "abstract": "The one-way coupling between soil water availability and surface energy fluxes between the land surface and the boundary layer represents a critical dynamic component of the integrated bedrock-to-boundary layer system. Recent cross-comparisons between long-term ground-based observations of surface soil moisture (SM) and evapotranspiration (ET) have suggested that land surface models generally overestimate the strength of this one-way coupling. However, these assessments neglect the impact of random error in ground-based SM and ET measurements. Such independent error will tend to spuriously degrade their sampled cross-correlation. Therefore, the apparent over-coupling of LSMs may be due to independent errors in SM and ET observations and not reflective of a systematic shortcoming in LSMs.\nIn order to examine this issue in greater detail, we propose a new triple collocation-based (TC) technique to estimate the true Spearman rank correlation coefficient between daily surface soil moisture and ET. Specifically, we apply a TC-based technique to concurrent SM and ET datasets obtained from: 1) an LSM, 2) ground-based observations, and 3) remotely sensing. The approach yields a Spearman rank correlation estimate that is unbiased in the presence of (potentially-significant) random error in any member of the SM and ET triplet. As such, the approach provides a highly-relevant example of exploiting long-term remote sensing and in situ datasets to improve process-level understanding within the bedrock-to-boundary layer system.\nApplication of the technique to North American Land Data Assimilation System-2 (NLDAS-2) models over Ameriflux sites between 2002 and 2014 (utilizing satellite-based ALEXI ET and AMSR-E/LPRM surface soil moisture products) suggests that the apparent over-coupling of LSM soil moisture/ET predictions at Ameriflux sites can largely be attributed to independent errors in ground-based soil moisture and ET observations at each site. Generally, NLDAS-2 models tend to either accurately represent (or even slightly under-predict) the true one-way SM/ET coupling strength within arid and semi-arid regions. The consequences of this result for the coupled modeling of the bedrock-to-boundary layer system will be discussed.",

However, the foredune line is rarely uniform and can exhibit considerable variation in height and width alongshore at a range of length scales ranging from tens of meters to several kilometers. LiDAR data from Santa Rosa Island in northwest Florida, Padre Island, Texas and Assateague Island, Maryland are used to explore how the dune morphology varies alongshore and how this variability is altered by storms and post-storm recovery. While the alongshore variation in dune height can be approximated by a power law, there are scale-dependent variations in the dune that exhibit different responses to storm erosion and post-storm recovery. This suggests that the alongshore variation in dune morphology reflects the history of storm impact and recovery, and that changes in the variance magnitude through time may provide insight into whether the island will be resilient as it transgresses with rising sea level. The difference in variance magnitude at large spatial scales is associated with the framework geology unique to each island and a dominant control on island response to sea level rise.",

All models simulated well the observed seasonal cycle of BC concentrations in the high Canadian Arctic region, however, most models (except CanAM) underestimate the total concentrations. Transport of BC from lower latitudes is the major source for the Arctic region where emissions are small. The models produce similar seasonal cycle of BC transport towards the Arctic with maximum transport in July. However, substantial differences were found among the models in simulating BC burdens and vertical distributions with some models producing very week seasonal cycle while others producing stronger seasonality. The annual mean BC residence times in models also differs markedly with CanAM having the shortest residence times followed by SMHI-MATCH, CESM and NorESM. There are substantial differences among the models in simulating the relative role of wet and dry deposition rates which is one of the major factors causing variations in the seasonality of BC burdens in the models. Similarly, significant differences in wet deposition efficiencies among the models exist and are the leading cause of differences in simulated BC burdens. To further explore these processes, we performed several sensitivity tests in CanAM and CESM. Overall, the results indicate that scavenging of BC in convective clouds as compared to simulations without convective BC scavenging substantially increases the overall efficiency of BC wet deposition which leads to low BC burdens and a more pronounced seasonal cycle.",

We present electric field, magnetic field, electron density, electron temperature, and ion temperature measurements from early in the Swarm mission (December 2013). This data set is of particular interest as the pearls-on-a-string orientation of the satellites provide multiple measurements of similar volumes of space taken minutes apart, providing confidence in measurement integrity and reducing the spatio-temporal ambiguity inherent to in-situ measurements. Furthermore, the measurement period is characterized by low geomagnetic activity which results in consistent measurement conditions orbit to orbit.\nThe December 2013 ionospheric Swarm measurements combined with ground-based optical and magnetic measurements provide a consistent picture of ionospheric and field-aligned currents near midnight during quiet geomagnetic conditions. Relationships between large-scale field aligned currents, auroral precipitation, narrow regions of enhanced electric fields, the electrojets, and the open-closed field line boundary have all been studied pairwise previously. We present a synthesis interpretation of the set of measurements to arrive at a consistent picture of the auroral current structure near midnight.\nThis work is supported by a grant from the Canadian Space Agency.",

Here we extend a spherical harmonic reconstruction of Enceladus’ shape to order 16 by combining Cassini limb profile data with the positions of a large, globally distributed collection of surface control points. We have discovered an aligned arrangement of deep topographic lows that define a circumglobal valley lying along a non-equatorial great circle across Enceladus' surface. In addition, we have found two antipodal basins located about 90 degrees from the great circle. We argue that these structures are evidence of True Polar Wander of an angle 75 to 90 degrees, where the great circle and the antipodal regions are remnants of old equator and poles, respectively.\nModeling of heat transport in Enceladus’ sub-surface ocean suggests that heat flux along the ice-ocean interface is strongest and weakest at high and low latitudes, respectively. The resulting basal melt/freeze distribution may produce latitudinal variations in ice shell thickness and density that can create the topographic depressions apparent at the surface through isostatic adjustment. Our hypothesis also agrees well with the surface geological features visible in Cassini images.",

Snow cover plays major roles in the energy balance of Arctic sea ice and also required to understand the present condition and future behavior of first-year ice (FYI). Microwave remote sensing provides the most effective means to acquire near-real time thermodynamic information about snow cover on smooth FYI. Microwave interaction with snow-covered sea ice is a function of both snow and ice electro-thermo-physical properties such as shape, size and orientation of scatterers, surface roughness, complex dielectric constant as a function primarily of brine volume, and brine volume as a function of temperature, salinity and density; as well as microwave parameters such as incidence angle, polarization and wavelength. Fluctuations in snow cover thermodynamics affect microwave propagation, attenuation, and scattering through the influence that brine volume exerts on interfacial and volume characteristics of snow and ice layers. Previous studies exhibit reduced penetration depth and inaccurate snow thickness estimates, using a single-frequency approach (C-band), from highly saline snow covers. We present a case study based on an observational (Ku-, X- and C-band surface-based fully-polarimetric microwave scatterometer system) and theoretical multi-frequency approach (using first-order microwave scattering and penetration depth models), to understand the sensitivity of varying snow thermodynamics on microwave scattering and penetration. The study site is a 14cm highly saline snow cover over smooth FYI, near Resolute Bay, Nunavut, Canada (Figure 1), with in-situ snow property measurements acquired from 18th to 20th May 2012, when snow layer temperatures were found to be fluctuating (Figure 2). Preliminary results show variations in observed Ku-, X- and C-band VV backscatter (Figure 3) and penetration (Figure 5) for warm (18th and 20th May) and cold (19th May) snow cases, similar to the modeled VV backscatter (Figure 4). Based on our initial observations, the thermal dependence of multi-frequency microwave backscatter over highly saline snow on FYI shows promise to provide an initial foundation to understand their microwave interactions necessary for snow thickness estimation on FYI.",

            "abstract": "Opaline silica outcrops and soil identified by the Spirit rover adjacent to “Home Plate” in Gusev crater are associated with a suite of geologic features that demonstrates that they are the products of a volcanic hydrothermal system, the first such example verified on Mars [1]. Fumarolic acid-sulfate leaching of basaltic precursor materials was suggested as the origin of the opaline silica, based largely on geochemical arguments. A more complete analysis by Ruff et al. [2] included stratigraphic and textural observations of the outcrops to advance the hypothesis of a hot spring and/or geyser-related origin under alkaline-neutral conditions; acid-sulfate leaching appears much less tenable. But the nodular expression of many of the outcrops and sub-cm-scale “digitate protrusions” they contain remained enigmatic, precluding a complete explanation for the silica. Now, new observations of silica deposits produced in small discharge channels from hot springs and geysers in a high elevation geothermal field known as El Tatio in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile reveal remarkably similar features, including infrared spectral characteristics and what we describe here as micro-digitate silica structures. We hypothesize that these structures at El Tatio arise through microbial mediation of silica precipitation, i.e., that they are microstromatolites and that they provide favorable environments for the capture and preservation of microbial biosignatures. Similar features have been identified among hot spring silica deposits in Yellowstone National Park, the Taupo Volcanic Zone of New Zealand, and Iceland [e.g., 3; 4; 5]. Our ongoing field and lab studies are intended provide a robust assessment of the biogenicity of the micro-digitate silica structures and other aspects of El Tatio silica sinter deposits and test their viability as direct analogs to similar features found among the Home Plate silica deposits on Mars.\n[1] Squyres, S.

Differences in solar wind drivers lead to different ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) responses in time, magnitude, and to different pre-conditioning. The purpose of our study is to establish a correspondence between interplanetary transient structures (parts of a CME or a high-speed-stream) and dynamics of IT parameters over the course of a geomagnetic storm. Detailed analysis will be presented for the St. Patrick’s Day storm of 2015. We introduce global metrics of daytime and dusktime average ionospheric response of VTEC estimates from over ~2000 GPS ground stations distributed globally. Nitric oxide and carbon dioxide cooling radiation fluxes measured by TIMED/SABER instrument are calculated in several latitudinal bins throughout the storm phases. In addition, GUVI observations of the dynamical response of the thermosphere (NO and O/N2) are compared. SSUSI observations of the equatorial ionosphere, particularly the magnitude and separation of the equatorial arcs are considered. In our analysis, metrics are inter-compared to get better understanding of the self-consistent IT response to solar wind driving.",

After the storm, the plasmasphere refills due to an upward flow of plasma from the ionosphere that is initially supersonic (H+). The current numerical models of plasmasphere refilling are typically based on a numerical solution of the ion (H+, O+, He+) and electron continuity, momentum, and energy equations. The equations are solved along closed magnetic field lines that connect conjugate ionospheres, with allowance for cross-B plasma drift during storms. Both diffusion and hydrodynamic approximations have been adopted. The diffusion approximation neglects the nonlinear initial term in the momentum equations, so this approximation is not rigorously valid for early refilling times (~ day). At high altitudes, the plasma becomes collisionless and there are different temperatures parallel and perpendicular to B (not included in current models). Also, single-stream and multi-stream (separate ion streams from the conjugate ionospheres) formulations have been adopted, and the refilling features are different. These and other problems with the current plasmasphere refilling models will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Drought, fire and insects are major disturbances in the western US, and conditions are expected to get warmer and drier in the future. We combine multi-scale observations and modeling with CLM4.5 to examine the effects of these disturbances on forests in the western US. We modified the Community Land Model, CLM4.5, to improve simulated drought-related mortality in forests, and prediction of insect outbreaks under future climate conditions. We examined differences in plant traits that represent species variation in sensitivity to drought, and redefined plant groupings in PFTs. Plant traits, including sapwood area: leaf area ratio and stemwood density were strongly correlated with water availability during the ecohydrologic year. Our database of co-located observations of traits for 30 tree species was used to produce parameterization of the model by species groupings according to similar traits. Burn area predicted by the new fire model in CLM4.5 compares well with recent years of GFED data, but has a positive bias compared with Landsat-based MTBS. Biomass mortality over recent decades increased, and was captured well by the model in general, but missed mortality trends of some species. Comparisons with AmeriFlux data showed that the model with dynamic tree mortality only (no species trait improvements) overestimated GPP in dry years compared with flux data at semi-arid sites, and underestimated GPP at more mesic sites that experience dry summers. Simulations with both dynamic tree mortality and species trait parameters improved estimates of GPP by 17-22%; differences between predicted and observed NEE were larger. Future projections show higher productivity from increased atmospheric CO2 and warming that somewhat offsets drought and fire effects over the next few decades. Challenges include representation of hydraulic failure in models, and availability of species trait and carbon/water process data in disturbance- and drought-impacted regions.",

            "abstract": "Legume tree species with the ability to fix nitrogen (N) are highly diverse and widespread across tropical forests but in particular in the dry tropics. Their ecological success in lower latitudes has been called a “paradox”: soil N in the tropics is thought to be high, while acquiring N through fixation incurs high energetic costs. However, the long held assumptions that N fixation is limited by photosynthate and that N fixation penalizes plant productivity have rarely been tested, particularly in legume tree species. We show results from three different experiments where we grew eleven species of tropical dry forest legumes. We quantified plant biomass and N fixation using nodulation and the 15N natural isotope abundance (Ndfa or nitrogen derived from fixation). These data show little evidence for costs of N fixation in seedlings grown under different soil fertility, light regimes, and with different microbial communities. Seedling productivity did not incur major costs because of N fixation: indeed, the average slope between Ndfa and biomass was positive (range in slopes: -0.03 to 0.3). Moreover, foliar N, which varied among species, was tightly constrained and not correlated with Ndfa. This finding implies that legume species have a target N that does not change depending on N acquisition strategies. The process of N fixation in tropical legumes may be more carbon efficient than previously thought. This view is more consistent with the hyperabundance of members of this family in tropical ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Mount St. Helens is the most active volcano of the Cascade range in the Western U.S. Given its recent eruptions in 1980 and 2005, it is clear that magma transport has recently occurred in the shallow crust beneath the volcanic edifice. A dense seismic array was deployed around Mount St. Helens for two weeks in summer 2014. The array was composed of 904 vertical-component 10-Hz geophones distributed within 20 km of the caldera. We cross-correlated all the seismic ambient noise data from this array to measure Rayleigh wave travel times and invert for the seismic shear velocity structure beneath the volcano. Clear Rayleigh waves are observed between 2 to 5 sec period in most directions and the signal is particularly strong in the Southwest-Northeast direction likely caused by ocean waves off the west coast of Washington State. We applied frequency-time analysis to measure phase velocity dispersions for all available station pairs, and we applied surface wave tomography for each period to determine 2-D Rayleigh wave phase velocity maps between 2 to 5 second period. Finally, we inverted these maps for a preliminary 3D velocity model from surface to 5 km depth. The model shows a low-velocity anomaly beneath the center of the caldera. This anomaly could be related to shallow magma storage beneath Mount St. Helens as well as the highly fractured rock of the volcanic edifice. Further analysis of short period surface wave propagation will improve understanding of upper crustal structure beneath Mount St. Helens and how it is linked to supply of silicate melts and volatiles from greater depths.",

            "abstract": "Ombrotrophic bogs are both nutrient-poor systems and important carbon (C) sinks yet there remains a dearth of information on the stoichiometry of C, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), an important determinant of substrate quality for microorganisms, in these systems. In this study, we quantified the C, N, P, and K concentrations and stoichiometric ratios of both soil organic matter (SOM) and dissolved organic matter (DOM) as well as microbial extracellular enzyme activity from 0 – 10cm depth in a long-term fertilization experiment at Mer Bleue bog, Ontario, Canada. Though trends in C:N, C:P, and C:K between SOM and DOM seem to follow one another, preliminary results indicate that the stoichiometric ratios of DOM were at least an order of magnitude smaller than those of DOM suggesting that nutrient fertilization impacts the quality of DOM as a microbial substrate to a greater degree than SOM. C:N decreased with greater nitrogen addition but C:P and C:K increased; the magnitude of that increase being smaller in NPK treatments relative to N-only treatments suggesting co-limitation by P and/or K. This is further supported by the increase in activity of both the C-cycling enzyme, β-D-glucosidase (bdG), and the P-cycling enzyme, phosphatase (Phos), with greater nitrogen addition; particularly in NPK-treatments for bdG and N-only treatments for Phos. The activity of the N-cycling enzyme, N-acetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase, and the C-cycling enzyme, phenol oxidase, with greater N-addition suggests a decreased need to breakdown organic nitrogen to meet microbial N-requirements in the former and N-inhibition in the latter consistent with findings in the literature. Taken together, these results suggest that higher levels of nutrients impact both microbial substrate quality as well as the activity of microbial enzymes that are key in the decomposition process which may ultimately decrease the ability of peatlands to sequester carbon.",

Elaborated and refined in 2015 via JpGU, AbSciCon, IAC, and COSPAR Water, this plan is now specific: discrete and integrated analyses and coordination actions that, if acted on by the community over the next 45 months, could result in Enceladus ocean exploration appearing in the next Planetary Decadal Survey’s mission priorities, issued in 2021.\nAt AGU 2015, a product-based, outcome-measurable, stepwise milestone plan is presented to catalyze the next level of community discussion. Topics covered by the action plan include: hypothesis-driven science questions; mission cost as a function of mission capability; mission selectability as a function of programmatic constraints and evaluation process; exploration technologies as a function of funding and schedule; international consensus on forward and backward planetary protection requirements and solutions for exploring worlds with astrobiologically significant liquid water; and strategic balance among major NASA planetary science initiatives.\nKey Decadal-runup milestones are analyzed with respect to stakeholders, success criteria, and – critically – calendar and precedence. These results then inform a multi-year action plan to generate, vet, and socialize throughout the community a set of technically and fiscally viable mission concepts, respectively enabled by an achievable technology development roadmap also detailed in the presentation. This can begin to align advocate actions toward a broad community goal of exploring the Enceladan ocean.\nWithout such coordination, which must reach fruition by Sep 2019, the probability that the next Decadal could explicitly prioritize mission objectives for Enceladus ocean exploration – as one of the top Flagship or as New Frontiers priorities – will be low. Missing the 2023-2032 Decadal window would in turn force such missions beyond the career horizon even of today’s graduate students.",

            "abstract": "The first official space weather forecast was issued by the Space Disturbances Laboratory in Boulder, Colorado, in 1965, ushering in an era of operational prediction that continues to this day. Today, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) charters the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC) as one of the nine National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) to provide the nation's official watches, warnings, and alerts of space weather phenomena. SWPC is now integral to national and international efforts to predict space weather events, from the common and mild, to the rare and extreme, that can impact critical technological infrastructure. In 2012, the Strategic National Risk Assessment included extreme space weather events as low-to-medium probability phenomena that could, unlike any other meteorogical phenomena, have an impact on the government's ability to function. Recognizing this, the White House chartered the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) to produce the first comprehensive national strategy for the prediction, mitigation, and response to an extreme space weather event. The implementation of the National Strategy is ongoing with NOAA, its partners, and stakeholders concentrating on the goal of improving our ability to observe, model, and predict the onset and severity of space weather events. In addition, work continues with the research community to improve our understanding of the physical mechanisms - on the Sun, in the heliosphere, and in the Earth's magnetic field and upper atmosphere - of space weather as well as the effects on critical infrastructure such as electrical power transmission systems. In fifty years, people will hopefully look back at the history of operational space weather prediction and credit our efforts today with solidifying the necessary developments in observational systems, full-physics models of the entire Sun-Earth system, and tools for predicting the impacts to infrastructure to protect against any and all forms of space weather.",

Important relationships between the two components occur within the northwest Paraná Basin and concealed beneath sedimentary cover. We integrated all available airborne magnetic and gravity surveys and ground-based gravity data to produce consistent, digital magnetic and Bouguer anomaly maps. Data-processing and modeling techniques then were used in order to reveal principal crustal compartments and basin-basement structures at various depths. Three large magnetic discontinuities delineate crustal compartments in the area with N30°E, N60°E, and N70°E strike, from east to west, respectively. These magnetic lineaments bound regions with distinct gravity anomaly character. Robust matched-filter analysis applied to magnetic and gravity data yielded important depth estimates: (i) 2.5 km to the top of the Paraná Basin Neoproterozoic basement; (ii) 4-6 km to the top of a second group of basement units; (iii) 20 km, possibly associated with the upper-lower crust interface; and (iv) 33-39 and 43 km related to crustal thicknesses west and southeast of a major N30°E trending lineament, respectively. The 2D joint modeling of gravity and magnetic data sheds light on the asymmetric geometry of the basement beneath the Paraná basin, with at least three half-grabens formed by LTB reactivated structures. The central region of the study area is characterized by thinner crust and higher crustal weakness, where important structures have developed in the Mesozoic, including NW trending reactivations, linked to crustal uplift and evolution of small NE-aligned Cretaceous basins. Important depocenters occur to the north and east of the study area, with N70ºE and N30°E – NS strike, respectively.",

            "abstract": "The advent of modern 3D printing has provided an unprecedented opportunity to combine the strengths of two of the main approaches used in rock physics analysis - digital and experimental. In the laboratory we can explore still unknown frontiers of rock behaviour, and in digital rock physics each sample and experiment is fully reproducible at a minute, detailed scale. Bringing these two techniques together and applying both to the same rock volumes has become more important than ever as we add layers of complexity to both models and experiments in an attempt understand the coupled thermo-chemo-mechanical changes controlling transport and elastic properties of carbonate diagenesis.\nIn this study, we take a two-pronged approach. First, we investigate the effect of changing the size of a specific natural carbonate pore geometry on the frame independent properties porosity and permeability and compare the laboratory measurements to the results of numerical simulations. These preliminary tests show that it is possible to use an iterative, grain-scale geometry modification and measurement workflow that utilizes 3D printing. Second, we induce the decarbonation reaction in a carbonate deposit injected with silicate-bearing fluids in a temperature-pressure space not previously explored. These results show that we can quantify changes to the acoustic and transport properties of the sample when exposed to such diagenetic conditions.\nUltimately we will use a workflow designed to iteratively combine baseline CT-scanned rock volumes, experimentally derived boundary conditions for and modifications to the digital rock volumes, and measurements on 3D printed rock models in order to test hypotheses about grain-scale changes on bulk sample properties.",

            "abstract": "Global solar magnetic maps are the primary input to coronal and heliospheric models used to estimate geoeffective space weather events. The ADAPT (Air Force Data Assimilative Photospheric flux Transport) model has recently been modified to utilize line-of-sight magnetograms observed from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) to create global flux distribution maps. Compared to ground-based observations, data assimilation of inferred photospheric magnetic field data close to the solar limb is possible as a result of the high quality of HMI magnetograms. Estimation of the global magnetic field distribution continues to be challenging, however, since less than half of the solar surface is viewable via spectropolarimetric measurements at any given time. The lack of farside solar magnetic field observations results in temporal and spatial discontinuities within the global maps at the east-limb boundary (where the observational time difference is greater than two weeks and continuously present) and at the poles (where quality observations are not available for each pole for ~5 months, once per year). In this presentation, we will discuss the progress towards improved data assimilation, modeling the evolution of active regions and polar fields, incorporating helioseismic farside and full-Stokes vector data, and forecasting the solar wind, F10.7 (i.e., the solar 10.7 cm radio flux), and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) irradiance.",

Driven by a magnetic flux transport model, ADAPT evolves global solar magnetic maps forward 1 to 7 days in the future to provide realistic estimates of the solar near-side field distribution used to forecast the solar wind, F10.7 (i.e., the solar 10.7 cm radio flux), extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and far ultraviolet (FUV) irradiance. Input to the ADAPT model includes solar near-side estimates of the inferred photospheric magnetic field from space-based (i.e., HMI) and ground-based (e.g., GONG & VSM) instruments. We summarize the recent findings that: 1) the sum of the absolute value of strong magnetic fields, associated with sunspots, is shown to correlate well with the observed daily F10.7 variability (Henney et al. 2012); and 2) the sum of the absolute value of weak magnetic fields, associated with plage regions, is shown to correlate well with EUV and FUV irradiance variability (Henney et al. 2015). In addition, recent progress to utilize the ADAPT global maps as input to the Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) coronal and solar wind model is presented. We also discuss the challenges of observing less than half of the solar surface at any given time and the need for future magnetograph instruments near L1 and L5.",

            "abstract": "Over the next several decades, the population of the world’s cities is projected to nearly double, increasing by 2.6 billion people and requiring massive urban expansion globally. This massive growth in urban density and scale will compound ongoing city challenges related to climate change, energy, infrastructure, public health, and more. Cities are using data they already collect such as 311 calls, bus and train operations, street repair orders, census data and building permits to help understand the complex interactions between the human, built and natural systems within a city and inform their decision making. Helping to guide urban decision-making is The Array of Things (AoT): a new tool for measuring many aspects of the physical environment of urban areas at the city block scale with continuous, reliable, integrated data from a variety of sensors. An AoT node includes multiple sensors to measure basic meteorological quantities such as pressure, temperature and humidity as well as light and trace gases such as carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and ozone. The sensors operate 24/7 with ingest frequencies as high as 1Hz. The nodes are modular and allow new sensors to be added or swapped out. The hardware/software backbone of an AoT node is provided by the Waggle architecture. Each AoT node includes, via Waggle, compute power from a single board computer running Linux that allows data to be processed in-situ and, if needed, command and control of components of the node. Data is communicated in near real-time typically through WiFi, 3G or wired ethernet to a designated host and resilience is built-in to prevent data loss if communication is disrupted. The AoT includes a software stack with a programmable API and cloud-based infrastructure for performing data ingest and further analysis. The first full instance of AoT will comprise 500 nodes deployed in the City of Chicago, each with power, Internet, and a base set of sensing and embedded information systems capabilities. A prototype of the Array of Things consisting of 12 nodes has been deployed on the campus of the University of Chicago and initial data from the array will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Recent study employing the MDS-1 satellite reveals that magnetic field dipolarization in the deep inner magnetosphere is not unusual. When the MDS-1 satellite was located at L=3.5-5.0 near the auroral onset longitude (MLT difference of ≤2.5 h), the occurrence probability of local dipolarization was about 16%. Surprisingly, an event was found at L~3.6, far inside the geosynchronous altitude. It was also shown that after the dipolarization, the oxygen ENA flux in the nightside ring current region measured by the IMAGE satellite was predominantly enhanced by a factor of 2–5 and stayed at an enhanced level for more than 1 h, while clear enhancement was scarcely seen in the hydrogen ENA flux. To better understand mechanisms of the selective acceleration of O+ ions during dipolarization, an in-situ measurement of ion fluxes is needed. However, there are few studies investigating H+ and O+ flux variations during dipolarization in the deep inner magnetosphere.\nIn this study we investigate magnetic field dipolarization and its associated ion flux variations in the deep inner magnetosphere, using magnetic field and ion flux data obtained by the Van Allen Probes. From the magnetic field data recorded on the nightside (1800-0600 MLT) in the inner magnetosphere (L=3.0-6.6) in VDH coordinates, we select substorm-related dipolarization events in which the H component increases by more than 20 nT and the absolute value of the V component decreases by more than 8 nT in 5 minutes. About 150 dipolarization events are identified from 1 October 2012 to 30 June 2015. We find that the dipolarization mostly occurs at L=4.5-6.5 in the premidnight sector (2100-0000 MLT). No events are found at L<4.0. Some dipolarization events are accompanied by O+ flux enhancements in the energy range higher than a few keV, which have the pitch angle distribution peaked around 45 or 135 degrees. We also find that low energy O+ ions often appear after dipolarization with an energy dispersion starting from around keV down to a few tens of eV. These energy dispersive O+ ions are detected in the directions parallel and antiparallel to the magnetic field line. We will discuss possible mechanisms of the selective acceleration of O+ ions and the generation of the field-aligned sub-keV O+ ions in the deep inner magnetosphere during the dipolarization events.",

            "abstract": "Landfill methane emissions are difficult to estimate due to limited observations and data uncertainty. The mobile tracer dilution method is a widely used and cost-effective approach for predicting landfill methane emissions. The method uses a tracer gas released on the surface of the landfill and measures the concentrations of both methane and the tracer gas downwind. Mobile measurements are conducted with a gas analyzer mounted on a vehicle to capture transects of both gas plumes. The idea behind the method is that if the measurements are performed far enough downwind, the methane plume from the large area source of the landfill and the tracer plume from a small number of point sources will be sufficiently well-mixed to behave similarly, and the ratio between the concentrations will be a good estimate of the ratio between the two emissions rates.\nThe mobile tracer dilution method is sensitive to different factors of the setup such as placement of the tracer release locations and distance from the landfill to the downwind measurements, which have not been thoroughly examined. In this study, numerical modeling is used as an alternative to field measurements to study the sensitivity of the tracer dilution method and provide estimates of measurement accuracy. Using topography and wind conditions for an actual landfill, a landfill emissions rate is prescribed in the model and compared against the emissions rate predicted by application of the tracer dilution method. Two different methane emissions scenarios are simulated: homogeneous emissions over the entire surface of the landfill, and heterogeneous emissions with a hot spot containing 80% of the total emissions where the daily cover area is located. Numerical modeling of the tracer dilution method is a useful tool for evaluating the method without having the expense and labor commitment of multiple field campaigns. Factors tested include number of tracers, distance between tracers, distance from landfill to transect path, and location of tracers with respect to the hot spot. Results show that location of the tracers relative to the hot spot of highest landfill emissions makes the largest difference in accuracy of the tracer dilution method.",

            "abstract": "The first no-gap OH airglow all-sky imager network in the world was established in northern China in February 2012. The network is composed of 6 all-sky airglow imagers that make observations of OH airglow gravity waves and cover an area of about 2000 km east and west and about 1400 km south and north. A comparison of the observations in 2012, 2013, and 2014 are made, which shows that there were more strong thunderstorms take place in 2013 in the northern China and produce more Concentric Gravity Wave (CGW) events. Especially, a series of CGW events were observed by the network nearly every night during the first half of August 2013. These events were also observed by satellite sensors from FY-2, AIRS/Aqua, and VIIRS/Suomi NPP. Combination of the ground imager network with satellites provides multi-level observations of the CGWs from the stratosphere to the mesopause region. In this talk, two representative CGW events in August 2013 are studied in detail and movies of the two events are displayed. One is the CGW on the night of 13 August 2013, likely launched by a single thunderstorm. The temporal and spatial analyses indicate that the CGW horizontal wavelengths agree with the GW dispersion relation within 300 km from the storm center. A gravity wave with horizontal wavelength of about 20 km propagates horizontally to more than 800 km in the mesopause region, probably due to a ducting layer. Another CGW event was induced by two very strong thunderstorms on 09 August 2013. Multi-scale waves with horizontal wavelengths ranging from less than 10 km to 200 km were observed. Many ripples were found, probably due to the breaking of strong gravity waves with large relative OH intensity perturbations of 10%.",

            "abstract": "Global river routine models have been developed for representing freshwater discharge from land to ocean in Earth System Models. At the beginning, global river models had simulated river discharge along a prescribed river network map by using a linear-reservoir assumption. Recently, in parallel with advancement of remote sensing and computational powers, many advanced global river models have started to represent floodplain inundation assuming sub-grid floodplain topography. Some of them further pursue physically-appropriate representation of river and floodplain dynamics, and succeeded to utilize “hydrodynamic flow equations” to realistically simulate channel/floodplain and upstream/downstream interactions. State-of-the-art global river hydrodynamic models can well reproduce flood stage (e.g. inundated areas and water levels) in addition to river discharge.\nFlood stage simulation by global river models can be potentially coupled with land surface processes in Earth System Models. For example, evaporation from inundated water area is not negligible for land-atmosphere interactions in arid areas (such as the Niger River). Surface water level and ground water level are correlated each other in flat topography, and this interaction could dominate wetting and drying of many small lakes in flatland and could also affect biogeochemical processes in these lakes. These land/surface water interactions had not been implemented in Earth System Models but they have potential impact on the global climate and carbon cycle.\nIn the AGU presentation, recent advancements of global river hydrodynamic modelling, including super-high resolution river topography datasets, will be introduces. The potential applications of river and surface water modules within Earth System Models will be also discussed.",

In order to understand the detail removal process, it is important to investigate the interactions between reactions and structural evolution. In this work, reactions between nZVI and Co2+ at different initial concentrations in anoxic aqueous solutions (to eliminate the effects of O2) were tracked for 10 days using a variety of methods including inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES), high resolution-transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Continuous removal and reduction of Co2+ by nZVI caused by structural evolution were revealed in reaction processes. The system pH (pH measured in mixture), which controls the stability of coprecipitation and the corrosion rate of nZVI, was deemed as the determining factors of structural evolutions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results showed that the formation and dissolution of sheet structure impacts on the ratio of Fe (0) on nZVI’s surface and the surface reduction of Co2+. The cavity structure provides the possibility of Co migrating from surface to inside of nZVI leading a continuous removal. A subacidity condition could accelerate the evolution to improve the removal of Co2+ and the results of structural controlled reactions further indicated that the removal was suspended by sheet structure and enhanced by cavity structure. The results in this study revealed “structural influence” for fully and dynamically understanding nZVI’s reactions.",

These studies have provided valuable data, but their duration has been restricted to a few weeks since the majority have been part of intensive field campaigns. With the aim of addressing the VOC pollution problem during longer monitoring periods and evaluating control measures to reduce the production of ozone and secondary aerosols, the environmental authorities of Mexico City through its Air Quality Monitoring Network have developed a program to monitor over 50 VOC species every hour in selected existing air quality monitoring stations inside and outside the urban sprawl. The program started with a testing period of six months in 2012 covering the ozone-season (Mar-May). Results of this first campaign are presented in this paper.\nUsing as reference VOC data collected in 2003, reductions in the mixing ratios of light alkanes associated with the consumption of liquefied petroleum gas and aromatic compounds related with the evaporation of fossil fuels and solvents were observed. In contrast, a clear increase in the mixing ratio of olefins was observed. This increase is of relevance to understand the moderate success in the reduction of ozone and fine aerosols in recent years in comparison to other criteria pollutants, which have substantially decreased. Particular features of the diurnal profiles, reactivity with the hydroxyl radical and correlations between individual VOCs and carbon monoxide are used to investigate the influence of specific emission sources. The results discussed here expect to highlight the importance of monitoring VOCs to better understand the drivers and impacts of secondary pollution in large cities like Mexico City.",

            "abstract": "The Middle America Trench bends sharply northward at 20°N. This, along with the close proximity of the Rivera-North America Euler pole (e.g., Suárez et al., 2103) to the northern end of the Middle American trench (the Jalisco Subduction Zone), produces a sharp increase in the obliquity of subduction at 20°N. By analogy with other subduction zones where this situation occurs,a significant trench parallel extensional stress field is expected to exist in the forearc region near the bend. Given the poor bathymetric coverage previously existing in this area, to verify that such stresses are present in the forearc area of the Jalisco Subduction Zone, multibeam bathymetric, seafloor backscatter and sub-bottom seismic reflection data were collected during the MORTIC08 campaign of the B.O. EL PUMA using the Kongsberg EM300 multibeam system and TOPAS sub-bottom profiler. Consistent with the analogy, these data image in detail a large submarine canyon extending from the coast at 20°05'N to the Middle America Trench at 19°50'N. This canyon, which we call the Ipala canyon (the canyon head lies offshore of the town of Ipala, Jalisco) is approximately 120km in length and is most likely fed by two, possibly three, small rivers, namely: the Ipala, Tecolotlán and Maria Garza rivers. . The seafloor and subbottom seismic reflection images also expose the tectonic processes that are actively influencing the present day geomorphology of the canyon region. Specifically, the new information indicates that much of the physical geography of seafloor is the result of active tectonic deformation of the plate margin, including uplift, erosion along structural lineaments and faulting. Of particular interest, the canyon is deflected by almost 90° at three locations, the deflections all having a similar azimuth of between 125° and 130°. Given the prominence and geometry of this canyon, along with its tectonic setting, we propose that this canyon is the result of extensional stresses produced by the sharp change in the plate convergence direction in this area and that the canyon delineates the southeast boundary of a major forearc block, which we call the Banderas Forearc Block.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we investigate the bio-geophysical effects of large-scale deforestation on monsoon regions using idealized deforestation simulations. The simulations are performed using the NCAR CAM5 atmospheric model coupled to a mixed layer ocean model. The four deforestation experiments are named Global, Boreal, Temperate and Tropical, respectively. In these deforestation experiments, trees are replaced by grasses around the globe, between 20oS and 20oN, between 20oN and 50oN and poleward of 50oN, respectively. We find that the remote forcing from large-scale deforestation in the Temperate and Boreal cases shift the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) southward. This results in a significant decrease in precipitation in the Northern Hemisphere monsoon regions (East Asia, North America, North Africa, South Asia) and moderate precipitation increases in the Southern Hemisphere monsoon regions (South Africa, South America and Australia).\nThe magnitude of the monsoonal precipitation changes depend on the location of deforestation with remote effects showing a larger influence than local effects. The South Asian Monsoon region is affected the most with 18% decline in precipitation over India in the Global deforestation case. Our results indicate that any comprehensive assessment of afforestation/reforestation as climate change mitigation strategies should carefully evaluate the remote effects on monsoonal precipitation besides the large local impacts on temperatures and carbon sequestration benefits. Our results also demonstrate the linkages between any large scale forcing that causes large warming/cooling in the high latitudes and rainfall changes in tropical monsoonal regions via ITCZ shifts.\nFigure Caption: Changes in annual mean precipitation (mm/day) between the deforestation experiments and the control simulation. Hatched areas are regions where changes are statistically significant at the 95% confidence level. Shading in line plots represents the ±1 standard deviation estimated from the control simulation.

            "abstract": "Wildfires are an important concern in California (CA) which is characterized by the semi-arid to arid climate and vegetation types. Highly variable winter precipitation and extended hot and dry warm season in the region challenge an effective strategic fire management. Climatologically, the fire season which is based on live fuel moisture (LFM) of generally below 80% in Los Angeles County spans 4 months from mid-July to mid-November, but it has lasted over 7 months in the past several years. This behavior is primarily due to the ongoing drought in CA during the last decade, which is responsible for frequent outbreaks of severe wildfires in the region. Despite their importance, scientific advances for the recent changes in wildfire risk and effective assessments of wildfire risk are lacking. In the present study, we show impacts of large-scale atmospheric circulations on an early start and then extended length of fire seasons. For example, the strong relationships of North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) with springtime temperature and precipitation in the SWUS that was recently revealed by our team members have led to an examination of the possible impact of NAO on wildfire danger in the spring. Our results show that the abnormally warm and dry spring conditions associated with positive NAO phases can cause an early start of a fire season and high fire risks throughout the summer and fall. For an effective fire danger assessment, we have tested the capability of satellite vegetation indices (VIs) in replicating in situ LFM of Southern CA chaparral ecosystems by 1) comparing seasonal/interannual characteristics of in-situ LFM with VIs and 2) developing an empirical model function of LFM. Unlike previous studies attempting a point-to-point comparison, we attempt to examine the LFM relationship with VIs averaged over different areal coverage with chamise-dominant grids (i.e., 0.5 km to 25 km radius circles). Lastly, we discuss implications of the results for fire danger assessment and prediction.",

At 25 °S, the Tonga trench is intersected by the Louisville ridge, a ~4,300-km-long chain of seamounts and the Osbourn trough, a paleo-spreading center. For this reason, magma which created these seamounts may have various origin. Based on this, the seamounts which forming the Tonga arc are divided into three groups; including group 1(region that the earliest Louisville ridge subduction arised, correspond to TA07-12), group 2(region that the second Louisville ridge subduction arised, correspond to TA14-24); and group 3(region that the Louisville ridge and the Osbourn trough are subducting, correspond to TA25-26). These seamounts are mostly stratovolcanoes with caldera. Rocks recovered by dredging have been identified as pumice, dacite, andesite, basaltic andesites and basalts(most abundant). Major element concentrations are constant, trace element concentrations are enriched LILE, depleted HFSE compared with MORB. The Tonga arc is affected by subduction components divided into the shallow and deep subduction components. Related to subduction components, variables include mantle source, AOC(altered oceanic crust), PS(pelagic sediment), LSC(Louisville seamount chain) and OS(Osbourn trough). In the case of shallow subduction component, it tends to have higher contents in group 1, 3 and lower contents in group 2. Thus, comparatively speaking, it seems that group 1, 3 have been heavily influenced by the fluid. However, origin of the fluid seems to be different, since its locations are not continuous. In the case of deep subduction component, it shows similar range in the group 1, 2, and shows a significantly lower ratio in the group 3. The reason why its values are similar is that it is effected by the melt during the Louisville ridge was subducting and the reason why the ratio in the group 3 shown lower is because of the fluid effect and its effect was greater than the melt. Based on these reasons, group 1 affected dominantly by AOC fluid, group 2 affected dominantly by LSC melt, and group 3 affected dominantly by LSC, OS fluid. In order to clarify this, through the subsequent isotope research, we need to know the origin of the components that effected to the magma which formed the seamounts.",

            "abstract": "H2O degassing influences the evolution of magma viscosity and vesicularity during ascent through the crust, and ultimately the eruptive style. Investigating H2O degassing requires data on both initial and final H2O contents. Initial H2O contents are revealed by melt inclusion data, while final H2O contents are found from dissolved H2O contents of volcanic glass. However volcanic glasses, particularly of silicic composition, are susceptible to secondary hydration i.e. the addition of H2O from the surrounding environment at ambient temperature during the time following pyroclast deposition. Obtaining meaningful final H2O data therefore requires distinguishing between the original final dissolved H2O content and the H2O added subsequently during hydration. Since H2O added during hydration is added as molecular H2O (H2Om), and the species interconversion between H2Om and hydroxyl (OH) species is negligible at ambient temperature, the final OH content of the glass remains unaltered during hydration. By using H2O speciation models to find the original H2Om content that would correspond to the measured OH content of the glass, the original total H2O (H2Ot) content of the glass prior to hydration can be reconstructed. These H2O speciation data are obtained using FTIR spectroscopy. In many cases, particularly where vesicular glasses necessitate thin wafers, OH cannot be measured directly and instead is calculated indirectly as OH = H2Ot - H2Om. Here we demonstrate the importance of using a speciation-dependent H2Ot molar absorptivity coefficient to obtain accurate H2Ot and H2O speciation data and outline a methodology for calculating such a coefficient for rhyolite glasses, with application to hydrated silicic pumice from submarine volcanoes in the Japanese Izu-Bonin Arc. Although hydrated pumice from Kurose Nishi and Oomurodashi now contain ~1.0 - 2.5 wt% H2Ot, their pre-hydration final H2O contents were typically ~0.3 – 0.4 wt% H2Ot. Furthermore, we show that pre-hydration final H2O contents vary with pumice texture, with Kurose Nishi tube pumice containing ~0.3 wt% H2Ot while denser pumice with spherical vesicles contains ~1.0 wt% H2Ot. By combining these new reconstructed final H2O data with textural characteristics we investigate H2O degassing and eruption mechanisms of silicic submarine volcanoes.",

China’s GNSS, BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS), has already satisfied the requirement of stand-alone precise positioning in Asia-Pacific region with 14 in-orbit satellites, which promisingly suggests that BDS could be applied to the high-precision earthquake monitoring as GPS. In the present paper, real-time monitoring of seismic waveforms using BDS measurements is assessed. We investigate a so-called “variometric” approach to measure real-time seismic waveforms with high-rate BDS observations. This approach is based on time difference technique and standard broadcast products which are routinely available in real time. The 1HZ BDS data recorded by Beidou Experimental Tracking Stations (BETS) during the 2015 Mw 7.8 Nepal earthquake is analyzed. The results indicate that the accuracies of velocity estimation from BDS are 2-3 mm/s in horizontal components and 8-9 mm/s in vertical component, respectively, which are consistent with GPS. The seismic velocity waveforms during earthquake show good agreement between BDS and GPS. Moreover, the displacement waveforms is reconstructed by an integration of velocity time series with trend removal. The displacement waveforms with the accuracy of 1-2 cm are derived by comparing with post-processing GPS precise point positioning (PPP).",

With each hammer strike the steel pile – often exceeding 6 m in diameter and 80 m in length – radiates energy into the surrounding water and soil, until reaching its targeted penetration depth. Several European authorities introduced limitations regarding hydroacoustic emissions during the construction process to protect marine wildlife. Satisfying these regulations made the development and application of sound mitigation systems (e.g. bubble curtains or insulation screens) inevitable, which are commonly installed within the water column surrounding the pile or even the complete construction site. Last years’ advances have led to a point, where the seismic energy tunneling the sound mitigation systems through the soil and radiating back towards the water column gains importance, as it confines the maximum achievable sound mitigation. From an engineering point of view, the challenge of deciding on an effective noise mitigation layout arises, which especially requires a good understanding of the soil-dependent wave field. From a geophysical point of view, the pile acts like a very unique line source, generating a characteristic wave field dominated by inclined wave fronts, diving as well as head waves. Monitoring the seismic arrivals while the pile penetration steadily increases enables to perform quasi-vertical seismic profiling. This work is based on datasets that have been collected within the frame of three comprehensive offshore measurement campaigns during pile driving and demonstrates the potential of seismic arrivals induced by pile driving for further soil characterization.",

            "abstract": "The geological record at rifts and margins worldwide often reveals along-strike variations in volumes of extruded and intruded igneous rocks. These variations may be the result of asthenospheric heterogeneity, variations in rate, and timing of extension; alternatively, preexisting plate architecture and/or the evolving kinematics of extension during breakup may exert first-order control on magmatism. The Ethiopian and Afar Rift systems provide an excellent opportunity to address this since it exposes, along strike, several sectors of asynchronous rift development from continental rifting in the south to incipient oceanic spreading in the north. Here we perform studies of distribution and style of volcanism and faulting along strike in the MER and Afar. We also incorporate synthesis of geophysical, geochemical, and petrological constraints on magma generation and emplacement in order to discriminate between tectonic and mantle geodynamic controls on the geological record of a newly forming magmatic rift. Along-rift changes in extension by magma intrusion and plate stretching, and the three-dimensional focusing of melt where the rift dramatically narrows each influence igneous intrusion, volcanism and subsidence history. In addition, rift obliquity plays an important role in localizing intrusion into the crust beneath en echelon volcanic segments. Along-strike variations in volumes and types of igneous rocks found at rifted margins thus likely carry information about the development of strain during rifting, as well as the physical state of the convecting mantle at the time of breakup.",

Spacecrafts have clearly established the existence of two distinct populations in the quasi-perpendicular shock region (i.e. for 45° ≤ ΘBn ≤ 90°, where ΘBn is the angle between the shock normal and the upstream magnetic field) : (i) field-aligned ion beams or « FAB » characterized by a gyrotropic distribution, and (ii) gyro-phase bunched ions or « GPB » characterized by a NON gyrotropic distribution.\nOne of the important unresolved problem is the exact origin of the particles contributing to these two populations. To our knowledge, it was the first time that full-particle simulations have been performed including self-consistently the shock front curvature and nonstationarity, and the time-of-flight effects.\nOur analysis evidences that these two backstreaming populations may be reflected by the front itself and can be differentiated both in terms of interaction time and trajectory within the shock front. In particular, simulations evidence that \"GPB\" population is characterized by a short interaction time (ΔTinter = 1 to 2 τci) while the \"FAB\" population corresponds to a much larger time range (from 1 τci to 10 τci), where tci is the upstream ion gyroperiod.\nPresent individual ion trajectories evidence that \"FAB\" population shows a strong perpendicular drift at the shock front (i.e. strong dependence of the pitch angle to the perpendicular velocity) whereas the \"GPB\" population shows no perpendicular drift (i.e. its pitch angle is mainly driven by the parallel velocity). Such differences explain why the \"FAB\" population loses their gyro-phase coherency and become gyrotropic which is not the case for the \"GPB\". This important result was not expected and greatly simplifies the question of their origin.",

We compute trajectories of a large number of electrons forming a delta function with the same energy and pitch angle. The electrons are launched at different locations along the magnetic field line and different timings with respect to a pair of chorus emissions generated at the magnetic equator. We follow the evolution of the delta function, and obtain a distribution function in energy and equatorial pitch angle, which is a numerical Green's function for one cycle of chorus wave-particle interaction. We obtain the Green's functions for the energy range 10 keV\n∼\n6 MeV and all pitch angles greater than the loss cone angle. By taking the convolution integral of the Green's functions with the distribution function of the injected electrons repeatedly, we follow a long-time evolution of the distribution function. We find that the energetic electrons are accelerated effectively by relativistic turning acceleration and ultra-relativistic acceleration through nonlinear trapping by chorus emissions, and that these processes result in the rapid formation of a dumbbell distribution of highly relativistic electrons within a few minutes after the injection of tens of keV electrons.",

The temporal and spatial changes of the bed surface grain size distribution were measured during the runs with a technique based on coloring sediment classes and image analysis. The measurements indicate that the coarse wedge induces bed degradation and a decrease of the bed slope in the downstream reach as the coarseness of the wedge reduces the sediment supply to the downstream reach. This results in a sharp transition in bed slope and grain size, which is characteristic of gravel-sand transitions. Numerical runs emphasize how at field scale such a gravel wedge migrates at an extremely slow pace and how the progradation of its front can be limited to peak flows. An analytical model illustrates how the time scale of wedge progradation compares to the De Vries time scale of morphodynamic river changes. The research illustrates how the combination of field data, physical experiments, numerical modelling, and analytical analysis adds to our understanding of the physical behavior of river systems.",

Less emphasized is the fact that a new dynamic height datum will also be defined about the same time to replace the International Great Lakes Datum of 1985 (IGLD 85). IGLD 85 was defined concurrent with NAVD 88 and used the same geopotential values. This paper focuses on the use of an existing tool for determining geometric coordinates and a developing geopotential model as a means of determining dynamic heights. The Online Positioning User Service (OPUS) Projects (OP) is an online tool available from the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) for use in developing geometric coordinates from simultaneous observations at multiple sites during multiple occupations. With observations performed at the water level gauges throughout the Great Lakes, the geometric coordinates of the mean water level surface can be determined. NGS has also developed the xGEOID15B model from satellite, airborne and surface gravity data. Using the input geometric coordinates determined through OP, the geopotential values for the water surface at the water level stations around the Great Lakes were determined using the xGEOID15B model. Comparisons were made between water level sites for each Lake as well as to existing IGLD 85 heights. A principal advantage to this approach is the ability to generate new water level control stations using OP, while maintaining the consistency between orthometric and dynamic heights by using the same gravity field model. Such a process may provide a means for determining dynamic heights for a future Great Lakes Datum.",

            "abstract": "It is well established that fine-scale features in the aurora (<100-m perpendicular to B) follow distinctly different rules of motion than the mesoscale arcs (order 10-km) within which they are embedded. These scale-dependent distinctions may be conveniently captured and quantified through the formalism of phase- and group- motion from classical wave theory. But less clear is how such empirical propagation models should be connected to the underlying physics of energy release and dissipation in the magnetosphere. This paper seeks to connect multi-scale models of auroral motion to dynamic wave-particle interactions in the magnetotail and near-Earth auroral acceleration region (AAR). Our focus is on auroras associated with the established phases of the substorm cycle (growth, onset, expansion, recovery). A unifying construct is the ‘backward wave’ (oppositely directed phase- and group- motion), which is argued to be a natural consequence of magnetic reconnection and concomitant release of magnetic stress, applicable to both the magnetotail and the AAR domains.",

Initialized predictions of global hurricane activity show skill on regional scales, comparable to the skill on basin-wide scales, suggesting that regional seasonal TC predictions may be a feasible forecast target. The 25km version of the model shows skill at seasonal predictions of the frequency of the most intense hurricanes (Cat. 3-4-5 and Cat. 4-5). It is shown that large-scale systematic errors in the mean-state are a key constraint on the simulation and prediction of variations of regional climate and extremes, and methodologies for overcoming model biases are explored. Improvements in predictions of regional climate are due both to improved representation of local processes, and to improvements in the large-scale climate and variability from improved process representation.\nThese models are used to explore the the response of tropical cyclones, both globally and regionally, to increasing greenhouse gases and to internal climate variations. The 25km model in generally shows a more faithful representation of the impact of climate variability on hurricane activity than the 50km model. The response of the total number and the total power dissipation index of tropical cyclones to increasing greenhouse gases can differ substantially between models of two atmospheric resolutions, 50km and 25km - with the 25km version of the model showing a larger increase in power dissipation from increasing greenhouse gases, principally because - in contrast to that of the 50km model - its global hurricane frequency does not decrease with increasing CO2. Some thoughts on the reasons behind those differences will be offered. The 25km model shows an increase in the frequency of intense tropical cyclones under increasing greenhouse gases, including the development of a substantial number of \"Category 6\" cyclones (storms with maximum winds exceeding 80m/s) that are not present in the control climate.",

            "abstract": "During the last year of operations Venus Express was conducting an experimental aerobraking campaign. The objectives were twofold; firstly, to exercise for the first time the techniques of orbit modification by aerobraking with a European spacecraft, in order to prepare for future scientific ESA missions, and secondly, to collect information on atmospheric density by direct measurements in an environment difficult to sample with other means. Several of the scientific instruments on board Venus Express measured gas abundances of various gasses, including CO2, up to an altitude of 130km, but no reliable measurements could be made of total density and no remote measurements could be done above this altitude.\nThe on board accelerometers gave direct measurements of the deceleration which in turn is directly proportional to the local atmospheric density. This provided an excellent way to study both the total density profile throughout the orbital arc in the atmosphere and small scale density variations in the region of the pericentre. The spacecraft behaved perfectly well throughout the whole campaign and provided a wealth of data both on the atmosphere and on the response of the spacecraft to the harsh environment with strong heat loads and some dynamic stress. At the time of the campaign the pericentre was located near the terminator at about 75 degrees Northern latitude.\nThe so called \"walk-in\" phase started at an altitude of 190 km on 17 May 2014 and the campaign ended on 11 July, after having reached a lowest altitude of 129.2 km. Subsequently, a series of orbit control manoeuvres lifted up the pericentre to 460 km altitude and the science activities were resumed after a thorough check-out of the spacecraft.\nWe have detected a highly variable atmosphere, both on a day to day basis and within the individual pericentre passes. The duration of each pass was approximately 100 s and the maximum dynamic pressure achieved was more than 0.75 N/m2. The orbital period was reduced over the duration of the campaign changing from 24 hours to 22 hours 20 minutes. A simple atmospheric model has been constructed that connects at the lower end to the measurements by the SpicaV and SOIR data and at the higher end to the results from previously derived data from drag campaigns at altitudes between 165 and 200 km. The valid range for this new model is 130-200km.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Mateeva_AGU2015.pdf\nObservations at hydrothermal systems in modern ocean settings suggest that methane produced by serpentinization can support methanotrophic bio-systems. An important question is whether such bio-systems are localised or are more pervasive in their association with serpentinized mantle in the subsurface. This has implications for the global importance of the hidden sub-surface bio-systems, the fate of methane and the carbon cycle.\nThe Totalp unit, a remnant of a former Ocean Continent Transition (OCT) exposed in Alps of Eastern Switzerland, has been chosen to investigate the presence or absence of methanotrophic biosystems within serpentinized exhumed mantle in the Alpine Tethyan margin. The Totalp unit is made of serpentinized mantle and ophicalcites overlain by Upper Jurassic to Lower Cretaceous post-rift sediments. The Totalp unit has undergone little Alpine deformation and only a low-grade metamorphic overprint (<200°C).\nTotalp samples are characterized by total carbon contents of 0.02% to 12.90% and organic carbon contents of 1x10-4 % to 8%. This large range of values reflects the large lithological diversity of this area. The serpentinized peridotite, ophicalcite and post-rift sediments contain hydrocarbons in the form of n-alkanes in the range C20 – C40; isoprenoids, for example pristane and phytane are present in sediments. The organic biological marker distribution is consistent with the temperature history of the OCT (i.e.lower maximum temperature than 200°C).\nFirst results from Totalp show evidence for preservation of marine organic matter in the serpentinized mantle and overlying sediments, although there is no evidence that any organic matter is generated from methanotrophic bio-systems. Nevertheless, focussing on Tethyan hydrothermal systems and preserved hydrocarbons will be critical in understanding whether methanotrophic biomarkers can be preserved and if so whether the methane originated from serpentenization.",

            "abstract": "Among geologic materials volcanic rocks have been typically used to deduce an absolute paleointensity. In the last decade, however, there seems a becoming consensus that volcanic rocks are not so ideal materials due to such as magnetic grains other than non-interacting single domain particles. One approach to obtain a good paleointensity estimate from the rocks is to reduce and correct the non-ideality, suppress alterations in laboratory and screen out suspicious results.\nWe have been working on a development and an application of the Tsunakawa-Shaw method, which has been previously called the LTD-DHT Shaw method. This method is an AF(alternating field)-based technique and thus a paleointensity is estimated using coercivity spectra. To reduce the non-ideality, all remanences undergo low-temperature demagnetization (LTD) before any AF demagnetizations to remove multi-domain like component. To correct the non-ideality, anhysteretic remanent magnetizations (ARMs) are imparted with their directions parallel to natural remanent magnetizations and laboratory-imparted thermoremanent magnetizations (TRMs) and measured before and after laboratory heating. These ARMs are used to correct remanence anisotropies, possible interaction effects originated from the non-ideal grains and TRM changes caused by laboratory alterations. TRMs are imparted by heating specimens above their Curie temperatures and then cooling to room temperature at once to simulate nature conditions. These cycles are done in vacuum to suppress alterations in laboratory. Obtained results are judged by selection criteria, including a check for validity of the ARM corrections.\nIt has been demonstrated that successful paleointensities are obtained from historical lavas in Japan and Hawaii, and from baked clay samples from a reconstructed ancient kiln, with the flow-mean precision of 5-10%. In case of old volcanic rocks, however, the method does not necessarily seem to be perfect. We will summarize these points in this presentation.",

            "abstract": "Approximately 500 Tg/yr of non-methane organic compounds (NMOCs) are emitted by biomass burning (BB) to the global atmosphere, leading to the photochemical production of ozone (O3) and secondary particulate matter (PM). Until recently, in studies of BB emissions, a significant mass fraction of NMOCs (up to 80%) remained uncharacterized or unidentified. Models used to simulate the air quality impacts of BB thus have relied on very limited chemical characterization of the emitted compounds. During the Fourth Fire Lab at Missoula Experiment (FLAME-IV), an unprecedented fraction of emitted NMOCs were identified and quantified through the application of advanced analytical techniques. Here we use FLAME-IV data to improve BB emissions speciation profiles for individual fuel types. From box model simulations we evaluate the sensitivity of predicted precursor and pollutant concentrations (e.g., formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and terpene oxidation products) to differences in the emission speciation profiles, for a range of ambient conditions (e.g., high vs. low NOx). Appropriate representation of emitted NMOCs in models is critical for the accurate prediction of downwind air quality. Explicit simulation of hundreds of NMOCs is not feasible; therefore we also investigate the consequences of using existing assumptions and lumping schemes to map individual NMOCs to model surrogates and we consider alternative strategies. The updated BB emissions speciation profiles lead to markedly different surrogate compound distributions than the default speciation profiles, and box model results suggest that these differences are likely to affect predictions of PM and important gas-phase species in chemical transport models. This study highlights the potential for further BB emissions characterization studies, with concerted model development efforts, to improve the accuracy of BB predictions using necessarily simplified mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "Sandy river-bed morphology often lags changes in water discharge, producing hysteresis in the relation between discharge and bed-form geometry. While this effect is well known, its origins are not. In this talk we present experimental and field results that reveal these origins. We show that the primary mechanism of bed form growth in a rising flood is merger induced by collisions, which occur due to a dispersion in migration rates. At the start of a flood the bed forms are small and transport rate is high, so growth is rapid. Conversely, on the falling limb of a flood the bed forms are large while the transport rate is small. If the flood recedes rapidly enough, the large bed forms cease migrating and small, secondary bed forms emerge on their backs. These smaller features cannibalize the original, relict structures which slowly diffuse away. (We do not distinguish between ripples and dunes, the data do not indicate any reason to do so, and we therefore recuse ourselves from discussing that tiring topic.). The timescale of decay is much larger than growth, leaving a memory of peak-flood conditions that may persist until the next flood. Thus, the timescales of both growth (Tg) and decay (Td) are related to a simple bed form turnover time - the time to displace a bed form's volume by transport - however, the turnover time is different for growth vs. decay. This reveals three different regimes for the response of bed forms to a flood: (1) a slow flood with a timescale Tf > Td > Tg is quasi-steady, i.e., bed forms grow and shrink with no lag between morphology and flow; (2) an intermediate flood with Td > Tf > Tg exhibits quasi-steady growth, but decay lags the flow; and (3) a fast flood with Td > Tg > Tf produces a lag between morphology and flow over the entire hydrograph. Regimes 2 and 3 produce hysteretical behavior, with 3 being the most extreme. We discuss the implications of these results for: predicting stage-discharge relations, anticipating and understanding hysteresis in other geomorphic systems, and improving the overall human condition.",

            "abstract": "Many studies seeking to link climatic and tectonic drivers to fluvial records start with the assumption that such links exist, and that our failure to identify these links is due to either noisy data or confounding factors. This study begins from a different perspective: the robust hydraulic-geometry scaling relations of both alluvial and bedrock rivers suggests an insensitivity of these systems to climatic and tectonic drivers. The pattern stability of river channels, in the face of an onslaught of stochastic driving over a wide range of scales, becomes the feature in need of explanation. To explore this question in a constrained manner, we examine the case of gravel-bedded (d > 10 mm) rivers where one may reasonably suggest that bed-load transport is the dominant means of channel adjustment and erosion. We examined data from 188 rivers across the USA, covering a wide range of climatic, tectonic and bedrock controls. Almost without exception, the rivers exhibit two remarkable features: (1) they are organized such that the bankfull fluid stress is slightly in excess of the critical value; and (2) the distribution of fluid stresses in excess of critical follows a common exponential-decay function. Although discharge regimes and distributions for these rivers vary widely as a function of climate (as expected), the fluid-stress distribution is universal. We surmise that the generic self-organization of a river channel to a near-critical condition acts to decouple important aspects of sediment transport from its regional climate. This \"critical filter\" suggests that finding strong signatures of climate and tectonics in river morphology and erosion should be the exception, rather than the rule. We anticipate and invite criticism of this view. Results imply that landscape evolution models can get by with a simple treatment of climate, and may use a constant Shields stress condition as a channel closure scheme even for bedrock-influenced rivers.",

Therefore, changes in these organized systems will likely have a considerable impact on rainfall. Here, we investigate how observed changes in deep convection of different degrees of organization contribute to changes in tropical rainfall.\nCloud regimes derived from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project allow us to identify organized deep convection and less organized deep convection at the scale of a few hundred kilometers. By decomposing the contributions of these regimes to changes in precipitation derived from the Global Precipitation Climatology Project, we find that the change in the frequency of organized deep convection can explain most of the observed spatial patterns of change in rainfall. In contrast, changes in the mean precipitation of organized deep convection and changes in less organized forms of deep convection contribute lower to rainfall changes. Independent results based on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission support our key conclusions.\nGiven the lack of distinction between the different degrees of organization of convection in global climate models, our results caution against the reliance on these models for future rainfall projections and highlight an area of priority for future model development to achieve a more accurate representation of precipitation.",

Their main limitation, however, is the coverage of the inner corona over a distance range limited to half a solar radius at best from the solar surface. They thus fall short in placing the observed structures within the context of the expanding corona from the solar surface out into interplanetary space. This presentation will review the unique advantages of total solar eclipse observations in yielding novel insights into the bewildering variety of seemingly disparate coronal structures.

The experiment was conducted simultaneously with the 2014 DISCOVER-AQ (Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality) intensive, and employed a coordinated set of ground-based, aircraft-based and satellite measurements.\nThe NFRMA is subject to emissions from a wide variety of very diverse sources such as transportation, power generation, agriculture and livestock operations, oil and gas extraction activities, and natural emissions from vegetation. Inflow into the state can contain elevated ozone brought about from emissions originating from other Western states, Canada or Asia. Terrain-induced, complex mountain-valley circulation patterns, can, to some extent, recirculate polluted air and exacerbate high ozone events. This transport also contributes to high ozone, visibility degradation, and deposition of pollution into Rocky Mountain National Park and other pristine areas.\nFifteen flights were performed between July 26 and August 17, 2014, on board the NCAR/NSF C-130 research aircraft, which was equipped with a comprehensive gas phase photochemistry and aerosol payload. The C-130 flights covered much of the State of Colorado. Numerous ground sites and mobile labs were taking measurements simultaneously, and the NASA P3, B-200, and Falcon aircraft flight operations were concentrated on the NFRMA itself.\nThis presentation will summarize the FRAPPÉ activities and present first results with respect to emission characterization of the area and comparison with inventories, contributions of emission source types to ozone production and particle composition, transport and chemical evolution of air masses from the NFRMA into adjacent, remote areas such as rural mountain communities and Rocky Mountain National Park, as presented in detail later in this session by individual research groups.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater discharge alters stream and river thermal regimes due to the thermal inertia of the subsurface, but the exact nature of its influence depends on the discharge conditions. Diffuse groundwater discharge attenuates daily, weekly, and seasonal changes in surface water temperature. On the other hand, discrete groundwater discharge (e.g., a spring) creates in-stream thermal anomalies that provide temporary refuge for cold-water fish and other aquatic species. Thus, diffusive groundwater input reduces the temporal variability of surface water temperature, while discrete groundwater input enhances its spatial variability.\nIn the present climate, thermal effects of groundwater discharge can be empirically studied by comparing thermal regimes of groundwater-dominated streams to those of runoff-dominated streams. However, there are still many challenges associated with attempting to quantify the thermal influence of groundwater discharge. These difficulties arise in part because the heat flux from groundwater upwelling is induced by a mass flux, and thus it cannot be directly compared to purely sensible heat fluxes. Also, shallow subsurface flow exhibits complex thermal signatures that are not well represented with mean annual air temperature data.\nExamining the thermal influence of groundwater discharge becomes even more complex when potential effects of climate change are considered. Results from previous studies utilizing empirical transfer models, analytical solutions, and numerical models of groundwater temperature dynamics have demonstrated that the nature of groundwater warming depends on the soil properties, groundwater recharge rate, and aquifer configuration. This talk will highlight challenges associated with quantifying the thermal influence of groundwater discharge and provide recommendations for future research opportunities in this field, including the potential to engineer thermal diversity in rivers via manipulation of groundwater flow paths.",

            "abstract": "During the Miocene, due to the convergence of the African plate and the Eurasian plate, the Mediterranean region was subject to profound paleogeographic changes. The evolving coastline and bathymetry of the Mediterranean Sea and, in particular, the opening and closure of the marine connections between the Mediterranean and the outside oceans, triggered important changes in Mediterranean circulation and, indirectly, also affected the global-scale ocean circulation.\nUntil about the Middle Miocene the proto-Mediterranean Sea was open to the Indo-Pacific Ocean through the so-called Indian Gateway. Although the exact age of closure of this gateway is still debated, it is accepted that it substantially affected the paleoceanography of the Mediterranean Sea. Later in time, during the Late Miocene, the Mediterranean was only connected to the Atlantic Ocean but by two marine corridors: the Betic and Rifian corridors. Closure of these narrow passages resulted in the Messinian Salinity Crisis, during which a sequence of evaporites was deposited throughout the Mediterranean basin.\nIn this work we use a regional-scale ocean general circulation model (the Princeton Ocean Model) to gain insight into the role of the evolving gateways. The analysis focuses on large-scale (overturning) circulation, patterns of exchange in the gateways and properties of the Mediterranean water. By comparing our model results to geological data we are able to propose new scenarios or rule out previously proposed ones, and determine the conditions evidenced by the geological observations. More specifically we investigate two different topics: (i) the effects of shoaling and closure of the Indian Gateway and (ii) the functioning of the Late Miocene double gateway to the Atlantic.",

            "abstract": "Geodynamic models predict large strains due to convection in the mantle, and polycrystal plasticity simulations suggest strong crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO), yet much of the lower mantle is observed to be mostly isotropic. However, these models ignore interaction among phases, which is important for the lower mantle, estimated to be composed of ~25% soft ferropericlase (Mg,Fe)O and ~70% harder bridgmanite (MgSiO3). Here we consider deformation of these two lower mantle mineral phases together and look at the microstructure to find whether soft ferropericlase becomes interconnected and acts as a lubricant between harder bridgmanite grains or if ferropericlase is largely disconnected leaving deformation to be absorbed by bridgmanite. We quantify how the volume percent of ferropericlase might affect deformation and CPO development in the lower mantle.\nWe deformed lower mantle mineral analogs halite (NaCl, ferropericlase structure) and neighborite (NaMgF3, perovskite structure) together in the D-DIA. Development of CPO was recorded in situ with radial X-ray diffraction, and information on microstructural evolution was collected using X-ray microtomography. We performed self-consistent polycrystal plasticity modelling to infer likely slip systems and strain rates in each phase.\nResults show that when present in as little as 15% volume, the soft halite becomes interconnected during deformation, surrounding the harder neighborite grains. The change in microstructure during deformation coincides with a decrease in differential stress, i.e. weakening of the aggregate, and a reduction in CPO, likely due to a switch in deformation mode. Furthermore, polycrystal plasticity models imply much higher strain rates in the softer halite, suggesting it is absorbing the bulk of deformation. The halite does not develop significant CPO, and CPO in the neighborite is reduced by nearly half with addition of 15% volume halite. The results suggest that ferropericlase controls deformation in the lower mantle through a mechanism that does not produce significant CPO. This implies a more viscous lower mantle and helps to explain why the bulk of the lower mantle is fairly isotropic.",

The lake model was calibrated with 6 years of water temperature profiles, and then simulated 10 years of validation data with an RMSE ranging from 0.81°C at 50 m depth to 0.04°C at 350-460 m depth. The simulated time series of heat content in the deep lake accurately captured extreme years characterized by weak and strong deep water renewal. The lake model uses wind speed and lake surface temperature (LST) as boundary conditions. LST projections under six climate scenarios from the CMIP5 intermodel comparison project (2 representative concentration pathways X 3 general circulation models) were evaluated with air2water, a simple lumped model that only requires daily values of downscaled air temperature. air2water was calibrated with data from 1993-2011, resulting in a RMSE between simulated and observed daily LST values of 0.68°C. All future climate scenarios project increased water temperature throughout the water column and a substantive reduction in the frequency of deepwater renewal events. The least extreme scenario (CNRM-CM5, RCP4.5) projects the frequency of deepwater renewal events to decrease from about 1 in 2 years in the present to about 1 in 3 years by 2100. The most extreme scenario (HadGEM2-ES, RCP8.5) projects the frequency of deepwater renewal events to be less than 1 in 7 years by 2100 and lake surface temperatures never cooling to less than 4°C after 2050. In all RCP4.5 simulations the temperature of the entire water column is greater than 4°C for increasing periods of time. In the RCP8.5 simulations, the temperature of the entire water column is greater than 4°C year round by the year 2060 (HadGEM2) or 2080 (CNRM-CM5); thus, the conditions required for thermobaric instability induced mixing become rare or non-existent in these projections. The results indicate that the frequency of deep water renewal events could change substantially in a warmer future climate, potentially altering the lake ecosystem and water clarity.",

            "abstract": "The Svalbard archipelago consists of three Caledonian provinces that were assembled by thrusting and transcurrent faulting during the Silurian and Devonian in a location directly northeast of the Greenland Caledonides. Syn- to post-orogenic alluvial strata, referred to as the Old Red Sandstones, filled pull-apart basins adjacent to the transcurrent faults and comprise cover assemblages that help constrain the timing of the Caledonian orogeny. To further investigate the tectonic history and paleogeography of the Raudfjorden-Liefdefjorden-Woodfjorden area of Spitsbergen, NW Svalbard, we analyzed rock samples of the Old Red Sandstones and underlying Precambrian basement complexes for detrital zircon analysis. Laboratory studies of the Old Red Sandstones include the novel Laser Ablation Split Stream (LASS) technique, which allows for simultaneous U-Pb & Lu-Hf isotope analysis of zircon crystals. Lower Devonian Red Bay Group strata contain a range of early Neoproterozoic to Neoarchean detrital zircons with prominent age peaks c. 960, 1050, 1370, 1450, 1650, and 2700 Ma; subordinate Ordovician (c. 460-490 Ma) and Cryogenian (c. 650 Ma) detrital zircons occur in a subset of the samples. Underlying Precambrian metasedimentary rocks are composed of similar earliest Neoproterozoic to Neoarchean age populations, which argues for much of the Red Bay Group to be derived from local basement rocks during thrusting and other faulting. The U-Pb ages and Hf isotope compositions of Paleozoic to Neoarchean detrital zircons are consistent with Arctic crustal evolution, and support the hypothesis that northwestern and northeastern provinces of the Svalbard Caledonides are extruded fragments of the northeast Greenland allochthons. The new Hf isotope results further allow paleogeographic and stratigraphic comparisons with rock assemblages proximal to the North Atlantic Caledonides during the Silurian-Devonian, including the Pearya terrane of Ellesmere Island, Alexander terrane of NW Canada and Alaska, and the Franklinian margin of Arctic Canada.",

            "abstract": "Black carbon (BC) is a troubling particulate. Commonly known as soot, BC forms through the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels, biofuels and biomass. It has a very low albedo compared to natural particulates making it a very efficient absorber of solar radiation. As BC is deposited on snow and ice, albedo is decreased - enhancing solar heating and increasing meltwater production. With rising air temperatures, melting rates of polar ice are increasing and are being enhanced by BC, leading to elevated global sea levels.\nThis study aims to document sources and deposition areas of BC in the Arctic region. Utilizing the HySplit air trajectory model, patterns of BC trajectories can be assessed. Spatial patterns of deposition will be estimated from known sources and source regions can be predicted from known deposition locations through the use of backwards trajectory. Atmospheric circulation transports BC from temperate and polar into the Arctic region. The strength and location of the polar front in relation to the North Atlantic Oscillation is a dominant controlling factor. I expect that BC will be found downwind of industrial sources and will have a substantial effect on snow and ice melt in the Arctic region.\nA comparison of the trajectory analysis from HySplit with site-specific studies will be made. In addition, previous assessments of BC concentrations and industrial processes producing BC will supplement the study. These resources will help identify regions of BC concentration to extrapolate beyond field measurements. This study will examine the influence of BC in the Arctic and identify possible sources contributing to its appearance in the regions cryosphere.",

            "abstract": "The Sierras Pampeanas region of west-central Argentina has long been considered a geologic type-area for flat-slab induced thick-skinned deformation. Frictional coupling between the horizontal subducting plate and South American lithosphere from ~12 Ma to the present provides an obvious causal mechanism for the basement block uplifts that characterize this region. New low temperature thermochronometry data show basement rocks from the central Sierras Pampeanas (~ longitude 66 ̊ W) including Sierras Cadena de Paiman, Velasco and Mazan retain a cooling history of Paleozoic - Mesozoic tectonics events. Results from this study indicate that less than 2 km of basement has been exhumed since at least the Mesozoic. These trends recorded by both apatite fission track (AFT) and apatite helium (AHe) thermochronometry suggest that recent Mio-Pliocene thick-skinned deformation associated with flat-slab subduction follow inherited zones of weakness from Paleozoic terrane sutures and shear zones and Mesozoic rifting. If a Cenozoic foreland basin exisited in this region, its thickness was minimal and was controlled by paleotopography. Pre-Cenozoic cooling ages in these ranges that now reach as high as 4 km imply significant exhumation of basement rocks before the advent of flat slab subduction in the mid-late Miocene. It also suggests that thick-skinned deformation associated with flat slab subduction may at least be facilitated by inherited crustal-scale weaknesses. At the most, pre-existing zones of weakness may be required in regions of thick-skinned deformation. Although flat-slab subduction plays an important role in the exhumation of the Sierras Pampeanas, it is likely not the sole mechanism responsible for thick-skinned deformation in this region. This insight sheds light on the interpretation of modern and ancient regions of thick-skinned deformation in Cordilleran systems.",

This modified model showed excellent performance compared to other published studies but the method needs improvements under dry conditions. To overcome this deficiency, we propose a further refinement to the earlier work of Anayah and Kaluarachchi (2014) using both the complementary method and the Budyko framework. The difference is the addition of the Budyko framework which can capture vegetation cover better than with the complementary method only. This work used 75 AmeriFlux eddy covariance tower sites in USA. The proposed model called GG-NDVI reduced the mean root-mean-squared-error (ERMS) by 32% and 15% for dry and wet regions, respectively, as compared the modified GG method. From the comparison with other complementary methods, the GG-NDVI method showed the lowest mean ERMS of 14.7 mm/month for the dry regions. Most dry regions underestimated ET during the summer seasons. We also observed some decrease in ERMS in the wet regions with increasing precipitation and with higher plant density associated with high ET. While the GG-NDVI method showed good performance in most regions, a better parameter than NDVI is needed to accommodate regions with dense vegetation cover.",

This method was previously testing, modeling the October 9, 1995, Jalisco Earthquake and Tsunami, the results obtained were similar to the field observations and testimonies performed in 20 sites along 100 km on the coast of Jalisco, related to the height and flood extension reached during the tsunami. To estimate the vulnerability the following variables were considered: distribution of population density, population by age or physical limitation, housing characteristics, level of education, cost of goods in the affected area, location of key facilities, cost of cleaning the affected area, and change of land use policy in the Puerto Vallarta area. The study indicates that the vulnerability is very high in the Salado basin, and high in the Pitillal and Mascota-Ameca basins.",

            "abstract": "Nitrate is one of the most common contaminants in the world's aquifers, streams, and nearshore waters. Theoretical and experimental studies have shown that in-stream processing of nitrate by hyporheic exchange is a major control on the magnitude of nitrogen export from watersheds and it can be affected by groundwater-stream interactions via gaining or losing conditions. However, implication of this observation for stream function and water quality is not yet clear. In this study, we set out to answer the question: can groundwater-stream interactions affect nitrate removal within streams and exacerbate surface water quality impairments, even in cases where the groundwater itself is not a direct source of nitrate? We couple a model for local hyporheic exchange and regional groundwater upwelling to a nitrate fate and transport model to investigate the influence of gaining stream conditions on nitrate processing in the hyporheic zone over a range of Damkohler numbers (Da = transport time over respiration time) and for three different water quality scenarios (agricultural-impacted stream, urban runoff impacted stream, and sewage impacted stream). We find that upwelling groundwater perturbs nitrate processing within the hyporheic zone by increasing the Da number at which significant denitrification occurs and, in two of three cases, causing sediments to “switch” from being a net sink of nitrate (by denitrification) to a net source of nitrate (by nitrification). These results provide some insights on how upwelling groundwater can influence nutrient processing in the hyporheic zone of streams, and demonstrate that changes in regional hydrology (e.g., brought on by climate change and land-use change) can significantly impact important ecosystem services and receiving water quality.",

            "abstract": "Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) represent one of the most intriguing examples of iron biomineralization and magnetic navigation in nature. MTB synthesize magnetic nanocrystals, called magnetosomes, which act as an incorporated compass for navigation purposes (magnetotaxis). MTB are ubiquitous organisms living in chemically stratified freshwater and marine environments, where they contribute significantly to the Fe cycle. Magnetosomes accumulate as fossil MTB remains in sediment (magnetofossils). The recent development of magnetic measurement protocols enabling to detect small magnetosome concentrations among complex iron mineral mixtures led to the discovery that magnetofossil preservation over geological times is not uncommon. Therefore, magnetofossils can play an important role in sedimentary records of the Earth's magnetic field, as well as conveying selective information about past environmental conditions (e.g. redox conditions and nutrient concentration). Paleomagnetic and environmental applications require us to understand the processes that control MTB occurrence, magnetofossil formation and preservation, and the final alignment with the Earth's magnetic field. Our current knowledge relies mostly on experiments performed with cultured MTB in aqueous solutions, under physical and chemical conditions that do not necessarily reproduce those encountered in sediment. These experiments have been pivotal for understanding magnetosome growth and the fundaments of magnetotaxis. On the other hand, recent investigations of living MTB populations in sediment with specially developed observation techniques led to unexpected findings, with important implications for magnetotaxis models, MTB ecology, and, indirectly, for modeling the acquisition of natural magnetizations in bioturbated sediments.\nLudwig, P. et al.

This study was conducted to determine the effect of mill ash and three biochars on sugarcane yield and sandy soil properties. Mill ash and biochars produced from hardwood yard waste (HY), barn shavings with horse manure (HM), and rice hulls (RH) were incorporated at 1% and 2% (by weight) to sandy soils in a lysimeter experiment. A control without amendment and an often-used commercial practice of mill ash applied at 6% (AS6) were also included. Results showed that RH2 and AS6 produced greater biomass and sucrose yield compared with the control. According to critical nutrient level analysis, RH and AS amendments also resulted in the highest silicon content, which had a positive correlation with increasing sugarcane yield. In addition, RH2 and AS6 increased total phosphorus, Mehlich-3 phosphorus, and cation exchange capacity (CEC) compared with the control. While CEC remained constant with AS2 and AS6 applications, CEC significantly increased over time with RH2. Moreover, higher amendment applications increased soil organic matter compared with the control and did not decrease over time, which suggests a positive influence for long term carbon sustainability and nutrient cycling in sandy soils. Overall, RH2 and AS6 have the most potential to be used as amendments in sandy soils of South Florida due to their positive effects on soil properties, which improved sugarcane yield. However, no negative consequences were found with the application of any other amendment in terms of sugarcane growth and soil quality. Future research should focus on the use of RH and AS amendments on long-term field-scale studies, and the economic feasibility of a single year application on plant and ratoon cane yields.",

A record of this cooling over the last 13 years has been provided by Mlynczak et al. [2014]. Nitric Oxide emissions in concert with EUV photons, auroral particles, and neutral thermosphere circulation determine if geomagnetic storms will deliver a sudden powerful upheaval of Earth's upper atmosphere or a damped event. In this talk I will review recent findings about the forecastability of solar and magnetospheric control of this important thermospheric trace constituent. In particular, I will discuss the role of pseudo-streamers and helmet streamers in the solar wind, and the possible role of magnetic cloud orientation, in determining the extent of thermospheric NO storm response.

            "abstract": "Groundwater management depends on the type and quality of field data available describing a given aquifer system. Our increasing reliance on groundwater, especially as traditional surface supplies continue to be overexploited due to rising population and standard of living, requires that we better understand the state of our subsurface supplies. Groundwater aquifers, and the water flow models that relate aquifer parameters to management strategies, are typically characterized in terms of how much water is available at any point in the basin (storativity), and how easily water can flow from one point to another (transmissivity). Often these parameters are estimated by field drawdown tests, in which a known quantity of water is withdrawn from the aquifer, and the resulting spatial and temporal distribution of hydraulic head analyzed.\nPumping tests can be expensive and time consuming, so that for most aquifer systems very few drawdown test data sets exist. Here we show that estimates for storativity and hydraulic conductance can be derived from time series InSAR observations coupled with well head measurements. While this requires the presence of monitoring wells in the basin, monitor-only wells are often fairly plentiful. Comparison of hydraulic head and InSAR deformation data at a monitoring well yields the ratio of head to subsidence and any time delay between the two, from which we solve for the needed conductivity and storativity. We present examples of these parameters associated with groundwater systems in the San Luis Valley, CO, and the Central Valley area of California, as observed by several spaceborne radar systems and validated by comparison with field data.\n The fundamental relation between pressure and stress resulting in changes in hydraulic head yields a simple linear relationship between deformation Δb, hydraulic head Δh, and skeletal storage coefficient: Sk = Δb / Δh, so that measuring deformation everywhere above an aquifer over time yields change in head. Similarly, InSAR-observed temporal response of deformation following changes in head allows us to estimate conductivity in the reservoir. These tools point toward an approach for forecasting future head levels.",

            "abstract": "Accurate subduction zone thermal models are necessary to understand a wide range of geophysical and geochemical processes, including: metamorphic reaction progress, mantle wedge hydration, and melt generation. For decades, plate convergence rate and subducting plate age and dip have been recognized as basic factors affecting subduction zone temperatures. Recent discoveries highlight the important effects of fluid circulation in oceanic lithosphere on subduction zone temperatures. However, there are contrasting hypotheses for the distribution of the regions within the oceanic lithosphere that host vigorous fluid circulation: one with a constant thickness aquifer extending both seaward and landward of the trench, one with an aquifer that thickens as it approaches the trench (due to bend-related faulting) but assumes vigorous fluid circulation only occurs prior to subduction, and a hybrid that considers both aquifer thickening seaward of the trench and continued circulation in the subducting plate. I examine the effects of bend-related aquifer thickening on temperatures within the Japan Trench subduction zone with a suite of thermal models. Kawada et al. [2014] hypothesize that plate-bending faults offshore northern Japan increase the thickness of the oceanic crustal aquifer, and therefore influence heat redistribution in the system. Existing models explore the effects of aquifer thickening on heat flux seaward of the trench, but they do not examine the effects of this process on temperatures within the subduction zone; additionally, they treat the aquifer seaward of the trench as completely isolated from the aquifer in the subducted plate. Here, I exploit the fact that aquifer thickening from the outer rise to the trench and continued fluid circulation in subducting crust are expected to produce distinct surface heat flux anomalies, in order to constrain the thermal effects of each process. I find the combinations of the amount of aquifer thickening and the degree of continued circulation in the subducting crust that yield results consistent with surface heat flux observations.",

Under the right conditions, the need to share scarce water resources can act as a catalyst for dialogue between otherwise hostile neighbors. Yet the strategic reluctance of the involved parties to share water diversion and use data remains a major barrier that raises the probability of conflict. In that context, high-quality satellite data are progressively available to monitor water resources beyond political boundaries. These datasets have an increasing role to play in the allocation of shared waters. We develop a game theoretical framework to predict their effect on transboundary water negotiations.\nWe consider repetitions of a game between two countries that have a water allocation agreement for transboundary river flow. The upstream country can observe the available flow in any given year and decide whether or not to provide her neighbor with the agreed upon river discharge. The downstream country cannot observe the initially available flow. He only observes the water allocated provided by his upstream neighbor and can take actions to impose a sanction on her if he can confidently determine that the agreement has been breached. In that context, satellite monitoring data will affect the informational advantage of the upstream country and increase her probability of either abiding by the agreement or being caught when breaching it. We find that the informed equilibrium will produce a lower probability of conflict, but changes in both players’ positions regarding equitable allocation may destabilize the existing agreement in the short term.",

Average half-life of indaziflam was obtained as 40±11 days and indaziflam concentrations consistently decreased with increasing soil depth and time. Indaziflam concentrations were greater in the unimpacted area than in the impacted area and mass recoveries were greater in plots treated with 36.5 g a.i. ha-1 compared with those treated with 73.1 g a.i. ha-1.

Compared with experimental investigations on physical properties of crystalline iron alloys as candidates for the inner core, there is a remarkable lack of data on properties of liquid iron-rich alloys due to experimental challenges. Liquid properties are usually investigated at pressures under 10 GPa, far below the conditions of the outer core. This lack of data on liquid iron-rich alloys has prompted us to employ a combination of experiments at low-pressures and computations at relevant core conditions. Among the lighter elements considered for the Earth’s core, carbon is considered a leading candidate for the principal light element alloying with iron in the core. In this study, we have determined the structure, velocity, and viscosity of Fe-Ni-C liquids under high pressures in a Paris-Edinburgh Cell by means of X-ray diffraction, ultrasonic interferometry, and sinking/floating sphere viscometry, respectively. A short-range atomic structure transition was observed in the Fe-Ni-C liquids between 4 and 6 GPa. First-principles calculations based on the Density Functional Theory were performed to provide insights into the experimentally-determined structural and viscoelastic properties. We used the low-pressure experimental data to benchmark and validate the theoretical results at similar conditions, and then explored the physical properties of Fe-Ni-C liquids under core conditions by theoretical calculations. The results were used to provide new insights into the carbon-rich outer core composition models for the Earth and other terrestrial planets such as Mercury.",

            "abstract": "Glacial cycles transfer ∼5×10^19 kg of water between the oceans and ice sheets, causing pressure changes in the upper mantle with consequences for the melting of Earth’s interior. Forced with Plio-Pleistocene sea-level variations, theoretical models of mid-ocean ridge magma/mantle dynamics predict temporal variations up to 10% in melt supply to the base of the crust. Moreover, a transport model for a perfectly incompatible element suggests that CO2 emissions from mid-ocean ridges could vary by a similar proportion, though with a longer time-lag.\nBathymetry from the Australian-Antarctic ridge shows statistically significant spectral energy near the Milankovitch periods of 23, 41, and 100 thousand years, which is consistent with model predictions. These results suggest that abyssal hills record the magmatic response to changes in sea level. The mechanism by which variations in the rate of melt supply are expressed in the bathymetry is not understood.\nThe same pressure variations that modulate the melting rate could also modulate the depth of the onset of silicate melting. As ice sheets grow and sea level drops, this onset deepens, causing melting at the base of the silicate melting regime. Excess highly incompatible elements like CO2 enter the melt and begin their journey to the ridge axis. Tens of thousands of years later, this additional CO2 flux is emitted into the climate system. Because of its delay with respect to sea-level change, the predicted variation in CO2 emissions could represent a restoring force on climate (and sea-level) excursions. This mechanism has a response time determined by the time scale of melt transport; it potentially introduces a resonant frequency into the climate system.",

            "abstract": "Traditionally, economists have treated the management of water quality and water quantity as separate problems. However, there are some water management issues for which economic analysis requires the simultaneous consideration of water quality and quantity policies and outcomes. Water reuse, which has expanded significantly over the last several decades, is one of these issues. Analyzing the cost effectiveness and social welfare outcomes of adopting water reuse requires a joint water quality-quantity optimization framework because, at its most basic level, water reuse requires decision makers to consider (a) its potential for alleviating water scarcity, (b) the quality to which the water should be treated prior to reuse, and (c) the benefits of discharging less wastewater into the environment. In this project, we develop a theoretical model of water reuse management to illustrate how the availability of water reuse technologies and practices can lead to a departure from established rules in the water resource economics literature for the optimal allocation of freshwater and water pollution abatement. We also conduct an econometric analysis of a unique dataset of county-level water reuse from the state of Florida over the seventeen-year period between 1996 and 2012 in order to determine whether water quality or scarcity concerns drive greater adoption of water reuse practices.",

            "abstract": "Multidecadal drought during the early Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA, 800-1200 CE) in Mesoamerica has been implicated in the demise of many pre-Columbian societies, including the Maya. The mechanisms behind these droughts, however, are poorly understood. Researchers most often interpret these records as tracking the mean position of the ITCZ, with a southward shifted ITCZ resulting in Mesoamerican drought. This is puzzling, however, because our dynamical understanding of the ITCZ and its role in interhemispheric heat transport would suggest a more northward shifted ITCZ during the MCA. Here, we evaluate two hypotheses to reconcile existing proxies and dynamics. First, we assess whether evidence for dry conditions during the MCA is robust across multiple Mesoamerican proxy records, focusing on the influence of radiometric dating uncertainty on estimates of drought timing. Second, we use control simulations of CCSM4 and HadCM3, as well as a broader synthesis of oceanic and terrestrial proxies, to explore the mechanisms responsible for long-term drought in Mesoamerica. Ultimately, we suggest that a temporary slowdown of the AMOC, either internally or externally forced, combined with local and regional land surface feedbacks can explain these droughts in Mesoamerica.",

            "abstract": "We present observations that illustrate the energy-dependence and L-shell dependence of radiation belt dynamics. We survey events in 2013 and analyze individual events in more detail. The survey data show: (a) Lower-energy electrons are enhanced more often than higher energies. (b) Events that fill the slot region are more common at lower energies. (c) Enhancements of electrons in the inner zone are more common at lower energies. And (d) even when events do not fully fill the slot region, enhancements at lower-energies tend to extend to lower L-shells than higher energies. The outer zone, inner zone, and slot region all occupy regions of space that are strongly energy dependent. During enhancement events the outer zone extends to lower L-shells at lower energies and higher L-shells at higher energies. The inner zone shows the opposite with an outer boundary at higher L-shells for lower energies. Both boundaries are nearly straight in log(energy) vs. L-shell space. At energies below a few hundred keV radiation belt electron penetration through the slot region into the inner zone is commonplace but the number and frequency of “slot filling” events decreases with increasing energy. The inner zone is enhanced only at energies that penetrate through the slot. Analysis shows that at least three processes may determine which electrons penetrate into the slot and inner zone: (1) enhanced convective electric fields at low L-shells, (2) impulsive, substorm-associated injections at low L-shells, and (3) slower radial diffusion and interaction with plasmaspheric hiss. These new observations challenge some of our long-held pictures of what the radiation belts look like and how they behave.",

            "abstract": "Statistical studies of radiation belt enhancement events typically rely on other observations to define an “event”. Those other observations could be based on Dst, solar wind speed, CME or CIR occurrence, etc. It is also interesting to start with an electron event and ask which geomagnetic or solar wind driving conditions are (or are not) related to those events. However, such studies have been hindered by the absence of a uniform, quantitative definition of “events”. This is particularly true in phases of the solar cycle where background radiation belt fluxes are low but relative changes are large. Such events would be missed by picking an arbitrary flux threshold to define events. We examine two solar cycles of geosynchronous measurements to define the probability distribution of events with both fixed and solar cycle-dependent event criteria. These distributions allow us to define events based on radiation belt electron data alone, to classify types of enhancement events, and to ask: What conditions produced that class of events? The same distributions have important space weather forecasting applications as well. We can now quantify the criteria that define enhancement events that can be expected to occur once per month, once per year, or once per solar cycle.",

            "abstract": "Over the last century, the two dams blocked the upstream movement of anadromous fish to over 90% of the Elwha River watershed on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington State. These dams also restricted the downstream movement of sediment, wood, and other organic materials to the lower river and estuary. Populations of all Pacific salmon species and steelhead in the Elwha became critically low, habitat complexity decreased below the dams, and downstream coastal habitats became sediment starved. Simultaneous deconstruction of the two dams began in September 2011 was completed in September of 2014. The recent removal of the dams has been an opportunity to explore linkages among changes in sediment supply, salmonid populations, and ecosystem attributes. Preliminary findings focus on the delivery of millions of metric tonnes of sediment to the main river, its floodplain, and nearshore, the re-establishment of a natural wood delivery regime, the re-colonization of the upper watershed by anadromous fish, insights into functional relationships among salmonid populations and life history strategies, and the associated effects of all these elements on the aquatic and terrestrial foodwebs. This talk will provide an overview of the Elwha restoration project, and highlight recent changes observed during dam removal.",

            "abstract": "Inferring the relative magnitude of tsunamis generated during earthquakes based on the characteristics of sandy coastal deposits is a challenging problem. Using a hydrodynamic and sediment transport model, we explore whether the volume of sandy tsunami deposits can be used to infer tsunami magnitude and seafloor deformation. For large subduction zone earthquakes specifically, we are testing the hypothesis that onshore tsunami deposit volume is correlated with nearshore tsunami wave height and coseismic slip. First, we test this hypothesis using onshore tsunami deposit volume data and offshore slip for the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. This test considers tsunami deposit volume and offshore slip as they vary alongshore across a wide range of sediment sources, offshore and onshore slopes, and boundary roughness conditions. Preliminary analysis suggests that a strong correlation exists between onshore tsunami deposit volume and adjacent offshore coseismic slip, so long as ample sediment were available along the coast to be eroded. Second, we apply a Delft3D tsunami inundation and sediment transport model to Stardust Bay in the U.S. Aleutian Islands, where 6 tsunamis in the last ~1700 years deposited marine sand across a coastal plain as much as 800 m inland and up to ~15 m above mean sea level. The youngest sand sheet, probably deposited by a tsunami generated during the 1957 Andreanof Islands earthquake (Mw 8.6), has the smallest sediment volume. Several older deposits have larger volumes. Models show that ≥10 m of slip on the Aleutian subduction megathrust offshore of Stardust Bay could produce the onshore sediment volume measured for the 1957 deposit. Older tsunami deposits of greater volume require up to 14 m of megathrust slip. Model sensitivity studies show that onshore sediment volume is most sensitive to megathrust slip and less sensitive to other unknowns such as width of fault rupture and roughness of inundated terrain",

However, we show that, during the 17 March 2015 great storm, TEC and F2 region electron density peak height (hmF2) over Millstone Hill increased, but the F2 region electron density peak (NmF2) decreased significantly during the storm-enhanced density (SED) phase of the storm compared with the quiet-time ionosphere. This SED occurred where there was a negative ionospheric storm near the F2 peak and below it. The weak ionosphere below the F2 peak resulted in much reduced downward heat conduction for the electrons, trapping the heat in the topside. This, in turn, increased the topside scale height, so that, even though electron densities at the F2 peak were depleted, TEC increased in the SED. The depletion in NmF2 was probably caused by an increase in the density of the molecular neutrals, resulting in enhanced recombination.

The major, most organized changes tend to occur close to the centers of flaring regions, near the main neutral line and/or in twisted sunspots. Fields close to the neutral line tend to collapse downward and inward, consistent with compression rather than rotation of the vector field. In sunspots the twist (or azimuthal component around the sunspot axis) tends to decrease. In a limited number of cases particularly well-observed by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on SDO and the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI) on the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO), the evolution of the photospheric magnetic vector field can be related to changes in coronal magnetic structure to provide a coherent description of the magnetic changes during the different phases of a flare.\nThis work was supported by NASA grant NNX14AE05G.",

Under the full forcing, during the present warming period (PWP; 1901-1999), Pacific SST shows larger warming over the whole tropical Pacific region than the subtropical Pacific region. This pattern is composed by an El Niño-like SST gradient due to the greenhouse gas forcing and a La Niña-like SST gradient due to the natural forcing. Two sensitivity experiments, the PWP under greenhouse gas forcing and Medieval Warming Period (MWP; 751-1250) under natural forcing, were used to examine the mechanisms. The results showed that, under the greenhouse forcing, the larger warming over eastern tropical Pacific is induced by increased surface net heat flux mainly contributed by short-wave radiation and latent heat flux. Under the natural forcing, the larger warming over western tropical Pacific is induced by changes of vertical heat transportation caused by the surface wind anomalies.",

In particular, understanding how uncertainties propagate in porous media with nonlinear two-phase flow is essential, yet challenging, in reservoir simulation and hydrology. We give a computationally efficient and numerically accurate method to estimate the one-point probability density (PDF) and cumulative distribution functions (CDF) of the water saturation for the stochastic Buckley-Leverett problem when the probability distributions of the permeability and porosity fields are available.\nThe method draws inspiration from the streamline approach and expresses the distributions of interest essentially in terms of an analytically derived mapping and the distribution of the time of flight. In a large class of applications the latter can be estimated at low computational costs (even via conventional Monte Carlo). Once the water saturation distribution is determined, any one-point statistics thereof can be obtained, especially its average and standard deviation. Moreover, rarely available in other approaches, yet crucial information such as the probability of rare events and saturation quantiles (e.g. P10, P50 and P90) can be derived from the method.

            "abstract": "Bedload transport rates are frequently different for an equivalent stage or discharge on the rising and falling limbs of a hydrograph. This asymmetry in transport results in hysteresis in sediment rating curves, which although widely documented, is not well understood mechanistically. A major factor contributing to the uncertain origins of hysteresis is the difficulty associated with making continuous bedload transport measurements in large rivers during floods. However, recent work demonstrates that seismic signals from rivers can provide quantitative constraints on the evolution of bedload transport during storms on large rivers, when direct measurements would otherwise be impossible. Here, we analyze patterns in the amplitude of seismic shaking along the Cho-Shui River in Taiwan and along the Erlenbach Stream in Switzerland during a total of 10 storm events. The storms exhibit varying amounts of hysteresis in the amplitude of seismic shaking as a function of flood discharge (as measured from nearby gages). However, the amount of hysteresis, which we quantify with a non-dimensional metric, correlates strongly with the degree of asymmetry in the flood hydrograph. Specifically, the degree of hysteresis observed during an event scales inversely with the ratio of the rising limb time to the recessional limb time. Flume experiments and field observations indicate that vertical sorting and, hence, armor formation in gravel-bedded river channels is more pronounced during longer storms. Although we lack direct constraints on the bed surface during the observed events, our results support the possibility that differential gravel sorting on the rising and falling limbs is responsible for the observed hysteresis. Specifically, our results imply that for a given stage, armor will be better developed on a slow recessional limb, resulting in lower gravel transport rates and a pattern of clockwise hysteresis.",

            "abstract": "Although wide, longitudinally traceable, paired strath terraces in river canyons are frequently argued to reflect periods of higher sediment supply, there is no consensus on how changes in sediment supply translate into dramatic changes in valley morphology. Here, quantitative analysis of LiDAR data is combined with field observations in Arroyo Seco, in the Santa Lucia Range of Central California, to develop a conceptual model for paired bedrock terrace formation and its connection to sediment supply.\nThe most recently formed bedrock terrace in Arroyo Seco grades onto a prominent alluvial fan surface, suggesting that planation of straths in Arroyo Seco occurs as downstream alluvial fans aggrade. This aggradation apparently buffers Arroyo Seco’s bedrock channel from base level fall on the Reliz Canyon Fault, which separates the bedrock and alluvial sections of the river. Notably, despite the fact that bedrock terraces grade smoothly onto alluvial fan surfaces, the deep aggradation of sediment downstream is not seen upstream in bedrock channel sections. Gravel on straths is typically only 0.5-1 m thick. Instead, excess gravel appears to be accommodated by the lateral planation of the wide strath itself. LiDAR evidence suggests that strath planation is associated with braiding, which is often triggered by increases in sediment supply. Given the high lateral mobility of braided streams and the extremely fractured (and hence easily detached) mudstone valley walls along Arroyo Seco, braiding provides a simple connection between sediment supply and lateral planation in Arroyo Seco.\nIn Arroyo Seco, fan incision (under decreased sediment supply) should exhume a bedrock step whose height represents the accumulated fault slip during fan aggradation. The upstream propagation of this exhumed step as a knickpoint provides a simple mechanism to connect drops in sediment supply to rapid vertical incision, valley narrowing and strath terrace formation. Long profile data for Arroyo Seco shows clear evidence that the last two generations of strath terraces terminate upstream at knickpoints.\nOSL dating (Taylor and Sweetkind, 2014) constrains the formation of the two most recent strath terraces to the last ~ 35 kyr, implying at least two reductions in sediment supply relative to capacity during this interval.",

            "abstract": "The submarine landslide associated with gas hydrate is a potential risk for environment and engineering projects, and thus from long time ago it has been a hot topic of hydrate research. The study target is Slipstream submarine landslide, one of the slope failures observed on the frontal ridges of the Northern Cascadia accretionary margin off Vancouver Island. The previous studies indicated a possible connection between this submarine landslide feature and gas hydrate, whose occurrence is indicated by a prominent bottom-simulating reflector (BSR), at a depth of ~265-275 m beneath the seafloor (mbsf). The OBS (Ocean Bottom Seismometer) data collected during SeaJade (Seafloor Earthquake Array – Japan Canada Cascadia Experiment) project were used to derive the subseafloor velocity structure for both P- and S-wave using travel times picked from refraction and reflection events. The P-wave velocity structure above the BSR showed anomalous high velocities of about 2.0 km/s at shallow depths of 100 mbsf, closely matching the estimated depth of the glide plane (100 ± 10 m). Forward modelling of S-waves was carried out using the data from the OBS horizontal components. The S-wave velocities, interpreted in conjunction with the P-wave results, provide the key constraints on the gas hydrate distribution within the pores. The hydrate distribution in the pores is important for determining concentrations, and also for determining the frame strength which is critical for controlling slope stability of steep frontal ridges. The increase in S-wave velocity suggests that the hydrate is distributed as part of the load-bearing matrix to increase the rigidity of the sediment.",

Watershed models can be classified based on what media are included, what processes are dealt with, and what approaches are taken. In term of media, a watershed may include segregated overland regime, river-canal-open channel networks, ponds-reservoirs-small lakes, and subsurface media. It may also include integrated media of all these or a partial set of these as well as man-made control structures. In term of processes, a watershed model may deal with coupled or decoupled hydrological and biogeochemical cycles. These processes include fluid flow, thermal transport, salinity transport, sediment transport, reactive transport, and biota and microbe kinetics. In terms of approaches, either parametric or physics-based approach can be taken. This talk discusses the evolution of watershed models in the past sixty years. The advances of watershed models center around their increasing design capability to foster these segregated or integrated media and coupled or decoupled processes. Widely used models developed by academia, research institutes, government agencies, and private industries will be reviewed in terms of the media and processes included as well as approaches taken. Many types of potential benchmark problems in general can be proposed and will be discussed. This presentation will focus on three benchmark problems of biogeochemical cycles. These three problems, dealing with water quality transport, will be formulated in terms of reactive transport. Simulation results will be illustrated using WASH123D, a watershed model developed and continuously updated by the author and his PhD graduates.\nKeywords: Hydrological Cycles, Biogeochemical Cycles, Biota Kinetics, Parametric Approach, Physics-based Approach, Reactive Transport.",

            "abstract": "In order to clarify the ULF seismo-magnetic phenomena, a sensitive geomagnetic network has been installed in Kanto, Japan. In this study, we have analyzed geomagnetic data observed during the past decade in Izu, Boso, and Kakioka (KAK) stations. To verify the relation between ULF geomagnetic anomalies and local seismicity, statistical studies by superposed epoch analysis (SEA) have been carried out. The results have indicated that before a sizeable earthquake there are clearly higher probabilities of ULF anomalies than after the earthquake: for Seikoshi (SKS) station in Izu, about 20~30 days before, one week and few days before, and one day after the event statistical results of daily counts are significant; for Kiyosumi (KYS) station in Boso around two weeks before, few days before, and one day after the event; For KAK station, 30 days before, about 2 weeks before, few days before, and 2 days after the event.\nTo find out the detailed waveform of anomalous magnetic signals, waveform analysis has been performed. The results show that there are mainly two kinds of seismo-magnetic signature. (1) Noise-like signals: Compared with the background, the signals exhibit small increases of amplitudes at a wide frequency range. (2) Transient/quasi-rectangular signals: the signals have transient/quasi-rectangular waveforms with amplitudes of several nT. The noise-like signals usually persist for several days or even a few weeks, and are mainly associated with large earthquakes; the transient/quasi-rectangular signals have durations of few seconds to few ten seconds, and are registered mainly during slow slip events.\nFinally, we have evaluated the precursory information of ULF geomagnetic signals for local sizeable earthquakes using Molchan’s error diagram. The probability gain is around 2-4 against a Poisson model. The above results have indicated that the ULF seismo-magnetic phenomena clearly contain precursory information and have a possibility of improving the forecasting of large earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "During the last several years, various new results were reported on the LPO (lattice-preferred orientation) of olivine that would require major modifications to the paradigms established by the previous studies (for a review see (Karato et al., 2008)). They include (i) the development of strong LPO in the diffusion creep (Miyazaki et al., 2013), (ii) the development of the B-type fabric under dry, low stress torsion deformation at the presence of a small amount of melt (Kohlstedt and Holtzman, 2009) (also Holtzman et al., 2003), and (iii) the development of the A-type fabric under water-rich conditions (Ohuchi and Irifune, 2013).\nI will discuss these results based partly on the review of existing results and new results from my lab on olivine morphology. (Miyazaki et al., 2013) reported that substantial LPO develops in diffusion creep in forsterite-diopside aggregates and also the intensity of LPO increases with temperature. They attributed this to the anisotropic crystal morphology of forsterite that appears to depend on temperature. I first note that these results are similar to often observed non-negligible LPO in the diffusion creep (or superplasticity) regime when conditions are close to the boundary to dislocation creep regime (calcite: (Pieri et al., 2001; Walker et al., 1991), perovskite: (Karato et al., 1995)). And in these cases, non-negligible LPO in diffusion creep regime is attributed to the contribution from dislocation glide near the conditions close to the transition to dislocation creep regime. The observed temperature dependence can be interpreted by this model. I will report the results of experimental studies on olivine morphology as a function of temperature to test this model.\nThe causes for the B-type LPO in partially molten olivine, and the A-type LPO under water-rich conditions are enigmatic. Possible causes for these observations will be discussed based partly on the current knowledge of deformation of olivine.",

            "abstract": "Most structural geology articles do not state significance levels, report confidence intervals, or perform regressions to find trends. This is, in part, because structural data tend to include directions, orientations, ellipsoids, and tensors, which are not treatable by elementary statistics. We describe a full procedural methodology for the statistical treatment of ellipsoidal data. We use a reconstructed dataset of deformed ooids in Maryland from Cloos (1947) to illustrate the process. Normalized ellipsoids have five degrees of freedom and can be represented by a second order tensor. This tensor can be permuted into a five dimensional vector that belongs to a vector space and can be treated with standard multivariate statistics. Cloos made several claims about the distribution of deformation in the South Mountain fold, Maryland, and we reexamine two particular claims using hypothesis testing: 1) octahedral shear strain increases towards the axial plane of the fold; 2) finite strain orientation varies systematically along the trend of the axial trace as it bends with the Appalachian orogen. We then test the null hypothesis that the southern segment of South Mountain is the same as the northern segment. This test illustrates the application of ellipsoidal statistics, which combine both orientation and shape. We report confidence intervals for each test, and graphically display our results with novel plots. This poster illustrates the importance of statistics in structural geology, especially when working with noisy or small datasets.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - HumanUsesofForestedWatershedsPoster.pdf\nHumans have long favored settlement along rivers for access to water supply for drinking and agriculture, for transport corridors, and for food sources. Additionally, settlement in or near montane forests include benefits such as food sources, wood supply, esthetic values, and high quality water resources derived from watersheds where upstream human disturbance and environmental degradation is generally reduced. However, the advantages afforded by these riparian and montane settings pose episodic risks for communities located there as floods, landslides, and wildfires cause loss of life, destroy infrastructure, and damage or destroy crops. A basic understanding of flood probability and magnitude as well as hillslope stability by residents in these environments can mitigate these risks. Early humans presumably developed some degree of knowledge about these risks by means of their long periods of occupation in these environments and their observations of seasonal and storm rainfall patterns and river discharge, which became more refined as agriculture developed over the past 10,000 years. Modern global urbanization, particularly in regions of rapid economic growth, has resulted in much of this \"organic\" knowledge being lost, as rural populations move into megacities, many of which encroach on floodplains and mountain fronts. Moreover, the most likely occupants of these hazardous locations are often economically constrained, increasing their vulnerabity. Effective stewardship of river floodplains and upstream montane forests yields a key ecosystem service, which in addition to the well-known services, ie. water, hydroelectric energy, etc., provides a risk mitigation service, by reducing hazard and vulnerability. Puerto Rico, Panama, and Venezuela illustrate a range of practices and results, providing useful examples for planners and land use managers.",

            "abstract": "High fidelity modeling of an asteroid impact requires a known size, mass, shape, entry orientation, entry speed, entry angle, time and location of entry, and material properties of the impacting asteroid. Much of that information can be gathered from small asteroids on an impact trajectory with Earth while they are on approach, given sufficient warning time. That makes small asteroid impacts uniquely suited for collecting data to validate such models. One-meter sized asteroids impact Earth about once a week, 4-meter sized asteroids impact once a year. So far, only asteroid 2008 TC3 was observed in space, characterized prior to impact, and then recovered in part as meteorites on the ground. The next TC3-like impact could provide more warming time to study the impact in detail. Close to 70 percent of all asteroid impacts on Earth occur over the ocean. Hence, small asteroid impact observations require an instrumented airborne platform to take a multi-disciplined research team to the right location at the right time. From a safe 100-km distance, the impact would be observed low enough in the sky to study the process of fragmentation that dictates at which altitude the kinetic energy is deposited that can cause an airburst. Constraints on radiative heating, ablation rate, and fragmentation processes can be obtained from measuring the air plasma emission escaping the shock, elemental atom line emissions and excitation conditions, pressure broadening, and deceleration in the plane of the known trajectory. It is also possible to measure wake, lightcurve and air plasma emission line intensities early in flight that can be used to evaluate the presence of regolith and the internal cohesion of asteroids. The main element abundance (asteroid composition) can be measured for individual fragments, while CN-band emission can point to the presence of organic matter. Such information will help constrain the meteorite type if no meteorites can be recovered in an over-the-ocean impact (e.g., ordinary chondrites with low or high iron content). The observed altitude of disruption can be used to direct airborne dust collection efforts in the atmosphere. To prepare for such observing campaign and the quick recovery of meteorites, if possible, an international \"Next TC3 Consortium\" was established. For more information: http://impact.seti.org.",

            "abstract": "An absolute plate motion model is required to address issues such as the thermo-chemical evolution of Earth’s mantle, yet all such models have to rely on indirect inferences. Given that azimuthal seismic anisotropy in the uppermost mantle appears to show fast axes parallel to seafloor spreading, we explore a new, spreading-aligned reference frame. We show that this reference frame indeed fits azimuthal seismic anisotropy from surface waves and SKS splitting very well. The corresponding Euler pole (at 64∘E, 61∘S, with rotation of ~0.25∘/Myr) is close to those of hot spot reference frames, as expected if hot spots were due to relatively stationary mantle plumes. The new Euler pole is also close to that of ridge motion minimizing models, and its amplitude broadly consistent with estimates of net rotation generation by mantle convection with strong continental keels and a weak asthenosphere. The finding that relative spreading aligns with absolute plate motions implies that ridges are passive and that transform faults weak, allowing for easy realignment of spreading centers during slab-driven plate reorganizations. We also explore the implications of our new reference frame for slabs where we find that all of the major eastern Pacific subduction zone trenches are rolling back (away from the overriding plate). Fast trench advance is only predicted in regions with strong corner flow and pivoting (Tonga), continental plate interactions (Sumatra and Caribbean), and most clearly in an ocean-ocean setting for the Philippine Sea Plate where double subduction, slab-slab interactions may explain the fast advance of the Marianas. We conclude that a net rotation pole guided by the spreading-aligned model could indeed represent a comprehensive reference frame for present-day plate motions with respect to the deep mantle.",

The near-infrared camera of FAI is capable of providing up to two auroral images per second, ideal for investigation of pulsating auroras. The auroral pulsations were observed within the auroral bulge formed during a substorm interval on 2014 February 19. This first satellite view of these pulsations from FAI reveals that (1) several pulsating auroral channels (PACs) occur within the auroral bulge, (2) periods of the intensity pulsations span over one decade within the auroral bulge, and (3) there is no apparent trend of longer pulsation periods associated with higher latitudes for these PACs. Although PACs resemble in some respect stable pulsating auroras reported previously but they have several important differences in characteristics.PACs are not embedded in or emerging from omega bands or torches and are located at significant distances from the equatorward boundary of the auroral oval, unlike the characteristics of stable pulsating auroras.",

            "abstract": "To explain the ~90 ppm lower atmospheric CO2 content during the Last Glacial Maximum, much effort has been focused on the mechanisms that helped to limit the outgassing of CO2 from the deep ocean to the atmosphere via the Southern Ocean. Field measurements and modeling studies suggest that the North Atlantic Ocean has been an important sink of CO2 during preindustrial and modern times. However, the role of the North Atlantic in sequestering atmospheric CO2 in the past largely remains unconstrained. Here, we use a suite of geochemical proxies to reconstruct nutrient and carbonate ion concentrations of both surface and deep waters in the North Atlantic during the last ~25 kyr. When normalized to the same nutrient levels, we find that the gradient in carbonate ion content between surface and mid-depth waters increased during the last glacial. Although a combination of factors including changes in Redfield ratio and rain ratio and increased CO2 absorption at the air-sea boundary might have caused the observed change, the greater gradient most likely suggests an enhanced sequestration of CO2 in the North Atlantic Ocean during the Last Glacial Maximum. Therefore, we infer that, in addition to changes in the Southern Ocean, processes in the North Atlantic Ocean enhanced the uptake of CO2 and synergistically contributed to the low atmospheric CO2 during ice ages.",

Here we present a summary of our ongoing effort to reconstruct geomagnetic variations of the past several millennia in the Levant at decadal to millennial resolution. This effort at the Southern Levant, namely the “Levantine Archaeomagnetic Compilation” (LAC), presently consists of data from over 650 well-dated archaeological objects including pottery, slag, ovens, and furnaces.\nIn this talk we review the methodological challenges in achieving a robust master secular variation curve with realistic error estimations from a large number of different datasets. We present the current status of the compilation, including the southern and western Levant LAC data (Israel, Cyprus, and Jordan) and other published north-eastern Levant data (Syria and southern Turkey), and outline the main findings emerging from these data.\nThe main feature apparent from the new compilation is an extraordinary intensity high that developed over the Levant region during the first two millennia BCE. The climax of this event is a double peak intensity maximum starting at ca. 1000 BCE and ending at ca. 735 BCE, accompanied with at least two events of geomagnetic spikes. Paleomagnetic directions from this period demonstrate anomalies of up to 20 degrees far from the averaged GAD field. This leads us to postulate that the maximum in the intensity is a manifestation of an intense mid-latitude local positive geomagnetic anomaly that persisted for over two centuries.",

There are some highly dense areas with lower ground elevation which submerge under water even with an intense precipitation of few hours. The higher areas also suffer with the drainage problem due to inadequate maintenance of the system and encroachment or illegal filling up of the drainage canals and lakes. Most part of the city suffered from long term urban flooding during historical extreme rainfall events in September 2004, 2007 and July 2009. The situation is likely to worsen in the future due to Climate Change, which may lead to more frequent and intense precipitation. To assess the major and minor drainage systems and elements of the urban basins using the hydrodynamic modelling and, through this, identifying the flooding events and areas, taking into account the current situation and future flood or drainage scenarios. Stormwater modeling has a major role in preventing issues such as flash floods and urban water-quality problems. Stormwater models of a lowered spatial resolution would thus appear valuable if only their ability to provide realistic results could be proved. The present scenario of urban morphology of Dhaka city and existing drainage system is complex for hydrological and hydrodynamic modeling. Furthermore limitations of background data and uncertain future urban scenarios may confine the potential outputs of a model. Although several studies were carried out including modeling for drainage master planning, a detail model for whole DAP (Detaile Area Plan) of Dhaka city area is not available. The model developed under this study is covering the existing drainage system in the study area as well as natural flows in the fringe area. A good number of models are available for hydrological and hydraulic analysis of urban areas. These are MIKE 11, MOUSE, HEC-RAS, HEC HMS and EPA SWMM. EPA-SWMM is used for the study area which is mostly developed and consists pipe networks, open channels and water bodies. This study proposes a methodology for rapid catchment delineation and stormwater management model (SWMM) set-up in a large urban area with model calibration and validation.",

With the wealth of data from space-based and ground-based observatories, it is evident that solar magnetic fields span the entirety of the convection zone-to-corona system, and do not exist in isolation in a localized region, or interact only over a prescribed spatial scale.\nThe challenge of modeling this system in its entirety is that the magnetic field not only spans multiple scales, but also regions whose physical conditions vary dramatically. In this overview, I will summarize recent progress in the effort to dynamically model the upper convection zone-to-corona system over large spatial scales, and will discuss applications of these new models to Solar Probe Plus science.",

            "abstract": "Geological disposal of high-level radioactive waste is the long term solution for the disposal of long lived radionuclides and spent fuel. However, some radionuclides might be released from these repositories into the subsurface as a result of leakage, which ultimately make their way into groundwater. Engineered bentonite barriers around nuclear waste repositories are generally considered sufficient to impede the transport of radionuclides from their source to the groundwater. However, colloidal-sized mobile bentonite particles (\"carrier\" colloids) originating from these barriers have come under investigation as a potential transport vector for radionuclides sorbed to them.\nAs lanthanides are generally accepted to have the same chemical behaviors as their more toxic actinide counterparts, lanthanides are considered an acceptable substitute for research on radionuclide transportation. This study aims to evaluate the transport behaviors of lanthanides in colloid-facilitated transport through a fractured chalk matrix and under geochemical conditions representative the Negev desert, Israel. The migration of Ce both with and without colloidal particles was explored and compared to the migration of a conservative tracer (bromide) using a flow system constructed around a naturally fractured chalk core. Results suggest that mobility of Ce as a solute is negligible. In experiments conducted without bentonite colloids, the 1% of the Ce that was recovered migrated as \"intrinsic\" colloids in the form of carbonate precipitates. However, the total recovery of the Ce increased to 9% when it was injected into the core in the presence of bentonite colloids and 13% when both bentonite and precipitate colloids were injected. This indicates that lanthanides are essentially immobile in chalk as a solute but may be mobile as carbonate precipitates. Bentonite colloids, however, markedly increase the mobility of lanthanides through fractured chalk matrices.",

This makes spatial and temporal extrapolation outside of the training domain difficult at best. There is therefore a clear need for the incorporation of knowledge of ecosystem function, in combination with the strength of data mining. Here, we present such an approach. We describe a novel diagnostic process-based model of global photosynthesis and ecosystem respiration, which is directly informed by a variety of global datasets relevant to ecosystem state and function. We use the model framework to estimate global carbon cycling both spatially and temporally, with a specific focus on the mechanisms responsible for long-term change. Our results show the importance of incorporating process knowledge into upscaling approaches, and highlight the effect of key processes on the terrestrial carbon cycle.",

Yet, ENSO’s response to global warming remains highly uncertain1. To improve our understanding of ENSO’s sensitivity to external climate forcing, it is paramount to determine its past behavior using paleo climate data and model simulations. Paleo climate records document that ENSO has varied considerably since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21,000 years ago, or 21 ka)2-9 and some datasets suggest a gradual intensification of ENSO for the past ~6,000 years2,5,7,8. Previous attempts to simulate the transient evolution of ENSO have relied on simplified models10 or snapshot11-13 experiments. Here we analyze a series of transient Coupled General Circulation Model (CGCM) simulations forced by changes in greenhouse gasses, orbital forcing and the ice-sheet history throughout the last 21,000 years. Consistent with most paleo ENSO reconstructions, our model simulates an orbitally-induced strengthening of ENSO during the Holocene, which is caused by increasing positive ocean-atmosphere feedbacks. During the early deglaciation, ENSO characteristics change drastically in response to meltwater discharges and the resulting changes of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and equatorial annual cycle. Increasing deglacial atmospheric CO2 concentrations tend to weaken ENSO, whereas retreating glacial ice-sheets intensify ENSO. The complex evolution of forcings and ENSO feedbacks and the uncertainties in the reconstruction further highlight the challenge and opportunity for constraining future ENSO responses.",

The Río La Carbonera watershed on the southeastern flank of Pico de Orizaba volcano, the highest mountain in Mexico, is selected as a study area. The catchment covers 71.9 km2 with elevations ranging from 1224 to 3643 m a.s.l. and hillslopes between <5° and 68°. The stream system of Río La Carbonera catchment erodes Tertiary and Quaternary lavas, pyroclastic flows, and fall deposits. The geologic and geomorphologic factors in combination with high seasonal precipitation, high degree of weathering, and steep slopes predispose the study area to landslides. The methodology encompasses three main stages of analysis to assess landslide hazards:\nStage 1 builds a historic landslide inventory. In the study area, an inventory of more than 200 landslides is created from multi-temporal aerial-photo-interpretation and local field surveys to assess landslide distribution. All landslides were digitized into a geographic information system (GIS), and a spatial geo-database of landslides was constructed from standardized GIS datasets.\nStage 2 calculates the susceptibility for the watershed. During this stage, (SINMAP using default values) is evaluated.\nStage 3 Estimate the potential total material delivered to the main stream drainage channel by all landslides in the catchment. Detailed geometric measurements of individual landslides visited during the field work will be carried out to obtain the landslide area and volume. These measurements revealed an empirical relationship between area and volume that took the form of a power law. This relationship will be used to estimate the potential volume of material delivered to the catchment. The technique and its implementation of each stage in a GIS-based technology is presented and discussed.",

            "abstract": "There is mounting evidence of profound hydrologic changes over the past century when instrumented records began, but to make correct attributions for the causes of the observed change, and to integrate and make sense of the changes in different branches of the water cycle and in different water stores, large-scale hydrologic models play an irreplaceable role. However, most of the existing large-scale water cycle models do not yet explicitly represent the anthropogenic forces which can no longer be neglected because the water cycle today is not natural anymore. In this study, an integrated modeling framework of continental-scale water cycle, with explicit representation of climate and human induced forces (e.g., irrigation, groundwater pumping) is developed and used to reconstruct the observed water cycle changes in the past and to attribute the observed changes to climatic and human factors. The new model builds upon two different previously developed models: a global land surface model called the Human Impacts and GroundWater in the MATSIRO (HiGW-MAT) [1,2] and a high-resolution regional groundwater model called the LEAF-Hydro-Flood [3]. The model is used to retro-simulate the hydrologic stores and fluxes in close dialogue with in-situ and GRACE satellite based observations at a wide range of river basin scales over the U.S., with a particular focus on the changes in groundwater dynamics in the High Plains and the Central Valley aquifers.\n1.

            "abstract": "The growing global demand for hydrocarbons has tested the limits of oil exploration and exploitation technologies. Within the seismic methods, tomography is an alternative for the high resolution characterization of reservoirs, enabling a more efficient recovery of new as well as mature fields. In this work, seismic traveltime tomography in the transmission mode was applied to real data from the Miranga Field, Reconcavo Basin, State of Bahia, Brazil. This basin represents a landmark of oil exploration in Brazil and has been intensively studied since the 1950s. Today, the Reconcavo Basin is still the principal oil producer in the State of Bahia, but there is a demand for new technologies, especially for mature fields, to improve hydrocarbon recovery. The objective is to estimate the two-dimensional velocity distribution in the region between the two wells. We have used linearized inversion through the Levenberg-Marquardt scheme. The input data in the system are the traveltimes between the sources and the receivers and the distances propagated by each ray connecting such sources and receivers. Both inputs are provided through acoustic forward modeling. The conjugate gradient algorithm with regularization through derivative matrices was used as an inverse procedure. The tomographic inversion is an ill-posed problem because the existence, uniqueness and stability conditions are not completely satisfied. The linear system is regularized by derivative matrices derived to minimize the instability. This regularization procedure has a crucially important parameter called regularization parameter lambda. For the selection of lambda we used L-curve and Theta-curve. The estimated tomograms were consistent with previous geological knowledge of the area and the P-wave velocity range was consistent. The results showed that traveltime tomography is feasible for the characterization of reservoirs with a high rate of vertical change, similar to the Miranga Field.",

In this research we divided the study into three periods (1982-1990, 1991-2003 and 2004-2014) and the marshes are exposed to a few significant droughts during 33 years. In this study we will examine the relationship between water cycle and land surface variables during these three periods.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_Poster_2015.pdf\nRip currents are strong, narrow seaward flows of water that originate in the surf zones of many global beaches. They are related to hundreds of international drownings each year, but exact numbers are difficult to calculate due to logistical difficulties in obtaining accurate incident reports. Annual average rip current fatalities are estimated to be ~100, 53 and 21 in the United States (US), Costa Rica, and Australia respectively. Current warning systems (e.g. National Weather Service) do not account for fine resolution nearshore bathymetry because it is difficult to capture. The method shown here could provide frequent, high resolution maps of nearshore bathymetry at a scale required for improved rip prediction and warning.\nThis study demonstrates a method for mapping bathymetry in the surf zone (20m deep and less), specifically within rip channels, because rips form at topographically low spots in the bathymetry as a result of feedback amongst waves, substrate, and antecedent bathymetry. The methods employ the Digital Globe WorldView2 (WV2) multispectral satellite and field measurements of depth to generate maps of the changing bathymetry at two embayed, rip-prone beaches: Playa Cocles, Puerto Viejo de Talamanca, Costa Rica, and Bondi Beach, Sydney, Australia. WV2 has a 1.1 day pass-over rate with 1.84m ground pixel resolution of 8 bands, including ‘yellow’ (585-625 nm) and ‘coastal blue’ (400-450 nm). The data is used to classify bottom type and to map depth to the return in multiple bands. The methodology is tested at each site for algorithm consistency between dates, and again for applicability between sites.",

            "abstract": "Although wave-particle interactions may maintain a pre-existing kappa distribution throughout the solar wind once formed, an important question is to identify the origin of a quasi-kappa distribution. It transpires that the dissipation mechanism at quasi-perpendicular shocks and the so-called injection problem at shock waves may be of particular relevance to the formation of initial quasi-kappa distributions throughout the solar wind. In particular, the question of how particles are injected into the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism at a perpendicular shock can be addressed on the basis of a kappa distribution. We discuss briefly the possible formation of a kappa distribution at interplanetary shocks and show how this is then accelerated at a quasi-perpendicular shock. These results are related to observed energetic particle spectra downstream of an interplanetary shock. The related question of the dissipation mechanism at the quasi-perpendicular heliospheric termination shock is discussed, focusing particularly in the important role of the pickup ion distribution upstream and downstream of the heliospheric termination shock. We show that the downstream proton distribution in the inner heliosheath closely resembles a kappa distribution.",

The research sites were six high developed blocks in Seoul, Korea. Air temperature was measured with mobile loggers in clear daytime during summer, from August to September, at screen level. Also the measurement repeated over three times a day during three days by walking and circulating around the experimental blocks and the control blocks at the same time. By analyzing spatial characteristics, the averaged air temperatures were classified with three spaces, sunny spaces, building-shaded spaces and small green spaces by using Kruskal-Wallis Test; and small green spaces in 6 blocks were classified into their outward forms, polygonal or linear and single or mixed. The polygonal and mixed types of small green spaces mitigated averaged air temperature of each block which they belonged with a simple linear regression model with adjusted R2 = 0.90**. As the area and volume of these types increased, the effect of air temperature reduction (ΔT; Air temperature difference between sunny space and green space in a block) also increased in a linear relationship. The experimental range of this research is 100m2 ~ 2,000m2 of area, and 1,000m3 ~ 10,000m3 of volume of small green space. As a result, more than 300m2 and 2,300m3 of polygonal green spaces with mixed vegetation is required to lower 1°C; 650m2 and 5,000m3 of them to lower 2°C; about 2,000m2 and about 10,000m3 of them to lower 4°C air temperature reduction in an urban block.",

We have tentatively mapped its types of seafloor using a well-known classification system, which includes various types of large-scale and small-scale features, bottom induration, vegetation, surface texture, and slope. Seismic lines and sediment cores were collected to create the map. CSUMB’s Seafloor Mapping Lab as well as the Elkhorn Slough National Estuarine Research Reserve provided bathymetry, raster files, and shapefiles to be incorporated into the project. We divided the Slough into three main sections: the Lower, Central, and Upper Slough. Sand sediments were found in the Lower Slough, which is a high-energy environment, whilst mud or silt sediments dominated the rest of the Slough. Five classification categories were used to describe the Slough’s seafloor: flat sand sediments, sloped sand sediments, flat mud sediments, sloped mud sediments, and eelgrass on sandy sediment. Bathymetry data was used to discuss the Slough’s sediment erosion and accretion. This preliminary map can be used to understand the location of various marine habitats, which is important for the wildlife conservation and planning efforts in the Slough.\nAcknowledgments: CSUMB (chirp), Ron Eby (ESNEER), Geoff (Triton Imaging Inc.).

These events have resulted in a loss of thousands of lives as well as billions of dollars of property damage. Many of these extreme events occur in developing countries where in-situ observing networks are sparse, making forecasting and estimation of impacts near impossible. Data from NASA Earth Observing Satellites are used to measure changes in ten river basins globally. This study assesses how the water cycle variables such as precipitation, soil moisture, runoff, evapotranspiration and vegetation have changed over the past 15 years in these river basins that are located in different climate and ecosystems. Monthly trends using GRACE Water Equivalent Thickness Anomaly, TRMM and GPM Precipitation, MODIS NDVI and ET, and GLDAS Runoff and Root Zone Soil moisture are analyzed over each major basin, and at sub-basin level using the 2007 Koppen Climate Classification. This information provides a basis to determine the spatial variation of expected water availability, and to predict changes in water cycle variables using lag correlations.",

            "abstract": "Subduction modifies the descending basaltic and sedimentary oceanic crust and generates felsic arc materials and continental crust. Studies of element mass balances in the subduction zone therefore reveal the evolution of the Earth’s two major geochemical reservoirs: the continent crust and mantle. We use the Arc Basalt Simulator ver.4 (ABS4) to model the geochemical mass balance during dehydration by prograde metamorphism and melting of the slab followed by subsequent flux melting of the wedge mantle caused by the addition of slab-derived liquids. The geochemistry of high-Mg andesite or adakite formed in a hot subduction zone is akin to the present-day bulk continental crust and to the Archean (>2 Ga) Tonalite-Trondjhemite-Granodiorite composition. Therefore, the residual slab and the metasomatized mantle wedge at hot subduction zones should be the most plausible sources for materials recycled back into the deep mantle. Model calculations of isotopic growth in the residual slab and mantle formed in hot subduction zones reproduce fairly well the EM1–FOZO–HIMU isotope arrays found in ocean island basalts (OIBs) of deep mantle plume origin, although FOZO with high 3He/4He is not generated by this slab recycling process. The recycled materials are bulk igneous ocean crust for HIMU and metasomatized mantle wedge peridotite for EM1. In contrast, the EM2–FOZO array can be generated in a cold subduction zone with igneous oceanic crust for FOZO and sediment for EM2 sources. Necessary residence time are ~2 Ga to form HIMU–FOZO–EM1 and ~1 Ga to form EM2–FOZO. The subducted oceanic crust (forming HIMU) and mantle wedge peridotite (forming EM1) may have travelled in the mantle together. They then melted together in an upwelling mantle plume to form the EM1–FOZO–HIMU isotopic variations found frequently in OIBs. In contrast, the less frequent EM2–FOZO array suggests a separate source and recycling path. These recycling ages are consistent with the change in the mantle potential temperature over the past 3.5 Ga, which was high and constant at Tp = 1650 °C during 3.5–2 Ga before decreasing monotonously to Tp = 1300 °C today. This allows the formation of HIMU–EM1 sources in an ancient hot subduction zone, and formation of EM2–FOZO sources in younger, colder subduction systems.",

Observations from space using sensors mounted on satellites cover wider areas and provide high spatial and temporal resolution. The estimates derived from this process are very useful in integrated hydrologic modeling, weather forecasting and monitoring landslides, droughts and floods, etc. Example of a satellite precipitation product is the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) and Global Precipitation Mission (GPM). TRMM was primarily designed to measure heavy-to-moderate rainfall over tropical and subtropical regions. GPM was designed to extend, enhance, and improve TRMM precipitation data. The primary objective of this study is the assimilation GPM satellite based precipitation estimates into the Canadian Precipitation Analysis (CaPA). CaPA combines the Global Environmental Multi-Scale model (GEM) dataset and observed precipitation from monitoring stations to provide precipitation estimates at 6hr and 24hr time steps and spatial resolution of 10km covering North America. In the result, we used the Equitable Threat Score (ETS) as performance evaluation. GPM assimilation provides higher skill (ETS) at precipitation values below 3mm while being used as additional data source. GPM has better skill as background field at precipitation value above 3mm.",

They are convected tailward due to their interaction with the solar wind and as the result of reconnection. The leading model for their tailward propagation speed at Earth’s magnetopause has been described using boundary layer physics (Cowley and Owen, Planet. Space Sci., 37, 1461, 1989). We revisit this topic, noting that during times when the reconnection at both X-lines bracketing the flux ropes remain active, there should be consistency with the scaling laws of asymmetric magnetic reconnection with a flow shear. The convection speed of an isolated reconnecting X-line as a function of arbitrary upstream plasma parameters, including the reconnecting magnetic fields, densities, and upstream flow in the plane of the fields, was recently calculated analytically and tested with two-fluid simulations (Doss et al., J. Geophys. Res., submitted). Here, we present fully electromagnetic kinetic particle-in-cell simulations of local asymmetric reconnection with a flow shear that confirm the prediction in collisionless plasmas relevant to planetary magnetospheres. It is notable that the X-line convects even for sub-Alfvenic flow shear and can reconnect even for flow speeds exceeding twice the magnetosheath Alfven speed, which counters previous models. The application of these results for flux rope motion in global magnetospheric simulations of Earth is discussed, as are applications to the magnetospheres of other planets.",

            "abstract": "For over 90 years scientists have tried to explain how tornadoes form and function. The present general consensus is that a tornado is just a function of the thunderstorm. Much research has been done to find the answer and numerous articles and papers have been written, all to no avail. This research explores the fact that a tornado cannot be just a function of a thunderstorm, as there is no opposite force within the thunderstorm to the air drawn up by the tornado, so there must be some external force involved in a tornado’s formation. To have compliance with Newton’s Third Law of Motion we must see an equal downforce or some other force within the thunderstorm, to that drawn up by the tornado. And if there was a downforce, that force would be virtually as damaging as the tornado itself. But we don’t see this downforce or any other opposing force within the thunderstorm. Therefore, we must look for some other force that could cause a tornado’s formation. And if that opposing force is not within the thunderstorm we need to be looking for some external force, outside the thunderstorm, that could cause a tornado. Also the fact that we have Waterspouts, Landspouts and Gustnadoes all without a thunderstorm, but since they all look and function just like a tornado, tells us that there must be some other force that is responsible for causing a tornado just like a Waterspout, Landspout or Gustnado. My research shows that there is one other force of energy that could cause all of these vortexes and is most likely the source of energy for a tornado’s formation. That force is the High Velocity Overhead Jet Stream. My research shows a direct relationship between the High Velocity Overhead Jet Stream and Tornadogenesis as well as Waterspouts, Landspouts and Gustnadoes. Therefore, with the High Velocity Overhead Jet Stream providing the Action, at its interface with the tornado in the stratosphere, the Reaction is what we see on the ground as a tornado. With this explanation we now have compliance with Newton’s Third Law of Motion. The Action is the air being entrained, in some way, by the jet stream passing over the top of the tornado and the Reaction is the tornado we see on the ground.",

            "abstract": "We use thermospheric mass densities measured by the accelerometers on satellites of GRACE at ~480 km and CHAMP at ~380 km from 2002–2010 to study the longitudinal and latitudinal distribution of the diurnally averaged thermospheric mass density. The result shows that there are strong longitude variations in the diurnally averaged thermospheric mass density. These variations are global and have the similar characteristics at the two heights under geomagnetically quiet conditions (Ap<10). The largest relative longitudinal changes of the diurnally averaged thermospheric mass density occur at high latitudes from October to February in the Northern Hemisphere and from March to September in the Southern Hemisphere. The positive density peaks locate always near the magnetic poles. The high density regions extend toward lower latitudes and even into the opposite hemisphere. This extension appears to be tilted westward, but mostly is confined to the longitudes where the magnetic poles are located. Thus, the relative longitudinal changes of the diurnally averaged thermospheric mass density have strong seasonal variations and show an annual oscillation at high and middle latitudes but a semiannual oscillation around the equator. Our results suggest that heating of the magnetospheric origin in the auroral region is most likely the cause of these observed longitudinal and latitudinal structures. Our results also show that the relative longitude variation of the diurnally averaged thermospheric mass density is hemispherically asymmetric and more pronounced in the Southern Hemisphere. To check how deep the auroral heating can affect the atmosphere, we analyze the diurnally averaged temperature observed by TIMED/SABER and MIPAS. Results indicate that there are similar structure in the lower thermosphere and the impact of auroral heating on the thermodynamics of the neutral atmosphere can penetrate down to about 105 km under geomagnetically quiet conditions.",

            "abstract": "The Cenozoic geological evolution of the Central Andes, along two transects between ~17.5°S and 21°S, is compared with paleo-topography, determined from published paleo-altimetry studies. Surface and rock uplift are quantified using simple 2-D models of crustal shortening and thickening, together with estimates of sedimentation, erosion and magmatic addition. Prior to ~25 Ma, during a phase of amagmatic flat-slab subduction, thick skinned crustal shortening and thickening was focused in the Eastern and Western Cordilleras, separated by a broad basin up to 300 km wide and close to sea level, which today comprises the high Altiplano. Surface topography in the Eastern Cordillera appears to be ~1 km lower than anticipated from crustal thickening, which may be due to the pull-down effect of the subducted slab, coupled to the overlying lithosphere by a cold mantle wedge. Oligocene steepening of the subducted slab is indicated by the initiation of the volcanic arc at ~27 - 25 Ma, and widespread mafic volcanism in the Altiplano between 25 and 20 Ma. This may have resulted in detachment of mantle lithosphere and possibly dense lower crust, triggering 1 – 1.5 km of rapid uplift (over << 5 Myrs) of the Altiplano and western margin of the Eastern Cordillera and establishing the present day lithospheric structure beneath the high Andes. Since ~25 Ma, surface uplift has been the direct result of crustal shortening and thickening, locally modified by the effects of erosion, sedimentation and magmatic addition from the mantle. The rate of crustal shortening and thickening varies with location and time, with two episodes of rapid shortening in the Altiplano, lasting < 5 Myrs, that are superimposed on a long term history of ductile shortening in the lower crust, driven by underthrusting of the Brazilian Shield on the eastern margin.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - ver11.pdf\nTemporal variations of Green functions associated with the eruptive activity at Sakurajima Volcano, Japan, were estimated using an accurately controlled routinely operated signal system (ACROSS). We used the seismic records at stations HAR and KAB, which are 615 m and 1200 m apart from the ACROSS source, respectively, that recorded a modulating sinusoidal signal in a 12.505 ± 2.5 Hz band from the ACROSS. We deconvolved individual 400 s records at these stations by a known source time function and stacked the results based on the time relative to individual eruptions and eruption intervals; the quantities obtained by this procedure are Green functions corresponding to various stages of the eruptive activity. At station HAR, we identified an energy density decrease in a 2–4 s window of the Green functions before and after individual eruptions and for time periods of short eruption intervals. This time window (2–4 s) is after the main phase and before an exponentially decaying coda, and dominated by a later phase of a flat amplitude. At station KAB, similar energy density decrease was observed in a 2–6 s window. The Green functions estimated by our procedure may be affected by volcanic earthquakes. We evaluated this effect using seismic records in a time span when the ACROSS was temporarily not operating. This evaluation showed that an apparent Green function change caused by the volcanic earthquakes would be spread out over the entire 50 s window of the Green functions. Therefore the Green function change localized in the later phase portion (2–4 s at HAR and 2–6 s at KAB) is difficult to explain by contamination from volcanic earthquakes and tremors. The change could be more reasonably attributed to a subsurface structure change caused by the volcanic activity.",

Studies on hydrous silicate melts are, therefore, important to understand the magma-related phenomena of the planetary interior. Neutron has an advantage over X-ray to study the structure of hydrous melts. We have developed the high-pressure neutron diffraction method on the amorphous silicates with water at the PLANTE beamline of MLF, J-PARC. Here we report the results of in-situ neutron diffraction experiments on the hydrous silica glass at room temperature up to 10 GPa as well as X-ray diffraction study. Hydrous silica glass was synthesized by quenching from liquid at 3 GPa, in which D2O content is 13 wt.%. Neutron diffraction experiments were carried out at BL11 of MLF, J-PARC and X-ray studies were done at BL04B2 of SPring-8 and AR-NE5 of Photon Factory. On the neutron and X-ray spectra, the FSDP of hydrous glass locates at the higher Q-side than dry one, indicating the breakdown of network structure of silica glass by an addition of water. The FSDP shifts toward higher-Q side with increasing pressure parallel to that of dry silica glass. The radial distribution functions shows that the SiO4 unit does not change up to 10 GPa but the Si-Si-distance decreases with pressure. These show that the intermediate range order, which consists of the network of SiO4 tetrahedra, shrinks with increasing pressure. The changes of silica framework with pressure in hydrous silica glass are similar to those in dry silica glass. On the other hand, neutron diffraction shows the D-O distance in hydrous silica glass is nearly constant up to 10 GPa.",

            "abstract": "The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is earth’s dominant source of interannual climate variability. Yet, ENSO’s response to global warming remains highly uncertain. To improve our understanding of ENSO’s sensitivity to external climate forcing, it is paramount to determine its past behavior using paleo climate data and model simulations. Paleo climate records document that ENSO has varied considerably since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 21,000 years ago, or 21 ka) and some datasets suggest a gradual intensification of ENSO for the past ~6,000 years. Previous attempts to simulate the transient evolution of ENSO have relied on simplified models or snapshot experiments. Here we analyze a series of transient Coupled General Circulation Model (CGCM) simulations forced by changes in greenhouse gasses, orbital forcing and the ice-sheet history throughout the last 21,000 years. Consistent with most paleo ENSO reconstructions, our model simulates an orbitally-induced strengthening of ENSO during the Holocene, which is caused by increasing positive ocean-atmosphere feedbacks. During the early deglaciation, ENSO characteristics change drastically in response to meltwater discharges and the resulting changes of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and equatorial annual cycle. Increasing deglacial atmospheric CO2 concentrations tend to weaken ENSO, whereas retreating glacial ice-sheets intensify ENSO. The complex evolution of forcings and ENSO feedbacks and the uncertainties in the reconstruction further highlight the challenge and opportunity for constraining future ENSO responses.",

SMAP integrates L-band radar and radiometer instruments as a single observation system combining the respective strengths of active and passive remote sensing for enhanced soil moisture mapping.\nAirborne instruments will be a key part of the SMAP validation program. Here, we present an airborne campaign in the Rur catchment, Germany, in which the passive L-band system Polarimetric L-band Multi-beam Radiometer (PLMR2) and the active L-band system F-SAR of DLR were flown simultaneously on the same platform on six dates in 2013. The flights covered the full heterogeneity of the area under investigation, i.e. all types of land cover and experimental monitoring sites with in situ sensors. Here, we used the obtained data sets as a test-bed for the analysis of three active-passive fusion techniques: A) The SMAP baseline algorithm: Disaggregation of passive microwave brightness temperature by active microwave backscatter and subsequent inversion to soil moisture, B), the SMAP alternative algorithm: Estimation of soil moisture by passive sensor data and subsequent disaggregation by active sensor backscatter and C) Copula-based combination of active and passive microwave data. For method C empirical Copulas were generated and theoretical Copulas fitted both on the level of the raw products brightness temperature and backscatter as well as two soil moisture products.\nResults indicate that the regression parameters for method A and B are dependent on the radar vegetation index (RVI). Similarly, for method C the best performance was gained by generating separate Copulas for individual land use classes. For more in-depth analyses longer time series are necessary as can obtained by airborne campaigns, therefore, the methods will be applied to SMAP data.",

            "abstract": "Detailed estimates of physical property distributions- such as electrical resistivity- are common end products of geophysical surveys, but are often of limited use for the geologist, hydrologist, or resource manager who is tasked with making decisions based on these data. Here, we focus on the use of airborne electromagnetic (AEM) data to estimate large-scale model structural geometry, i.e. the spatial distribution of different lithological units based on assumed or estimated resistivity-lithology relationships, and the uncertainty in those structures given imperfect measurements. Geophysically derived estimates of model structural uncertainty are then combined with hydrologic observations to assess the impact of model structural error on hydrologic calibration and prediction errors. Using a synthetic numerical model, we describe a sequential hydrogeophysical approach that: (1) uses Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (McMC) methods to produce a robust estimate of uncertainty in electrical resistivity parameter values, (2) combines geophysical parameter uncertainty estimates with borehole observations of lithology to produce probabilistic estimates of model structural uncertainty over the entire AEM survey area using geostatistical sequential indicator simulation algorithms, and (3) uses model structural estimates along with hydrologic observations to quantify both hydrologic parameter and prediction uncertainty using a second McMC sampling algorithm. Results of simulations will be presented that illustrate the complete workflow from geophysical parameter uncertainty analysis to the impact of model structural uncertainty on hydrologic parameter estimates. We also discuss some of the computational challenges associated with application to large AEM surveys with many thousands of data locations.",

To promote the software estimation efficiency, 250 stations are divided by 8 subnets which have been considered by station numbers, network geometry and fault distributions. Each of subnets include around 50 CGPS and 10 international GNSS service (IGS) stations. After long period of data collection and estimation, a time series variation can be build up to study the effect of earthquakes and estimate the velocity of stations. After comparing the coordinates from campaign-mode GPS sites and precise leveling benchmarks with the time series from continuous GPS stations, the velocity field is consistent with previous measurement which show the reliability of observation. We evaluate the slip rate and slip deficit rate of active faults in Taiwan by 3D block model DEFNODE. First, to get the surface fault traces and the subsurface fault geometry parameters, and then establish the block boundary model of study area. By employing the DEFNODE technique, we invert the GPS velocities for the best-fit block rotate rates, long term slip rates and slip deficit rates. Finally, the probability analysis of active faults is to establish the flow chart of 33 active faults in Taiwan. In the past two years, 16 active faults in central and northern Taiwan have been assessed to get the recurrence interval and the probabilities for the characteristic earthquake occurred in 30, 50 and 100 years.",

            "abstract": "Land-use change (LUC) is known to significantly affect biogeochemical cycles as well as surface energy partitioning – with important implications, ranging from understanding present-day measurements, to simulations of climate change and impacts on ecosystems, to assessments of the mitigation potential of land-based mitigation policies on ecosystems. When connecting observations of surface-atmosphere interactions and modelling at different scales, two important issues in this context are: legacy effects (e.g., to what degree and for how long does past LUC at a given location affect vegetation structure, CO2 fluxes and carbon pools), and sub-grid variability of the land-use change per se (e.g., whether bi-directional information about changes are taken into consideration). Both are important when bridging between scales (in time and in space) to enhance long-term observation networks.\nThis contribution to the session will be very much from a process-based modelling perspective. Using a second generation dynamic global vegetation model we will show how different land-use histories impact vegetation and soil recovery (carbon pool-size, fluxes) differently, depending on the type of previous land-use, its length, and on the type of biome. We also study the difference between “gross” and “net” LUC accounting for simulated carbon cycling. Two important aspects, considering the session’s objectives, are: 1) When establishing and developing observation networks, land-use history is key information for the interpretation of measured fluxes and needs to be collected and made available;, 2) Observation networks that “operate” solely in the natural science domain need to increasingly seek cooperation with socio-economic observations (such as land-use change, land management) in order to gain better understanding of coupled socio-ecological systems.",

            "abstract": "Historical land-use (LUC) change is known to have been a large source of CO2 emissions, mostly from deforestation: the equivalent of around 1/3 of today’s CO2 in the atmosphere arises from LUC. And LUC will continue into the future, although the expected area change, the type of LUC (deforestation vs. afforestation/reforestation) and regions where the LUC will take place will differ greatly, depending on the future scenario. But LUC is not only of importance for projecting emissions of CO2. It also affects greatly emissions of biogenic volatile organic carbon, and from wildfires – all of which are important for the quantification of precursor substances relevant to air quality, and interactions with climate change.\nWe show here that accounting for future socio-economic developments and LUC scenarios has the potential to override climate change and effects of CO2 fertilisation on fire and BVOC emission, regionally and in some cases also globally. Simulation experiments with the dynamic global vegetation model LPJ-GUESS will be performed, covering the 20th and 21st century, and assessing a rage of future population growth, LUC and climate change scenarios. For wildfire emissions, we find that burned area and emissions depend greatly on the type of population growth scenario, and on the distribution of urban vs rural population. BVOC emissions depend greatly on the amount and location of deforestation vs the region and magnitude of forest expansion in response to warming, such as through expansion of vegetation in the northern hemisphere, and via reforestation/afforestation. LUC so far has not been given sufficient attention for simulations of future air quality-climate interactions. In terms of terrestrial precursor emissions of atmospherically reactive substances our simulations clearly demonstrate the importance of including LUC in combination with vegetation that responds dynamically to changes in climate and atmospheric CO2 levels.",

            "abstract": "Explanations of the glacial-interglacial variations in atmospheric pCO2 invoke a significant role for the deep ocean in the storage of CO2. Deep ocean density stratification has been proposed as a mechanism to promote the storage of CO2 in the deep ocean during glacial times. A wealth of proxy data exists supporting the idea of a \"chemical divide\" between intermediate and deep water in the glacial Atlantic Ocean, which indirectly points to an increase in deep ocean density stratification. However, direct observational evidence of changes in the primary controls of ocean density stratification, i.e. temperature and salinity, remain scarce.\nIn this study, we present proxy reconstructions showing the evolution of the physical density gradient in high-latitude South Atlantic over the last deglaciation. Mg/Ca-derived seawater temperature estimates combined with salinity estimates determined from temperature-corrected δ18O measurements on the benthic foraminifer Uvigerina spp. from deep and intermediate water-depth marine sediment cores are used to reconstruct the changes in density of sub-Antarctic South Atlantic water masses over the last deglaciation. Comparison is made between the evolution of the density gradient and benthic δ13C and 14C records from the two sites in order to assess the hypothesis of a causal link between the physical and chemical properties of the deglacial ocean.\nOur records suggest that the major breakdown in the physical density stratification significantly lags the breakdown of the deep-intermediate chemical divide. The main chemical destratification event coincided with the early deglacial increase in atmospheric pCO2, whereas the density destratification of the deep South Atlantic occurred at the onset of the Holocene. Our findings emphasise that the physical and chemical destratification of the ocean are not as tightly coupled as generally assumed. We argue that at least in the South Atlantic, physical ocean density destratification was not a major driver of atmospheric CO2 change during the last glacial termination.",

            "abstract": "The drivers of abrupt climate change during the Last Glacial Period are not well understood. While Dansgaard-Oeschger (DO) cycles are thought to be linked to variations in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Ocean Circulation (AMOC), it is not clear how or if Heinrich Events—extensive influxes of icebergs into the North Atlantic Ocean that impacted global climate and biogeochemistry—are related. An enduring problem is the difficultly in dating iceberg rafted debris deposits that typically lack foraminifera. Here we present an ultra-high resolution record of methane from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet Divide ice core at unprecedented, continuous temporal resolution from 67.2–9.8 ka BP, which we propose constrains the timing of Heinrich events.\nOur methane record essentially mirrors Greenland ice core stable isotope variability across D-O events, except during Heinrich stadials 1, 2, 4 and 5. Partway through these stadials only, methane increases abruptly and rapidly, as at the onset of a D-O event but Greenland temperature exhibits no equivalent response. Speleothem records exhibit signatures of drought in the Northern extra-tropics and intensified monsoonal activity over South America at these times. We use a simple heuristic model to propose that cold air temperatures and extensive sea ice in the North, resulting from Heinrich events, caused extreme reorganization of tropical hydroclimate. This involved curtailment of the seasonal northerly migration of tropical rain belts, leading to intensification of rainfall over Southern Hemisphere tropical wetlands, thus allowing production of excess methane relative to a ‘normal’ Greenland stadial.\nWe note that this mechanism can operate if AMOC is already in a slowed state when a Heinrich event occurs, as paleo-evidence suggests it was. Heinrich events and associated sea ice cover would therefore act to prolong the duration of this AMOC state. Our findings place the big four Heinrich events of Hudson Strait origin firmly within ice core chronologies and suggest that their impacts on AMOC and tropical hydroclimate persisted for 740–1520 yr.",

Both the traveltime and the slowness of the signals can be translated to variations in the wind and temperature structure along the source-receiver trajectory. In such a case, ground-truth about the source location and sometimes orgin time are necessary to restrict the analysis. However, sources with such a ground-truth are limited to certain geographical locations and have a sparse temporal availability. It is therefore attractive to use the ambient noise field, which is continuously present from a variety of directions. In theory, the cross correlation of the ambient noise field between two receivers should reveal the acoustic lag time between these receivers. With a known distance between the receivers, this lag time can be translated to the acoustic velocity which in turn is a function of the wind and temperature. In this presentation, the theory and results of this so-called ambient noise interferometry will be shown.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic properties of lake sediments can provide valuable information on terrestrial environmental conditions. The composition of detrital magnetic minerals provides information on erosion and pedogenesis in the catchment. However, depending on the trophic state of the lake, water depth and stratification, oxygen supply is often limited and leads to dissolution and neo-formation of magnetic minerals.\nVariations in bulk magnetic and geochemical properties of a sediment core (ICDP site 5045-1) from Lake Ohrid, mimic climatic changes on glacial-interglacial and millennial time scales. During extremely cold glacials, low accumulation of organic matter and enhanced mixing of the water-column coincides with the preservation of syn-sedimentary greigite whereas in sediments deposited during less severe glacials and interglacials, greigite is absent. “Non-greigite” glacial sediments are characterized by high concentration of high-coercivity magnetic minerals, which relates to enhanced erosion of soils due a retreat in vegetation. During interglacials magnetite dominates the magnetic mineral assemblage, most likely corresponding to detrital particles originating from physically weathered rocks. Millennial-scale variations of magnetic properties are superimposed on the general glacial-interglacial pattern. Higher contributions from high-coercivity minerals correspond to phases of low summer-insolation. We propose that also on these time scales retreated vegetation resulted in enhanced soil erosion. Our study demonstrates that rock-magnetic studies, in concert with geochemical and sedimentological investigations, provide a multi-level contribution to environmental reconstructions, since the magnetic properties can mirror both environmental conditions on land, as well as intra-lake processes.",

They are of particular importance at low-latitudes where they can dominate over the hot magnetospheric ions (tens of keV). Cold ions have smaller gyroradius, and therefore they remain magnetized down to smaller spatial scales than the hot ions, introducing a new length-scale into the reconnection process. The Cluster orbit crossed the subsolar magnetopause region several times during 2007 and 2008. We observe cold ions ExB drifting with the strong E fields set up during reconnection in many of these crossings. At the same time, the cold ions are heated when convecting towards the exhausts. We investigate the heating mechanisms of the cold ions using two spacecraft, to distinguish spatial and time variations of the E fields.",

            "abstract": "Deformation at convergent plate boundaries involves various styles of mass flux and of backarc shortening. For the Andes, patterns appear obvious. Long-term mass flux style – i.e. accretionary versus erosive – shows a distinct relationship with forearc as well as backarc deformation mode. Neogene surface deformation exhibits tectonically uplifting areas along the coast driven by interseismically active reverse faulting. Moreover, seismic-cycle vertical displacement is not coincident with long-term vertical motion that probably is superseded by slow basal underplating (southern Chile) or tectonic erosion (northern Chile). Reconstruction clearly indicates that the Central Andean trench has always been underfilled with less than 500 m of sediment. In southern Chile, our data illustrate a similar trend during most of the Cenozoic with a shift around some 6-7 Ma to substantial sediment influx from glaciation of the Patagonian part of the Andean Cordillera. As a consequence, backarc shortening stopped at this latitude, while shortening velocity in the Central Andes was still accelerating.\nUsing latitudinal evolution and variations of shortening rate, orogenic strain accumulation and deformation partitioning in the Andes can be shown to be dominated by distinct factors. The Altiplano-Puna plateaux are characterized by a complete cycle of initial lateral spreading of deformation followed by subsequent localization and acceleration of bulk shortening rate. Estimates of strength evolution based on force balance calculations and critical wedge analysis suggest significant backarc weakening driving this change. Lithosphere-scale failure from strain weakening beyond a critical strain threshold (c. 20%) and fault coalescence with formation of a weak detachment in shales (µeff < 0.1) played a key role in the evolution of the Central Andes. Strain-related lithosphere weakening dominated over the impact of external forcing mechanisms, such as variations of plate convergence, mantle-assisted processes, or erosion. In summary, the climatically-controlled sediment flux into the trench and the subduction channel along with strain-dependent weakening of the upper plate appear to be the key parameters affecting the styles of subduction orogeny.",

The Continental Shelf of Southeastern Brazil is dominated by the oligotrophic Brazil Current, whose instabilities promote an untypical western boundary upwelling of South Atlantic Central Water (SACW) and consequently increases of primary productivity. The inorganic nitrogen concentration and the δ15N­nitrate and δ15N of sinking particles was characterized for each water masses present on the shelf (SACW, Tropical Water and Coastal Water). Cross­shelf gradients of nitrogen concentration and stable isotopes were observed. The SACW showed δ15N­nitrate signature around 5­6‰ characterizing the inner and mid­shelf conditions, where the input of new nitrate from upwelling is rapidly used by organisms in the euphotic zone without any fractionation. On the other hands, the dominance of N­ limited TW on the outer shelf provided a δ15N­nitrate and δ15N­sinking particles signals (­2.0 to 3.0‰) lower than the SACW average indicating N­fixation as a dominant source of nitrogen. The δ15N fractionation during upwelling events are also identified, but in smaller scale. The information of preliminary δ15N results from Holocene sediment record along a cross-shelf gradient showed values ranging from 3 to 8 ‰. In general, the tendency of low values recorded in middle Holocene indicates low availability of N during these low productivity stages. These results agreed pretty well with the δ13C records. In contrast, during late Holocene the values were heavy, probably indicating another processes (e.g. complete use of N-pool), which are still under investigation in association with another proxies (e.g. degraded pigments, opal, CaCO3).",

            "abstract": "The vadose zone of karst systems plays an important role on the water dynamics. In particular, temporary perched aquifers can appear in the subsurface due to changes of climate conditions, diminished evapotranspiration and differences of porosity relative to deeper layers. It is therefore crucial, but challenging, to separate the hydrological signature of the vadose zone from the one of the saturated zone for understanding hydrological processes that occur in the vadose zone.\nAlthough many difficulties are usually encountered when studying karst environments due to their heterogeneities, cave systems offer an outstanding opportunity to investigate vadose zone from the inside with various techniques. We present results covering two years of hydrogeological and geophysical monitoring at the Rochefort Cave Laboratory (RCL), located in the Variscan fold-and-thrust belt (Belgium), a region that shows many karstic networks within Devonian limestone units.\nHydrogeological data such as flows and levels monitoring or tracer tests performed in both vadose and saturated zones bring valuable information on the hydrological context of the studied area. Combining those results with geophysical measurements allows validating and imaging them with more integrative techniques.\nA microgravimetric monitoring involves a superconducting gravimeter continuously measuring at the surface of the RCL. Early in 2015, a second relative gravimeter was installed in the underlying cave system located 35 meters below the surface. This set up allows highlighting vadose gravity changes. These relative measurements are calibrated using an absolute gravimeter. 12 additional stations (7 at the surface, 5 in the cave) are monitored on a monthly basis by a spring gravimeter.\nTo complete these gravimetric measurements, the site has been equipped with a permanent Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) monitoring system comprising an uncommon array of surface, borehole and cave electrodes. Although such an unconventional ERT setup is challenging in terms of data processing and interpretation, it provides valuable data for inferring variations of the vadose zone saturation rate.",

What did we learn more since then?\nESA’s constellation mission Swarm provides the opportunity to derive more reliable FAC estimates from multi-satellite magnetic field measurements. We make use of the Swarm A/C satellite pair, which flies side-by-side at a separation of 1.4° in longitude. By considering along-track differences over 5 s the four readings at the corners of an almost symmetrical quad are used for calculating the mean vertical current density flowing through the encircled area. FACs are estimated by mapping the vertical current component onto the field direction. Within the auroral oval current estimates from single and dual-satellite solutions agree generally well. Significant differences are frequently observed in the polar cap. Here underlying assumptions for single-satellite solutions are obviously not well satisfied. Another characteristic derived from the multi-satellite observations: FACs can be divided into two classes. For scale sizes up to some ten kilometers rapid temporal variations are observed. These FACs are related to kinetic Alfvén waves. The other class with scale lengths of more than 150 km can be regarded as stationary current systems lasting for more than a minute.",

More recent observations, however, evidence more and more exceptions from that. For example, CHAMP and GRACE recorded significant mass density anomalies over the polar cap practically during every magnetic storm. The question is, which process provides enough Joule heating and/or particle precipitation along the open field lines. A promising mechanism is field-aligned currents (FACs).\nIn the past it has been difficult to make reliable estimates of FACs in the polar cap from single satellite magnetic field measurements. An important assumption that the currents are organized in sheets is often not fulfilled in the polar cap. As a consequence current densities are largely underestimated. Only recently ESA’s Swarm constellation mission offers reliable FAC estimates from dual-satellite measurements. Significant differences between single and dual-satellite estimates are found in the polar cap. We will show the relation between polar cap FAC patches and IMF orientation and solar wind conditions. Based on these results suggestions for possible current drivers are made.",

The SIRCUS-based calibration facility at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center was used to measure the absolute spectral response (ASR) of the G-LiHT’s imaging spectrometer. Continuously tunable lasers coupled to an integrating sphere facilitated a radiance-based calibration for the detectors in the reflective solar bands. The transfer of the SIRCUS-based laboratory calibration of G-LiHT’s Imaging Spectrometer to the Landsat sensors (Landsat 7 ETM+ and Landsat 8 OLI) is demonstrated using simultaneous overpasses over the Red Lake Playa and McClaw’s Playa sites during the commissioning phase of Landsat 8 in March 2013. Solar Lunar Absolute Imaging Spectrometer (SOLARIS) is the calibration demonstration system for the reflected solar instrument of CLARREO. A portable version of SOLARIS, known as Suitcase SOLARIS, also calibrated using a SIRCUS-based setup, was deployed for ground measurements as a part of both the field campaigns. Simultaneous measurements of SOLARIS allow cross-comparison with G-LiHT and Landsat sensors. The transfer of the lab-based calibration of G-LiHT to Landsat sensors show that the sensors agree within 5% with a 1-3% calibration uncertainty of G-LiHT’s Imaging Spectrometer.",

It is known that this is the result of the coupling between oceanic subduction, where largest tectonic forces are generated, and continents, however why only some segments of the Asian margin display tectonics migration in the interiors remains unknown. Using numerical modeling the dynamics of the subducting and upper plates interactions is probed, emphasizing the role forces such as subducting slabs’ buoyancy, viscous mantle drag, ridge push and far-field forces have in plate margins-interiors coupling. The perturbations to the force balance following slab breakoff, continent subduction and trench land-locking during oceanic closure leads to a range of different strain regimes in the upper plate, from large-scale extrusion to thickening along the collisional margin. The models support the combined interpretation of closing plates, subduction histories and continental tectonics, which is relevant to examples of Asian continent, where similar coupled subduction and upper plate tectonics evolutions are found. It is inferred that the subduction dynamics during Tethys closure strongly controlled the emergence of lithospheric faulting and thickening, indentation, extrusion and extension in the Asian continent.",

            "abstract": "A course in numerical modeling should include a balance of theory and practical programming experience. Although numerical models can be written in virtually any computer language, some are better suited for the classroom environment. Python, with its simple and intuitive syntax, is an ideal language for students who are learning numerical modeling. Other advantages include the elimination of the compilation step prior to execution, and the ease of getting feedback and immediate visualization of results with readily available and robust plotting libraries. These advantages tip the scales in Python’s favor, compared with compiled languages such as Fortran or C++. Unlike other non-compiled languages such as Matlab and IDL, Python is also non-proprietary and easily available across all operating systems without licensing fees.\nFor several years now Python has been incorporated into the undergraduate meteorology curriculum at Millersville University, including the teaching of numerical modeling. It is the third language that has been used in the evolution of the numerical modeling course, being preceded by Fortran and IDL. In this presentation the use of Python, including IPython Notebook, for teaching numerical modeling to undergraduates is discussed, and its advantages further explained.",

            "abstract": "Observing small magnitude surface displacements through InSAR is highly challenging, and requires advanced correction techniques to reduce noise. In fact, one of the largest obstacles facing the InSAR community is related to tropospheric noise correction. Spatial and temporal variations in temperature, pressure, and relative humidity result in a spatially-variable InSAR tropospheric signal, which masks smaller surface displacements due to tectonic or volcanic deformation. Correction methods applied today include those relying on weather model data, GNSS and/or spectrometer data. Unfortunately, these methods are often limited by the spatial and temporal resolution of the auxiliary data. Alternatively a correction can be estimated from the high-resolution interferometric phase by assuming a linear or a power-law relationship between the phase and topography. For these methods, the challenge lies in separating deformation from tropospheric signals. We will present results of a statistical comparison of the state-of-the-art tropospheric corrections estimated from spectrometer products (MERIS and MODIS), a low and high spatial-resolution weather model (ERA-I and WRF), and both the conventional linear and power-law empirical methods. We evaluate the correction capability over Southern Mexico, Italy, and El Hierro, and investigate the impact of increasing cloud cover on the accuracy of the tropospheric delay estimation. We find that each method has its strengths and weaknesses, and suggest that further developments should aim to combine different correction methods.\nAll the presented methods are included into our new open source software package called TRAIN - Toolbox for Reducing Atmospheric InSAR Noise (Bekaert et al., in review), which is available to the community\nBekaert, D., R.

            "abstract": "Accurate quantitative precipitation estimation over mountainous basins is of great importance because of their susceptibility to hazards such as flash floods, shallow landslides, and debris flows, triggered by heavy precipitation events. In situ observations over mountainous areas are limited, but currently available satellite precipitation products are able to provide precipitation estimates over those areas. However, uncertainties in satellite precipitation estimates still represent the main limitation in utilizing these products in hydrological applications. Therefore, quantifying the uncertainty in satellite precipitation products is necessary for enabling an improved use of those products. The study is conducted on the Trentino Alto-Adige region, located in the eastern Italian Alps. Rainfall observations for a 10-yr period (2000-2009) derived from a dense rain gauge network in the region are used as reference. A number of satellite precipitation error properties, typically used in error modeling, are investigated and include the probability of detection, false alarm rates, missed events, spatial correlation of the error, and hit biases are investigated as a function of seasonality, satellite precipitation algorithm, satellite rainfall rate, gauge density, and temporal resolution. Three widely used satellite-based precipitation products are employed: 1) the Climate Prediction Center morphing (CMORPH) product; 2) the Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Imagery Using Artificial Neural Networks (PERSIANN); and 3) the TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) 3B42 near–real time product (3B42-RT). These products are the ones on which the new GPM level-3 precipitation product - IMERG – algorithm is based upon. Therefore, a better understanding of uncertainties associated with each single product is fundamental for improving error modeling of this merged satellite precipitation algorithm over complex terrain regions.",

            "abstract": "Almost all kinds of geological activities on Earth depend critically on the operation of plate tectonics, but did plate tectonics initiate right after the solidification of a putative magma ocean, or did it start much later, e.g., sometime during the Archean? This problem of the initiation of plate tectonics in the Earth history presents us a unique combination of observational and theoretical challenges. Finding geological evidence for the onset of plate tectonics is difficult because plate tectonics is a dynamic process that continuously destroys a remnant of the past. We therefore need to rely on more secondary traces, the interpretation of which often involves theoretical considerations. At the same time, it is still hard to predict, on a firm theoretical ground, when plate tectonics should have prevailed, because there is no consensus on why plate tectonics currently takes place on Earth. Knowing when plate tectonics began is one thing, and understanding why it did so is another. The initiation of plate tectonics is one of the last frontiers in earth science, which encourages a concerted effort from both geologists and geophysicists to identify key geological evidence and distinguish between competing theories of early Earth evolution. Such an endeavor is essential to arrive at a self-contained theory for the evolution of terrestrial planets.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic has warmed more than twice as fast as the global average, a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification (AA). These profound changes to the Arctic system have coincided with a period of ostensibly more frequent events of extreme weather across the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes, including extreme heat and rainfall events and recent severe winters. The possible link between Arctic change and mid-latitude weather has spurred a rush of new observational and modeling studies. These studies have argued that heavy precipitation events and heat waves are at least partially attributable to Arctic warming. A growing number of recent studies even argue that recent extreme winter weather is related to AA. In part due to the high impact of extreme weather on our society, some of these studies linking AA to the increased frequency of extreme weather have garnered public and media attention. At the same time, uncertainties from the large intrinsic variability of the system, the short observational record due to the recentness of AA and the shortcomings of global climate models have also resulted in much skepticism in any argued links between AA and severe weather. This in turn has resulted in a number of workshops trying to frame the problem and laying the groundwork to improve our understanding of Arctic-mid-latitude linkages and accurate attribution of extreme weather events.\nAlthough these workshops identified existing problems and difficulties, and provided broad recommendations, they did not synthesize the diversified research results to identify where community consensus and gaps exist. Therefore we have assembled many of the leading scientists researching Arctic-mid-latitude linkages as part of a US CLIVAR working group. Through the three-year efforts of this working group, we will use the outcome of the previous workshops and newly planned activities to guide the synthesis efforts, coordinate on-going research to fill out key gaps, and provide specific recommendations for accelerating scientific progress. The working group will also coordinate/integrate efforts on the topic with other national and international programs.",

            "abstract": "Aeolian erosion has been the dominant geomorphic agent to shape the surface of Mars for the past ~3.5 billion years. Although individual geomorphic features evidencing aeolian activity are well understood (e.g., yardangs, dune fields, and wind streaks), landscapes formed by aeolian erosion remain poorly characterized. Intra-crater sedimentary mounds are hypothesized to have formed by wind deflation of craters once filled with flat-lying strata, and, therefore, should be surrounded by landscapes formed by aeolian erosion. Here we present a landscape evolution model that provides both an initial characterization of aeolian landscapes, and a mechanism for large-scale excavation. Wind excavation of Gale Crater to form the 5 km high Mount Sharp would require removal of 6.4 x 104 km3 of sediment. Imagery in Gale Crater from satellites and the Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity shows a surface characterized by first-cycle aeolian erosion of bedrock. The overall landscape is interpreted to represent stages in a cycle of aeolian deflation and excavation, enhanced by physical weathering (e.g., thermal fracturing, cratering). Initial wind erosion of bedrock is enhanced along fractures, producing retreating scarps. Underlying less resistant layers then erode faster than the armoring cap rock, increasing relief in scarps to form retreating mesas. As scarp retreat continues, boulders from the armoring cap unit break away and cover the hillslopes of less resistant material below the scarps. Eventually all material from the capping unit is eroded away and a boulder-capped hill remains. Winnowing of fine material flattens hillslope topography, leaving behind a desert pavement. Over long enough time, this pavement is breached and the cycle begins anew. This cycle of landscape denudation by the wind is similar to that of water, but lacks characteristic subaqueous features such as dendritic drainage networks.",

            "abstract": "Assumptions on ice particle shapes are typically made when developing algorithms to retrieve ice cloud microphysical properties. Many remote sensing algorithms assume either a spherical shape or some sort of pristine hexagonal crystal shapes. In situ cloud sampling data, however, indicate that cloud populations with the dominance of pristine crystals or quasi-spherical ice particles are not very common. Uncertainties in particle shape model assumptions result in the microphysical retrieval uncertainties. Polarimetric measurements available with advanced scanning cloud radars provide opportunities to infer particle type and shape information. This presentation will focus on prospects for the use of radar depolarization ratio measurements to infer particle types (e.g., planar-type particles versus columnar-type particles) and estimations of their mean aspect ratios. Different types of radar depolarization measurements will be analyzed for their suitability for inferring hydrometeor shape information. Independent estimates of particle shape parameters will potentially result in reducing uncertainties of ice cloud microphysical retrievals.",

            "abstract": "InSAR is commonly used to measure surface deformation between different radar passes at cm-scale accuracy and m-scale resolution. However, InSAR measurements are often decorrelated due to vegetation growth, which greatly limits high quality InSAR data coverage. Here we present an algorithm for retrieving InSAR deformation measurements over areas with significant vegetation decorrelation through the use of adaptive interpolation between persistent scatterer (PS) pixels, those points at which surface scattering properties do not change much over time and thus decorrelation artifacts are minimal. The interpolation filter restores phase continuity in space and greatly reduces errors in phase unwrapping. We apply this algorithm to process L-band ALOS interferograms acquired over the San Luis Valley, Colorado and the Tulare Basin, California. In both areas, groundwater extraction for irrigation results in land deformation that can be detected using InSAR. We show that the PS-based algorithm reduces the artifacts from vegetation decorrelation while preserving the deformation signature. The spatial sampling resolution achieved over agricultural fields is on the order of hundreds of meters, usually sufficient for groundwater studies. The improved InSAR data allow us further to reconstruct the SBAS ground deformation time series and transform the measured deformation to head levels using the skeletal storage coefficient and time delay constant inferred from a joint InSAR-well data analysis. The resulting InSAR-head and well-head measurements in the San Luis valley show good agreement with primary confined aquifer pumping activities. This case study demonstrates that high quality InSAR deformation data can be obtained over vegetation-decorrrelated region if processed correctly.",

In order to model the spectra of these plasmas, it is necessary to obtain the appropriate collision rate coefficients.

Summing Maxwellians has the additional advantages of being easy to implement and extendable to many different collision processes. We apply this technique to modeling the charge state distribution (CSD) of kappa-distribution plasmas.

            "abstract": "The magnetic mineralogy of soils and paleosols is a rich archive of paleoclimatic information. However, efforts to quantify parameters such as mean annual precipitation (MAP) or temperature using environmental magnetism are still in their infancy. Inherent in any magnetic paleoclimate proxy is a fundamental understanding of how the concentration, grain size distribution, and composition of iron oxides and oxyhydroxides formed during pedogenesis reflect the climatic conditions that prevailed during soil formation. The influence of diagenetic processes on magnetic minerals, particularly for paleosols in pre-Quaternary systems, may compromise our ability to recover a climatic signal due to mineral alterations or incomplete preservation. Here, we evaluate the rock magnetic properties of non-loessic paleosols across the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM, ~55.5 Ma) in the Bighorn Basin, WY. Our study compares data from nine paleosol layers sampled from outcrop, exposed to surficial weathering, as well as the equivalent paleosol layers sampled from drill core, all of which are preserved below a pervasive oxidative weathering front and presumably unweathered. Despite variation in magnetic properties within paleosol layers, there is no clear change in magnetic mineralogy that we can attribute to surficial weathering. Further, common measures of magnetic enhancement in susceptibility and remanence show similar trends across the PETM, in both core and outcrop, when compared to estimates of MAP from geochemical weathering indices. Taken together, our record suggests that the magnetic minerals preserved in ancient paleosols retain at least qualitative information about paleoprecipitation and could be an important source of information for paleoclimatic studies. Further work to improve our understanding of the relative preservation of various pedogenic components in paleosols will ultimately determine their viability as quantitative indicators of paleoclimate.",

In different types of strokes (negative first, negative subsequent, and positive first), we observed faintly luminous formations (FLFs) connecting the downward leader to ground. The 2–D lengths of FLFs ranged from 51 to 200 m in negative first strokes (N = 11), from 130 to 908 m in negative subsequent strokes (N=5), and it was 177 m in 1 positive first stroke.\nThe nature of FLFs in negative first strokes differs from that in negative subsequent strokes. We inferred that in first strokes FLFs are mostly composed of positive streamers that developed from the prospective strike point (without a significant upward connecting leader), tens of microseconds prior to the return-stroke onset, while in subsequent strokes they are manifestations of elevated conduction current (of the order of 1 A) in the weakly-conducting defunct channel, occurring in response to the increasing average electric field of the descending leader. The FLF in the positive stroke appeared to be similar to its counterparts in negative first strokes.\nThe streamer connection of the first-stroke leader tip to ground constitutes the break-through phase of the attachment process. Establishment of this connection tens of microseconds prior to the lightning return-stroke onset has never been reported before. We found that the streamer connection did not significantly influence the propagation characteristics of descending leader (and the upward connecting leader, if any), except for always guiding it to the origin of streamers on the grounded object. Implications of the new observations for lightning protection will be discussed.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported in part by NSF and DARPA.",

            "abstract": "Data assimilation is a process of combining information from imperfect models and imperfect observations. To the extent that models used for data assimilation are probabilistic to account for epistemic uncertainty, we expect data assimilation to attenuate the effect of model errors on estimates of hydrologic states and fluxes. Intuitively, if data assimilation can mitigate model deficiencies, we would expect it to be informative of the nature of these deficiencies.\nWe address two related questions. The first is about how to store information gained via data assimilation into the structure of the model so that this information is not lost outside the period of observation. We show the general (theoretical) strategy for storing this information, and propose a practical algorithm based on the EnFK. Doing this results in improved forecasts of energy and carbon fluxes from land surface models, as well as improved estimates of streamflow in a rainfall-runoff model.\nStoring information in a model structure is done purely by statistical analysis of DA innovations, and so provides no insight about the adequacy of model hypotheses. We show that this type of insight can be gained by measuring how data assimilation changes the way information moves within the model. By treating the model as an information processing system, we can visualize explicitly how assimilating observations changes strengths and time-scales of couplings between modeled variables. The insight is that measuring Shannon-type information fluxes instead of mass and energy fluxes allows us to relate any variable with any other at any time-scale. We produce a concise set of statistics that are easily interpreted and directly highlight how DA effectively changes the way that the model behaves.\nWe applied these techniques to the Noah LSM after assimilating both in situ (FluxNet, SCAN) and remote sensing (AMSR-E, MODIS) observations. Results indicate that major deficiencies in the way that Noah translates climatological boundary conditions into soil water states, vegetation states, surface energy fluxes and carbon fluxes are consistent across diverse soils, climatic regimes, and biomes. This consistency suggests very particular ways to approach improving the structure of the LSM, and also that the methods we propose provide meaningful (non-spurious) insight.",

Fault geometry and predictions of whether the SSAF will rupture through the restraining bend in San Gorgonio Pass (SGP) are controversial, with significant implications for seismic hazard. The evolution of faulting in SGP has led to various models of strain accommodation, including clockwise rotation of fault-bounded blocks east of the restraining bend, and generation of faults that siphon strike slip away from the restraining bend onto the SJF (also parallel to the SSAF). Complex deformation is not restricted to the upper crust but extends to mid- and lower-crustal depths according to magnetic data and ambient-noise surface-wave tomography. Initiation of the SJF ~1.2 Ma led to formation of the relatively intact Salton block, and end of extension on the West Salton detachment fault on the west side of Coachella Valley. Geologic and geomorphic data show asymmetry of the southern Santa Rosa Mountains, with a steep fault-bounded SW flank produced by active uplift, and gentler topographic gradients on the NE flank with tilted, inactive late Pleistocene fans that are incised by modern upper fan channels. Gravity data indicate the basin floor beneath Coachella Valley is also asymmetric, with a gently NE-dipping basin floor bound by a steep SSAF; seismic-reflection data suggest that NE tilting took place during Quaternary time. 3D numerical modeling predicts gentle NE dips in the Salton block that result from the slight clockwise orientation of relative motion across a NE-dipping SSAF. A NE dip of the SSAF, supported by various geophysical datasets, would reduce shaking in Coachella Valley compared to a vertical fault.",

Solar heating of the ionosphere creates thermal winds which by dynamo action induce an electric field driving an electric current having a magnetic effect observable on the ground, as was discovered by G. Graham in 1722. The current rises and sets with the Sun and thus causes a readily observable diurnal variation of the geomagnetic field, allowing us the deduce the conductivity and thus the EUV flux as far back as reliable magnetic data reach. High–quality data go back to the ‘Magnetic Crusade’ of the 1830s and less reliable, but still usable, data are available for portions of the hundred years before that. J.R. Wolf and, independently, J.–A. Gautier discovered the dependence of the diurnal variation on solar activity, and today we understand and can invert that relationship to construct a reliable record of the EUV flux from the geomagnetic record. We compare that to the F10.7 flux and the sunspot number, and find that the reconstructed EUV flux reproduces the F10.7 flux with great accuracy. On the other hand, it appears that the Relative Sunspot Number as currently defined is beginning to no longer be a faithful representation of solar magnetic activity, at least as measured by the EUV and related indices. The reconstruction suggests that the EUV flux reaches the same low (but non–zero) value at every sunspot minimum (possibly including Grand Minima), representing an invariant ‘solar magnetic ground state’.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between soil moisture and surface evaporative fraction (latent heat flux normalized by the sum of sensible and latent heat flux) is critical in linking land surface forcing to clouds and precipitation. The evaporative fraction (EF) can influence precipitation directly through precipitation recycling, and indirectly through convective triggering. Several studies have shown that the observed correlation between soil moisture and EF is weaker than the correlation predicted in climate models, suggesting that land-atmosphere coupling is overestimated in models. Here, we present evidence that observed land-atmosphere coupling is underestimated when defined by the correlation between soil moisture and EF. Land-atmosphere coupling is three times stronger when using leaf area index as a correlate of EF instead of soil moisture, in the Southern Great Plains. This stronger coupling results from transpiration of relatively deep soil moisture. Furthermore, transpiration makes the relationship between EF and soil moisture nonlinear, and gives rise to the false appearance of weak coupling when using linear soil moisture metrics. The geographical extent of land-atmosphere coupling is not as small as in previous estimates. Regions of substantial land-atmosphere coupling extend to semi-arid and humid continental climates across the United States, in terms of correlations between vegetation metrics and EF. A comparison of the Community Land Model (CLM4.5) to observations in the Southern Great Plains reveals that the model overestimates correlations between soil moisture and EF, but underestimates correlations between leaf area index and EF by 30%, even when using observed daily leaf area index and meteorological forcing. It appears that the hydrological cycle is more tightly constrained by vegetation in observations than in climate models.",

            "abstract": "The endangered chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) is threatened by habitat loss from resource extraction and land conversion, as well as hunting, disease and the illegal pet trade. It has been estimated that more than 70% of chimpanzee's tropical forest habitats in Africa are now threatened by land use change. Recent developments in remote sensing and cloud computing enable the use of satellite observations to provide a synoptic view of chimpanzee habitats at finer spatial and temporal resolutions that are locally relevant and consistent across the entire species’ range. We present a practical Decision Support System to be used by the Jane Goodall Institute and partners to annually monitor and forecast chimpanzee habitat health in Africa. The system integrates Earth observations from 30-meter resolution Landsat data with a species-specific habitat model and a model forecasting future land use change, enhanced by crowd-sourced field data collected by local communities and rangers using the Open Data Kit app and Android mobile smartphones and tablets. While coarser-scale and static chimpanzee habitat models have been previously developed, this project is the first to develop a dynamic monitoring system updated annually via Earth observations data that will systematically monitor threats and changes in habitat over time. Since the chimpanzee is an important keystone, flagship and umbrella species, an annual chimpanzee habitat health index would support conservation goals of other species within its large 2.5 million sq. km range and could be an important indicator of overall ecosystem health of tropical forests in Africa.",

            "abstract": "A critical, long-standing problem in substorm research is identification of the sequence of events leading to substorm expansion phase onset. Recent THEMIS all-sky imager (ASI) array observations have shown a repeatable pre-onset sequence, which is initiated by a poleward boundary intensification (PBI) and is followed by auroral streamers moving equatorward (earthward flow in the plasma sheet) and then by substorm onset. On the other hand, substorm onset is also preceded by azimuthally propagating waves, indicating a possible importance of wave instability for triggering substorm onset. However, it has been difficult to identify the link between fast flows and waves. We have found an isolated substorm event that was well-instrumented with the Poker Flat incoherent scatter radar (PFISR), THEMIS white-light ASI, and multi-spectral ASI, where the auroral onset occurred within the PFISR and ASI fields-of-view. This substorm onset was preceded by a PBI, and ionospheric flows propagated equatorward from the polar cap, crossed the PBI and reached the growth phase arc. This sequence provides evidence that flows from open magnetic field lines propagate across the open-closed boundary and reach the near-Earth plasma sheet prior to the onset. Quasi-stable oscillations in auroral luminosity and ionospheric density are found along the growth phase arc. These pre-onset auroral waves amplified abruptly at the onset time, soon after the equatorward flows reached the onset region. This sequence suggests a coupling process where pre-existing stable waves in the near-Earth plasma sheet interact with flows from further downtail and then evolve to onset instability.",

An important question for both earthquake physics and seismic hazard analysis of other complex fault systems is whether this earthquake’s complex rupture and slip pattern can be reproduced and explained with dynamic rupture models. In particular, what details of the fault geometry and of the pre-event fault stress distribution are required to allow such a rupture, with multiple stepovers and changes in dip and strike, to take place? We perform 3D Finite Element (FE) modeling of this event using realistic fault geometry and topography, and explore the effects of geometry, frictional properties, and stress assumptions on the ability to reproduce observed features of this earthquake. These models are part of a larger project that combines a 3D geodetic model of the El Mayor-Cucapah event with dynamic rupture models that are designed to match this inverted slip distribution. By combining observations with dynamic modeling in an iterative fashion, we are able to produce physically-reasonable models that match primary observations of this event.",

            "abstract": "The contribution to lithospheric magnetization from deep crustal rocks remains enigmatic. Based on models from satellite studies, the magnetic signature of the crust is best fitted using a susceptibility value of ~0.04 SI. Current models use crustal thicknesses from seismic and thermal studies, and then attempt to fit satellite magnetic data using a magnetic response in the direction of the present day field. This susceptibility is significantly higher than is found in many continental rocks. It is an open question whether there are more magnetic rocks at depth, if parts of the mantle could contribute, or if assumptions in the model are incomplete.\nThe magnetic response of deep crustal rocks is strongly controlled by the amount and oxidation state of magnetic minerals, thermal structure of the crust, whether fluids were available during metamorphism, and at what Ts and Ps reactions occurred. Subduction zones have been proposed as areas of enhanced magnetic signal due to production of magnetite, however high-grade metamorphism to eclogite facies may destroy magnetic minerals as Fe is absorbed into garnet. Contributions from mantle rocks would depend on the compositions of olivine and pyroxene, fluid availability, and PT regimes capable of producing magnetite.\n1450 samples from mafic and ultramafic bodies in the Western Gneiss Region (WGR), Norway, >300 from the Leka Ophiolite, and >350 of ultramafic rocks from the Seiland Igneous Province were studied in the Scandian collision zone. They show strong variations in petrophysical properties, oxide mineralogy and assemblages. Four groups of WGR samples, represent different metamorphic conditions and crustal depths: 1) Garnet-corona gabbros considered to have reached 600-750oC and 1-1.5 Gpa, equivalent to depths up to 60 km; 2) Normal eclogite-facies rocks that reached 700-750oC and 1.5 -2.5 Gpa, equivalent to depths of 60-90 km; 3) Ultrahigh-pressure eclogite-facies rocks that reached 750-850oC and 2.5-4 Gpa, equivalent to depths 90-120 km; 4) Garnet peridotites that may have reached 850-900oC and up to 6.5 GPa, equivalent to depths 200 km. In addition, samples from the partially serpentinized Leka Ophiolite, and Seiland ultramafic rocks (crystallized ~1500oC) are compared for magnetic properties, mineralogy and contributions to crustal magnetism.",

            "abstract": "Mountain streams provide important headwater refugia for native fish, amphibians, and other cold-water fauna globally. Although the well documented existence of such refugia indicates some level of resistance to ongoing environmental change, stream warming associated with climate change raises questions about their future persistence. Moreover, evidence exists that air temperatures are warming faster at higher elevations, and some stream temperature models predict that cold streams associated with snowmelt hydrologies will be most sensitive to air temperature increases (i.e. high ratio of stream Δ˚C:air Δ˚C). Here, we estimate stream sensitivities to climate forcing using long-term monitoring records from 927 sites across the topographically complex northwestern U.S. Sensitivity values are combined with high-resolution NorWeST stream temperature scenarios (website:\nhttp://www.fs.fed.us/rm/boise/AWAE/projects/NorWeST.html\n) to map climate velocities at 1 kilometer resolution throughout the 450,000 stream kilometers in the regional network. Our results suggest that cold mountain streams are often ‘double buffered’ against the thermal effects of climate change due to low sensitivities (0.3ºC/ºC) and steep gradients, which translated to very slow climate velocities (<0.35 km/decade for streams >3% slope) from 1968-2011 when air temperatures warmed at the rate of 0.2ºC/decade. Alternative scenarios based on aggressive air temperature warming rates (2x historical rates) and higher sensitivity values of cold streams suggests velocities will remain low in mountain streams due to the dominant effects of steep channel slope and strong local temperature gradients. These results reinforce earlier predictions from high-resolution species distribution models that show which watersheds are most likely to host resilient native trout populations across the West later this century (Climate Shield project website:\nhttp://www.fs.fed.us/rm/boise/AWAE/projects/ClimateShield.html\n). Although other aspects of climate change related to changing hydrology and disturbance regimes may affect stream refuges in mountainous areas, their high thermal resistance should enable many to continue serving as conservatoires of cold-water biodiversity for the foreseeable future.",

            "abstract": "Numerical weather prediction models and observation (forward) operators are important components of modern data assimilation systems. They are inherently nonlinear or even highly nonlinear at times. These nonlinearities can be handled through an iterative procedure, often referred to as the “outer loop” / ”inner loop” formulation in 3D/4DVar data assimilation. In the “inner loop”, one typically minimizes a cost-function around a previous 3D/4D state that is already a good approximation of the true nonlinear state. Additional “outer loops” are then used to account for the missing nonlinearity in both the NWP model and the observation operator. There is no formal proof of convergence in the aforementioned iterative procedure in general. However, it can be formally shown that the procedure can converge under certain condition (e.g. the Gauss-Newton algorithm). In practice, the iterative procedure works quite well due to the fact that the NWP model and the observation operators are generally quite good in capturing majority of the nonlinearity in dynamical process.\nThe NRL global and mesoscale 4DVar systems use the Accelerated Representer (AR) formulation to solve the analysis equations in observation space. The dual formulation has several strategic advantages, but also present additional challenges unique to this formulation. This presentation will describe various methods used within the NRL Accelerated Representer 4DVar formulations to extend the solution methods to weakly nonlinear problems. These include ocean surface wind speed assimilation, assimilation of water vapor sensitive radiances, the multiple outer loop formulation, and the inclusion of linearized physics in the tangent linear and adjoint models.",

            "abstract": "A challenge for traditional InSAR has been its limited spatial and temporal coverage especially for very large events, whose dimensions exceed the typical swath width of 70 – 100 km. This problem is addressed by the ScanSAR mode of the ALOS-2 satellite’s PALSAR-2 instrument, which enables a repeat time of 2 weeks and a swath width of 350 km. We present InSAR line-of-sight displacement observations from ScanSAR images acquired within one week of both the Mw 7.8 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake and its Mw 7.3 aftershock. The Mw 7.3 aftershock extended the rupture area of the main shock toward the east, but also left a 20 km gap where the fault has little or no co-seismic slip. We estimate this un-slipped fault patch has the potential to generate a Mw 6.9 event. Our results are freely available online at http://topex.ucsd.edu/nepal, and we encourage their use in models of the fault slip and associated stress changes. We also discuss burst alignment of the PALSAR-2 ScanSAR images and show that while images acquired after February 8, 2015 are burst-aligned with each other, prior to that date the alignment drifted according to a sinusoidal function. We present an accurate formula for determining the burst offset between two scenes; the date ranges for burst alignment with post-February 8 images are July 22 – July 31, November 8 – November 17, December 16 – December 23 2014, and January 20 – January 29 2015.",

We record interseismic deformation using four separate ENVISAT InSAR viewing geometries and continuous and survey-mode GPS, resulting in a dense set of observations of both shallow creep and regional strain accumulation due to secular loading. These data are combined with observations of coseismic and postseismic surface slip due to the 1979 Mw 6.6 Imperial Valley earthquake. We compare the geodetic data to two-dimensional models of the earthquake cycle on a strike-slip fault obeying rate- and state-dependent friction. We find that data from all parts of the earthquake cycle are required to constrain key fault properties such as the rate-dependence parameter (a-b) as a function of depth; the extent of shallow creep; and the recurrence interval of large events. The data are inconsistent with a high (>30 mm/yr) slip rate on the Imperial fault, and we propose that an extension of the San Jacinto - Superstition Hills fault system through the town of El Centro may accommodate a significant portion of the slip previously attributed to the Imperial fault. Models including this additional sub-parallel fault are in better agreement with the available observations, implying that the long-term slip rate of the Imperial fault is lower than previously suggested, and that there may be a significant unmapped hazard in the western Imperial Valley.",

To better image the Long Valley magmatic system, 60 full-tensor broadband magnetotelluric (MT) stations were collected in LVC and modeled in three-dimensions to constrain the subsurface electrical resistivity structure down to 30 km. Three conductive zones are imaged in the preferred resistivity model. The most prominent conductive zone (<7 Ohm-m) is located 5 km beneath the resurgent dome (near the center of Long Valley Caldera), where it elongates in a north-south direction, and has westward connection to the surface close to well 44-16 near Deer Mountan. This conductive zone is interpreted to be an accumulation zone of hydrothermal fluids originating from a deeper magmatic source. The shape of the conductive body suggests that the fluids pool under the resurgent dome and migrate westward, upwelling just south of well 44-16 to feed the near surface geothermal system. A second conductive zone (<10 Ohm-m) is 4 km southeast of the resurgent dome and 5 km deep and coincident with the seismic swarm of 2014. This is another zone of fluid accumulation, where the source could be the fluid accumulation zone to the west or an independent deeper source. The third conductive anomaly (<10 Ohm-m) is a few kilometers south of the resurgent dome below a depth of 15 km, and collocated with a low p- and s-wave velocity zone, and directly beneath a GPS inflation area, all of which advocate for a magma mush zone of as much as 30% interstitial melt. The preferred resistivity model suggests an accumulation of hydrothermal fluids 5 km below the resurgent dome that originates from a deeper magmatic source at 15 km depth.",

Combining 16 years of Ulysses interstellar dust data with Monte Carlo simulations of these particle trajectories in the inner heliosphere have unveiled new insights in the interstellar dust flow, the dust properties and it can be used to explore the nature of the outer heliosphere.\nWe start the talk with an overview of the current state of the art of the local interstellar dust research. We then explain the simulations and put them in the context of the Ulysses data. Using these, we demonstrate that the particles are likely to be porous, and we show why a model of dust propagation through the outer heliosphere is needed to provide a final proof. Also, we discuss the steps needed to determine from the simulations, data, and experiments how porous or fluffy the interstellar dust is. Finally, we explain how ISD data can be used as an extra ‘measureable’ to explore the structure of the outer heliosphere and we conclude the talk with a summary of how this enhances our knowledge of ISD and the LIC.",

These waves are thought to play important roles in the radial transport and energization of particles and also important roles in the loss of electrons from the radiation belts. There have been observations of particle responses to ULF waves by electrons like that of Hao et al. 2014 and ULF waves have been correlated with electron precipitation observed by the BARREL mission (Halford et al., 2015). There are observations of resonant interactions between the particles and waves such as those published by Claudepierre et al., 2013 and Dai et al, 2013, plus observations relating EMIC waves to losses of relativistic electrons like that of Usanova et al., 2014 and Zan et al., 2014. Observations like these will be reviewed from the perspective of the particle measurements on the Van Allen Probes. In addition we will give a short summary of measurement improvements planned for the Van Allen Probes extended mission that will better support future particle comparisons with the low frequency waves.",

The analysis is performed between ±45° latitude during 2011, when reliable and continuous measurements are available. With geomagnetic and solar effects removed, DE3 and the UFKW are identified as dominant sources of day-to-day variability at both heights. Evidence is found for the vertical propagation of DE3 and the UFKW from the lower to middle thermosphere over a range of time scales. Over 60% of the variance due to DE3 and the UFKW at 260 km is traceable to variability occurring at 100 km. The not exact agreement is thought to be due to the influences of wave-wave interactions, zonal mean winds, dissipation, and inherent transience that interfere with one-to-one mapping of structures between 100 and 260 km. Spectral and temporal analyses of the SABER and GOCE data also reveal the presence of sidebands due to the modulation of DE3 by the UFKW. These secondary waves are responsible for up to 10% to 20% of the longitudinal and day-to-day variability. Overall, vertical propagating waves together with sidebands from DE3-UFKW nonlinear interactions are responsible for 60% to 80% of the total variability, while geomagnetic and solar effects correlated with ap and F10.7 account for less than 20% of the variance.",

They control the transport of water, solutes, and sediments to larger rivers downstream, and regulate the erosional development of many mountain landscapes. Flow and transport processes in these steep channels contrast with those in their lower-gradient counterparts. Steep streams have complex bed morphology, with large roughness relative to the flow depth, and the flow is likewise complex, often comprising a variable mixture of air and water. Here we present several examples from Switzerland highlighting recent research into hydraulics, sediment transport, and bedrock erosion in steep Alpine channels. The Riedbach presents a striking natural experiment, in which the channel gradient steepens from roughly 3% to more than 40% in less than 1km, while the discharge, flow width, and sediment transport rates remain roughly constant. Measurements at the Riedbach illustrate the self-adjustment of flow velocity and bed roughness in steep mountain channels. Data from the Erlenbach, an intensively instrumented stream in the Alpine foothills, illustrate how the bed configuration of such streams regulates the relationship between flow and sediment transport. Field studies at the Gornera illustrate how flow patterns control the spatial distribution of bedrock erosion in this glacier-fed stream in the shadow of the Matterhorn. We present an overview of these studies and discuss their implications.",

            "abstract": "It has long been known that ridge basalts tend to become enriched in both isotopic and incompatible trace element ratios with proximity to a hot spot. Less recognized is that at a certain distance from the hot spot, samples are relatively depleted in moderately incompatible element ratios (e.g., Zr/Y, Dy/Yb) even as the enrichment in highly incompatible element ratios (e.g., Ba/La, La/Sm) persists. This leads in some cases to trace element patterns that are concave downward for moderately incompatible elements, indicating a depleted source, and concave upward for highly incompatible elements, indicating an enriched source. Clear offsets for samples near hot spots exist on plots such as Ba/La vs. Dy/Yb, and they also often have low Na8.0 for their depth. Areas where such geochemical characteristics occur are adjacent to hot spots—they form a kind of geochemical “moat” of combined depletion and enrichment. Moats can result from two sequential processes: first removal of a melt in the presence of garnet, leading to a source with low Dy/Yb, etc., followed by addition of a low-degree (low F) enriched melt to produce incompatible element and isotope enrichment.\nTwo hypotheses for the moats are (1) they result from recent plume flow, where mantle that loses melt to the hot spot center is refertilized and enriched as it flows down the ridge. (2) Increased melting associated with a hot spot permits melting of ancient sources depleted by melt loss in the presence of garnet. High Hf isotopes for some moat samples from the N. Atlantic support model (2).\nGeochemical moats have global regularities. Using segment means from previous work, we show that the maximum distance of a moat segment from a hot spot correlates with plume flux normalized to spreading rate, with an R2 >0.9. A higher plume flux at slower spreading rates creates a larger moat. While high Hf isotopes are typical of N. Atlantic moat samples, this is not the case near Afar and Galapagos. This supports model (1) above, with Hf isotopes likely reflecting the regional mantle. While a geochemical model to account for the moats is straightforward, 3-D geophysical modeling is necessary to further elucidate these relationships.",

Soil organic carbon is also a key indicator of soil quality as it affects essential biological, chemical, and physical soil functions such as nutrient cycling, water retention, and soil structure maintenance. Much of the SOC on earth is found in forest ecosystems and is thought to be relatively stable. That said, there is growing evidence that SOC may be sensitive to disturbance and global change drivers. In the United States (US), SOC in forests is monitored by the national forest inventory (NFI) conducted by the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program within the US Department of Agriculture, Forest Service. The FIA program currently uses SOC predictions based on SSURGO/STATSGO data to populate the NFI. Most of estimates of SOC in forests from the SSURGO/STATSGO data are based primarily upon expert opinion and lack systematic field observations. The FIA program has been consistently measuring soil attributes as part of the NFI since 2001 and has amassed an extensive inventory of SOC in forests in the conterminous US and coastal Alaska. Here we present estimates of SOC obtained using data from the NFI and International Soil Carbon Network and describe the modeling framework used to compile estimates for United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change reporting.",

This younger ice has a lower probability of surviving the next melt season, and features different surface properties than multi-year ice floes typically possess. Through the combination of satellite passive microwave observations and buoy data, the motion and age of the ice pack in the Arctic are tracked and analyzed using datasets produced at the University of Colorado, Boulder that are archived at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. The ice motion product is produced daily from 1978 to the present, and the weekly age data span from 1985 onward. Using these products, the advection of first-year and multi-year ice is tracked through several key ice “gates” throughout the Arctic on relatively short time scales. Understanding the “sinks” that sea ice travels to and melts in will provide a more complete picture of the underlying causes in the decline in sea ice extent and volume in the Arctic. Through tracking the trajectory and locations of ice parcels in our ice motion product, we can also use other co-located data products to assess the impact of radiative and other climate component forcing on the Arctic ice pack.",

            "abstract": "Accurate modeling of major atmospheric chemical processes (oxidant cycling, aerosol formation, etc.) requires understanding the identity, chemistry, and lifecycle (emission, reaction, and deposition) of atmospheric organic species. Such an understanding is generally limited by the wide diversity in chemical structure, properties, and reactivity of atmospheric organics, posing major challenges in detection and quantification. However the last several years have seen the development of several new techniques for the measurement of a wide range of carbon-containing compounds, including low-volatility, oxidized species that have traditionally been difficult to measure. Many of these new techniques are based on high-resolution mass spectrometry, enabling the unambiguous identification of individual ions, and hence the elemental ratios and carbon oxidation state of the organic species; most also provide information on volatility and/or carbon number distributions of the molecular species. While a single instrument can generally measure only species of a particular class (occupying a localized region of “chemical space”), here we show that the combined measurements from multiple instruments can provide a comprehensive picture of the chemical composition of the entire organic mixture. From these combined measurements, the organic species can be described not only in terms of organic carbon mass but also in terms of distributions of key ensemble properties (such as oxidation state and volatility), and thus can be used to populate and constrain the various reduced-dimensionality chemical spaces that have been put forth as frameworks for describing atmospheric organic chemistry. We apply this general measurement approach both to field data, providing information on ambient organic species, and to laboratory (chamber) studies, providing insight into the chemical transformations that organic species undergo upon atmospheric oxidation.",

This presentation discusses results from the CIMC related to the dynamics of Equatorial Magnetosonic Waves (EMW). Cluster measurements were obtained within the EMW generation region enabling the identification of the observed proton ring distribution as the source of instability leading to the generation of EMW. The small spacecraft separation enabled two point observations of EMW within the wave coherency scale, and therefore to identify the wave dispersion directly from measurements. This dispersion is compared with analytical results. Finally the validity Chirikov resonance overlap criteria has been investigated and found to be consistent with the measurements. This latter result validates the current use of the quasi-linear approach in the modelling of EMW in spite of their discrete nature. Other results from the CIMC are also reviewed briefly.",

            "abstract": "Observations from MESSENGER's MAG and FIPS instruments during the first orbital year have resulted in the identification of 25 magnetopause crossings in Mercury's magnetosphere with significant low-latitude boundary layers (LLBLs). The large majority of these crossings are observed on the dawnside and for northward interplanetary magnetic field. The estimated LLBL thickness is 450±56 km, and increases with distance to noon. The Na+-group ion is sporadically present in 14 of the boundary layers, with an observed average number density of 22±11 % of the proton density. Furthermore, the average Na+-group gyroradii in the layers is 220±34 km, the same order of magnitude as the LLBL thickness. Magnetic shear, plasma β and reconnection rates have been estimated for the LLBL crossings, and compared to those of a control group (non-LLBL) of 61 distinct magnetopause crossings which show signs of nearly no plasma inside the magnetopause. The results indicate that reconnection is significantly slower, or even suppressed, for the LLBL crossings compared to the non-LLBL cases. Possible processes that form or impact the LLBL are discussed. Protons injected through the cusp or flank may be important for the formation of the LLBL. Furthermore, the opposite asymmetry in the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) as compared to the LLBL, rules out the KHI as a dominant formation mechanism. However, the KHI and LLBL could be related to each other, either by the impact of sodium ions gyrating across the magnetopause, or by the LLBL preventing the growth of KH waves on the dawnside.",

            "abstract": "Climate models suggest that global warming will cause substantial changes of the mid-latitude circulation, including meridional shifts of the extratropical jets and storm tracks. The magnitude, and in some circumstances even the sign, of these shifts remains subject to large model uncertainties, however. In this talk I will report on recent work that demonstrates the importance of longwave radiative effects of clouds and water vapor for the jet position and its response to warming. To this end, I will apply a hierarchy of climate models ranging from CMIP5 models in realisitic setups to dry idealized general circulation models. I will show that cloud changes, in particular those of the tropics and mid-latitudes, and high-latitude water vapor changes push the jet towards the pole under global warming, whereas equatorial water vapor changes pull the jet towards the equator. These radiative impacts of clouds and water vapor on the jet are found to be consistent with our understanding of the response of the dry circulation to diabatic heating. I will also discuss the extent to which mid-latitude clouds are controlled by the jet. Finally, I will show that CMIP5 model spread in warming-induced jet shifts is correlated with model spread in regional changes of clouds and water vapor. These results provide evidence that part of the climate model uncertainty in projections of future jet shifts might result from uncertainty in how clouds and water vapor respond to global warming, and how they modify the longwave radiation inside the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Climate change threatens to create fundamental shifts in in the distributions and abundances of endothermic organisms such as cold-water salmon and trout species (salmonids). Recently published projected declines in mid-latitude salmonid distributions under future climates range from modest to severe, depending on modeling approaches, assumptions, and spatial context of analyses. Given these projected losses, increased emphasis on management for ecosystem resilience to help buffer cold-water fish populations and their habitats against climate change is emerging. Using terms such as “climate-proofing”, “climate-ready”, and “climate refugia”, such efforts stake a claim for an adaptive, anticipatory planning response to the climate change threat. To be effective, such approaches will need to address critical uncertainties in both the physical basis for projected landscape changes in water temperature and streamflow, as well as the biological responses of organisms. Recent efforts define future potential climate refugia based on projected streamflows, air temperatures, and associated water temperature changes. These efforts reflect the relatively strong conceptual foundation for linkages between regional climate change and local hydrological responses and thermal dynamics. Yet important questions remain. Drawing on case studies throughout the Pacific Northwest, we illustrate some key uncertainties in the responses of salmonids and their habitats to altered hydro-climatic regimes currently not well addressed by physical or ecological models. Key uncertainties include biotic interactions, organismal adaptive capacity, local climate decoupling due to groundwater-surface water interactions, the influence of human engineering responses, and synergies between climatic and other stressors. These uncertainties need not delay anticipatory planning, but rather highlight the need for identification and communication of actions with high probabilities of success, and targeted research within an adaptive management framework.",

            "abstract": "Mid-ocean ridge magmatism is driven by seafloor spreading and decompression melting of the upper mantle. Scaling estimates [1-2] and model results [3-4] indicate that glacial-interglacial changes in sea level should modulate melt production at mid-ocean ridges, an idea that has been confirmed with detailed surveys of ridge bathymetry [4-5]. The nature and timing of associated changes in hydrothermal activity have remained unknown, however, precluding a clear understanding of whether ridge magmatism can act as a negative feedback on ice sheet size. Here we present multiple records of hydrothermal sedimentation spanning 1300 km of the East Pacific Rise (EPR). At each location, the flux of Fe, Mn, and As increased beginning at ~25 kyr BP, reached maximum values by 15 kyr BP, and then decreased into the Holocene.  Lateral sediment focusing is an unlikely explanation given the similar signal in multiple cores and the lack of evidence for anomalous horizontal transport in 3He-based focusing factors. Coherent variations in Fe, Mn, and As suggest that diagenetic overprinting is not the primary driver of the down core signal. Elevated metal fluxes also occur during Termination II. The time series of hydrothermal sedimentation bear a strong resemblance to a record of seafloor bathymetry from 17ºS [5], suggesting that both have a common driver. The simplest explanation is glacial-interglacial variations in sea level, which apparently modulates sub-ridge melting, seafloor bathymetry, and hydrothermal activity at the EPR. Our results imply that geothermal heat flux from ridges increases during the last two glacial terminations, which should act to erode the deep ocean stratification, enhance the abyssal circulation, and transmit excess heat to the Southern Ocean, thereby setting the stage for deglaciation.\n[1] Lund and Asimow (2008) AGU Fall Meeting, Abstract #PP11D-08.

            "abstract": "Two plumes of water vapor emanating from Europa’s southern leading hemisphere provide the best explanation for UV emissions detected by HST in Dec 2012 (Roth et al., 2014a). The detection occurred when Europa was near its orbital apocenter; there was no indication of plumes in two previous observations that occurred near pericenter. A southern location and cyclic activity peaking at apocenter are characteristic of Enceladus’ plumes (Porco et al., 2006; Spencer et al., 2006; Hedman et al., 2013), which led to the suggestion that Europa also has long-lived, active plumes controlled by tides (Roth et al., 2014a). However, two subsequent observations did not result in a repeat detection, even when Europa was again near apocenter (Roth et al., 2014b). Because tidal stresses caused by eccentricity, the supposed control mechanism of Enceladus’ plumes (Hurford et al., 2007; Nimmo et al., 2014), repeat exactly over each orbit, the lack of a repeat detection challenged the interpretation of tidally-modulated plumes on Europa.\nIn Rhoden et al. (2015), we considered the role of Europa’s tilted and precessing spin pole in modulating the eruption timing of the plumes. We found that, for a range of plausible precession rates (see Bills et al., 2009), tidal stresses could change substantially over subsequent orbits even for the same fracture orientation, location, and time in Europa’s orbit. We then identified subsets of fractures that would have been in tension when the plumes were detected and in compression during the other four observations.\nAn additional 15 HST observations of Europa have now been conducted over a wide range of true anomalies, with no plumes detected. Whether we would predict plumes at these times - due to tidal stress - depends on the precession rate we assume for Europa. We use the approach presented in Rhoden et al. (2015) to simultaneously fit all 20 HST observations to determine whether any fractures on Europa would be compatible with long-lived, tidally-modulated plumes. Furthermore, the 4-fold increase in the number of observations from the 2015 HST cycle can provide new insight into the conditions that may control plume behavior, such as the availability of liquid water and the number of active faults. We will discuss these implications and how they relate to the upcoming mission to Europa.",

            "abstract": "Streams in many Andean regions provide downstream communities and industries with water sourced from both groundwater and glacier melt, such as the streams of the Cordillera Blanca, Peru, which has the highest density of glaciers in the tropics. From May to September, when precipitation is minimal, approximately half the discharge in the region’s proglacial streams comes from groundwater. However, due to the remote nature of the region, there are few effective field methods to identify the spatial distribution of groundwater discharge at the reach scale. An energy balance model, Rhodamine WT dye tracing, and high-definition kite-borne imagery were used to determine gross and net groundwater inputs to a 4 km reach of the Quilcay River within Huascaran National Park, Peru.\nThe HFLUX computer program (http://hydrology.syr.edu/hflux.html) was used to simulate the Quilcay River’s energy balance using stream temperature observations, meteorological measurements, and kite-borne areal photography. Model results indicate 29% of stream discharge at the reach outlet was contributed by groundwater discharge over the study section. A constant rate Rhodamine-WT dye tracing experiment, coupled with the energy-balance model, shows that approximately 49% of stream water is exchanged (ie. no net gain) with the subsurface as gross gains and losses.\nThe energy balance simulations suggest the largest net groundwater gains in streamflow occur in reaches situated in low gradient meadows, likely a product of the abundant springs that flow into the main channel. Dye tracing results indicate significant groundwater-surface water exchange occurs in stream sections that traverse cross-valley moraines, where connectivity between the subsurface and the stream is highest. These insights into pathways of groundwater-surface water interaction can be applied to improve hydrological modeling in proglacial catchments throughout South America.",

With three-point simultaneous observations, two components of the ion density gradient can be calculated in the vortex plane. In the results, we find that: (1) under either northward or southward IMF, cold dense plasma was found in the Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) vortices even when the IMF was southward; (2) in both events, there existed an ion density gradient as large as 0.5 cm-3/Mm for southward IMF and 2.0 cm-3/Mm for southward IMF alongside with K-H vortices in the low latitude boundary layer (LLBL); (3) the dominant direction of the ion density gradient in the vortex plane pointed outward to the magnetopause when the gradient is defined as the increasing direction; (4) in both events, the ion density gradient has positive correlation with the vorticity calculated by the same technique. The ion density gradient driven by K-H vortices indicates that plasma diffusion plays an important role as the micro-physical process of plasma transport into the magnetosphere directly through the LLBL with K-H vortices.",

Previous studies (Nakajima et al. 2010; Suzuki et al. 2010) have devised a novel methodology for combining the CloudSat and MODIS satellite observations to investigate the microphysical processes. The statistics constructed with the methodology, referred to as the Contoured Frequency by Optical Depth Diagram (CFODD), provides a lifecycle view of warm clouds. Following the previous studies, we conduct detailed analyses of CFODD with a particular focus on comparisons between land and ocean. Our result shows that the coalescence process starts faster in the oceanic warm clouds than continental warm clouds. Also, oceanic clouds tend to produce more drizzle than continental clouds. Moreover, it is found that the difference between oceanic and continental cloud-to-precipitation process can be explained by different environmental conditions. For example, the cloud-to-precipitation processes in continental clouds are more similar to those in oceanic clouds over unstable environments than those over stable environments. Furthermore, ground-based measurement data obtained from Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) data and a cloud model simulation are analyzed to test how vertical velocity affects the warm rain formation process. Our result suggests that although the intensities of convective updrafts in warm clouds have been paid less attention, intensities of convective updrafts play a critical role in the warm rain formation process.",

This is best described by the coherence between stations.We demonstrate that a normalized coherence calculated from phase angles only is more robust to outliers. This processing has been popular for observing microseisms and for extracting noise cross correlation results.\nWe illustrate coherence-based processing for tracking storms in the Southern Ocean from the southern Californian array.The preprocessing is popular where stable traveltimes between stations are required. However, for extracting directions of propagating noise or attenuation the discarding of amplitudes can be problematic.\nFor large arrays (e.g. Long Beach array or USArray) there are often weak coherent arrivals within a fraction of the array. These cannot be observed with the whole array or using individual sensors. Forming first a coherence matrix, we identify the elements in the noise crosscorrelation matrix with sufficiently (?) large entries. Based on these entries further processing can identify the source location.",

            "abstract": "Curiosity, the Mars Science Laboratory rover, landed in Gale crater in 2012. The Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI), located on Curiosity’s robotic arm, can be placed as close as 0.2 cm from targets. At this distance it has a pixel scale of ~13 µm/pixel. MAHLI usually images in daylight, but light emitting diodes (LEDs) located around the lens make nighttime imaging possible. Two of the six LEDs produce 365 nm long wave UV and near-UV light and small amounts of green and red light.\nOn Mars MAHLI has taken images of UV-illuminated rocks, drill tailings, and a fluorescent calibration standard. In a lab test bed we took images of UV-illuminated terrestrial minerals. The test bed UV LEDs are equivalent to those on MAHLI. Fluorescence in the test bed was inferred when the color of the mineral in UV light was shifted from the color of the reflected incident UV light on non-fluorescing targets. We demonstrate this shift with terrestrial minerals: willemite (ZnSiO4) is green, fluorite (CaF2) is blue, fluorapatite (Ca5(PO4)3F) is yellow, and (some) calcites are red (Figure). Bassanite (CaSO4•½H2O) has been identified in sedimentary rock in Gale, and under long wave UV illumination, terrestrial bassanite fluoresces blue. In addition to bassanite, fluorite and apatite are candidate minerals in Gale crater.\nPortions of a bassanite-bearing target in Gale appear to fluoresce blue under MAHLI UV illumination. Adjacent to the bassanite is a dark mineral that yields a signal with more blue and less red and green than the bassanite suggesting a second fluorescing mineral. If these findings are supported by additional MAHLI and test bed measurements, then this will be the first fluorescence detection of its kind on Mars. This will be a step toward using UV light for the detection of organic compounds as has been proposed for the Mars 2020 mission.",

            "abstract": "The New Zealand palaeotsunami database was first established in 2008 and has continued to grow in a somewhat ad hoc manner since then. While ostensibly a geological database, it has grown markedly through the addition of geomorphological, archaeological, anthropological and ecological data. The main tsunami research focus in New Zealand has tended to be along those coastlines either adjacent to a local subduction zone or exposed to events generated by similar distant sources; in this case - the eastern shores of New Zealand. Examining the database, we unexpectedly identified at least two large events within the past 700 years on the western shores. Event 1 occurred between 1470 and 1510AD and Event 2 between 1320 and 1450AD. Once the probable extent of these events was defined we were able to then propose a range of potential tsunamigenic sources including non-subduction fault ruptures and several slope failure mechanisms.\nWhile numerous sites with contemporaneously-aged evidence along the eastern shores point to significant probable subduction zone tsunamis, at least one anomalously high elevation data point stands out. The ~60 masl site at Korapuke Island fits comfortably within the timing of a probable 15th century palaeotsunami but evidence from neighbouring sites along 10s of kms of coastline range from only 0-10 masl. A subsequent reassessment of the site identified no unusual characteristics that might amplify runup and no local tsunamigenic source. However, a similar nearby site has high elevation (~45 m) deposits laid down in 1996 by a waterspout and it seems increasing likely that Korapuke Island may have the first reported palaeo-waterspout deposit. This adds an interesting wrinkle to the palaeotsunami-palaeostorm deposit debate, but also reveals the value of a palaeotsunami database. There are probably similar anomalies (and errors) in the database, but without the context of related data it is unlikely that they would be exposed to such scrutiny.",

The minimum magnitude of the used events was 3.4, which was determined from the magnitude–frequency relationship.\nWe computed the tidal sensitivity and phase lag between the occurrence of VLFEs and the ocean tide for each point along the RT. We then predicted the fault normal stress (FNS) and updip shear stress (UDSS) on the plate interface and compared them with the excess value (Nex) of the VLFEs. The stress components at a depth of 15 km were predicted using Earth tide strain [Matsumoto et al., 2001] and ocean tide [Matsumoto et al., 2000].\nThe distribution of tidal sensitivity shows that the sensitivity and phase change gradually from northeast to southwest along the RT. High sensitivity (0.20–0.42) is evident at central RT, but the sensitivity is < 0.2 at southwestern RT. The Nex in the FNS ranges 0.22–0.28 at central RT and 0.04–0.11 at southwestern RT. The Nex in the UDSS ranges 0.17–0.22 at central RT and 0.04–0.11 at southwestern RT.\nThe comparison of Nex with stress components shows that the VLFEs are activated by the thrust-encouraging shear stress or maximum extensional normal stress of the ocean tide corresponding to the low-tide period. The tidal sensitivity is highest in the central portion of the RT, where the thin sediment layer is subducting, whereas it is lowest in the southwestern portion of the RT, where a thick sediment layer exists and an accretionary prism is developed. Differences in the sediment–rock properties of the overriding plate, which cause lateral heterogeneity in the extremely high pore-fluid pressure in the plate interface, would control the sensitivity of the VLFEs to ocean tides.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU2015_Poster_MaxSize_s.pdf\nUnderstanding subsurface gas/fluid behavior is significant for revealing hydrocarbon pathways or for discussions on global carbon cycle. Conventional hydrocarbon indicators in seismic profiles are in practice useful for detection of gas hydrates or gas in shallow sedimentary sequences. We herein study uniquely distinct seismic reflectors imaged in 3D seismic data acquired in the eastern Nankai Trough. The reflectors termed here as Foldback reflectors (FBRs), which occur along the edge of BSR and have accordion shaped characteristics. The FBRs resemble but differ from vertically stacked stratigraphic traps, in terms of that all the reflectors cut the formational sequences. FBRs are distributed in thick, well-stratified and less deformed sediments of the north-western slope of the uplifted outer ridge. Two-dimensional thermal structure taking into account topographic effects on the seafloor in our model undoubtedly shows that FBRs are developed well below depths of the base of gas hydrate stability (BGHS), even with changing hydrocarbon proportion including methane and ethane. P-wave velocity strongly suggests that the FBRs serve as a boundary of gas distribution below the BGHS. The polarity reversed at the edge of each FBR is consistent with a velocity model. Relatively fast regional uplift possibly produces the trapped free gas in pore spaces that is related to dissociation of gas hydrates. Morphology of FBRs is controlled by lithology and structure of their surrounding formation. The edge of FBRs might be corresponded to the boundary of the sandy/muddy seismic unit that is inferred from an instantaneous amplitude attribute analysis. Previously reported distribution of gas hydrates in this region can be well-constrained by lithology which is consistent with the seismic unit defined in this study. FBRs strike almost in the same direction with hosting formation, and they are always developed in downdip of the formation below BSRs. It is thus inferred that the regional uplift and the layer-parallel fluid migration play important roles in forming FBRs. Therefore, FBRs are regarded as an important proxy for gas distribution and fluid migration in the gas hydrate bearing areas.\n [K1]“formational sequences”?",

            "abstract": "Photosymbiosis is a mutualistic relationship that many corals have developed with dinoflagellates called zooxanthellae. The dinoflagellates, of the genus Symbiodinium, photosynthesize and provide corals with most of their energy, while in turn coral hosts live in waters where zooxanthellae have optimal exposure to sunlight. Thanks to this relationship, symbiotic corals calcify faster than non-symbiotic corals. Photosymbiosis is therefore considered the evolutionary innovation that allowed corals to become major reef-builders through geological time.This relationship is extremely difficult to study. Zooxanthellae, which are housed in the coral tissue, are not preserved in fossil coral skeletons, thus determining whether corals had symbionts requires a robust proxy.\nIn order to address this critical question, the goal of this research is to test new proxies for ancient photosymbiosis. Currently the project is focused on assessing the nitrogen (δ15N) isotopes of corals' organic matrices, sensu Muscatine et al. (2005), as well as carbon and oxygen (δ13C, δ18O) isotopes of fossil coral skeletons. Samples from Modern, Pleistocene, Oligocene and Triassic coral skeletons were analyzed to test the validity of these proxies. Coral samples comprise both (interpreted) symbiotic and non-symbiotic fossil corals from the Oligocene and Triassic as well as symbiotic fossil corals from the Modern and Pleistocene to corroborate our findings with the results of Muscatine et al. (2005). Samples were tested for diagenesis through petrographic and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analyses to avoid contamination. Additionally, a novel technique that has not yet been applied to the fossil record was tested. The technique aims to recognize dinosterol, a dinoflagellate biomarker, in both modern and fossil coral samples. The premise of this proxy is that symbiotic corals should contain the dinoflagellate biomarker, whereas those lacking symbionts should lack dinosterol. Results from this research will ideally lead to the development of a definitive, quantitative test for whether fossil corals had symbionts.",

Lack of field observation data is a strong limitation to investigate soil erosion and sediment transport. The aim of this study is to assess the spatial and temporal variations of sediment fluxes in the midstream of the Brahmaputra River based on intermittent discharge and suspended sediment datasets obtained in 2007-2009 at the Lazi, Nugesha, and Yangcun hydrological stations and to develop an empirical sediment transport model using a sediment rating curve (SRC) approach, by interpolating the points on the graph of discharge (Q) vs sediment concentration (C). SRC coefficients correlating with catchment area and other catchment characteristics vary spatially and temporally. Based on the seasonal variability of the SRC coefficients, we assume that larger flow peaks mobilize source sediments not previously activated. As a result, sets of SRC coefficients were obtained for different time periods throughout the year separated by flow peak ranking, which were further used to predict the suspended sediment concentrations/loads based on discharge with improved accuracy compared to the traditional SRC approach.",

These interactions couple electrodynamic processes of the ionosphere with hydrodynamic processes of the more abundant thermospheric neutral gas. This produces a complex spatial and temporal interplay of competing processes that results in a myriad of physical and chemical responses and a rich array of neutral and plasma morphologies that constitute the high-latitude thermosphere and ionosphere. A grand challenge in the study of this space - atmosphere interaction region is how the collision-dominated thermosphere / ionosphere (I/T) system exchanges energy, mass and momentum. This talk will focus on collision-dominated processes of the high-latitude I/T system and the altitude-dependent energy and momentum transfer processes that lead to frictional heating of ions and neutrals, ion and neutral drag forces, and plasma instability that results in extreme electron heating. Observations of the ionosphere response to these processes will be illustrated using incoherent scatter radar measurements.",

            "abstract": "Urbanization is occurring at an unprecedented rate across the globe. The resulting urban heat island (UHI), which is a well-known phenomenon in urban areas due to the increasing number and density of buildings, leads to higher temperature in urban areas than surrounding sub-urban or rural areas. Understanding the effects of landscape pattern on UHI is crucial for improving the sustainability of cities and reducing heat vulnerability. Although a variety of studies have quantified UHI, there are a lack of studies to 1) understand UHI variation at the micro-scale (e.g., neighborhood effect) for large urban areas and 2) identify variation in the sensitivity of the UHI to environmental drivers across a megacity with a pronounced climate zone (i.e. coastal to desert climates) using advanced analytical tools. In this study, we identified the interacting relationship among various environmental and socio-economic factors to better identify UHI over the Los Angeles, CA metropolitan area. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to quantify the interacting relationships among land surface temperature (LST), land cover (NDVI), distance to ocean, elevation, and socio-economic status (neighborhood income). LST-NDVI slopes were negative across the climate zones and became progressively stronger with increasing distance from the coast. Results also showed that slopes between NDVI and neighborhood income were positive throughout the climate zone with a maximum in the relationship occurring near 25km from the coast. Because of these income-NDVI and NDVI-LST relationships we also found that slopes between LST and neighborhood income were negative throughout the climate zones and peaked at about 30km from the coast. These findings suggest assessments of urban heat vulnerability need to consider not only variation in the indicators but also variation in how the indicators influence vulnerability.",

            "abstract": "GNSS have been widely used for ionospheric monitoring. We anticipate over 160 GNSS satellites broadcasting 400 signals by 2023, nearly double the number today. With their well-defined signal structures, high spatial density and spectral diversity, GNSS offers low cost and distributed passive sensing of ionosphere effects.\nThere are, however, many challenges to utilize GNSS resources to characterize and forecast ionospheric scintillation. Originally intended for navigation purposes, GNSS receivers are designed to filter out nuisance effects due to ionosphere effects. GNSS measurements are plagued with errors from multipath, oscillator jitters, processing artifacts, and neutral atmosphere effects. Strong scintillation events are often characterized by turbulent structures in ionosphere, causing simultaneous deep amplitude fading and abrupt carrier phase changes. The combined weak signal and high carrier dynamics imposes conflicting requirements for GNSS receiver design. Therefore, GNSS receivers often experience cycle slips and loss of lock of signals during strong scintillation events. High quality, raw GNSS signals bearing space weather signatures and robust receiver algorithms designed to capture these signatures are needed in order for GNSS to be a reliable and useful agent for scintillation monitoring and forecasting.\nOur event-driven, reconfigurable data collection system is designed to achieve this purpose. To date, our global network has collected ~150TB of raw GNSS data during space weather events. A suite of novel receiver processing algorithms has been developed by exploitating GNSS spatial, frequency, temporal, and constellation diversity to process signals experiencing challenging scintillation impact. The algorithms and data have advanced our understanding of scintillation impact on GNSS, lead to more robust receiver technologies, and enabled high spatial and temporal resolution depiction of ionosphere responses to solar and geomagnetic conditions.\nThis presentation will summarize progress and current state of the event-driven multi-GNSS data collection systems, GNSS receiver architectures designed to capture and preserve scintillation features, and scintillation effects observations derived from this unique set of data and processing algorithms.",

            "abstract": "Cirrus clouds play an important role in regulating the Earth's radiative budget and water vapor distribution in the upper troposphere. Aerosols can act as solution droplets or ice nuclei that promote ice nucleation in cirrus clouds. Anthropogenic emissions from fossil fuel and biomass burning activities have substantially perturbed and enhanced concentrations of aerosol particles in the atmosphere. Global aerosol-climate models (GCMs) have now been used to quantify the radiative forcing and effects of aerosols on cirrus clouds (IPCC AR5). However, the estimate uncertainty is very large due to the different representation of ice cloud formation and evolution processes in GCMs. In addition, large discrepancies have been found between model simulations in terms of the spatial distribution of ice-nucleating aerosols, relative humidity, and temperature fluctuations, which contribute to different estimates of the aerosol indirect effect through cirrus clouds.\nIn this presentation, four GCMs with the start-of-the art representations of cloud microphysics and aerosol-cloud interactions are used to estimate the aerosol indirect effects on cirrus clouds and to identify the causes of the discrepancies. The estimated global and annual mean anthropogenic aerosol indirect effect through cirrus clouds ranges from 0.1 W m-2 to 0.3 W m-2 in terms of the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) net radiation flux, and 0.5-0.6 W m-2 for the TOA longwave flux. Despite the good agreement on global mean, large discrepancies are found at the regional scale. The physics behind the aerosol indirect effect is dramatically different. Our analysis suggests that burden of ice-nucleating aerosols in the upper troposphere, ice nucleation frequency, and relative role of ice formation processes (i.e., homogeneous versus heterogeneous nucleation) play key roles in determining the characteristics of the simulated aerosol indirect effects.\nIn addition to the indirect effect estimate, we also use field campaign measurements and satellite retrievals to evaluate the simulated micro- and macro- physical properties of ice clouds in the four GCMs.",

            "abstract": "Optimal long-term planning plays an important role in many water infrastructure problems. However, this task is complicated by deep uncertainty about future conditions, such as the impact of population dynamics and climate change. One way to deal with this uncertainty is by means of robustness, which aims to ensure that water infrastructure performs adequately under a range of plausible future conditions. However, as robustness calculations require computationally expensive system models to be run for a large number of scenarios, it is generally computationally intractable to include robustness as an objective in the development of optimal long-term infrastructure plans. In order to overcome this shortcoming, an approach is developed that uses metamodels instead of computationally expensive simulation models in robustness calculations. The approach is demonstrated for the optimal sequencing of water supply augmentation options for the southern portion of the water supply for Adelaide, South Australia. A 100-year planning horizon is subdivided into ten equal decision stages for the purpose of sequencing various water supply augmentation options, including desalination, stormwater harvesting and household rainwater tanks. The objectives include the minimization of average present value of supply augmentation costs, the minimization of average present value of greenhouse gas emissions and the maximization of supply robustness. The uncertain variables are rainfall, per capita water consumption and population. Decision variables are the implementation stages of the different water supply augmentation options. Artificial neural networks are used as metamodels to enable all objectives to be calculated in a computationally efficient manner at each of the decision stages. The results illustrate the importance of identifying optimal staged solutions to ensure robustness and sustainability of water supply into an uncertain long-term future.",

            "abstract": "I review multi-scale multi-signal seismological results on structural properties within and around the San Jacinto Fault Zone (SJFZ). The results are based on data of the regional southern California and ANZA networks, additional near-fault seismometers and linear arrays with instrument spacing 25-50 m that cross the SJFZ at several locations, and a spatially-dense rectangular array with 1108 vertical-component sensors separated by 10-30 m centered on the fault. The studies utilize earthquake data to derive Vp and Vs velocity models with horizontal resolution of 1-2 km over the depth section 2-15 km, ambient noise with frequencies up to 1 Hz to image with similar horizontal resolution the depth section 0.5-7 km, and high-frequency seismic noise from the linear and rectangular arrays for high-resolution imaging of the top 0.5 km. Pronounced damage regions with low seismic velocities and anomalous Vp/Vs ratios are observed around the SJFZ, as well as the San Andreas and Elsinore faults. The damage zones follow generally a flower-shape with depth. The section of the SJFZ from Cajon pass to the San Jacinto basin has a faster SW side, while the section farther to the SE has an opposite velocity contrast with faster NE side. The damage zones and velocity contrasts produce at various locations fault zone trapped and head waves that are utilized to obtain high-resolution information on inner fault zone components (bimaterial interfaces, trapping structures). Analyses of high-frequency noise recorded by the fault zone arrays reveal complex shallow material with very low seismic velocities and strong lateral and vertical variations.",

            "abstract": "Global temperature response to the eruptions of Mount Agung in 1963, El Chichón in 1982 and Mount Pinatubo in 1991 is investigated using nine reanalysis datasets (JRA-55, MERRA, ERA-Interim, NCEP-CFSR, JRA-25, ERA-40, NCEP-1, NCEP-2, and 20CR). Multiple linear regression is applied to the zonal and monthly mean time series of temperature for two periods, 1979–2009 (for eight reanalysis datasets) and 1958–2001 (for four reanalysis datasets), by considering explanatory factors of seasonal harmonics, linear trends, Quasi-Biennial Oscillation, solar cycle, and El Niño Southern Oscillation. The residuals are used to define the volcanic signals for the three eruptions separately. In response to the Mount Pinatubo eruption, most reanalysis datasets show strong warming signals (up to 2–3 K for one-year average) in the tropical lower stratosphere and weak cooling signals (down to −1 K) in the subtropical upper troposphere. For the El Chichón eruption, warming signals in the tropical lower stratosphere are somewhat smaller than those for the Mount Pinatubo eruption. The response to the Mount Agung eruption is asymmetric about the equator with strong warming in the Southern Hemisphere midlatitude upper troposphere to lower stratosphere. Comparison of the results from several different reanalysis datasets confirms the atmospheric temperature response to these major eruptions qualitatively, but also shows quantitative differences even among the most recent reanalysis datasets.",

Considerable uncertainty remains concerning trends of regional precipitation in response to global warming and their controlling mechanism(s). Here we use an inter-annual difference method to derive trends of regional precipitation from data of Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP) and Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) reanalysis in the near-global domain of 60°S–60°N during a major global warming period of 1979–2013. We find that trends of regional annual precipitation are primarily driven by changes in the top 30 % heavy precipitation which in turn are controlled by changes in precipitable water in response to global warming, i.e. by thermodynamic processes. Significant drying trends are found in most of the US and eastern Canada, the Middle East, and eastern South America, while significant increases in precipitation occur in northern Australia, southern Africa, western India and western China. In addition, as the climate warms there are extensive enhancements and expansions of the three major tropical precipitation centers, namely the Maritime Continent (MC), Central America, and tropical Africa, leading to a significant strengthening of the global hydrological cycle. However, there are significant discrepancies between observed trends derived from GPCP and those from a typical climate model (MPI ECHAM5) during the period 1979–2013, raising a serious concern regarding the capability of climate models in their projections of trends of regional precipitation in response to global warming.",

            "abstract": "Observations of Ceres with the Hubble Space Telescope revealed very subtle albedo variations across the surface of the dwarf planet, but also showed localized bright spots. Dawn Framing Camera (FC) approach images show that most bright spots are associated with recent impact craters. Bright spots in two large craters, Dantu and Occator, are associated with intermittent water vapor plumes detected by the Herschel Space telescope. FC images acquired during the Survey phase (410 m/pixel) show interesting morphology associated with these bright spots. The brightest spots on Occator’s floor are crossed by small fractures and surrounded by a unit of intermediate brightness. This unit could be melted material originating from the bright spots, as suggested by its flow-like morphology. A darker layer visible underneath covers most of the crater floor and displays lobate edges, suggesting it was melted in the past. All the observed geologic units may represent a sequence of different outflows emplaced on the crater floor, becoming less reflective as they age. On Dantu’s floor, large bright patches surrounding the central pit of the crater could represent recently emplaced melted material. Dantu might correspond to an older version of Occator with a central depression similar to the central pit of Occator and bright deposits that have darkened and blended with the background material. A network of long cracks on the floor suggests cooling of material that was either impact melt, or cryolava that erupted shortly after the impact. Among the possible explanations for these bright spots is excavation of subsurface materials by impacts, impact-generated hydrothermal activity, and cryovolcanic outflow triggered by the impact event. The bright material might also effuse from deeper under the surface; its ascent being made easier through preexisting fractures, either in the basement of Dantu and Occator (generated at the time of impact), and/or in potential pre-cratering fractures such as those oriented NW-SE around Occator. FC images from High-Altitude Orbit Mapping at 140 m/pixel will help describe in better detail the morphology of all these geologic features. In combination with the FC color images and geophysical modeling, these will enable us to find clues about the formation processes and evolution of the bright spots.",

            "abstract": "Northwest Germany is a typical low strain intraplate region with a low seismic activity. Nevertheless, 58 well documented earthquakes with magnitudes of 0.5 - 4.3 affected the area in the last 40 years. Most of the epicenters were located in the vicinity of active natural gas fields and some inside. Accordingly, the earthquakes were interpreted as a consequence of hydrocarbon recovery (e.g. Dahm et al. 2007, Bischoff et al. 2013) and classified as induced events in the bulletins of the Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR). The two major ones have magnitudes of 4.3 and 4.0. They are the strongest earthquakes ever recorded in Northern Germany. Consequently, these events raise the question whether the ongoing extraction itself can cause them or if other natural tectonic processes like glacial isostatic adjustment may considerably contribute to their initiation. Recent studies of Brandes et al. (2012) imply that lithospheric stress changes due to post glacial isostatic adjustment might be also a potential natural cause for earthquakes in Central Europe.\nIn order to better analyse the earthquakes and to test this latter hypothesis we performed a relocalization of the events with the NonLinLoc (Lomax et al. 2000) program package and two differently scaled 3D P-wave velocity models. Depending on the station coverage for a distinct event, either a fine gridded local model (88 x 73 x 15 km, WEG-model, made available by the industry) or a coarse regional model (1600 x 1600 x 45 km, data from CRUST1.0, Laske et al. 2013) and for some cases a combination of both models was used for the relocalization. The results confirm the trend of the older routine analysis: The majority of the events are located at the margins of the natural gas fields, some of them are now located closer to them. Focal depths mostly vary between 3.5 km and 10 km. However, for some of the events, especially for the older events with relatively bad station coverage, the error bars for the focal depth are large. To prevent uncertainties in focal depths and focal mechanisms we generate synthetic seismograms depending on the reflectivity method to get a more precise position of the hypocenters. For hypocenters deeper than 10 km we speculate that these events might be potential natural earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "A number of passive seismic methods have been developed over many decades. Still, imaging of aseismical zones of the subducting slabs is one of challenging themes in the geoscience community. Conventional seismological approaches, such as hypocentral mapping, receiver functions, and global tomography, have been providing useful imaging of the Nazca slab, which subducts under the South American plate; however, the aseismic zones remained unclear. Here, we propose to apply global-phase seismic interferometry (GloPSI) for the imaging of the aseismic zones of the Nazca slab beneath the Malargüe region (Mendoza, Argentina). GloPSI uses global phases (epicentral distances ≥ 120°) such as PKP, PKiKP, and PKIKP, recorded on the vertical component of the seismic sensors. These phases illuminate the lithosphere below the receivers with small angles of incidence, which illumination suffices for creating virtual sources that radiate primarily downwards. We then migrate the retrieved virtual responses to obtain a subsurface reflection image with high resolution (< 15 km in depth). We use data recorded in the Malargüe region using an exploration-type receiver array called MalARRgue. This array was recording continuously in 2012 for one year. In this presentation, we show the imaging results from the Moho down to the aseismic Nazca slab, including the upper mantle.",

            "abstract": "Future shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns, and changes in the behavior of snow and ice – and possibly the quasi-disappearance of glaciers – in many mountain regions will change the quantity, seasonality, and possibly also the quality of water originating in mountains and uplands. As a result, changing water availability will affect both upland and populated lowland areas. Economic sectors such as agriculture, tourism or hydropower may enter into rivalries if water is no longer available in sufficient quantities or at the right time of the year. The challenge is thus to estimate as accurately as possible future changes in order to prepare the way for appropriate adaptation strategies and improved water governance.\nThe European ACQWA project, coordinated by the author, aimed to assess the vulnerability of water resources in mountain regions such as the European Alps, the Central Chilean Andes, and the mountains of Central Asia (Kyrgyzstan) where declining snow and ice are likely to strongly affect hydrological regimes in a warmer climate. Based on RCM (Regional Climate Model) simulations, a suite of cryosphere, biosphere and economic models were then used to quantify the environmental, economic and social impacts of changing water resources in order to assess how robust current water governance strategies are and what adaptations may be needed to alleviate the most negative impacts of climate change on water resources and water use. Hydrological systems will respond in quantity and seasonality to changing precipitation patterns and to the timing of snow-melt in the studied mountain regions, with a greater risk of flooding during the spring and droughts in summer and fall. The direct and indirect impacts of a warming climate will affect key economic sectors such as tourism, hydropower, agriculture and the insurance industry that will be confronted to more frequent natural disasters.\nThe results from the ACQWA project suggest that there is a need for a more integrated and comprehensive approach to water use and management. In particular, beyond the conventional water basin management perspective, there is a need to consider other socio-economic factors and the manner in which water policies interact with, or are affected by, other policies at the local, national, and supra-national levels.",

            "abstract": "Environmental conditions within sensitive seafloor ecosystems such as cold-seep provinces or cold-water coral reef communities vary temporally and spatially over a wide range of scales. Some of these are regularly monitored via short periods of intense shipborne activity or low resolution, fixed location studies by benthic lander systems. Long term measurements of larger areas and volumes are ususally coupled to costly infrastructure investments such as cabled observatories.\nIn space exploration, a combination of fixed and mobile systems working together are commonly used, e.g. lander systems coupled to rovers, to tackle observational needs that are very similar to deep-sea data aquisition. The analogies between space and deep-sea research motivated the German Helmholtz Association to setup the joint research program ROBEX (Robotic Exploration under extreme conditions). The program objectives are to identify, develop and verify technological synergies between the robotic exploration of e.g. the moon and the deep-sea. Within ROBEX, the mobility of robots is a vital element for research missions due to valuable scientifice return potential from different sites as opposed to static landers.\nWithin this context, we developed a new mobile crawler system (VIATOR, latin for traveller) and a fixed lander component for energy and data transfer (MANSIO, latin for housing/shelter). This innovative MANSIO-VIATOR system has been developed during the past 2.5 years. The caterpillar driven component is developed to conduct high resolution opitcal mapping and repeated monitoring of physical and biogeochemical parameters along transects. The system operates fully autonomously including navigational components such as camera and laser scanners, as well as marker based near-field navigation used in space technology. This new concept of data aquisition by a submarine crawler in combination with a fixed lander further opens up marine exploration possibilities.",

Remote sensing offers a good option for creating glacier outlines over large areas, but manual correction is frequently necessary, especially in areas containing supraglacial debris. We show three different workflows for mapping clean ice and debris-covered ice within Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA). By working at the object level as opposed to the pixel level, OBIA facilitates using contextual, spatial and hierarchical information when assigning classes, and additionally permits the handling of multiple data sources.\nOur first example shows mapping debris-covered ice in the Manaslu Himalaya, Nepal. SAR Coherence data is used in combination with optical and topographic data to classify debris-covered ice, obtaining an accuracy of 91%.\nOur second example shows using a high-resolution LiDAR derived DEM over the Hohe Tauern National Park in Austria. Breaks in surface morphology are used in creating image objects; debris-covered ice is then classified using a combination of spectral, thermal and topographic properties.\nLastly, we show a completely automated workflow for mapping glacier ice in Norway. The NDSI and NIR/SWIR band ratio are used to map clean ice over the entire country but the thresholds are calculated automatically based on a histogram of each image subset. This means that in theory any Landsat scene can be inputted and the clean ice can be automatically extracted. Debris-covered ice can be included semi-automatically using contextual and morphological information.",

            "abstract": "The production, transport, deposition, and dissolution of carbonate profoundly implicate the global carbon cycle affect the inventory and distribution of dissolved organic carbon (DIC) and alkalinity (ALK), which drive atmospheric CO2 change on glacial-interglacial timescale. the process may provide significant clues for improved understanding of the mechanisms that control the global climate system. In this study, we calculate and analyze the foraminiferal dissolution index (FDX) and the fragmentation ratios of planktonic foraminifera over 60-25 ka based on samples from 17924 and ODP 1144 in the northeastern South China Sea (SCS) to reconstruct the deep water carbonate dissolution during Marine Isotope Stage 3 (MIS 3). Result shows that the dissolution of carbonate increases gradually at 17924 but keeps stable at ODP 1144. The changes of FDX coincidence with that of fragmentation ratios at 17924 and ODP 1144 suggest both indexes can be used as reliable dissolving proxies of planktonic foraminifera. Comparing FDX and fragmentation ratios at both sites, we find the FDX and fragmentation ratios at 17924 are higher than those at 1144, indicating that carbonate dissolution is intenser in 17924 core during MIS 3. The increasing total percentage of both N. dutertrei and G. bulloides during MIS 3 reveals the rising primary productivity that may lead to deep water [CO32-] decrease. The slow down of thermohaline circulation may increase deep water residence time and accelerate carbonate dissolution. In addition, the covering of ice caps, iron supply and increased surface-water stratification also contribute to atmosphere CO2 depletion and [CO32-] decrease in deep water. In the meanwhile, regression result from colder temperature increases the input of ALK and DIC to the deep ocean and deepens the carbonate saturation depth, which makes the deep water [CO32-] rise. In ODP Site 1144, the decrease in [CO32-] caused by more CO2 restored in deep water is equal to the increase in [CO32-] because of regression, so dissolution keeps steady. However, [CO32-] is probably more strongly controlled by regression, the decrease in [CO32-] result from more CO2 restored in deep water overwhelms the increase in [CO32-] due to regression at 17924, so more carbonate dissolved from MIS 3 to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM).",

We conclude that in many solar and planetary applications, where the superadiabaticity is expected to be vanishingly small, results obtained with the anelastic approximation are in fact more accurate than fully compressible computations, which typically fail to reach small\nϵ\nfor numerical reasons. On the other hand, if the astrophysical system studied contains\nϵ∼O(1)\nregions, such as the solar photosphere, fully compressible simulations have the advantage of capturing the full physics.

This earthquake can repeat with catastrophic consequences. The last large shock occurred in this area on 28 February 1969 (Ms=8.1) was recorded by analogical instruments which are completely saturated. The lack of large earthquakes recorded by BB instruments limit the possibilities of seismic hazard studies in this region. In order to solve this problem, we have generated synthetic seismograms at regional distances for recent and well studied earthquakes occurred in this region, such as the 2007 (Mw=5.9) or the 2009 (Mw=5.5) events. This allows testing the earth model used for synthetic data and to generate synthetic records at regional distances for larger earthquakes. We have generated synthetic PGA values for 1969 earthquake and check them with the PGA value observed at a site of Lisbon. From the PGV values and using the empirical relations developed by Carranza et al. (2013) we obtain the predicted instrumental intensity IMM using the Wald et al (1999) relations . Comparison of them with the observed intensities for the 1969 earthquake in the Iberian Peninsula allows to validate this relation for large earthquakes at the region.",

Climate change simulations project increased drought risk in southern Europe, and on the other hand decreased drought risk in the norther of the continent. Observed changes in water balance components and drought indicators do resemble the projected pattern. However, assessments of possible causes of the reported regional changes have yet been inconclusive. To resolve this, we first employ a data driven approach and estimate how the probability of exceptionally dry years is related to global warming. The results confirm that it is very likely that that drought risk in the Mediterranean has increased in response to global warming, whereas it is very likely that drought risk has decreased in Northern Europe. Subsequently we show that observed changes in drought risk can only be captured by climate models if anthropogenic radiative forcing is accounted for. The consistency of the observational estimates with model simulations suggests that it is very likely that past changes in drought risk are attributable to anthropogenic effects on the climate.",

            "abstract": "Seismic images of the upper mantle beneath mid-ocean ridges and rift zones typically show discontinuities in wave speed that are often attributed to the presence of partial melt. To understand how lithosphere and asthenosphere differ in temperature, composition and melt content, it is necessary to test plausible dynamic scenarios against a wide range of observables. Here we take a first step at comparing seismic constraints with the seismic structure predicted for (1) a simple oceanic lithosphere-asthenosphere system, formed by melt extraction and dehydration at the ridge and half-space cooling as the lithosphere away from it and (2) continental break-up where there is significant partial melting. We have developed a relatively simple 2-D geodynamic model of decompression melting during extension that incorporates melt retention and dehydration. This model can explain the seismic structure below the East Pacific Rise as imaged by surface and body waves, including a double low velocity zone, with triangular anomaly above 50-60 km depth due to dry melting and low velocity layer between 60 and ~200km depth mainly resulting from solid-state anelasticity in hydrated mantle. We only require a minor contribution below the ridge of deep hydrous melt. Below Afar, in the East African Rift, S receiver functions have found a discontinuity in shear wave speeds at ~75km depth, consistent with the depth of the onset of dry melting. Yet, from the same forward model, no aspect of the melt zone leads to sufficiently sharp impedance contrast in isotropic velocity to explain the receiver-function signals. This suggests that something else is required to explain the seismic observations. We speculate that this may be a change in seismic anisotropy caused by a change in melt segregation characteristics.",

The variation of GPS observed position time series are 2cm in the horizontal and 7cm in the vertical generated by the ocean tide loading effect and other error sources. With the power spectra analysis by the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the eigenvalues of the semidiurnal constituents and the diurnal constituents are obtained from the GPS estimates time series. The calculated frequencies are well agreements to the known within the error less than 1.5% for K1,Q1, O1, K2,S2, M2,N2, but P1 within 4.2%. The calculated amplitudes are also well consistent with the results from the global tide models FES2004,NAO.99 and GOT4.7. Their difference in the amplitude are mostly less than 5mm in the horizontal and the vertical direction, except K1 and M2. The maximum amplitude difference occurs in K1 and M2 up to 1.5cm in the vertical direction. In additional, two islands locate at the different transmission Channel, but they give the same calculated frequency in the horizontal and the vertical directional, respectively for 8 tidal constituents.

            "abstract": "We present detailed geologic evidence linking changes over time in Philippine Sea plate (PHS) motion and intracontinental deformation in central and southwest (SW) Japan during the Pliocene and after. In the early Pliocene, subduction of the PHS plate under SW Japan restarted in a northerly direction after period of deceleration or cessation. Later, motion changed to a more westerly direction. Corresponding geological changes found in the overriding plate include unconformities in the forearc basins, changes in slip sense on faults, depocenter migration, re-organization of drainage systems and volcanism. Quaternary intraplate deformation is prominent north of the Median Tectonic Line (MTL) inactive segment, above a shallow flat slab. In contrast, less Quaternary tectonic activity is found north of the MTL active segment which lies over a steadily-slipping portion of the subducting slab that behaves as a less-deformed rigid block. Depocenters and active thrusting have migrated north/northwestward over the past 5 My above the shallow flat slab segment of the PHS. We reconstructed the Plio-Pleistocene migration history using Neogene stratigraphy and shallow seismic reflection profiles. We see shallow PHS slab contact with the lower continental crust in our deep seismic reflection profiles, which may explain its enhanced downward drag of the overriding plate and synchronous strong compression in the crust. We find evidence of more westerly PHS plate subduction since the middle Pleistocene in (1) unconformities in the Kumano forearc basin deposits in SW Japan, (2) drastic stream captures in Shikoku, and (3) concordant changes in fault slip sense from thrust to dextral slip along the MTL. Oblique subduction could have induced stronger horizontal stress in the overriding plate above the shallow flat slab which could account for the increasing geologic slip rate observed on active structures. During four repetitions of megathrust earthquake sequences since the 17th century, ca. 65 % of all intraplate M>6.5 earthquakes have been concentrated in the area above the PHS flat slab. This also suggests that mechanical interaction between the slab and the overriding plate plays an important role in intraplate seismicity over shorter timescales as well.",

            "abstract": "The Zhongba terrane represents a special tectonic unit sitting between the northern and the southern ophiolitic sub-belt in the western segment of the Yarlung Zangbo Suture Zone (YZSZ), which separates the Indian and the Eurasian continental plates. The central-east section of the Zhongba terrane can be divided into fault-fold belt, fold belt and fault belt. The fault-fold belt, composed of northward-dipping thrust faults and asymmetric folds in the Carboniferous and late Devonian strata, mainly occurs at the northern margin of the Zhongba terrane. Four stages of deformation (D1-D4) can be recognized in this belt. Stage D1 is recorded by the rolling folds in the Devonian strata in which the residual S0 can be observed in asymmetric small folds. Quartz c-axis fabrics show that the dominant slip system of quartz is basal <a> under transpression and low temperature (~ 400℃). In the stage D2, many small folds with axial plane inclined at high angle to the north were formed. The highly inclined C foliation in mylonitic limestones suggests that this belt represents the strain concentration zone during the northward subduction of the Neo-Tethyan lithosphere beneath the Gangdese arc belt. Coaxial progressive deformation is demonstrated by strongly shortened layers and abundant cleavages that are parallel to the axial plane of pre-existing folds in the stage D3. Mylonitic foliation is replaced by the cleavages plane (S2) associated with southward thrusts. In the stage D4, some northward thrusts and relevant cleavage with medium angle replaced early folds. Zircon U–Pb ages found in nearby quartz diorites at Gangdese arc belt yielded 91.8 ± 1.3 Ma. Since these quartz diorites are compositionally similar to island-arc magma from active continental margins, we infer that the northward subduction of the north sub-belt of the YZSZ started in the upper Cretaceous. Muscovite separates from representative tectonites within the strain concentration zone and the southward thrust belts yielded 40Ar/39Ar age of 71.6 ±1.1 Ma and 56.5±2.5 Ma, respectively. The former represents the collisional time between the Zhongba terrane and the Gangdese arc, while the latter indicates the final closing time of the Neo-Tethys ocean.",

            "abstract": "Global terrestrial carbon cycle largely depends on a spatial pattern in land cover type, which is heterogeneously-distributed over regional and global scales. However, most studies, which aimed at the estimation of carbon exchanges between ecosystem and atmosphere, remained within several tens of kilometers grid spatial resolution, and the results have not been enough to understand the detailed pattern of carbon exchanges based on ecological community. Improving the sophistication of spatial resolution is obviously necessary to enhance the accuracy of carbon exchanges. Moreover, the improvement may contribute to global warming awareness, policy makers and other social activities. In this study, we show global terrestrial carbon exchanges (net ecosystem production, net primary production, and gross primary production) with 1km-grid resolution. As methodology for computing the exchanges, we 1) developed a global 1km-grid climate and satellite dataset based on the approach in Setoyama and Sasai (2013); 2) used the satellite-driven biosphere model (Biosphere model integrating Eco-physiological And Mechanistic approaches using Satellite data: BEAMS) (Sasai et al., 2005, 2007, 2011); 3) simulated the carbon exchanges by using the new dataset and BEAMS by the use of a supercomputer that includes 1280 CPU and 320 GPGPU cores (GOSAT RCF of NIES). As a result, we could develop a global uniform system for realistically estimating terrestrial carbon exchange, and evaluate net ecosystem production in each community level; leading to obtain highly detailed understanding of terrestrial carbon exchanges.",

            "abstract": "Present-day plate tectonics on Earth is characterized by asymmetric (one-sided) subduction, but how do we recognize the imprint of subduction in the geologic record? How do we weigh global (commonly younger) vs local (commonly older) datasets or distinguish initiation from episodic from continuous subduction? How reliable are data gaps? Characteristics of the Paleozoic record of subduction include calc-alkaline magmatism, blueschist/UHP metamorphism and collisional orogenesis, and ophiolites as representatives of former ocean lithosphere. Are these characteristic rocks preserved in Proterozoic, Archean and Hadean crust? Does a hotter mantle, higher heat production and weaker lithosphere modify or eliminate these features? What preceded subduction and how do we recognize that regime? Are rock associations or geochemical fingerprints reliable? Does reworking and overprinting modify geochemical fingerprints? Proposals for the start of plate tectonics have been based on: persistence of isotope anomalies/fractionated chemical domains in the mantle; changes in chemistry of magmatic rocks, rates of crustal growth vs reworking, and sites of growth; the metamorphic record, particularly the first appearance of contrasting thermal gradients or eclogite (including evidence from mineral inclusions in diamonds) or UHP metamorphic rocks; stabilization of cratonic lithosphere and formation of supercratons, and the beginning of the Proterozoic supercontinent cycle; the end of the flat Earth, emergence of continents, development of significant topography, changes in the style of orogeny and the rise in atmospheric oxygen; and, the appearance of passive margins and changes in the style of sedimentation. Estimates of the timing have varied from the Hadean to Neoproterozoic. I will summarize evidence for a growing consensus that the late Mesoarchean to early Paleoproterozoic was a 700 Myr long period of transition to continuous (?) subduction and global (?) mobile-lid plate tectonics.",

The project is based on a cross-OSSE approach which involves two independent air quality models. Each of the models generated the nature run for the other model, used subsequently in two linked OSSE studies. The models involved are MOCAGE, and the air quality model LOTOS-EUROS combined with the global TM5 chemistry-transport model. The work is based on state-of-the-art synthetic observations and their error characteristics derived by the KNMI and FMI teams involved in the TROPOMI retrieval algorithm development.

We invite brief (2 powerpoint slides) comments from the community about any aspect of the topic at hand. We encourage anyone who has something pertinent or interesting to say to submit 2 powerpoint slides directly to any one of the four co-convenors listed on this abstract. The first slide should be a simple title with the name and affiliation of the commenter. The second slide should be the content of the comment. The convenors will compile all of these that are submitted up to the noon on the day before the session occurs, when we will upload the compiled files in the order that they were received (if we have received digital scans of signed waivers by that time, see below). During the discussion, we will call on those who have submitted 2 slides to the podium to make their points in 2 minutes or less (total time from being called to leaving the podium). Because this AGU Union session including the discussion period will be live-streamed and recorded, all Discussion Session commenters will be required to sign an AGU waiver acknowledging this and giving permission to be recorded. These will be sent via e-mail to those who submit 2 slide powerpoints. Commenters that do not sign and return the waiver will be scheduled after all commenters who have returned signed waivers and AGU will terminate live streaming and recording accordingly. If no one submits anything then we will have open discussion from the floor. We will also advertise the Monte Verita conference in Locarno Switzerland 17-22 July 2016.

            "abstract": "The in situ dissociation of gas hydrate is prerequisite for the commercial recovery of natural gas from hydrate deposits. We examined different methods such as depressurization, thermal stimulation and distortion of the chemical equilibrium by carbon dioxide sequestration for methane gas production from hydrates within our Large Scale reservoir simulator LARS in a pilot plant scale.\nWithin this setup, thin-walled (0.8 mm) silicon tubes are utilized for in situ gas capture. They function as membranes for the extraction of methane gas, leaving sediment and brine behind. The gas capture via silicone tube membranes is, due to their robust nature, reliably applicable in remote and rough areas. First tests show that, driven by the transmembrane pressure difference, the methane flux through these membranes is about 1 mL per minute per cm² membrane surface at a reservoir pressure of about 20 MPa. This is in good agreement with values reported in the literature [e.g. 2]. The operation of the membranes as a simple capture tool for the released methane from a hydrate deposit is therefore considered as feasible.\nFurthermore, silicone tube membranes are suitable for the quantification of free and dissolved gas volumes. For the monitoring of spatial and temporal gas distribution, LARS has been equipped with several silicone membranes at various locations. They have been utilized to monitor the progress of hydrate formation and decomposition and show that inhomogeneous gas distributions within the reservoir are detectable and terminable. The quantification of carbon dioxide/methane gas ratios during exchange experiments, however, is due to differences in water solubility and permeation rates of the gas species challenging.\nThe study assesses the capability and limits of silicone tubes as membranes for gas extraction and as a tool to monitor gas distribution and composition in the course of hydrate dissociation experiments.\n[1] Merkel, T.C.; Bodnar, V.I.; Nagai, K.; Freeman, B.D.; Pinnau, I.

            "abstract": "Seismic derived acoustic impedance is an essential output for the quantitative interpretation of seismic data. However, the band limitation of seismic data leads to a nonunique estimate of the acoustic impedance profile. The prevalent methods counter the nonuniqueness either by stabilizing the answer with respect to an initial model or by resorting to an assumption of certain criterion such as sparsity of the reflection coefficients. Making a nominal assumption of a homogeneous layered earth model, we formulate a set of linear equations where the reflection coefficients are the unknowns and the recursively integrated seismic trace constitutes the data. The approach makes a frontal assault on the problem of reconstructing reflection coefficients from band-limited data and stems from first principles, i.e., Zöppritz’s equation in this case. Nonuniqueness is countered in part by the layercake assumption, and in part by the adoption of the singular value decomposition (SVD) method of finding an optimal solution to the set of linear equations, provided the objective is to reconstruct a smoothed version of the impedance profile that includes only its coarser structures. The efficacy of the method has been tested with synthetic data added with significant noise and generated from rudimentary earth models as well as from measured logs of acoustic impedance. Emergence of consistent estimates of impedance from synthetic data generated for several frequency bands increases the confidence in the method. The study also proves the successfulness of the method for (a) an accurate estimate of the impedance mean, (b) an accurate reconstruction of the direct-current (dc) frequency of the reflectivity, and (c) an acceptable reconstruction of the broad trend of the original impedance profile. All these outputs can serve as significant constraints for either more refined inversions or geological interpretations.\n(Keywords: Reflection data, Acoustic impedance, Broadband, Linear equations, Singular Value Decomposition, Inversion)",

            "abstract": "ePoster - IC-HT_AGU_2.pdf\nThe Holton-Tan (HT) effect describes the dependence of the northern stratospheric polar vortex on the equatorial quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) which is strongest in January (and reversed in February). During the easterly phase of the QBO the polar vortex is weaker and warmer while it is stronger and colder during the westerly phase. This weakening of the polar vortex changes the gravity wave filtering and refraction, leading to a reduction of the westward gravity wave drag in the mesosphere/ lower thermosphere (MLT). Consequently, the residual circulation from the summer to the winter pole weakens and the temperature in the southern mesopause region is expected to increase during the easterly phase of the QBO in January. Additionally, there is an influence of the solar cycle especially on the stratospheric circulation. This leads us to two questions: Is there an interhemispheric coupling induced by the HT effect and how is it influenced by the solar cycle?\nUsing 30 years of assimilated model data from the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model (CMAM) and, for comparison, 9 years of global satellite observations from the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), we investigate the average characteristics of the HT effect up to 120 km in January. The results show that the assumed interhemispheric coupling mechanism is confirmed for solar minimum and maximum conditions but, surprisingly, it seems reversed during solar transition periods. To prove the interhemispheric coupling mechanism, we also analyze simulations with the Kühlungsborn Mechanistic Circulation Model (KMCM) which includes a self-generated QBO.",

We are now leading the NSF-funded National Network for Ocean and Climate Change Interpretation (NNOCCI), partnering with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, FrameWorks Institute, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Monterey Bay Aquarium, and National Aquarium, with evaluation conducted by the New Knowledge Organization, Pennsylvania State University, and Ohio State University.\nNNOCCI enables teams of informal science interpreters across the country to serve as “communication strategists” – beyond merely conveying information they can influence public perceptions, given their high level of commitment, knowledge, public trust, social networks, and visitor contact. We provide in-depth training as well as an alumni network for ongoing learning, implementation support, leadership development, and coalition building. Our goals are to achieve a systemic national impact, embed our work within multiple ongoing regional and national climate change education networks, and leave an enduring legacy.\nWhat is the most useful theoretical model for conceptualizing the work of the NNOCCI community? This presentation will examine the pros and cons of three perspectives -- community of practice, collective impact, and social movements. The community of practice approach emphasizes use of common tools, support for practice, social learning, and organic development of leadership. A collective impact model focuses on defining common outcomes, aligning activities toward a common goal, structured collaboration. A social movement emphasizes building group identity and creating a sense of group efficacy.\nThis presentation will address how these models compare in terms of their utility in program planning and evaluation, their fit with the unique characteristics of the NNOCCI community, and their relevance to our program goals.",

The distinct εNd and REE signatures of the lithogenic components of margin sediments of the West Pacific allow characterization of trace element inputs to the Pacific Ocean. We present dissolved εNdand REE concentrations from twelve vertical profiles of a transect from South Korea to Fiji.\nNear South Korea, surface waters are marked by unradiogenic εNd (as low as -7.3), high REE concentrations (e.g., Nd = 15.3 pmol/kg) and low salinity. Towards the open ocean, these parameters gradually change towards typical Pacific open ocean values (εNd = -3.3, [Nd] = 5.55 pmol/kg). Subsurface waters show REE depletions, followed by the typical REE increase with increasing water depth. These distributions indicate trace element input near South Korea and enhanced subsurface scavenging, as indicated by strong heavy REE to light REE fractionation.\nIn the tropical West Pacific (10°N-15°S), high surface and subsurface water εNd values (+0.7) and positive Eu anomalies trace the influence of volcanic islands. Yet, absolute REE concentrations are extremely low at these depths (e.g., Nd = 2.77 pmol/kg). Using shale-normalized Nd/Er and Ho/Dy ratios, that show a much stronger surface to subsurface decrease in coastal waters compared to the open ocean, we suggest enhanced scavenging in this area. Eastward flowing intermediate waters (NPIW, AAIW) have εNd values up to +1.9 (NPIW) and +3.7 (AAIW) higher than those entering the tropical West Pacific from north and south, respectively. Modified εNd at intermediate depths and no change in REE patterns suggest that boundary exchange along volcanic island margins modifies the seawater εNd without changing the REE budget.",

The source appears to be a liquid reservoir rather than active heating, but the extent and location of any subsurface liquid region is not directly observable. We use measurements of control points across the surface of Enceladus from seven years of spacecraft observations to determine the satellite’s precise rotation state; we find a forced physical libration of 0.120 ± 0.014° (2σ). This value is too large to be consistent with Enceladus’s core being rigidly connected to its ice shell, and thus implies the presence of a global ocean rather than a solitary polar sea. Together with other constraints, our results imply that the global ocean is thin and connected to a thicker sea under the south polar terrain. We present models of the range of shell, ocean, and core sizes consistent with the libration and other geophysical data. The maintenance of a global ocean within Enceladus is problematic according to some thermal models and so may require particular satellite properties or a surprisingly dissipative Saturn.",

            "abstract": "Fluvial systems in large river basins experience temporal variations in flow discharge, which creates unsteady changes in the flow field and sediment fluxes. The sediment-water interface responds and organizes to these changes over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, primarily through adjustment of a variety of bed roughness elements. These roughness elements are the key component of overall flow resistance and the magnitude of their form drag significantly influences river stage levels for given discharge and determines the state and functioning of river systems and sediment fluxes.\nHere we present three dimensional numerically predicted flow results to demonstrate the importance of complex morphology on flow and sediment fluxes. Model boundary conditions and validation data were taken from two sources. Initially, they were collected from a field campaign on a 1.5 by 0.3 km stretch of the Mississippi near Alton, Illinois. Secondly, a series of flume experiments were undertaken that applied unsteady hydraulic conditions to generate a series of quasi-equilibrium three dimensional bed forms, which were scaled on the data collected in the field. The numerical flow results show that superimposed bed forms can cause changes in the nature of the classical separated flow region in particularly the number of locations where vortices are shed and the point of flow reattachment, which may be important for sediment flux dynamics during bed form adjustment.",

            "abstract": "Modern geodynamics and continental growth are critically driven by subduction and plate tectonics, however how this tectonic regime started and what geodynamic regime was before remains controversial. Most present-day subduction initiation mechanisms require acting plate forces and/or pre-existing zones of lithospheric weakness, which are themselves the consequence of plate tectonics. Here, we focus on plume-lithosphere interactions and spontaneous plume-induced subduction initiation, which does not require pre-existing lithospheric fabric and is viable for both stagnant lid and mobile/deformable lid conditions. We present results of 2D and 3D numerical modeling of plume-induced deformation and associated crustal growth resulting from tectono-magmatic interaction of ascending mantle plumes with oceanic-type lithosphere. We demonstrate that weakening of the lithosphere by plume-induced magmatism is the key factor allowing for its internal deformation and differentiation resulting in continental crust growth. We also show that plume-lithosphere interaction can enable subduction and rudimentary plate tectonics initiation at the margins of a crustal plateau growing above the plume head. We argue that frequent plume-arc interactions recorded in Archean crust could reflect either short-term plume-induced subduction or plume-induced episodic lithospheric drips. We furthermore suggest a distinct plume-tectonics regime operated on Earth before plate tectonics, which was associated with widespread tectono-magmatic heat and mass exchange between the crust and the mantle. This regime was characterized by weak deformable plates with low topography, massive juvenile crust production from mantle derived melts, mantle-flows-driven crustal deformation, magma-assisted crustal convection and widespread development of lithospheric delamination and crustal drips. Plume tectonics also resulted in growth of hot depleted chemically buoyant subcrustal proto-cratonic mantle layer. Later, this layer rapidly cooled by internal convection and consolidated to form long-living cratonic roots.",

However, warming rates are regionally different. In this presentation, we focus on the regions defined by the IPCC SREX report. We investigate the year in the future in which historically hottest summers are projected to become the norm, i.e. to occur at least every other year. Using results from a detection and attribution analysis, we provide probabilistic estimates based on RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 simulations constrained by observations during 1950-2012. We also estimate the fraction of attributable risk (FAR), i.e. the probability for hot summers that is attributable to past emissions of anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols. We find that the FAR is larger than 0.9 in many regions. We project that under RCP4.5, more than half of the world's population will experience the historically hottest summer of the past 63 years with a probability of 50% and 90% by 2035 and 2050, respectively. Under the higher emission scenario RCP8.5, historically hottest summers are projected to be more wide-spread. The Mediterranean region, Western and Eastern Asia, Northern Eurasia and the Sahara are among the first regions for which such hot summers might become the norm. Even under RCP4.5, more than 90% of summers are projected to be hotter than the historically hottest summers by 2025 and 2035 for Sahara and the Mediterranean regions, respectively.",

Spatial heterogeneity in the surface area can lead to complications in modelling reactive transport processes, but quantitative characterisation of this property has been limited. In this paper 3D images obtained using x-ray micro-tomography were used to characterise heterogeneity in surface area in one sandstone and five carbonate rocks. Measurements of average surface area from x-ray imagery were 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than measurements from nitrogen BET. A roughness factor, defined as the ratio of BET surface area to x-ray based surface area, was correlated to the presence of clay or microporosity. Coregistered images of Berea sandstone from x-ray and energy dispersive spectroscopy imagery were used to guide the identification of quartz, K-feldspar, dolomite, calcite and clays in x-ray images. In Berea sandstone, clay and K-feldspar had higher average surface area fractions than their volumetric fractions in the rock. In the Edwards carbonate, however, modal mineral composition correlated with surface area. By sub-sampling digital images, statistical distributions of the surface area were generated at various length scales of subsampling. Comparing these to distributions used in published modelling studies showed that the common practice of leaving surface area and pore volume uncorrelated in a pore leads to unrealistic combinations of surface area and pore volume in the models. We suggest these models adopt a moderate correlation based on observations. In Berea sandstone, constraining ratios of surface area to pore volume to a range of values between that of quartz-lined and five times that of clay-lined spheres appeared sufficient.",

Such approaches offer a practice- and policy-oriented knowledge to mitigate or to prevent potential disasters. A baseline assessment of disaster risks is needed to produce a clear and unambiguous scientific view on the current state of knowledge in disaster risk, the potential socio-economic impacts of natural hazards, and the ways to reduce significant human and economic losses. Such assessments would provide the catalyst for the advancement of not only the science but policy.

We focus our investigation on the effect of enhanced stellar wind and enhanced EUV flux as the planetary distance from the star decreases. Our simulations reveal different topologies of the planetary space environment for sub- and super-Alfvénic stellar wind conditions, which could lead to dynamic energy deposition into the atmosphere during the transition along the planetary orbit. We find that the stellar wind penetration for non-magnetized planets is very deep, up to a few hundreds of kilometers. We estimate a lower limit for the atmospheric mass-loss rate and find that it is insignificant over the lifetime of the planet. However, we predict that when accounting for atmospheric ion acceleration, a significant amount of the planetary atmosphere could be eroded over the course of a billion years.",

            "abstract": "Natural single crystals of quartz have been experimentally deformed in two orientations: (1) normal to one prism-plane, (2) In O+ orientation at temperatures of 900 and 1000°C, pressures of 1.0 and 1.5 GPa, and strain rates of ~1 x 10-6s-1. The starting material is milky quartz, consisting of dry quartz (H2O contents of <150 H/106Si) with fluid inclusions (FI). During pressurization many FI´s decrepitate. Cracks heal and small neonate FI´s form, increasing the number of FI´s drastically. During subsequent deformation, the size of FI´s is further reduced (down to ~10 nm). Sample deformation occurs by dominant dislocation glide on selected slip systems, accompanied by some dynamic recovery. Strongly deformed regions show FTIR spectra with a pointed broad absorption band in the ~3400 cm-1 region as a superposition of molecular H2O bands and three discrete absorption bands (at 3367, 3400, and 3434 cm-1). In addition, there is a discrete absorption band at 3585 cm-1, which only occurs in deformed regions. The 3585 cm-1 band is reduced or even disappears after annealing. This band is polarized and represents structurally bound H, its H-content is estimated to be 1-3% of the total H2O-content and appears to be associated with dislocations. The H2O weakening effect in our FI-bearing natural quartz crystals is assigned to the processes of dislocation generation and multiplication at small FI´s. The deformation processes in these crystals represent a recycling of H2O between FI´s, dislocation generation at very small fluid inclusions, incorporation of structurally bound H into dislocation cores, and release of H2O from dislocations back into FI´s during recovery. Cracking and crack healing play an important role in the recycling process and imply a close interrelationship between brittle and crystal plastic deformation. The H2O weakening by this process is of a disequilibrium nature and thus depends on the amount of H2O available.",

Continuous waveforms with signals generated by the ambient seismic noise, earthquakes, and Betsy gunshots were recorded with useable frequencies up to 200 Hz. Imaging the shallow structure is done with surface and body waves extracted from the ambient noise, arrivals from local and teleseismic earthquakes, and waves generated by the gunshots. The results reveal shallow material with very low seismic velocities and attenuation coefficients, strong lateral and vertical variations, seismic trapping structure, local sedimentary basin, and overall lithology contrast across the fault. The detection/location techniques include stacking, beamforming, matched field processing, and templates generated by these methods. The analysis uncovers many hundred of daily earthquakes not detected by the regional networks and several different types of surface noise sources.",

These analyses can be considered to be data-driven wavefield modeling. Studies of ambient-field tomography have been mostly focused on the surface waves, especially fundamental-mode Rayleigh waves. Although the surface-wave tomography is useful to model 3D velocities, the spatial resolution is limited due to the extended depth sensitivity of the surface wave measurements. Moreover, to represent elastic media, we need at least two stiffness parameters (e.g., shear and bulk moduli). We develop a technique to retrieve P diving waves from the ambient field observed by the dense geophone network (~2500 receivers with 100-m spacing) at Long Beach, California. With two-step filtering, we improve the signal-to-noise ratio of body waves to extract P wave observations that we use for tomography to estimate 3D P-wave velocity structure. The small scale-length heterogeneity of the velocity model follows a power law with ellipsoidal anisotropy. We also discuss possibilities to retrieve reflected waves from the ambient field and show other applications of the body-wave extraction at different locations and scales. Note that reflected waves penetrate deeper than diving waves and have the potential to provide much higher spatial resolution.",

The technique typically produces – at best – results some weeks after a volcanic eruption has commenced.\nThis contribution describes progress made on a user-friendly, easy-to-use petrological ‘tool’ that can be deployed in near-real time at the onset of and during an eruption. This is important for fast timescale retrieval (within days rather than weeks) without compromising the reliability of the timescale retrieved. This has implications for eruption monitoring and hazard mitigation, providing a petrological time-series complementing existing geophysical monitoring techniques.\nCurrent methods are constrained by data processing rates and the geometrical corrections required to control for random sectioning, crystal shape uncertainties and mineral anisotropy.\nUsing a set of Piton de la Fournaise (Réunion Island) lava flow samples and a suite of Mauna Loa (HI, US) air fall and lava flow samples, magmatic timescales for Mg-Fe diffusion in olivine have been retrieved.\nPiton has a monodisperse crystal population, making a near-perfect baseline from which to pick apart the current diffusion modelling method. In so doing, a greater understanding of the sources of scatter and uncertainty in the process of timescale retrieval was obtained. The variety of potential sectioning orientations and their interaction with diffusion processes led to the proposal by Shea et al, 2015, in press, of selection rules to select boundaries, based on numerical models.\nCombined with evaluations of crystal shape, crystal axial ratios, interfacial angles, U-stage measurements and a statistical approach, such selection rules should allow the orientation of the grain within a sample to be inferred, negating the need for independent EBSD measurements and enabling a faster processing technique.",

In order to fill this gap and to constrain the post-Devonian erosion and exhumation history of this region, we present the results of apatite fission track (AFT) dating of eleven samples selected from the cores taken from different depths of the northern part of the Khibina intrusive massif. This alkaline magmatic complex is located at the center of Kola Peninsula and formed at about 370 Ma (Kramm and Kogarko, 1994). Samples were analyzed from depths between +520 to -950 meters and yielded AFT ages between 290-268 Ma with an average age uncertainty (1σ) of ±30 Ma. Mean track lengths (MTL) lie between 12.5-14.4 μm. We used the most reliable AFT ages and distribution of MTL in two samples, corresponding to depths of +280 and -920 m, to conduct inverse time-temperature modelling of the Khibina massif. Thermal histories that best predict the measured data show three stages: (1) 290-250 Ma – rapid cooling from >110°C to 70°C/50°C for lower/upper sample correspondingly; (2) 250-50 Ma – a stable temperature stage; (3) 50-0 Ma – slightly increased cooling rates down to modern temperatures. We propose that the first cooling stage is related to late-Hercynian orogenesis; the second cooling stage may be associated with tectonics accompanying with opening of Arctic oceanic basin. The obtained data show that geothermal gradient at the center of Kola Peninsula has remained close to the modern value of 20°C/km for at least the last 250 Myr. AFT data show that the Khibina massif has been exhumed not more then 5-6 km in the last 290 Myr.\nThis study was funded by grants 15-35-20599, 15-05-02116, 15-05-01860 and 13-05-01033 from the Russian Foundation of Basic Research, grant 3.38.224.2015 from the St. Petersburg State University, grant 14.Z50.31.0017 from the Government of the Russian Federation.",

Models describing these fluxes implicitly propose hypotheses about the CZ which are encoded in the structure of the models. However, the certainty with which such hypotheses can be tested with observed hydrologic data is challenged by the well-known problem of equifinality – the tendency of multiple models, with very different model structures, to produce equally good representations of observed hydrologic dynamics. The project of modeling the CZ is thus challenged by the need to identify hydrologic signatures that are closely tied to the CZ structure and which could provide a stronger basis for hypothesis testing in model frameworks. Here I present one potential signature based on streamflow recession dynamics and the structure of their variability. Firstly, I present a technique to remove a mathematical artifact that is inherent in power-law representations of streamflow recessions. Secondly, I show that having removed this artifact, intriguing relationships emerge in the recession variability in the rivers near the Eel River Critical Zone Observatory. This relationship is interpreted in terms of how water is partitioned within the CZ. The close relationship between CZ processes and this part of the hydrologic response suggests that co-variation in recession parameters could provide a process-oriented hydrologic signature that CZ models should attempt to emulate.",

The environmental processes of saturation and evaporation control local concentrations of contaminants in pore water of porous media. Specifically, the rate of evaporation can affect the identity and extent of solid formation of a pharmaceutical compound. A range of experiments with different evaporation rates were conducted on sand columns saturated with a solution of ciprofloxacin, a fluoroquinolone antibiotic. Experiments were designed to simulate increased and decreased pore-water concentrations of a compound due to evaporation and resaturation, respectively. Results suggest that varied rates of evaporation cause differences in compound adsorption behavior.

            "abstract": "Numerical model representations of decadal- to centennial-scale soil-carbon dynamics are a dominant cause of uncertainty in climate change predictions. Recent attempts by some Earth System Model (ESM) teams to integrate previously unrepresented soil processes (e.g., explicit microbial processes, abiotic interactions with mineral surfaces, vertical transport), poor performance of many ESM land models against large-scale and experimental manipulation observations, and complexities associated with spatial heterogeneity highlight the nascent nature of our community’s ability to accurately predict future soil carbon dynamics.\nI will present recent work from our group to develop a modeling framework to integrate pore-, column-, watershed-, and global-scale soil process representations into an ESM (ACME), and apply the International Land Model Benchmarking (ILAMB) package for evaluation. At the column scale and across a wide range of sites, observed depth-resolved carbon stocks and their 14C derived turnover times can be explained by a model with explicit representation of two microbial populations, a simple representation of mineralogy, and vertical transport. Integrating soil and plant dynamics requires a ‘process-scaling’ approach, since all aspects of the multi-nutrient system cannot be explicitly resolved at ESM scales. I will show that one approach, the Equilibrium Chemistry Approximation, improves predictions of forest nitrogen and phosphorus experimental manipulations and leads to very different global soil carbon predictions. Translating model representations from the site- to ESM-scale requires a spatial scaling approach that either explicitly resolves the relevant processes, or more practically, accounts for fine-resolution dynamics at coarser scales. To that end, I will present recent watershed-scale modeling work that applies reduced order model methods to accurately scale fine-resolution soil carbon dynamics to coarse-resolution simulations. Finally, we contend that creating believable soil carbon predictions requires a robust, transparent, and community-available benchmarking framework. I will present an ILAMB evaluation of several of the above-mentioned approaches in ACME, and attempt to motivate community adoption of this evaluation approach.",

            "abstract": "Sediment supply dynamics affect fluvial erosion in steep landscapes. Workers have explored the effects of changing sediment flux and uniform grain size on incision processes and distribution of alluvial cover. However, sediment supplied to real rivers is often highly heterogeneous in size, especially in rapidly eroding landscapes where supply processes may range from landslides to rockfall to moraine incision. We hypothesize that the pace of landscape evolution depends on the sediment size distribution supplied to rapidly eroding channels. Rivers that quickly cut steep-walled canyons may incite a negative feedback on incision by receiving an increased supply of large, immobile blocks from the canyon walls that shield significant portions of the bed from erosion. We use a 1-D numerical model that combines mass-flux continuum treatment of several grain size classes with tracking of discrete large blocks to explore fluvial response to changing grain size distribution. We compare simulations with and without a feedback between channel incision rate and the supply rate of large blocks from adjacent hillslopes. This reflects the hypothesis that slopes will be steeper and more prone to releasing large blocks when the channel at their base is eroding rapidly. Comparing model predictions with field observations shows that our models can successfully reproduce the distribution of blocks in natural channels. Results suggest that in landscapes with access to large blocks, fluvial incision may be slowed as increasing amounts of immobile material are supplied from adjacent hillslopes and canyon walls. This can act to stall knickpoint retreat in such rivers and slow the pace of landscape adjustment. The importance of channel armoring by blocks is governed by competition between two timescales: the time required for significant block cover to accumulate in the channel and the time required for blocks to abrade, fragment, or weather down to transportable sizes. Model results also show the existence of a critical fraction of bed cover by large blocks at which incision is slowed such that few new blocks are added; this condition remains until block erosion and weathering expose additional bedrock. Our results point to the need for studies of the timing and magnitude of block supply as well as processes and timescales of block degradation.",

            "abstract": "The first lightning observations from space date from the early 1960s and more than a dozen spacecraft orbiting the Earth have flown instruments that recorded lightning signals from thunderstorms over the past 45 years. In this respect, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS), having just completed its mission (1997-2015), provides the longest and best total (intracloud and cloud-to-ground) lightning data base over the tropics.\nWe present a 16 year (1998-2013) reprocessed data set to create very high resolution (0.1°) TRMM LIS total lightning climatology. This detailed very high resolution climatology is used to identify the Earth’s lightning hotspots and other regional features. Earlier studies located the lightning hotspot within the Congo Basin in Africa, but our very high resolution lightning climatology found that the highest lightning flash rate on Earth actually occurs in Venezuela over Lake Maracaibo, with a distinct maximum during the night. The higher resolution dataset clearly shows that similar phenomenon also occurs over other inland lakes with similar conditions, i.e., locally forced convergent flow over a warm lake surface which drives deep nocturnal convection. Although Africa does not have the top lightning hotspot, it comes in a close second and it is the continent with the highest number of lightning hotspots, followed by Asia, South America, North America, and Oceania. We also present climatological maps for local hour and month of lightning maxima, along with a ranking of the highest five hundred lightning maxima, focusing discussion on each continent’s 10 highest lightning maxima. Most of the highest continental maxima are located near major mountain ranges, revealing the importance of local topography in thunderstorm development.\nThese results are especially relevant in anticipation of the upcoming availability of continuous total lightning observations from the Geostationary Lightning Mapping (GLM) aboard GOES-R. This study provides context to forecasters as to total lightning activity and locations within GLM field of view as well as around the world.",

            "abstract": "Based on satellite data, total (intracloud and cloud-to-ground) lightning activity climatological annual cycle over the GoAmazon area of interest (from T0 to T3 sites) shows that lightning activity is moderate (up to 10 flashes per day – fl day-1) throughout the wet (December-March) and dry (April-August) seasons, with T3 always being a little greater than T1 and T0 sites, respectively. During the dry-to-wet transition season (September-October), however, lightning activity peaks up to 25 fl day-1 at T1, followed by T3 (20 fl day-1) and T0 (15 fl day-1). The diurnal cycle reveals that the onset of deep convection during this same season starts one hour and peaks two hours earlier than the wet season. In the Amazon, cloud updrafts are primarily controlled by the local environment thermodynamics. During the dry-to-wet transition season, thermodynamics is significantly changed by land cover land cover where cloud base heights are elevated over deforested areas potentially increasing the strength of updrafts due to a better processing of the convective available potential energy, and therefore also increasing cloud electrification. The total (intracloud and cloud-to-ground) LIghtning NET(LINET - Nowcast) installed in September-October 2014 for GoAmazon IOP2 and ACRIDICON-CHUVA field experiments and the set of weather radars revealed that the thunderstorm enhancement over T1 (Manaus) during the dry-to-wet season is driven by the interaction between river breeze and the main easterly winds over Amazon basin, resulting in a locally forced convergent flow on the east side of Rio Negro which drives deep afternoon convection. In terms of atmospheric pollution, the dry-to-wet season is also marked by increased biomass burning, and the city of Manaus (T1) is a local polluted heat island. We will also present quantified thermodynamical and microphysical differences between the thunderstorms that developed over T0, T1 and T2. Our hypothesis is that cloud charge centers, total lightning activity and retrieved microphysics from radar and aircraft measurements (G-1 and HALO) will simultaneously show the influence of the shift from warm- to mixed-phase dominated microphysics caused by aerosol and thermodynamic variability.

            "abstract": "The dynamics and timing of river incision are controlled by a multitude of factors including climate, topography, lithology, and sediment supply. Sediment size distribution affects fluvial erosion in rapidly incising rivers by setting the spatial frequency and temporal longevity of bed cover. Formulating accurate models of river erosion and landscape evolution requires constraints on the link between hillslope steepness and sediment size distribution supplied to the channel. We explore this relationship along Boulder and Fourmile Creeks, two rivers draining the Colorado Front Range. We extracted hillslope angles from digital elevation models at 8 locations of constant (granitic) lithology. Measured slopes ranged from 2 ± 0.2 to 35 ± 2.9 degrees, increasing with proximity to migratory knickzones on both channels. At each slope measurement location, we recorded the size of the 50 largest blocks with a long axis >0.5 m in a 50 m2 area (10 m along-channel x 5 m up hillslope). Comparison of the sum of long axes (an effective proxy for total mass supplied) from each location on Boulder Creek against the corresponding hillslope angles reveals an abrupt transition at ~34°. Hillslopes below 34° exhibit fewer blocks over 50 cm as well as lower values of total long axis length (3 blocks and 135 cm total long axis) while hillslopes over 34° show sediment size distributions heavily skewed towards large blocks (15 blocks and 1600 cm total long axis). Fourmile Creek showed similar trends, but a low number of sample sites precludes comparison with Boulder Creek. Increases in the sum of long axes may indicate a general abundance of larger sediment or presence of a few very large blocks, both of which may significantly influence river incision. We conclude that hillslope angle influences sediment size distribution in the study channels. Complicating factors include variable fracture density and the presence of pre-existing alluvial fill in some study reaches. Our results provide first-order estimates of hillslope control on sediment supply size distribution that may be employed in modeling complex river incision processes.",

            "abstract": "Traditional learning limits the potential for self-discovery, and the use of data and knowledge to understand Earth system relationships, processes, feedback mechanisms and system coupling. It is extremely difficult for undergraduate students to analyze, synthesize, and integrate quantitative information related to complex systems, as many concepts may not be mathematically tractable or yet to be formalized. Conceptual models have long served as a means for Earth scientists to organize their understanding of Earth’s dynamics, and have served as a basis for human analytical reasoning and landscape interpretation. Consequently, we evaluated the use of conceptual modeling, knowledge representation and analytical reasoning to provide undergraduate students with an opportunity to develop and test geocomputational conceptual models based upon their understanding of Earth science concepts. This study describes the use of geospatial technologies and fuzzy cognitive maps to predict desertification across the South-Texas Sandsheet in an upper-level geomorphology course. Students developed conceptual models based on their understanding of aeolian processes from lectures, and then compared and evaluated their modeling results against an expert conceptual model and spatial predictions, and the observed distribution of dune activity in 2010. Students perceived that the analytical reasoning approach was significantly better for understanding desertification compared to traditional lecture, and promoted reflective learning, working with data, teamwork, student interaction, innovation, and creative thinking. Student evaluations support the notion that the adoption of knowledge representation and analytical reasoning in the classroom has the potential to transform undergraduate education by enabling students to formalize and test their conceptual understanding of Earth science. A model for developing and utilizing this geospatial technology approach in Earth science is presented.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic is beset with natural hazards no less than other regions of Earth, but there are some special aspects that require attention. The presence of ice leads to spring river flooding and dynamics of coastal erosion not present in warmer climates. Vast boreal forests are subject to wildfires that are huge pollution events and a positive feedback to climate change through production of CO2, other gases, and black carbon. Darkness and extreme cold that prevail for a significant portion of the year is a challenge to disaster response. Special societal aspects of the Arctic produce vulnerabilities on two scales. One is the development of infrastructure in support of growing extractive industries and Arctic shipping. Reliance on such facilities, which often lack redundancy, and on long supply lines for food and fuel from the south impedes resilience. In 1964, Alaska lost much of its infrastructure to the 9.2 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunamis. Today, Alaska has greater dependency on external supplies and less internal redundancy. Planning that affects vulnerability of infrastructure is often done by corporations and regulated by government agencies based outside the Arctic. The work of scientists who understood Alaska, both within and outside government, provided information to energy corporations persuading them to include expensive design measures into the Trans Alaska Pipeline for crossing an active fault and preventing thawing of permafrost. This is a success story that should not be forgotten. At the other end of the size scale are isolated off-grid and off-road remote communities with fragile power, water, and sanitation facilities. A disaster there can pose an immediate threat to health and even life. Long-term evacuation and the cost a reconstruction may mean that the community is never re-established. Where such communities are centers of indigneous culture, the culture is threatened. With the goal of identifying best practices with these communities, we are conducting a novel all-stakeholder and cross-cultural case study engaging paired towns inundated by ice jam-caused floods of the Lena River in Siberia and Yukon River in Alaska. We anticipate that linking these communities will be empowering for them, as they begin to share their common problems and together look for long-term solutions.",

The 30-member CESM large ensemble coupled runs are analyzed. Both global and local relationships are examined. There is a lot more high frequency variability in radiative fluxes than in temperature, highlighting the role of clouds and transient weather systems in the radiation statistics. Surface temperatures respond to a radiative imbalance and also greatly affect the outgoing longwave radiation OLR), especially over land. However, tropospheric temperatures are much more influenced by clouds, which affect both absorbed solar radiation (ASR) and OLR, and with large compensation. The vertical structure of the CESM temperature profile tends to be top-heavy in the model, with too much deep convection and not enough lower stratospheric cooling as part of the response to tropospheric heating. There is too much ASR over the southern oceans and not enough in the tropics, and ENSO is too large in amplitude in this version of the model. However, the co-variability of monthly mean anomalies produces remarkably good replication of most of the observed relationships. Over the Warm Pool in the tropical western Pacific and Indian oceans, where non-local effects from the Walker circulation driven by the ENSO events are important, several related biases emerge: in response to high SST anomalies there is more precipitation, water vapor and cloud, and less ASR and OLR in the model than observed. Different model global mean trends are evident, however, and hint at too much positive cloud feedback in the model.",

Often skills or an activity is learned but does not necessarily get practiced in the classroom. Very few professional development programs add direct, immediate practice with children where teachers can try out immediately the new activities or the knowledge they have just learned. In this case, the program directors wanted to see that, by having children to practice with in a non-threatening, low stakes environment, if participants would incorporate the activities and knowledge learned during the workshop into their classrooms in a more immediate way. Would immediate practice help participants internalize the new knowledge and skills and thus create a fund of knowledge that they would use immediately on their return to the classroom. As part of a grant for professional development for underserved elementary teachers on climate literacy, an innovative children’s camp was added to a summer intensive workshop. Prior to the summer workshop, participants completed an eight-week online graduate level course on the basics of inquiry-based science. Participants then attended the intensive three-week workshop to gain knowledge in weather and climate and how to teach these concepts in their classrooms. The workshop was rich in materials and resources for participants. During the third week of the workshop, teachers were camp leaders to 100 elementary students in grades 3 through 5 who were participating in “Climate Camp”. Various evaluation and assessments were completed during the program on all participants. Through various evaluation methods, it was found that there was a positive transfer of knowledge to the classroom.",

            "abstract": "Many driven nonequilibrium systems are described by a superposition of several dynamics on various time scales. If time scales are clearly separated then the formalism of superstatistics can be applied, leading effectively to a more general statistical mechanics relevant for complex systems. In these types of systems there is often dynamical behavior that is characterized by spatio-temporal fluctuations of an intensive parameter\nβ\n. This parameter may be for example the inverse temperature, or an effective friction constant, or the amplitude of Gaussian white noise, or the energy dissipation in turbulent flows, or simply a local variance parameter extracted from a measured signal. A nonhomogenoeus spatially extended system with fluctuations in\nβ\non a large time scale, larger than the local relaxation time, leads to a superstatistical description, by averaging local Boltzmann factors using a suitable weight function\nf(β)\n. Kappa distributions in space plasma physics are one example which naturally follows out of this formalism, but there are many applications in other areas as well. In this talk I will sketch the basic theory underlying the superstatistical approach and then describe a couple of recent applications.",

            "abstract": "The geocorona plays an important role in the energy budget of the Earth’s inner magnetosphere since charge exchange of energetic ions with exospheric neutrals makes the exosphere act as an energy sink for ring current particles. Long-term ring current decay following a magnetic storm is mainly due to these electron transfer reactions, leading to the formation energetic neutral atoms (ENAs) that leave the ring current system on ballistic trajectories.\nThe number of ENAs emitted from a given region of space depends on several factors, such as the energy and species of the energetic ion population in that region and the density of the neutral gas with which the ions undergo charge exchange. However, the density and structure of the exosphere are strongly dependent on changes in atmospheric temperature and density as well as charge exchange with the ions of plasmaspheric origin, which depletes the geocorona (by having a neutral removed from the system). Moreover, the radiation pressure exerted by solar far-ultraviolet photons pushes the geocoronal hydrogen away from the Earth in an anti-sunward direction to form a tail of neutral hydrogen.\nTWINS ENA images provide a direct measurement of these ENA losses and therefore insight into the dynamics of the ring current decay through interactions with the geocorona. We assess the influence of geocoronal neutrals on ring current formation and decay by analysis of the predicted ENA emissions using 6 different geocoronal models and simulations from the HEIDI ring current model during storm time. Comparison with TWINS ENA images shows that the location of the peak ENA enhancements is highly dependent on the distribution of geocoronal hydrogen density. We show that the neutral dynamics has a strong influence on the time evolution of the ring current populations as well as on the formation of energetic neutral atoms.",

            "abstract": "The solar cycle can be understood as a process that alternates the large-scale magnetic field of the Sun between poloidal and toroidal configurations. Although the process that transitions the solar cycle between toroidal and poloidal phases is still not fully understood, theoretical studies, and observational evidence, suggest that this process is driven by the emergence and decay of bipolar magnetic regions (BMRs) at the photosphere. Furthermore, the emergence of BMRs at the photosphere is the main driver behind solar variability and solar activity in general; making the study of their properties doubly important for heliospheric physics. However, in spite of their critical role, there is still no unified catalog of BMRs spanning multiple instruments and covering the entire period of systematic measurement of the solar magnetic field (i.e. 1975 to present).\nIn this presentation we discuss an ongoing project to address this deficiency by applying our Bipolar Active Region Detection (BARD) code on full disk magnetograms measured by the 512 (1975-1993) and SPMG (1992-2003) instruments at the Kitt Peak Vacuum Telescope (KPVT), SOHO/MDI (1996-2011) and SDO/HMI (2010-present). First we will discuss the results of our revitalization of 512 and SPMG KPVT data, then we will discuss how our BARD code operates, and finally report the results of our cross-callibration.\nThe corrected and improved KPVT magnetograms will be made available through the National Solar Observatory (NSO) and Virtual Solar Observatory (VSO), including updated synoptic maps produced by running the corrected KPVT magnetograms though the SOLIS pipeline. The homogeneous active region database will be made public by the end of 2017 once it has reached a satisfactory level of quality and maturity.\nThe Figure shows all bipolar active regions present in our database (as of Aug 2015) colored according to the sign of their leading polarity. Marker size is indicative of the total active region flux. Anti-Hale regions are shown using solid markers.",

            "abstract": "While all seismic observatories routinely determine hypocentral location and local magnitude within a few minutes of an earthquake's occurrence, the ability to estimate seismic moment and sense of slip in a similar time frame is less widespread. This is unfortunate, because moment and mechanism are critical parameters for rapid hazard assessment; for larger events, moment magnitude is more reliable due to the tendency of local magnitude to saturate, and certain mechanisms such as off-shore thrust events might indicate earthquakes with tsunamigenic potential. In order to increase access to this capability, we have developed a continuous moment tensor scanning code for Antelope, the ubiquitous open-architecture seismic acquisition and processing software in use around the world. The scanning code, which uses an algorithm that has previously been employed for real-time monitoring at the University of California, Berkeley, is able to produce full moment tensor solutions for moderate events from regional seismic data. The algorithm monitors a grid of potential sources by continuously cross-correlating pre-computed synthetic seismograms with long-period recordings from a sparse network of broad-band stations. The code package consists of 3 modules. One module is used to create a monitoring grid by constructing source-receiver geometry, calling a frequency-wavenumber code to produce synthetics, and computing the generalized linear inverse of the array of synthetics. There is a real-time scanning module that correlates streaming data with pre-inverted synthetics, monitors the variance reduction, and writes the moment tensor solution to a database if an earthquake detection occurs. Finally, there is an 'off-line' module that is very similar to the real-time scanner, with the exception that it utilizes pre-recorded data stored in Antelope databases and is useful for testing purposes or for quickly producing moment tensor catalogs for long time series. The code is open source and is available from a Github repository. This presentation will outline the structure of the software package, will discuss the capabilities and limitations of the code, and will show example solutions from running the code at the Alaska Earthquake Center, including results from the Mw = 5.8 Skwentna, Alaska earthquake of June 24, 2015.",

            "abstract": "Many slabs appear to stagnate in the transition zone although some slabs appear to stagnate at a depth of 1000 km and others appear to descend into the lower mantle relatively unaltered or, perhaps buckling as they descend. Because tomographic images provide a modern day snapshot of a time-dependent process, it is unclear whether the diversity of subducted slab geometries are a manifestation of the same process captured at different times in the lifetime of the subducting system or whether different subduction zones are subject to different conditions that control their evolution. At one time, stagnation of the slab at the base of the transition zone was thought to be due to the transformation of ringwoodite to bridgmanite plus ferropericlase, although subsequent experimental work showed that this transformation does not produce sufficient buoyancy to stall slab descent. In addition to phase transformations in the olivine system, rheology (specifically a ``viscosity hill’’ in the upper part of the lower mantle), trench migration, depth-dependent thermodynamic parameters, and composition have all been investigated as potential slab stagnation mechanisms. The transformation of pyroxene to majoritic garnet occurs by extremely slow diffusion and thus pyroxene unlikely to transform at equilibrium pressures. We have shown that the presence of metastable pyroxene in the cold cores of subducted slabs is sufficient to cause flat-slab subduction. Given the diversity of slab structures, it is quite likely that a combination of mechanisms control slab dynamics. We will investigate slabs stagnation using numerical experiments in 2D and 3D with dislocation/diffusion creep rheology, phase transformations, and plate reconstructions to control the evolution of the plate system.",

            "abstract": "The U.S. Geological Survey has undertaken a focused effort over the past several years to develop scientific tools to improve capabilities to forecast, assess, and mitigate the adverse impacts of ash-producing eruptions. To improve forecasting capabilities, USGS scientists developed a Eulerian ash dispersion and deposition model, Ash3D, with output designed for operational use by other agencies. For ashfall hazards, Ash3D output includes forecasts of time of arrival and duration of ashfall, as well as traditional isopach maps. We coordinated with colleagues at the National Weather Service in Alaska to ensure Ash3D output is useable by NWS in its official ashfall advisories, and we are developing methods to generate long-term probabilistic ashfall hazard maps for DOE. For ash-cloud hazards, Ash3D output includes animations of cloud height, mass load, concentration, and arrival times over airports. To improve assessment capabilities, diverse approaches were pursued: a portable Doppler radar was acquired and successfully used to characterize ash plumes during the 2009 eruption of Redoubt Volcano in Alaska; a database system was created to manage ashfall collection and observations, including by the public (‘Is Ash Falling?’ at\nwww.avo.alaska.edu/ashfall/ashreport.php\n); a display-and-analysis tool was developed that accesses public satellite data from a variety of sensors and platforms (‘Volcview’ at\nvolcview.wr.usgs.gov/\n). To improve mitigation capabilities, the USGS hosts a website (\nvolcanoes.usgs.gov/ash\n), developed by the partners of IAVCEI’s International Volcanic Ashfall Impacts Working Group and recently revamped, that provides practical guidance about how to prepare for and recover from ash eruptions, organized by affected sector (buildings, transportation, power supply, health, agriculture, water supply, communications). With these various tools now available, scientists and citizenry are better prepared for ash eruptions.",

The earthquake sequence also triggered thousands of landslides in the steep Himalayan topography of Nepal and China; these landslides were responsible for hundreds of fatalities and blocked vital roads, trails, and rivers. With the support of USAID’s Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance, the U.S. Geological Survey responded to this crisis by providing landslide-hazard expertise to Nepalese agencies and affected villages.   Assessments of landslide hazards following earthquakes are essential to identify vulnerable populations and infrastructure, and inform government agencies working on rebuilding and mitigation efforts. However, assessing landslide hazards over an entire earthquake-affected region (in Nepal, estimated to be ~30,000 km2), and in exceedingly steep, inaccessible topography presents a number of logistical challenges. We focused the scope of our assessment by conducting helicopter- and ground-based landslide assessments in 12 priority areas in central Nepal identified a priori from satellite photo interpretation performed in conjunction with an international consortium of remote sensing experts. Our reconnaissance covered 3,200 km of helicopter flight path, extending over an approximate area of 8,000 km2. During our field work, we made 17 site-specific assessments and provided landslide hazard information to both villages and in-country agencies. Upon returning from the field, we compiled our observations and further identified and assessed 74 river-blocking landslide dams, 12% of which formed impoundments larger than 1,000 m2 in surface area. These assessments, along with more than 11 hours of helicopter-based video, and an overview of hazards expected during the 2015 summer monsoon have been publically released (\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.3133/ofr20151142\n) for use by in-country and international agencies.",

Further verification of process is being pursued. Should the data continue to register as verifiable, the finery will enable accurate analysis of current and future climate conditions in various sub-regions, with the model being replicable and distributable globally through web mechanisms for localized use.

            "abstract": "The direction of magnetic vectors within coronal mass ejections, CMEs, has significant importance for forecasting terrestrial behavior. However forecasting these vectors remains largely elusive and lies predominately with the difficulty in disassociating the predictive skill of the magnetic configuration during the initiation process with the skill of understanding the evolutionary effects of the topology during propagation. Here, we discuss a simplified system for predicting the magnetic vector within CMEs, driven by observations and empirical relationships. We suggest a modification to a CME helicity rule by Bothmer & Schwenn (1998) can improve the skills with the initiation problem near the solar surface, and accurate triangulation methods of the CME with recent observational studies can improve the predictions of the evolutionary effects. Both tools in conjunction can provide the first steps to providing operationally reliable estimates of the magnetic vectors for all possible CMEs and include scope to improve individual modules within the forecasting scheme. By focusing on Earth-directed CMEs, we can develop forecasting skill scores for multiple CMEs using NOAA definitions for geomagnetic storms. We will present the skill scores of predicted CMEs in relation to their associated Kp values at Earth for CMEs that were predicted in a real-time setting at NASA Space Weather Research Center.",

            "abstract": "Estuaries are among the most productive habitats on the planet. Microbes in estuary sediments control the turnover of organic carbon, and the anaerobic cycling of nitrogen and sulfur. These communities are complex and primarily made up of uncultured lineages, thus little is known about how ecological and metabolic processes are partitioned in sediments. We reconstructed 82 bacterial and 24 archaeal high-quality genomes from different redox regimes (sulfate-rich, sulfate-methane transition zone, and methane-rich zones) of estuary sediments. These bacteria belong to 23 distinct groups, including uncultured candidate phyla (eg. KSB1, TA06, and KD3-62), and three newly described phyla (WOR-1, and -2, and -3). The archaea encompass 8 widespread sediment lineages including MGB-D, RC-III and IV, Z7ME43, Parvarchaeota, Lokiarchoaeta (MBG-B), SAGMEG, Bathyarchaeota (groups MCG-1, -6, -7, and -15) and previously unrecognized deeply branched phylum “Thorarchaeota”. The uncultured phyla mediate essential biogeochemical processes of the estuarine environment. Z7ME43 archaea have genes for S disproportionation (S0 reduction and thiosulfate reduction and oxidation). SAGMEG appear to be strict anaerobes capable of coupling CO/H2 oxidation to either S0 or nitrite reduction and have novel RubisCO genes for carbon fixation. Thorarchaeota contain pathways for acetate production from the degradation of detrital proteins and intermediate S cycling. Furthermore, the gene content of this group revealed links in the evolutionary histories of archaea and eukaryotes. This dataset extents our knowledge of the metabolic potential of several uncultured phyla. We were able to chart the flow of carbon and nutrients through the multiple layers of bacterial processing and reveal potential ecological interactions within the communities.",

The WBE and PM theories grant a generalized mechanistic understanding of relationships between the forest structure and multiple geospatial predictors including topography and climatic variables. We successfully expanded the average trend and predictions of the MST and PM by including eco-regional and plant functional type variations. Our model now accounts for plant interaction, self-competition and disturbance effects to alleviate known limitations of the MST. The topographic heterogeneity and climate seasonality are additionally incorporated in the model predictions. A simple and clear mechanistic understanding in the model is promising for prognostic applications in contrast to conventional black-box approaches. This study provides baseline maps (circa 2005; 1-km2 grids) of the maximum forest canopy heights and aboveground biomass over the continental USA.

            "abstract": "The broad universal nature of the SDGs requires integrated approaches across development sectors and action at a variety of scales: from global to local. In humanitarian and development contexts, particularly at the local level, working towards these goals is increasingly approached through the concept of resilience.\nResilience is broadly defined as the ability to minimise the impact of, cope with and recover from the consequences of shocks and stresses, both natural and manmade, without compromising long-term prospects. Key in this are the physical resources required and the ability to organise these prior to and during a crisis. However, despite the active debate on the theoretical foundations of resilience there is a comparative lack in the development of measurement approaches. The conceptual diversity of the few existing approaches further illustrates the complexity of operationalising the concept.\nHere we present a practical method to measure community resilience using a questionnaire composed of a generic set of household-level indicators. Rooted in the sustainable livelihoods approach it considers 6 domains: human, social, natural, economic, physical and political, and evaluates both resources and socio-cognitive factors. It is intended to be combined with more specific intervention-based questionnaires to systematically assess, monitor and evaluate the resilience of a community and the contribution of specific activities to resilience. Its use will be illustrated using a Haiti-based case study.\nThe method presented supports knowledge-based decision making and impact monitoring. Furthermore, the evidence-based way of working contributes to accountability to a range of stakeholders and can be used for resource mobilisation. However, it should be noted that due to its inherent complexity and comprehensive nature there is no method or combination of methods and data types that can fully capture resilience in and across all of its facets, scales and domains.",

The Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) Investigation on MMS is one of several fields-and-particles investigations. EPD comprises two sensor types, the Energetic Ion Spectrometer (EIS) with one instrument on each of the 4 spacecraft, and the Fly’s Eye Energetic Particle Spectrometer (FEEPS) with 2 instruments on each of the 4 spacecraft. EIS measures energetic ion energy, angle and elemental compositional distributions for protons from < 20 keV, and oxygen from 45 keV, up to > 1 MeV. FEEPS measures instantaneous ( 1/3 s) all sky images of energetic electrons from 25 keV to > 0.6 MeV and also measures total ion energy distributions from 45 keV to > 0.5 MeV to be used in conjunction with EIS to measure all-sky ion distributions. During the preparation stages for the prime mission (prior to 1 September 2015), with a 1.2 x 12 RE orbit precessing across the root of the magnetotail, EPD observed energetic particle responses to depolarization fronts and related particle injection features, ion composition and flow dynamics associated with injections, the dynamic formation of trapping-boundary-like features at intermediate magnetic latitudes, striking electron beam and butterfly distributions likely providing precursors to observations of the magnetopause-magnetosphere interface, and intense modulations in association ULF waves. In this overview presentation, we use some of these observations to document the promise that the EPD investigation holds for contributing to the resolution of reconnection-induced particle acceleration and structuring. We then show the early-mission energetic particle structures and dynamics observed at the magnetopause and in association with reconnection events identified by the mission for detailed study.",

            "abstract": "In assessing the efficacy of the kappa distribution function in space environments, it is useful to follow two paths. First, to what extent do we consider the kappa function (or any function) to represent some kind of universal spectral shape that indicates common physical processes occurring in a wide diversity of space environments? Second, how useful is the kappa function in quantitatively characterizing observed spectral shapes, particularly for the purpose permitting further quantitative analyses of the environment (e. g. wave growth). In this report I evaluate the efficacy of the kappa distribution in representing energetic particle spectral shapes in planetary magnetospheres from both perspectives. In particular, I expand on the extensive treatment provided by Carbary et al. (2014) by taking a more explicit comparative approach between the different planets (Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) and also focusing on the most intense (and therefore from my perspective the most interesting) spectra within each of these different planets. There is no question that the “power law tail” represents as close to a universal characteristic of planetary space environments as one could hope to find. Such a universal shape must represent some universality in the energization and/or equilibrating processes. Also, there is no question that such tails must (to be non-divergent) and do roll over to flatter shapes at lower energies. In a number of applications, this basic characteristic has been usefully characterized by the kappa function to extract such parameters of the system as flow velocities. However, at least for the more intense spectra at Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus, the kappa function in fact does a relatively poor job in representing the low energy roll-over of energetic particle spectra. Other functional forms have been found to be much more useful for characterizing these spectral shapes over a broad range of energies. And specifically, a very common shape that is found at energies below a power-law spectral component is in fact another power-law component.\nCarbary, J. F., M. Kane, B. H. Mauk, and S. M. Krimigis (2014), Using the kappa function to investigate hot plasma in the magnetospheres of the giant planets, J. Geophys. Res. Space Physics, 119, 8426–8447, doi:10.1002/2014JA020324.",

Research suggests that content-rich songs enhance student understanding of science concepts by helping students develop content-based vocabulary, by providing examples and explanations of concepts, and connecting to personal and situational interest in a topic. Building on the role of music in engaging students in learning, and on best practices in out-of-school time learning, the NASA Discovery and New Frontiers program in association with Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Marshall Space Flight Center, and KidTribe developed Space School Musical. Space School Musical consists of a set of nine songs and 36 educational activities to teach elementary and middle school learners about the solar system and space science through an engaging storyline and the opportunity for active learning. In 2014, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory contracted with Magnolia Consulting, LLC to conduct an evaluation of Space School Musical. Evaluators used a mixed methods approach to address evaluation questions related to educator professional development experiences, program implementation and perceptions, and impacts on participating students. Measures included a professional development feedback survey, facilitator follow-up survey, facilitator interviews, and a student survey.\nEvaluation results showed that educators were able to use the program in a variety of contexts and in different ways to best meet their instructional needs. They noted that the program worked well for diverse learners and helped to build excitement for science through engaging all learners in the musical. Students and educators reported positive personal and academic benefits to participating students.

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_Poster HHA final.pdf\nExtreme rainfall is important for the Andean region because of the large contribution of these events to the seasonal totals and consequent impacts on water resources for agriculture, water consumption, industry and hydropower generation, as well as the occurrence of floods and landslides. Over Central and Southern Peruvian Andes (CSPA), rainfall exceeding the 90th percentile contributed between 44 to 100% to the total Nov-Mar 1979-2010 rainfall. Additionally, precipitation from a large majority of stations in the CSPA exhibits statistically significant spectral peaks on intraseasonal time-scales (20 to 70 days). The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is the most important intraseasonal mode of atmospheric circulation and moist convection in the tropics and the occurrence of extreme weather events worldwide. Mechanisms explaining the relationships between the MJO and precipitation in the Peruvian Andes have not been properly described yet. The present study examines the relationships between the activity and phases of the MJO and the occurrence of extreme rainfall over the CSPA. We found that the frequency of extreme rainfall events increase in the CSPA when the MJO is active. MJO phases 5, 6 and 7 contribute to the overall occurrence of extreme rainfall events over the CSPA. However, how the MJO phases modulate extreme rainfall depends on the location of the stations. For instance, extreme precipitation (above the 90th percentile) in stations in the Amazon basin are slightly more sensitive to phases 2, 3 and 4; the frequency of extremes in stations in the Pacific basin increases in phases 5, 6 and 7 whereas phase 2, 3 and 7 modulates extreme precipitation in stations in the Titicaca basin. Greater variability among stations is observed when using the 95th and 99th percentiles to identify extremes. Among the main mechanisms that explain the increase in extreme rainfall events in the Peruvian Andes is the intensification of the easterly moisture flux anomalies, which are favored during certain phases of the MJO. Here dynamical mechanisms linking the MJO to the occurrence of extreme rainfall in stations in the Peruvian Andes are investigated using composites of integrated moisture flux and geopotential height anomalies.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - 2015_AGU_Hill_hydrologic partitioning of frozen soil_FINAL.pdf\nHigh altitude mountainous regions are vital source areas of water and their snow-dominated hydrologic processes are particularly sensitive to climate change. Yet, basic questions remain about snowmelt’s partitioning between surface and subsurface flow and the role it plays in replenishing alpine groundwater. High geologic heterogeneity in mountain regions and inter-annual climate variation challenge our ability to address these questions and anticipate related water resource vulnerabilities. This study compares bedrock and colluvial aquifer system responses to snowmelt on Niwot Ridge in Colorado over five years (2008-2012) to evaluate the role of snowmelt in annual groundwater recharge over varying temporal and spatial scales. We monitor water tables and conservative tracers in source water samples to infer groundwater interaction with snow melt based on unique signatures of source waters. We find that snowmelt is the most important hydrologic alpine groundwater recharge event with water table rises of up to 8m and 4m in response to the freshet in the bedrock and colluvial aquifers, respectively. However, the nature of groundwater response not only depends on climate conditions and the geologic setting, but also on wind scour and topography that affect seasonally frozen soil extent and thus soil infiltration capacity during snowmelt. Areas with high scour and small overlying snow experience smaller annual water table rise and recharge comes from a mix of snowmelt and summer rain sources. This finding suggests that localized recharge processes where seasonally frozen soil is present may not be as vulnerable to declining snowpacks as aquifers more exclusively reliant on snowmelt for recharge. Because wind scour indices can be determined using remotely sensed information, it is possible to anticipate this groundwater response over large scales and in remote regions.",

            "abstract": "The HVDC electrode is a component of a High Voltage Direct Current energy transmission system, and is designed to inject into the ground continuous currents up to 3500 A. The typical HVDC ground electrode is a ring of vertical conductors, 1 km wide, buried a few tens of meters.\nThe design of a HVDC electrode is based on extensive geological, geotechnical and geophysical surveys. Geophysical data are usually electrical (VES) and electromagnetic (TEM/MT) acquisitions, for the modeling of the shallow, near-surface and deep layers of the crust. This survey aims, first, the electrode site selection, and then, at the selected site, this data is combined into a single apparent resistivity curve, which is inverted, allowing for the determination of the layered geoelectric crust model. The injection of electrical continuous current in the electrode is then simulated, with the geoelectric crust model, for the determination of the soil surface potential profile (which is usually asymmetric for different directions, due to non-1D geoelectric models).\nFor the commissioning of a HVDC electrode, field measurements are done, such as electrode grounding resistance, soil surface potentials and metal-to-soil potentials at specific structures (buried pipelines, for instance).\nThe geophysical data acquired during the design phase is a set of data completely independent from the electrical data acquired during the electrode commissioning phase, and both are correlated by the geoelectric model. It happens, therefore, that the geoelectric model can be calibrated based on the electrical data, with the correction of static shifts and other adjustments.\nThis paper suggests that the commissioning of HVDC systems should be associated to a research & development program, with a university or foundation. The idea is to enjoy the opportunity of a more complete field survey, with the acquisition of a wide set of data for a better geological characterization of the area where the electrode was built.",

            "abstract": "Advances in satellite monitoring of the terrestrial water cycle have led to a concerted effort to assimilate soil moisture observations from various platforms into offline land surface models (LSMs). One principal but still open question is that of the ability of land data assimilation (LDA) to improve LSM initial conditions for coupled short-term weather prediction. In this study, the impact of assimilating Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) soil moisture retrievals on coupled WRF forecasts is examined during the summers of dry (2006) and wet (2007) surface conditions in the U.S. Southern Great Plains. LDA is carried out using NASA’s Land Information System (LIS) and the Noah LSM using an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) approach. The impacts of LDA on the a) soil moisture and soil temperature initial conditions for WRF, b) land-atmosphere coupling characteristics, and c) ambient weather of the coupled LIS-WRF simulations are then assessed. Results show that impacts of soil moisture LDA during the spinup can significantly modify LSM states and fluxes, depending on regime and season. Results also quantify the impacts of using seasonal versus cumulative CDF matching and coarse vs. fine-scale atmospheric forcing approaches. Downstream impacts on coupled simulations vary according to the strength of the LDA impact at initialization, and significant modification to the soil moisture-flux-PBL-ambient weather process chain are observed. Overall, improvements due to LDA in this study show promise for future soil moisture assimilation applications in weather and climate.",

            "abstract": "Plant phenology and maximum photosynthetic state determine spatiotemporal variability of gross primary productivity (GPP) of vegetation. Recent warming induced impacts accelerate shifts on phenology and physiological status over Northern vegetated land. Thus, understanding and quantifying these changes are very important. Here, we investigate 1) how vegetation phenology and physiological status (maximum photosynthesis) are evolved over last three decades and 2) how such components (phenology and physiological status) contribute on inter-annual variation of the GPP during last three decades. We utilized both long-term remotely sensed (GIMMS NDVI3g and MODIS) to extract larger scale phenology metrics (growing season start, end and duration) and productivity (i.e., growing season integrated vegetation index, GSIVI) for answering these questions. For evaluation purpose, we also introduced field measured phenology and productivity datasets (e.g., FLUXNET) and possible remotely sensed and modeled metrics at continental and regional scales. From this investigation, we found that onset of growing season has advanced by 1.61 days/decade and growing season end has delayed by 0.67 days/decade over circumpolar region. This asymmetric extension of growing season results in longer growing season trend (2.96 days/decade) and widespread increasing vegetation productivity trend (2.96 GSIVI/decade) over Northern land. However, regionally diverged phenology shift and maximum photosynthetic state contribute differently characterized productivity inter-annual variability and trend. We quantified that about 50%, 13% and 6.5% of Northern land’s inter-annual variabilities are dominantly controlled by onset of growing season, end of growing season and maximum photosynthetic state, respectively. Productivity characterization over other approximately 30% region has been driven by these codominant drivers. Our study clearly shows that regionally different contribution of phenological and physiological components on characterizing vegetation production over last three decade.",

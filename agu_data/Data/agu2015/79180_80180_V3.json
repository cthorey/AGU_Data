            "abstract": "Seasonal variations in outlet glacier velocity due to basal sliding are well-documented and typically involve acceleration early in the melt season due to enhanced sliding as a result of inefficient drainage of surface water reaching the bed. However, velocity observations from Kangerlussuup Sermusa (KS) in West Greenland contradict this pattern. Instead, ice velocity at KS shows no significant change in early spring compared with the previous winter. This sluggish response of the glacier to spring melt is often followed by an extreme, and short-lived, deceleration. For example, in August 2010, the lower 20 km of the trunk decelerated from about 1600 m a-1 to less than 250 m a-1; this event was followed by a rapid reactivation back to the previous velocity in less than 60 days. Available records since 2006 show that the sequence of steady spring velocity, followed by summer deceleration, and rapid fall reactivation occurs annually; however, the magnitudes of deceleration vary. In this regard, the response of KS to regional environmental forcings is unique compared to its neighboring glaciers.\nIn this study, we investigate whether the unique behavior of KS can be explained by the interaction between changes in basal conditions and the local geometry of the glacier. We model the glacier flow by solving full-Stokes equations using the finite element method in the open-source FEniCS framework. Assuming isothermal ice within the lower trunk, we run experiments on the mechanical properties and boundary conditions of the glacier. These experiments include spatio-temporal changes in basal slipperiness, periodic melt-water influx to the bed, and ice viscosity variations due to changes in melt-water supply to the bed. We also conduct sensitivity analyses on the glacier flow with different ice geometries (e.g. thickness and surface slope) to investigate conditions under which we can produce the unique seasonal behavior of KS. Finally, we assess the impact of the combination of these parameters on the ice flow and evaluate the credibility of our hypothetical scenarios based on available measurements.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic Ocean is known to be a region of significance in global climate, and has been observed to undergo drastic changes in recent decades. As research continues to understand the Arctic and the interaction of atmosphere, ice & ocean, a key area of study is ocean circulation – the investigation of which has traditionally been hampered by the region’s harsh and ice-covered nature. However with the advent of polar altimetry and the development of lead retracking, we may draw back the veil of sea ice and study the ocean beneath.\nWe use UCL’s well-developed sea ice retracking techniques to acquire sea surface height (SSH) measurements at leads across the Arctic. These data are used to produce a sea surface field, which is combined with the geoid to calculate dynamic topography and associated geostrophic currents. By adjusting the processing of SSH measurements we may examine surface currents on different time scales, from the multi-year mean state to annual and monthly variations.\nWe demonstrate the major improvement in coverage and resolution offered by Cryosat-2, as well as comparison against in-situ data. We show the variations in currents visible on different time scales, and discuss the considerations of processing data on these time scales with reference to Cryosat’s ground track/sampling pattern. We examine the potential effect of irregular distributions of leads, and the significance of any bias introduced by melt ponds in summer. We also show the improvements offered by using a combined (rather than satellite-only) geoid solution, and the caveats thereof. Finally, we look to methods of improving Arctic dynamic topography products in the future.",

            "abstract": "Almost all soils experience regular drought and rewetting events. Yet most of our understanding of soil processes focuses on the moist periods, when plants are growing and nutrients are actively cycling. Yet, as soils dry, processes continue, yet change. Microbes shift their metabolic pathways from growth to survival, producing extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), sporulating, and going dormant. Under dry conditions, biotic processes are constrained but abiotic, chemical processes continue potentially altering soil aggregation and structure; in clayey California annual grassland & woodland soils pools of bioavailable water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) increase as does microbial biomass. Finally at rewetting, the pulse of water mobilizes resources, stimulates microbial activity and produces a flush of respiration and nutrient mineralization that can mobilize resources that had been previously inaccessible. One question that has driven much research has been where the organic matter comes from that drives these processes. We had hypothesized that the source of C for the dry-season increases was from the previous winter’s dead roots, but field experiments where we maintained plots plant-free for two years showed no decline in the production of WEOC, nor in the early-season respiration pulses following rewetting. In this presentation, we will discuss recent work integrating measurements on aggregation (driven both by biotic and abiotic processes), EPS production, and the dynamics of WEOC and microbial biomass and how they function differently under dry and moist conditions.",

            "abstract": "Surface mass balance (SMB) represents a significant portion of the overall mass balance of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Accurate modeling of the SMB processes is key to our understanding of the past, present and future evolution of the ice sheets in response to climate forcings. Characterizing errors and improving the models is necessary to enhance our understanding of the SMB processes driving change, but also to isolate other processes such as dynamic ice loss through the combined reduction of satellite, airborne, in-situ and model data. In this study we quantify the performance of the MERRA-2 SMB model for the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets using satellite gravity observations from the GRACE mission.\nWe use two approaches in quantifying the performance and constraining the SMB model. First we compare the spatial and temporal variation of the intrinsic modes determined from both the MERRA-2 SMB model output and the NASA GSFC release 2 iterated high-resolution GRACE mascon solution. We take advantage of the mascon solution’s improved signal to noise and minimization of signal leakage. We use the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) adaptive filter to isolate seasonal, annual, and inter-annual modes in both the GRACE mascons and SMB model data. Spatial and temporal variations are compared and analyzed. Second, we incorporate the SMB model output of spatial and temporal surface mass change into our forward modeling used in the formal reduction of the GRACE inter-satellite range-rate data. The full spatial and temporal resolution of the SMB model is forward modeled. We analyze the change in the inter-satellite range-rate residuals as well as the new estimated mascon solution which has the SMB model output rigorously removed through forward modeling in the GRACE range-rate data reduction. The EEMD analysis is applied to the “delta mascon” solution and compared to the solution without the SMB forward modeled. The results of the EEMD analysis as well as the “delta mascon” solution are presented and interpreted. The techniques developed can be used to quantify the performance and improve other SMB models and to isolate other processes such as dynamic ice loss.",

            "abstract": "Current generation climate models exhibit substantial spread in their representation of Arctic atmosphere-ocean fluxes. Here, we compare Arctic surface fluxes in CMIP5 models and reanalysis products. We focus in particular on freshwater fluxes around Greenland, and the magnitude of observed and projected changes in ice sheet mass balance relative to those in precipitation and evaporation. This information is used to infer the time and spatial scales over which uncertainty in freshwater flux from the Greenland ice sheet is meaningful from a large-scale oceanographic perspective.\nWe intend to examine the influence of this spread on ocean heat content around Greenland using numerical simulations conducted with a common ocean model. Although our initial analysis will highlight near-Greenland ocean heat content, these simulations might be used to examine the mechanisms by which this surface forcing propagates to other oceanic quantities and/or regions. This presentation is thus also intended to solicit desired diagnostic outputs and additional perturbation experiments that would be of use to the Arctic system and wider scientific communities.",

We therefore examine the natural degree of saturation for samples taken from: a) drill cores in regions which have been thermally static for most of the Cenozoic Era; b) a transect across a glacial valley which was excavated during the Last Glacial Maximum; and c) a rapidly-uplifting tectonic block along the San Andreas Fault.

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU 2015 poster GCelis-HighRes.pdf\nCurrent and future warming of high latitude tundra ecosystems will play an important role in climate change through feedbacks to the global carbon (C) cycle. Long-term observational and experimental studies are pivotal for detecting and understanding changes in the coming decades. Yet studies of the C feedbacks from observational studies and manipulative experiments made on tundra plant communities often have significantly different conclusions with regards to impacts of warming on the ecosystem. Comparing results from these two study types, however, often involves integrating CO2 flux measurements that were collected on different spatial scales using a variety of methods. The process of data assimilation for landscape level analysis is often complicated by the fact that many projects only utilize one method for measuring CO2 fluxes at a given site. This study compares five years of C dynamics in a moist acidic tundra from control plots in a manipulative warming experiment (CiPEHR – plot-scale) and landscape-level natural permafrost thaw gradient (Gradient – Eddy covariance) observations all within a 1km distance from each other. We found net ecosystem exchange (NEE) to be an annual net source of carbon using both methods (Gradient 12.3 – 125.6 g CO2-C m-2 and CiPEHR warming manipulation 80.2 – 175.8 g CO2-C m-2). The differences between sites were biggest in the first three years of observation, and can be explained by lower growing season gross primary production (GPP – first three years) from the manipulation (CiPEHR), and lower ecosystem respiration (Reco) from CiPEHR in the first year only. Suppressed GPP and Reco could be from the impact of experimental setup (chamber soil collars – root damage), which lowered the plant community’s capacity to fix C, but recovered within three years. This warrants caution of making generalization of short-term experiments in the tundra and more research is needed evaluating coupling of belowground and aboveground C dynamics.",

Several robust features emerge, which – for instance – allows the IPCC to associate high confidence in the radiative forcing associated with ozone increases between 1750 and the present day. However, such quantities hide the spread in results between different models, particularly when looking at seasonal and regional scales, and including for comparisons with observations. What can we learn about our scientific understanding from the model spread? What can we learn about models from the model spread? And can we make recommendations for deficient or missing processes if we wish to use our models for environmental prediction? Of course, these questions also have to be asked in the context of what we want the model(s) to do (air quality, climate, stratospheric ozone depletion etc.).\nThis poster will report ongoing work in my group which draws on results from multi-model experiments conducted in support of the most recent IPCC report (CMIP5 and ACCMIP), with an eye to the expected outcomes from the ongoing Chemistry-Climate Model Initiative (CCMI) model simulations.",

            "abstract": "Subglacial waters tend to accumulate solutes from extensive rock-water interactions, which, when released to the surface, can provide nutrients to surface ecosystems providing a ‘hot spot’ for microbial communities. Blood Falls, an iron-rich, saline feature at the terminus of Taylor Glacier in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica is a well-studied subglacial discharge. Here we present an overview of geophysical surveys, thermomechanical drilling exploration and geomicrobiological analyses of the Blood Falls system. A helicopter-borne transient electromagnetic system (SkyTEM) flown over the Taylor Glacier revealed a surprisingly extensive subglacial aquifer and indicates that Blood Falls may be the only surface manifestation of this extensive briny groundwater. Ground-based temperature sensing and GPR data combined with the helicopter-borne TEM data enabled targeted drilling into the englacial conduit that delivers brine to the surface. During the 2014-15 austral summer field season, we used a novel ice-melting drill (the IceMole) to collect englacial brine for geomicrobiological analyses. Results from previously collected outflow and more recent samples indicate that the brine harbors a metabolically active microbial community that persists, despite cold, dark isolation. Isotope geochemistry and molecular analysis of functional genes from BF suggested that a catalytic or ‘cryptic’ sulfur cycle was linked to iron reduction. Recent metagenomic analysis confirms the presence of numerous genes involved in oxidative and reductive sulfur transformations. Metagenomic and metabolic activity data also indicate that subglacial dark CO2 fixation occurs via various pathways. Genes encoding key steps in CO2 fixation pathways including the Calvin Benson Basham and Wood Ljungdahl pathway were present and brine samples showed measureable uptake of 14C-labeled bicarbonate. These results support the notion that, like the deep subsurface, subglacial environments are chemosynthetic, deriving energy in part by cycling iron and sulfur compounds. Collectively our interdisciplinary dataset indicates that subsurface brines are widespread in the Taylor Valley polar desert and this previously unknown groundwater network likely supports unique microbial life.",

            "abstract": "In October 2015, the sounding rocket project O-STATES was conducted from Esrange Space Center (67.9°N, 21.1°E) in northern Sweden. The acronym O-STATES stands for “Oxygen Species and Thermospheric Airglow in The Earth´s Sky” and the basic idea is that comprehensive information on the composition, specifically atomic oxygen in the ground state O and first excited state O(1D), and temperature of the lower thermosphere can be obtained from a limited set of optical measurements. Starting point for the analysis are daytime measurements of the O2(b1∑g+ − X3∑g−) Atmospheric Band system in the spectral region 755-780 nm and the O(1D-3P) Red Line at 630 nm. In the daytime lower thermosphere O(1D) is produced by O2 photolysis and the excited O2(b) state is mainly produced by energy transfer from O(1D) to the O2(X) ground state. In addition to O2 photolysis, both electron impact on O and dissociative recombination of O2+ are major sources of O(1D) in the thermosphere.\nRecent laboratory studies at SRI demonstrate that the O2(b) production populates the vibrational levels v=1 and v=0 in a ratio of ~4. While O2(b, v=0) is essentially unquenched, O2(b, v=1) is subject to collisional quenching that is dominated by O at altitudes above 160 km. Hence, the ratio of the Atmospheric Band emission from O2(b, v=1) and O2(b, v=0) is a measure of the O density. Finally, the spectral shape of the O2 Atmospheric Band is temperature dependent and spectrally resolved measurements of the Atmospheric Bands thus provide a measure of atmospheric temperature.\nThis O2 Atmospheric Band analysis has been advocated as a technique for thermospheric remote sensing under the name Global Oxygen and Temperature (GOAT) Mapping. With O-STATES we want to characterize the GOAT technique by in-situ analysis of the O2 Atmospheric Band airglow and the underlying excitation mechanisms. By performing this dayglow analysis from a rocket payload, detailed local altitude profiles of the relevant emissions and interacting species can be obtained. In particular, the optical measurements are combined with independent detection of O and O2 (resonance fluorescence and electrochemical detection) as well as measurements of electron and ion densities. Here we describe the O-STATES project and present first results.",

The satellite completed its mission in November 2013 and the most recent gravity field models (e.g., GOCE 5th generation gravity field models) have already been released. However, there are still unanswered questions in the data processing which leak into GOCE Level 1b and 2 products. It is found that there are signals of non-gravitational origin present in the cross-track gravity gradients that are about three to five times larger than the expected noise level of the gravity field components derived from GOCE gradiometer. These disturbances are observed around the magnetic poles during particular time periods that correspond to geomagnetically active days. In this study, we investigate the unexpected disturbances present in GOCE gradiometer gravity tensor's diagonal components along the satellite track and analyze possible causes. External datasets, interplanetary magnetic, and electric field observations from the solar wind monitoring spacecraft ACE- (Advanced Composition Explorer) and WIND, geomagnetic activity observed at CARISMA (Canadian Array for Real-time Investigations of Magnetic Activity) stations and Ionospheric Equivalent Currents (EICS) and Elementary Current Amplitudes (SECS) derived from terrestrial geomagnetic field disturbances observed over North America and Greenland are used to understand the effect of the space weather variations and ionospheric dynamics on the GOCE Gradiometer measurements. We have shown that the variation in the amplitude of the equivalent currents and changes in the current directions show high correlation with the disturbances observed in GOCE measurements along the satellite track which hints the interaction between the two.",

In order to investigate short-term climatic control on river chemistry, riverine samples from Yangtze River were collected in Nanjing twice a month during May, 2010 to April, 2011. Major ions (Cl, SO4, NO3, Ca, Mg , K, Na, Sr ), 87Sr/86Sr ratios and magnesium isotopic composition in the dissolved load were determined. Results show that in the monsoon season, 87Sr/86Sr, Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios were lower than those ratios during the dry season, implying that carbonate weathering is relatively intense during high discharge periods. But variations in Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios are more significant than the changes in 87Sr/86Sr and δ26/24Mg ratios (Fig. 1), and are both negatively correlated with discharge (Fig. 2). This can’t be explained by changes in mixing portions of silicate and carbonate weathering products, but by that more secondary carbonate (low Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios) precipitates when discharge is lower. Because Mg is hardly incorporated into secondary carbonates, this process exerts little control on riverine δ26/24Mg ratio.\nIf the riverine chemistry change during the late Cenozoic cooling is similar to the regime above, the riverine Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca would been elevated, causing large increase in oceanic Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca ratios but stability in oceanic δ26/24Mg ratio.",

Analysis of a new, 1-year set of observations from an Automatic Weather Station on Larsen C Ice Shelf, Antarctica, reveals that föhn winds are able to cause intense melt in summer, and even into the late austral autumn. A potentially important, but hitherto unknown, consequence of this intense surface melting and ponding is the formation of high-density near-surface ice from the refreezing of that water. We report the discovery of a massive subsurface ice layer located in an area of intense melting and intermittent ponding on Larsen C Ice Shelf, Antarctica. We combine borehole optical televiewer logging and ground-based radar measurements with remote sensing and firn modelling to investigate the formation and spatial extent of this layer, found to be tens of kilometres across and tens of metres deep. The presence of this ice layer has the effect of raising local ice shelf density by ~190 kg m-3 and temperature by 5 - 10 °C above values found in areas unaffected by ponding and hitherto used in models of ice-shelf fracture and flow.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater flow in fractured basement rocks on aquifer scale and processes involved in the creation of fracture network permeability are poorly understood even though they have been studied for decades. A unique hydrogeological dataset consisting of 1030 discrete inflows (corresponding to preferential groundwater pathways) to the Poehla Ore Mine (Ore Mountains) of the SDAG Wismut has been compiled and quantitatively interpreted. Transmissivities and permeabilities were calculated from discrete and cumulative inflows using analytical equations and numerical groundwater flow models. The Variscan basement at Poehla Mine was modelled in 3-D, covering a volume of 14x4x1 km3 with 14 metamorphosed litho-stratigraphic units and 131 faults separated in 6 main strike directions. Mesoscale fractures mapped at inflows points, i.e. locally conductive fractures, show a weak correlation with fault orientation, and a large orientation scattering, which could be related to small scale stress heterogeneities. Inflow points were spatially correlated with major faults considering two distance criteria. This correlation suggests that mainly NW-SE and NE-SW striking faults are transmissive, which should be critically stressed considering all available data about the regional stress field. The trace length (extent) and width of the core and damage zones of the modelled faults were compiled in order to investigate the flow distribution and permeability profiles in directions perpendicular to fault strike. It can be shown that 90% of all inflows are located in damage zones. The inflows are usually situated within multiple fault zones which overlap each other. Cumulative flow distribution functions within damage zones are non-linear and vary between faults with different orientation. 75-95% of the flow occurs in the inner 50% of the damage zone. Significantly lower flow rates were recognized within most fault cores.",

We compiled 486 reports of 137Cs dated cores from coastal marshes in North America and compared vertical accretion rates to relative sea-level rise (RSLR) from the nearest NOAA tide gauge between 1963 and the core collection year. There was a positive linear correlation between RSLR and vertical accretion. When RSLR was greater than 5 mm/yr RSLR outpaced accretion on average indicating a possible limitation to positive feedback within the system. We also calculated net-accretion (vertical accretion - RSLR) and summarized regional variation according to both coastal zone and watershed boundaries. From 1963 to present the West Coast has been the most historically resilient to RSLR, the Gulf Coast has been the most vulnerable, and the East Coast has been intermediate and variable. We compared regional trends in net-accretion to land cover change using 1996-2010 Coastal Change Analysis Program maps with freshwater wetland area constrained by tidal categories from the National Wetlands Inventory. Watersheds with historic net-accretion falling below -3.9 mm/yr in the Gulf Coast were much more likely to have massive losses of coastal wetland area from 1996-2010, up to 10% of 1996 wetland area in some cases. Areas with higher net-accretion did not show change, except for some gains in the San Francisco Bay. The Mississippi Delta mouth is a notable data anomaly with positive historical net-accretion as well as a net-loss of wetland surface to open water which may identify an important limitation of soil coring techniques in areas with dynamic sediment deposition.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection has been extensively studied in 2D geometries for many decades and considerable progress has been made in understating 2D reconnection physics, yet in real plasmas reconnection is fundamentally 3D in nature. Only recently has it become possible to study 3D reconnection using simulations, however some initial results have suggested that the inclusion of 3D effects does not strongly affect the basic properties of reconnection (e.g. reconnection rate or particle acceleration). Yet on the other hand, previous experiments, without direct 3D measurements, have implied that 3D effects could be important even in a quasi-2D system. Here we experimentally study both the (1) macro- and (2) microphysics of 3D reconnection in order to directly test the importance of 3D effects in a quasi-2D experiment. Using fully simultaneous 3D measurements, it is shown that during highly driven reconnection the macroscopic structure of the current sheet can become strongly 3D despite an essentially 2D upstream region. The correlation length along the current sheet is measured to be far shorter than suggested by kinetic simulations. Results from new experiments with stronger reconnection drive and diagnostics designed to estimate the 3D reconnection rate will be discussed. With regards to (2), the 3D microphysics, new diagnostics capable of measuring fluctuations at frequencies up to the electron cyclotron frequency (~ 300 MHz) have been developed and have identified the presence of very high frequency waves (~ 100 MHz) during asymmetric reconnection, localized to the low-density side. The detailed properties of these waves, including the measured power spectra and dispersion relation, will be discussed and compared with both previous satellite observations of high-frequency waves as well as with theoretical predictions on the generation of whistler waves during reconnection.",

To accomplish this, we established a three-fold approach to link course work with fieldwork through: 1) active participation in the field and laboratory, 2) multi-tiered mentoring, 3) and formal education modules. During the summer of 2015, six undergraduate students and seven graduate students collected field samples from Green Lake (NY) and Mahoney Lake (BC). The students learned how to take water and sediment samples, process samples in anaerobic chambers in the field, and deal with moderately adverse field conditions. These learning by doing activities reinforced lessons learned in the classroom. The second phase involved two high school students who helped process and analyze the samples in the laboratory during summer session. These students worked with the undergraduate and graduate students who participated in the fieldwork. This interaction benefited both the high school students, who learned new methods, and the university students who learned to explain their field research and mentor younger students. The third phase involved creation of education modules to better inform middle school students of the issues of hypoxia. We piloted portions of our module at a conference for forty middle school girls. Graduate students showed the girls field equipment and how to make oxygen measurements using handheld instruments. In all of these activities, the students had the opportunity to work with the PI’s, who were fully engaged in the process and who made a constant effort to be educators in the field and in the lab.",

            "abstract": "In most models reported aiming to reconstruct the paleogeography of Southeast Asia, the Indochina block generally was attached to the South China block or travelled together with it in the convergence of Eastern Asia blocks. Here we present new paleomagnetic data of Middle Permian to Upper Triassic sediment rocks from the Indochina block in Thailand, and recalculate paleomagnetic data reported by different authors. We collected the Permian samples in 20 sites distributed in the central Thailand, and Triassic samples from the Huai Hin Lat and Nam Phong formations in 13 sites in the northern Thailand.\nThe magnetic directions of the 11 sites of Permian limestones are not significantly clustered after tilt correction which implying a remagnetized result. Remarkably, in geographic coordinate, the 11 sites were distributed along a circle showing a similar inclination，which is 22.9° implying the paleolatitude to be about 12°. Totally, 13 sites from the Huai Hin Lat formation are included in the calculation of the formation mean direction Dg/Ig = 21.4°/38.1°, kg = 19.5, α95 = 9.6° before and Ds/Is = 43.0°/48.0°, ks = 47.4, α95 = 6.1°, N = 13 after bedding correction. A pre-folding characteristic magnetization is suggested by the positive fold test result derived from the Huai Hin Lat formation, and thus implies a primary remanence of the Norian Stage Upper Triassic rocks. A new Nam Phong formation mean direction derived from 11 sites is Dg/Ig = 36.5°/31.3°, kg = 14.7, α95 = 12.3°before and Ds/Is = 36.4°/37.8°, ks = 68.5, α95 = 5.6°, N = 11 after bedding correction. The two formation mean directions correspond to the magnetic pole positions, Plat./Plon=48.7°N/165.9°E, A95=7.2° and Plat./Plon=55.2°N/178.0°E, A95=5.9°, respectively. The new magnetic pole position of the Huai Hin Lat formation is the first and oldest pole, derived from enough sites (or samples), of the APWP of the Indochina block, which is the most important highlight in our study. A remarkable tectonic movement (~8° southward) of the Indochina block from the age of the Huai Hin Lat formation to the Nam Phong formation is suggested in this study, indicating the Indochina block locates in the west of the South China block at the Norian Age Late Triassic and moved to a new position which is quite near the present at the Rhaetian Age of Late Triassic to Early Jurassic.",

            "abstract": "The establishment of distributed active archive centers (DAACs) as data warehouses and the standardization of file format by NASA’s Earth Observing System Data Information System (EOSDIS) had doubtlessly propelled interoperability of NASA Earth science data to unprecedented heights in the 1990s. However, we obviously still feel wanting two decades later. We believe the inadequate interoperability we experience is a result of the the current practice that data are first packaged into files before distribution and only the metadata of these files are cataloged into databases and become searchable. Data therefore cannot be efficiently filtered. Any extensive study thus requires downloading large volumes of data files to a local system for processing and analysis.The need to download data not only creates duplication and inefficiency but also further impedes interoperability, because the analysis has to be performed locally by individual researchers in individual institutions. Each institution or researcher often has its/his/her own preference in the choice of data management practice as well as programming languages. Analysis results (derived data) so produced are thus subject to the differences of these practices, which later form formidable barriers to interoperability. A number of Big Data technologies are currently being examined and tested to address Big Earth Data issues. These technologies share one common characteristics: exploiting compute and storage affinity to more efficiently analyze large volumes and great varieties of data. Distributed active “archive” centers are likely to evolve into distributed active “analysis” centers, which not only archive data but also provide analysis service right where the data reside. “Analysis” will become the more visible function of these centers. It is thus reasonable to expect interoperability to improve because analysis, in addition to data, becomes more centralized. Within a “distributed active analysis center” interoperability is almost guaranteed because data, analysis, and results all can be readily shared and reused. Effectively, with the establishment of “distributed active analysis centers”, interoperation turns from a many-to-many problem into a less complicated few-to-few problem and becomes easier to solve.",

            "abstract": "Meteoroids and orbital debris, collectively referred to as hypervelocity impactors, travel between 7 and 72 km/s in free space. Upon their impact onto the spacecraft, the energy conversion from kinetic to ionization/vaporization occurs within a very brief timescale and results in a small and dense expanding plasma with a very strong optical flash. The radio frequency (RF) emission produced by this plasma can potentially lead to electrical anomalies within the spacecraft. In addition, space weather, such as solar activity and background plasma, can establish spacecraft conditions which can exaggerate the damages done by these impacts. During the impact, a very strong impact flash will be generated. Through the studying of this emission spectrum of the impact, we hope to study the impact generated gas cloud/plasma properties.\nThe impact flash emitted from a ground-based hypervelocity impact test is long expected by many scientists to contain the characteristics of the impact generated plasma, such as plasma temperature and density. This paper presents a method for the time-resolved plasma temperature estimation using three-color visible band photometry data with a global pattern search optimization method. The equilibrium temperature of the plasma can be estimated using an optical model which accounts for both the line emission and continuum emission from the plasma. Using a global pattern search based optimizer, the model can isolate the contribution of the continuum emission versus the line emission from the plasma. The plasma temperature can thus be estimated. Prior to the optimization step, a Gaussian process is also applied to extract the optical emission signal out of the noisy background. The resultant temperature and line-to-continuum emission weighting factor are consistent with the spectrum of the impactor material and current literature.",

            "abstract": "The impact of CAPE and wind shear on storms in a Titan-like environment are explored through numerical simulation. Numerical modeling indicates that both large-scale shear and CAPE environment control the dynamics of the clouds. This response to the large-scale environment is analogous to the behavior of deep convective clouds on Earth. The balance between shear and CAPE, as expressed through the bulk Richardson Number (NR), is a good indicator of the response of a storm to its environment. Large NR results in short-lived single cell storms (Figure 1a). As shear increases for a given CAPE, and NR decreases, the storms transition to a multicellular regime. Multicellular storms are longer-lived and are characterized by a downdraft generated cold pool that interacts with the background shear vorticity to initiate cells along the leading edge of the storm gust front (Figure 1b). The most intense multicellular systems simulated in this study behave similar to terrestrial squall lines, and very long-lived storms (>24 hours) propagating for 1000 km or more might be possible. Cloud outbursts and linear cloud features observed from ground and Cassini may be the result of these organized storm systems. Varying amounts of shear in the Titan environment might explain the variety of convective cloud expressions identified in Cassini orbiter and ground-based observations. The resulting distribution and magnitude of precipitation as well as surface winds associated with storms have implications on the formation of fluvial and aeolian features, including dunes, and on the exchange of methane with the surface and lakes.",

            "abstract": "Aerosols play an important role in Earth’s energy balance mainly through interactions with solar radiation and cloud processes. There is a distinct annual cycle of arctic aerosols, with greatest mass concentrations in the spring and lowest in summer due to effective wet removal processes - allowing for new particles formation events to take place. Little is known about the spatial extent of these events as no previous studies have directly compared and linked aerosol measurements from different arctic stations during the same times. Although the arctic stations are hardly affected by local pollution, it is normally assumed that their aerosol measurements are indicative of a rather large area. It is, however, not clear if that assumption holds all the time, and how large may that area be.\nIn this study, three different datasets of aerosol size distributions from Mt. Zeppelin in Svalbard, Station Nord in northern Greenland and Alert in the Canadian arctic, are analyzed for the measurement period of 2012-2013. All stations are 500 to 1000 km from each other, and the travel time from one station to the other is typically between 2 to 5 days. The meteorological parameters along the calculated trajectories are analyzed in order to estimate their role in the modification of the aerosol size distribution while the air is traveling from one field station to another. In addition, the exposure of the sampled air to open waters vs. frozen sea is assessed, due to the different fluxes of heat, moisture, gases and particles, that are expected to affect the aerosol size distribution.\nThe results show that the general characteristics of the aerosol size distributions and their annual variation are not very different in all three stations, with Alert and Station Nord being more similar. This is more pronounced when looking into the cases for which the trajectory calculations indicated that the air traveled from one of the latter stations to the other. The probable causes for the measurements at Mt. Zeppelin to stand out are the greater exposure to ice-free water all year round. In addition, the air sampled at Mt. Zeppelin is sometimes decoupled from the air at sea level. This results in a greater potential contribution of long-range transport to the aerosols that are measured there, compared to the other low-altitude stations.",

            "abstract": "Sudden commencements (SCs) are triggered by a compression of the dayside magnetosphere, leading to fast mode wave propagation in the equatorial plane. In contrast, the compression induces Alfven waves that propagate toward the dayside polar ionosphere along field lines, and then ionospheric electric fields propagate toward low-latitude ionosphere at speed of light. Several direct observations have provided evidence of the fast mode or Alfven wave propagation, but spatial and temporal evolutions of these propagations are not well known. Moreover, a previous study shows that upward Poynting fluxes transport electromagnetic energy toward the nightside magnetosphere. However, whether such upward Poynting fluxes are launched from the ionosphere or converted from fast mode waves has not been confirmed yet. In this study, we investigate evolution of the electric field in the magnetosphere-ionosphere coupled system using THEMIS, Van Allen Probes, GOES 13 and 15, SuperDARN, and HF Doppler radars. We find 70 SC events occurred from January 2013 to December 2014. The result of event studies shows the time delay of the onsets between dayside and nightside magnetospheric electric fields, which can be explained by the fast mode wave propagation. However, we also find that the SC onset of the nightside electric field (~21 h LT) is 15 s later than that of the midnight one although they are detected in the same L-value, which may suggest a dawn-dusk asymmetry of the electromagnetic energy propagation time in the inner magnetosphere. In the ionosphere, both SuperDARN and HF Doppler radars detect a northward velocity at ~15 h LT about 1 min after that of the dayside magnetospheric electric field, which is consistent with the Alfven velocity from the dayside magnetosphere to the polar ionosphere. We will evaluate the possible propagation path of the electromagnetic energy associated with SCs.",

Compared to ground-based precipitation measurements, satellite-based precipitation estimation products have advantages of temporal resolution and spatial coverage. Also, the massive amount of satellite data contains various measures related to precipitation formation and development. On the other hand, deep learning algorithms were newly developed in the area of machine learning, which was a breakthrough to deal with large and complex dataset, especially to image data.\nHere, we attempt to engage deep learning techniques to provide hourly precipitation estimation from satellite information, such as long wave infrared data. The brightness temperature data from infrared data is considered to contain cloud information. Radar stage IV dataset is used as ground measurement for parameter calibration. Stacked denoising auto-encoders (SDAE) is applied here to build a 4-layer neural network with 1000 hidden nodes for each hidden layer. SDAE involves two major steps: (1) greedily pre-training each layer as a denoising auto-encoder using the outputs of previous trained hidden layer output starting from visible layer to initialize parameters; (2) fine-tuning the whole deep neural network with supervised criteria.\nThe results are compared with satellite precipitation product PERSIANN-CCS (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Imagery using an Artificial Neural Network Cloud Classification System). Based on the results, we have several valuable conclusions: By properly training the neural network, it is able to extract useful information for precipitation estimation. For example, it can reduce the mean squared error of the precipitation by 58% for the summer season in the central United States of the validation period. The SDAE method captures the shape of the precipitation from the cloud shape better compared to the CCS product. Design of the loss function is essential to the optimization model where multiple aspects need to be accommodated.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - TEX Broader Impacts Poster.pdf\nLosses from natural hazards continue to grow, despite growing scientific understanding. Similarly, increasing scientific evidence of our vulnerability to human-induced environmental change has little impact on human behavior. From the perspective of community leaders and policy makers, useful research is hard to locate and difficult to translate from academic publications. Making local decisions is complicated by multiple scientific approaches and predictions and a scientific emphasis on the abstract and global over the concrete and local.\nCollaborative and respectful locally-focused partnerships, in which community leaders and decision makers co-design local solutions with Earth and space scientists, can overcome this research-to-impact gap. These partnerships work best when they use available scientific and community knowledge to make an immediate local impact while also designing research that addresses broadly relevent and emerging priorities. Framed this way, successful partnerships rest on reciprocal volunteerism: for scientists, making an immediate impact with current knowledge is pro-bono work, while the longer term research better aligns with their career advancement. For community leaders this is flipped: immediate actions tie to their professional responsibilities, and participating in research is often extracurricular.\nThe Thriving Earth Exchange has launched several of these local partnerships and is assembling a set of tools and resources that scientists and community leaders can use to advance their work together. We will introduce the institutional partners who help us identify communities willing to enter these partnerships, and describe how we recruit and select willing and able scientists, many from AGU. We will highlight the human-centered skills and values that are important predictors of successful partnerships and show how we nurture them. We will also describe the progress of several existing efforts and the strategies they use to advance their co-design process. We will explore ideas for sharing co-designed solutions between communities, and explore how partnerships can make the inevitable local customization of borrowed solutions more efficient. Finally, we will share some of the solutions these partnerships have developed and describe their impact.",

The D-region ionospheric changes associated with that eclipse, led to several degree of observable perturbations of sub-ionospheric very low frequency (VLF) radio signal. The University of Electro-Communications (UEC) operates VLF observation network over Japan. The solar eclipse associated signal changes were recorded in several receiving stations (Rx) simultaneously for the VLF signals coming from NWC/19.8kHz, JJI/22.2kHz, JJY/40.0kHz, NLK/24.8kHz and other VLF transmitters (Tx). These temporal dependences of VLF signal perturbation have been analyzed and the spatio-temporal characteristics of respective sub-ionospheric perturbations has already been studied by earlier workers using 2D-Finite Difference Time Domain method of simulation. In this work, we determine the spatial scale, depth and temporal dependence of lower ionospheric perturbation in consistence with umbral and penumbral motion. We considered the 2-parameter D-region ionospheric model with exponential electron density profile. To model the solar obscuration effect over it, we assumed a generalized space-time dependent 2-dimensional elliptical Gaussian distribution for ionospheric parameters, such as, effective reflection height (h′) and sharpness factor (β). The depth (△hmax, △βmax), center of shadow (lato(t), lono(t)) and spatial scale (σlat,lon) of that Gaussian distribution are used as model parameters. In the vicinity of the eclipse zone, we compute the VLF signal perturbations using Long Wave Propagation Capability (LWPC) code for several signal propagation paths. The propagation path characteristics, such as, ground and water conductivity and geomagnetic effect on ionosphere are considered from standard LWPC prescriptions. The model parameters are tuned to set an optimum agreement between our computation and observed positive and negative type of VLF perturbations. Thus, appropriate set of parameters lead us to the possible determination of spatial scale, depth and temporal dependence of eclipse associated D-region electron density perturbation solely from the VLF-network observations coupled with theoretical modeling.",

            "abstract": "Shoreline change via coastal erosion and accretion is largely influenced by variations in ocean wave climate. Identifying the sources of these variations is challenging because the timing of wave energy delivery varies over multiple timescales within ocean basins. We present the results of an investigation of USACE Wave Information Studies hindcast hourly wave heights, periods, and directions along the North American Atlantic coast from 1980-2012, designed to explore links between wave climate and teleconnection patterns. Trends in median and extreme significant wave heights (SWHs) demonstrate that mean monthly SWHs increased from 1 to 5 cm/yr along the roughly 3000 km reach of study area, with changes in hurricane season waves appearing to be most influential in producing the overall trends. Distributions of SWHs categorized by North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) phase, show that positive-period NAO SWHs are greater than negative-period NAO SWHs along the entire eastern seaboard (25°N to 45°N). The most prominent wave direction off Cape Cod, MA during positive-period NAO is approximately 105°, as compared to approximately 75° during negative-period NAO. Prominent wave directions between Cape Canaveral, FL, and Savannah, GA exhibit a similar shift but during opposite phases of the NAO. The results of this analysis suggest that the atmosphere-ocean interactions associated with contrasting NAO phases can significantly change the wave climate observed offshore along the North American Atlantic coast, altering alongshore wave energy fluxes and sediment transport patterns along the coast.",

            "abstract": "To better delineate a seismic anomaly beneath the eastern flank of the Rio Grande Rift identified by seismic tomography, we depth-migrated Ps and Sp receiver functions using data from the SIEDCAR (Seismic Investigation of Edge Driven Convection Association with Rio Grande Rift) and USArray Transportable Array (TA) deployments. We performed Common Conversion Point (CCP) stacking to improve the S/N ratio of receiver functions.\n Using an incorrect velocity model for depth migration of a stacked CCP image may generate an inaccurate picture of the subsurface. To find sufficiently accurate P- and S-velocity models for migration, we optimize the average correlation value of common receiver gathers for target features – in this case the Moho and the LAB – while perturbing the shear wave velocities in a process driven by simulated annealing. The technique simultaneously finds depths to major discontinuities (in this case the Moho and LAB) and S and P velocity profiles beneath each seismic station in a manner that is similar to velocity analysis in reflection seismology. An application to data acquired in southeastern New Mexico and west Texas, at an average station spacing of 35 km, reveals an abrupt increase in lithospheric thickness from west to east, from the Rio Grande Rift to the Great Plains craton. Previous studies found an elongated high velocity anomaly that extends to depths approaching 500 km in southeastern New Mexico and west Texas that is distinct from the thick Great Plains lithosphere. Our stacked 3-D image confirms the anomaly's existence and shows that it is more laterally extensive than was previously indicated.\nRecent numerical modeling suggests that an abrupt change in lithospheric thickness, which creates a step change in densities, may produce a gravitational instability that leads to thicker mantle lithosphere dripping off into the lower density asthenosphere. As the mantle deforms it alternately thickens and thins the crust, producing topographic anomalies that correlate with the disappearing mantle lithosphere. The northward time progression of rifting, variable width of the rift, and varying elevations and locations of uplifted mountain ranges in the study area allow us to evaluate this mechanism’s role in the evolution of this rift-craton transition.",

            "abstract": "Profiles of soil pore space CO2 and CH4 concentrations are rarely reported, especially from the same soils, yet are important for a number of applications. First, quantifying the component of respired CO2 in the soil pore spaces improves paleosol-based paleo-atmospheric CO2 estimates. Second, profiles can be used to estimate the average depth of biological activity (e.g. respiration and CH4 oxidation). Third, CH4 profiles, by identifying microbial activity, may help distinguish root/rhizosphere respiration from microbial decomposition. Here, we report soil CO2 and CH4 profiles measured at the Semi-Arid Climate Observatory and Laboratory (SACOL) on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) at Lanzhou University, Gansu, China. Soil parent material on the site is mainly Quaternary aeolian loess and classifies as an Entisol.\nSoil respired CO2 (S(z) = soil CO2 – atmospheric CO2) is the most uncertain variable required to reconstruct ancient atmospheric CO2 concentrations from paleosol carbonates. Our direct soil pore space CO2 measurements show that S(z) values varied from ~100ppmV during the spring to ~2200ppmV during the summer. S(z) average 390 ± 30ppmV during May before the summer monsoon begins when soil temperature is increasing, soil water content is at a minimum and pedogenic carbonate may be forming. This value lies in the range of S(z) values previously estimated for surface Inceptisols (300 ± 100ppmV, Breecker 2013) and is lower than Pleistocene CLP paleosols (Da et al.,2015) in similar parent material. Our direct measurements of soil pore space CO2 thus support these previous independent S(z) estimates.\nWe also investigate the average depth of CH4 oxidation and soil respiration, which range from 3-10cm and at least 20cm, respectively, using the shapes of soil gas profiles. Fitting observed soil CO2 and CH4 profiles with a production-diffusion model show that the average depth of CH4 oxidation was always at least 10 cm shallower than the average depth of respiration. This is likely the result of deeper average depths of root respiration than microbial activity. If soil specific relationships between methane oxidation and microbial respiration can be developed, then soil CH4 profiles might help quantify the rate and depth of root respiration.",

TOA and surface flux products are provided for each CERES footprint (Single Scanner Footprint – SSF) and also time integrated and spatially averaged (TISA) to provide global daily averaged quantities.\nDespite the use of the most recently available calibration coefficients and operational inputs that are different from CERES formal climate quality data products, FLASHFlux has been found to provide results that compare very favorably with the CERES results. The TISA results from the FLASHFlux highly parameterized models are compared to the surface fluxes from CERES-EBAF, which uses a radiative transfer model, for the time period when both products are available. The FLASHFlux surface data products also have been found to give accurate surface flux results when compared to ground measurements.\nWe present validation of both footprint-level and time-space averaged surface fluxes against ground measurements. Validation is done for both longwave (LW) and shortwave (SW) surface fluxes.

            "abstract": "The study of microbes from the environment is often facilitated by the fixation of samples prior to analyses in the laboratory. Samples not appropriately preserved can show dramatic changes e.g. unwanted growth, loss of biomass and sample degradation between collection and analysis. To move Deep-UV Raman analyses from model lab organisms to environmental samples the effect of preservation must be evaluated.\nDeep UV Raman and Fluorescence (i.e. excitation <250 nm) has been shown capable discriminating various types of microbes as well as giving some information on the growth stage of the culture. The fluorescence signal is typically 3-4 orders of magnitude more intense than the Raman signal and enables rapid location of bacteria on a surface and crudely split them into categories. However it suffers from broad spectral features making discrete classification of bacteria problematic. While a far weaker phenomenon, the chemical specificity of Raman spectroscopy has been shown capable of discriminating between different bacterial species and has even shown spectral variation in same species under differing growth conditions or growth stages and has even been used to measure microbial activity by measuring the incorporation of stable isotope labeled substrates. Typically these analyses are carried out on well-studied, lab-grown model organisms and while relatively easy, these analyses are performed on cells grow under non-environmentally relevant conditions using rich media types not often found in nature.\nHere we show the effect on the Raman and fluorescence signal (248 nm Deep-UV excitation) from E. coli and other bacteria, grown in more nutrient limited environments, and fixed/preserved in ethanol, PFA and formalin. These fixatives not only preserve the cells for spectroscopic analysis but are compatible with many common techniques that can be used for further characterization of environmental microbial samples. Ethanol appears to heavily degrade the signals from both Raman and fluorescence while formalin and PFA do not. Our ultimate goal is to create an analytical “pipeline” using the Deep UV fluorescence and Raman techniques on environmental samples in concert with other non-destructive (e.g. Green 548ex nm Raman) and destructive techniques (e.g. SEM, SIMS and 16S and metagenomic community analyses).",

            "abstract": "Projections of future climate change contain large uncertainties stemming from our inability to confirm long-term trends in climate models with short instrumental records. Fossil corals are an important archive of past climate changes in the tropical oceans as oxygen isotopic ratios (δ18O) in their skeletons reflect ambient ocean temperature and salinity during the time they grew. In particular, El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a natural phenomenon with a complex array of sensitivities to climate change, rendering any future projections of its variability highly uncertain. The long-term behavior of ENSO and lower-frequency Pacific climate variability is recorded by annually banded fossil corals, providing insight into both natural and anthropogenic climate changes in this under-sampled region (Hughen et al. 1999; Tudhope et al. 2001; Cobb et al. 2003; Cobb et al. 2013). To date, most coral-based reconstructions have utilized cores from the genus Porites, owing its regular, concentric growth bands and fast growth-rates that allow for the generation of up to 20 samples per year of coral growth. However, this genus is neither evenly distributed across the tropics nor continuously available within the fossil record, so there is a pressing need to expand the types of corals available for reconstruction. Here, we test Favia species from Kiritimati Island (2°N, 157°W) as a paleoclimate recorder by comparing different δ18O timeseries from within a single coral as well as across multiple corals with instrumental sea-surface temperature (SST). We find significant and consistent differences between coral δ18O profiles sampled along thecal versus septa walls, and show that δ18O in the thecal wall is more reproducible, and more coherent with SST. Slow growth rates (8-10mm/yr), and small inter-colony δ18O offsets suggest that Favia may be an untapped climate archive that is capable of providing robust constraints on natural climate variability in the tropical Pacific. Applying our sampling protocols to two fossil Favia corals from the early 19th century, we demonstrate that high-resolution, accurate reconstructions of ENSO and mean climate in the central tropical Pacific are achievable with Favia corals.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - tmp_824-2015_AGU770440369.pdf\nMany calderas have a history of repeated caldera-forming eruptions, interspersed with periods of more minor activity. Rabaul, for instance, has had at least 11 ignimbrite-forming eruptions over the last 200 ky. The most recent of these was the ‘1400 BP’ eruption, which led to caldera collapse. Since then, there has been multiple smaller eruptions, including the ongoing activity from Tavurvur and Vulcan. An important question facing volcanology today is what controls the size of eruptions at calderas such as Rabaul.\nDetailed stratigraphic sampling of the 1400BP eruption reveals that prior to eruption, the magma reservoir below Rabaul contained a well-mixed dacite with whole-rock SiO2 contents of 65.0–66.4 wt%. The dacite contains a single phenocryst assemblage of plag (An44–52), cpx (En43–46Fs13–15Wo40–41), opx (En69–71Fs25–28Wo3) and magnetite, along with minor apatite. The homogeneity of the dacite is underscored by the narrow range of compositions of both the matrix glass and the melt inclusions (67.8–69.0 wt% SiO2). The only exception to this is at the top of the ignimbrite, representing some of the last magma to have been withdrawn. Dispersed throughout the dacitic pumices are darker, more mafic blebs. Streaks of mingled magma with a range of SiO2 contents, down to 59.9 wt% SiO2 are also found in the pumice, suggesting that a mafic recharge magma was intruded into the base of the reservoir shortly before eruption. High TiO2 contents rule out the direct involvement of basalt, and instead imply the magma that intruded into the reservoir was an andesite with at least 56 wt% SiO2. Phenocrysts related to this recharge magma are rare, and the crystals found in the dark blebs are identical in composition to those found in the dacite, indicating that the recharge was aphyric.\nThe present-day, post-caldera recharge magma is different to the pre-1400 BP recharge magma: it is basaltic. This suggests that the plumbing system of Rabaul is different during the pre-caldera and post-caldera stages of the caldera cycle. Currently, basaltic magma can reach shallow levels of the plumbing system, and even make it to the surface as enclaves. Prior to a large, caldera-forming eruption, however, any basaltic magma that enters the system gets trapped at depth. This allows a large reservoir of evolved magma to develop.",

            "abstract": "It is well known that hydroxyl radicals (OH) act as a dominant reactive species in the degradation of VOCs in the atmosphere. In recent field studies, directly measured total OH reactivity often showed poor agreement with OH reactivity calculated from VOC measurements (e.g. Nölscher et al., 2013; Lu et al., 2012a). This “missing OH reactivity” is attributed to unaccounted biogenic VOC emissions and/or oxidation products. The comparison of total OH reactivity being directly measured and calculated from single component measurements of VOCs and their oxidation products gives us a further understanding on the source of unmeasured reactive species in the atmosphere. This allows also the determination of the magnitude of the contribution of primary VOC emissions and their oxidation products to the missing OH reactivity.\nA series of experiments was carried out in the atmosphere simulation chamber SAPHIR in Jülich, Germany, to explore in detail the photochemical degradation of VOCs (isoprene, ß-pinene, limonene, and D6-benzene) by OH. The total OH reactivity was determined from the measurement of VOCs and their oxidation products by a Proton Transfer Reaction Time of Flight Mass Spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS) with a GC/MS/FID system, and directly measured by a laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) at the same time. The comparison between these two total OH reactivity measurements showed an increase of missing OH reactivity in the presence of oxidation products of VOCs, indicating a strong contribution to missing OH reactivity from uncharacterized oxidation products.",

New environmental reconstructions from stable carbon isotope ratios of preserved organic matter (δ13Corg), atmospheric pCO2 data based on the δ13C of soil carbonate, palynological, and wildfire data from charcoal from early dinosaur-bearing strata at low paleolatitudes in western North America show that variations in δ13Corg and palynomorph ecotypes are tightly correlated, displaying large and high-frequency excursions. These variations occurred within an environment characterized by elevated and increasing atmospheric pCO2, pervasive wildfires, and rapidly fluctuating extreme climatic conditions. Whereas pseudosuchian archosaur-dominated communities were able to persist in these same regions until the end-Triassic, the large-bodied, fast-growing tachymetabolic dinosaurian herbivores were not. We hypothesize that the greater resources required by the herbivores made it difficult from them to adapt to the unstable conditions at low paleolatitudes in the Late Triassic.",

VIRTIS-M uses a slit and a scan mirror to generate images with spatial resolution of 250 μrad over a FOV of 3.7°. The second channel is VIRTIS-H (H for High-resolution), a point spectrometer with high spectral resolution (λ/Δλ=3000 @3μm) in the range 2-5 μm.\nThe nucleus observations have been performed in a wide range of conditions with best spatial resolution of 2.5m. The surface temperature has been determined since the first distant observations when the nucleus filled one single VIRTIS-M pixel and continuously monitored since. Maximum temperature determined until April 2015 are as high as 300K at the subsolar point. Modeling of the thermophysical properties allowed to derive the thermal inertia of the crust.\nThe VIRTIS composition analysis has showed evidence of carbon-bearing compounds on the nucleus of the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. The very low reflectance of the nucleus (normal albedo of 0.060 ± 0.003 at 0.55 µm), the spectral slopes in VIS and IR ranges (5-25 and 1.5-5 % kÅ-1) and the broad absorption feature in the 2.9-3.6 µm range present across the entire illuminated surface, are compatible with a surface crust made of a complex mixture of dark disordered poly-aromatic compounds, opaque minerals and several chemical species containing: -COOH, CH2 / CH3, -OH (in Alcohols) and possibly NH4+.\nBoth channels are contributing to the determination of the spatial distribution of H2O and CO2 in the coma; their abundances as a function of altitude and of time of day.\nAuthors acknowledge the support from national funding agencies.",

            "abstract": "Airborne electromagnetics (EM) is in many ways undergoing the same type rapid technological development as seen in the telecommunication industry. These developments are driven by a steadily increasing demand for exploration of minerals, groundwater and geotechnical targets. The latter two areas demand shallow and accurate resolution of the near surface geology in terms of both resistivity and spatial delineation of the sedimentary layers.\nAirborne EM systems measure the grounds electromagnetic response when subject to either a continuous discrete sinusoidal transmitter signal (frequency domain) or by measuring the decay of currents induced in the ground by rapid transmission of transient pulses (time domain). In the last decade almost all new developments of both instrument hardware and data processing techniques has focused around time domain systems.\nHere we present a concept for measuring the time domain response even before the transient transmitter current has been turned off. Our approach relies on a combination of new instrument hardware and novel modeling algorithms. The newly developed hardware allows for measuring the instruments complete transfer function which is convolved with the synthetic earth response in the inversion algorithm. The effect is that earth response data measured while the transmitter current is turned off can be included in the inversion, significantly increasing the amount of available information.\nWe demonstrate the technique using both synthetic and field data. The synthetic examples provide insight on the physics during the turn off process and the field examples document the robustness of the method. Geological near surface structures can now be resolved to a degree that is unprecedented to the best of our knowledge, making airborne EM even more attractive and cost-effective for exploration of water and minerals that are crucial for the function of our societies.",

These alluvial sediments host aquifers which are thought to provide important “hot spots” and “hot moments” for microbiological activity controlling organic carbon processing and fluxes in the subsurface. Relatively little is known about the clay mineralogy of these alluvial aquifers and the parent alluvial sediments in spite of the fact that they commonly include lenses of silt-clay materials. These lenses are typically more reduced than coarser grained materials, but zones of reduced and more oxidized materials are present in these alluvial aquifer sediments. The clay mineralogy of the non-reduced parent alluvial sediments of the alluvial aquifer located in Rifle, CO (USA) is composed of chlorite, smectite, illite, kaolinite and quartz. The clay mineralogy of non-reduced fine-grained materials at Rifle are composed of the same suite of minerals found in the sediments plus a vermiculite-smectite intergrade that occurs near the bottom of the aquifer near the top of the Wasatch Formation. The clay mineral assemblages of the system reflect the mineralogically immature character of the source sediments. These assemblages are consistent with sediments and soils that formed in a moderately low rainfall climate and suggestive of minimal transport of the alluvial sediments from their source areas. Chlorite, smectite, smectite-vermiculite intergrade, and illite are the likely phases involved in the sorption of organic carbon and related microbial redox transformations of metals in these sediments. Both the occurrence and abundance of chlorite, smectite-vermiculite, illite and smectite can therefore exert an important control on the contaminant fluxes and are important determinants of biogeofacies in mountainous, semiarid terrains.",

            "abstract": "We report results of an experimental investigation into the effects of small-scale (mm-cm) heterogeneities and hydrodynamic dispersion on miscible and immiscible displacements in a Berea Sandstone core. Pulse-radiotracer tests were carried out by measuring breakthrough curves at distinct flow rates and gas/water saturation ratios, while simultaneously imaging the internal displacement of the radioactive solution by [11C]PET. Dynamic multidimensional maps of the tracer concentration in the rock sample have been obtained with a spatial resolution of about 10 mm3 and provide evidence for significant macrodispersion effects caused by the presence of heterogeneities at the same scale. The numerical solution of the classic Advection-Dispersion Equation (ADE) applied in 1D form fails to describe the measured breakthrough curves and significantly overestimates longitudinal dispersivity. An excellent agreement with the experiments is attained by explicitly accounting for permeability heterogeneity, while reducing the contribution of “Fickian\" dispersivity. Heterogeneity was introduced in the model by discretising the rock sample into independent parallel streamlines, which were generated based on a previously determined 3D permeability map, and by solving the 1D ADE for each of them. The use of streamlines is supported by direct quantitative observations from the PET scans; remarkably, this approach leads to an accurate representation of both the temporal behaviour and spatial distribution of the tracer concentration in the sample. It is shown that when the length-scale of permeability variations is similar in order as the size of the sample, the effect of the former can be as significant as hydrodynamic dispersion. The presence of a second immiscible fluid phase further complicates the flow field and, accordingly, the interpretation of the experiments. The ability to decouple these effects leads to the estimation of dispersion coefficients that aren't sample specific and are therefore better suited for up-scaling fluid mixing and dispersion in rocks. In this context, PET provides significant opportunities to advance our understanding of fluids displacements in rocks, thus including complex flows that involve additional phenomena, such as adsorption and chemical reactions.",

The management of water resources, by means of e.g. flow diversions and dams, for industrial, agricultural, water-supply, hydropower production and flood protection purposes induces significant changes to the natural streamflow regime of a river. Indeed, the river flow regime is known to be a major abiotic factor influencing fluvial ecosystems. An established approach aimed at preserving the behaviour and distribution of fluvial species relies on the definition of minimum streamflow requirements (i.e., environmental flows) downstream of dams and diversion structures. Such environmental flows are normally identified through methodologies that have an empirical nature and may not be representative of local ecological and hydraulic conditions. While the effect of imposing a minimum discharge release is easily predictable in terms of e.g. loss of hydropower production, the advantages in terms of species preferences are often poorly understood and seldom assessed. To analyze the interactions between flow releases and the behaviour and distribution of fluvial species (i.e., from periphyton, to benthic invertebrate and fish), one may use a habitat suitability curve, which is a fundamental tool capable of describing species preferences influenced by any generic environmental variable. The outcomes of a real case study applied to several Italian rivers, located in the Marche administrative district in Central Italy (∽10000km2), in which we quantitatively assess the effects of alternative environmental flow scenarios on the existing hydropower network and on two fish species that are quite abundant in the study area (i.e., Leuciscus cephalus cabeda and Barbus barbus plebejus), will be presented and discussed. The proposed analysis, which can be easily adapted to different riparian habitats and hydrological contexts, is a useful tool to guide the derivation of optimal water resource management strategies in order to ensure both hydropower production and fluvial ecosystem protection.",

Studies have shown that fluids circulating within the crust are minimally altered from original seawater, making this subsurface environment a unique natural experiment in which the fate of marine organic matter and the limitations of microbial adaptability in the context of reduced carbon supply can be examined. To make the subsurface crustal aquifer accessible, two CORK (Circulation Obviation Retrofit Kit) observatories have been installed at North Pond, a sediment-filled depression beneath the oligotrophic Sargasso Sea. Radiocarbon analysis of dissolved inorganic (DIC) and organic carbon (DOC) in samples recovered from these observatories show uncoupled aging between DOC and DIC with Δ14C values of DOC as low as -933‰ despite isolation from the open ocean for, at most, 2,100 years. This extreme value is part of a general trend of decreasing DOC δ13C and Δ14C values with increasing incubation time within the aquifer. Combined with reduced concentrations of DOC, our results argue for selective microbial oxidation of the youngest, most 13C-enriched components of downwelled DOC, possibly identifying these as characteristics of the more bioavailable fractions of deep-ocean dissolved organic matter. They also suggest that microbial oxidation during low-temperature hydrothermal circulation could be an important sink for aged marine dissolved organic matter.",

            "abstract": "Seismic tomography can be used to investigate radial viscosity variations on instantaneous flow models by predicting the global geoid and comparing with the observed geoid. This method is one of many that has been used to constrain viscosity structure in the Earth's mantle in the last few decades. Using the 3D mantle convection model, Stag-YY (e.g., Hernlund and Tackley, 2008), we are further able to explore the effect of lateral variations in viscosity in addition to the radial variations. Examining over 50 tomographic models we found notable differences by comparing a synthetically produced geoid with the observed geoid. Comparing S- and P-wave tomographic models, the S-wave models provided a better fit to the observed geoid. Using this large suite of 50 tomographic models, we have been able to constrain the radial viscosity structure of the Earth. We found that two types of viscosity profiles yielded equally good fits. A viscosity profile with a low transition zone viscosity and a lower mantle viscosity equal to the upper mantle, or a profile with a large lower mantle viscosity and a transition zone viscosity similar to the upper mantle. Using the set of radial viscosity profiles that gave the best fit to the observed geoid, we can explore a range of lateral viscosity variations and see how they affect the different types of tomographic models. Improving on previous studies of lateral viscosity variations (e.g. Ghosh, Becker and Zhong, 2010), we systematically explore a large range of tomographic models and density-velocity conversion factors. We explore which type of tomographic model (S- or P- wave) is more strongly affected by lateral viscosity variations, as well as the effect on isotropic and anisotropic models. We constrain the strength of lateral viscosity variations necessary to produce a high correlation between observed and predicted geoid anomalies. We will discuss the wavelength of flow that is most affected by the lateral viscosity variations.\nREFERENCES\nHernlund, J. W. and Tackley, P. J., 2008.

Their behavior can be observed or modelled spatially at various resolutions. In this work, a deterministic point of view is adopted to analyze multi-scale behavior taking a set of ordinary differential equation (ODE) as elementary part of the system.\nTo perform analyses, scenes of study are thus generated based on ensembles of identical elementary ODE systems. Without any loss of generality, their dynamics is chosen chaotic in order to ensure sensitivity to initial conditions, that is, one fundamental property of atmosphere under instable conditions [1]. The Rössler system [2] is used for this purpose for both its topological and algebraic simplicity [3,4].\nTwo cases are thus considered: the chaotic oscillators composing the scene of study are taken either independent, or in phase synchronization. Scale behaviors are analyzed considering the scene of study as aggregations (basically obtained by spatially averaging the signal) or as associations (obtained by concatenating the time series). The global modeling technique is used to perform the numerical analyses [5].\nOne important result of this work is that, under phase synchronization, a scene of aggregated dynamics can be approximated by the elementary system composing the scene, but modifying its parameterization [6]. This is shown based on numerical analyses. It is then demonstrated analytically and generalized to a larger class of ODE systems.

The 3D seismic data newly acquired show that Baiyun basin is an asymmetric half graben mainly controlled by a set of north-dipping normal faults converging in deep. By employing the principle of back-stripping, we estimate the fault dips and slip amount would be in the absence of post-rift sediments and seawater loading. Results show these Middle Eocene faults were extremely active, with a high accumulation horizontal displacement (＞ 10 km) and an initial very low angle (＜7°), followed by a rotated into sub-horizontal. A general scenario for extension of the uppermost continental crust probably includes simultaneous operation of low angle normal fault (F1) as well as parallel arrays of step-faults (domino-faults, f2-f9). Under such a scenario, it shows no obvious extension discrepancy in Baiyun basin. Our results indicate that Baiyun sag preserves information recording the continent thinning before the seafloor spreading, and it could be an abandoned inner rifted basin.",

            "abstract": "A major challenge for spaceborne observations of ocean color is to correct for atmospheric scattering, which typically contributes ≥85% to the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiance and varies substantially with aerosols. Ocean color missions traditionally analyze TOA radiance in the near-infrared (NIR), where the ocean is black, to constrain the TOA atmospheric scattering in the visible (VIS). However, this procedure is limited by insufficient sensitivity of NIR radiance to absorption and vertical distribution of aerosols, and by uncertainties in the extrapolation of aerosol properties from the NIR to the VIS.\nTo improve atmospheric correction for ocean color observations, one needs to change the traditional procedure for this correction and/or increase the aerosol information. The instruments proposed to increase the aerosol information content for the Pre-Aerosol, Clouds, and ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission include ultraviolet and Oxygen A-band observations, as well as multispectral and multiangle polarimetry. However few systematic studies have been performed to quantify the improvement such measurements bring to atmospheric correction.\nTo study the polarimetric atmospheric correction capabilities of PACE-like instruments, we conducted field experiments off the Coast of California to obtain high-altitude (65,000 ft) and ship-based observations of water-leaving radiance. The airborne data sets consist of hyperspectral radiance between 380-2500 nm by the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer, and multi-spectral multi-angle polarimetric data between 410-2250 nm by the Research Scanning Polarimeter. We discuss examples of retrieved atmosphere and ocean state vectors, and of corresponding ocean color spectra obtained by subtracting the computed atmospheric scattering contribution from the high-altitude radiance measurements. The ocean color spectra thus obtained are compared with those measured from the ship.",

It is generally tuned to maintain overall statistical 'reliability' in ensemble forecasts. However, for ensemble forecast systems to be worthwhile, they must be reliable in a flow-dependent sense too. Non-linear interactions make the root causes of deficiencies in such flow-dependent reliability more difficult to trace at forecast ranges >2 days, and so we discuss a new diagnostic that can be applied at the short ranges associated with data assimilation. Results demonstrate that the current stochastic physics scheme in the ECMWF model may be over-active in sub-tropical anticyclone regions, where mid-tropospheric meteorology is largely a balance between time-mean decent and radiative cooling. On the other hand, the stochastic physics may be under-active in convective regions. This later result has implications for the prediction of heightened forecast uncertainty over Europe following mesoscale convection over North America. The success in localising deficienices in stochastic physics suggests that this diagnostic it will be useful for the future assessment of more stochastically-formulated physical parametrizations in future.",

Previous study indicates that in the absence of careful management, consequences to rivers downstream of diversion hydropower dams can be severe. However, patterns of hydrologic alteration below diversion hydropower dams have not been well described. In addition, diversion hydropower projects typically require some form of sediment management to maintain relatively small impoundments at diversion sites. Investigation of principal coupled processes, notably flow and sediment dynamics, in the context of alteration by diversion schemes may elucidate potential for working with natural processes to mitigate consequences to rivers.\nThis analysis characterizes hydrologic alteration by diversion hydropower dams, investigating flows below 31 diversion dams. Diversion for hydropower production generated distinctive signatures of hydrologic alteration in sample rivers. For instance, flow signals were characterized by reduced low to moderate flows and steep transitions between low and high stages. In a number of rivers, small floods were reduced in number and size. However, effect to magnitude and timing of large floods was minimal across all rivers investigated. Sediments were stored in impoundments and released in pulses annually through lower sediment gates. The hydrologic signatures observed were strongly linked to diversion designs and may be transferable to other rivers developed with similar infrastructure.\nUnderstanding characteristic flow alterations due to diversion hydropower, in combination with cycles of sediment storage and release, may inform management practices for simultaneously maintaining reservoirs and downstream channels. In particular, investigating altered flood magnitudes and frequencies in the context of geomorphic work may indicate potential for maintaining natural hydrogeomorphic processes. Detailed study of sediment pulse transport under the characteristic modified flow regime is necessary to inform recommendations for integrating flow and sediment releases below diversion dams.",

These measurements support previous laboratory experiments showing a fast photochemical loss of nitrate from collected urban grime upon illumination with simulated sunlight.

            "abstract": "There is a clear need for observation-based methodologies to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) at diverse spatial domains. The ALEXI methodology (Atmosphere Land Exchange Inverse) is a thermal-based implementation of the two-source energy balance method and provides one of the most direct estimates of actual ET. A unique aspect of ALEXI is that it integrates measurements at multiple spatial scales. It is used to estimate crop water use (field scale), as an early indicator of agricultural drought (regional scale), and at continental to global scales to study hydrological impacts of climate variations and land-use change.\nUp to now, the thermal input to ALEXI has always been based on thermal infrared radiometers, which give the most direct measurement of physical land surface temperature (LST). However, because TIR is blocked by clouds, the dependence on TIR has limited ALEXI to clear sky conditions and made the accuracy dependant on the efficacy of cloud masking. Passive microwave (MW) methods to estimate LST could help to overcome this limitation and provide a more cloud tolerant alternative to existing TIR-based techniques. This paper builds on recent progress in characterizing the main structural differences between TIR LST and MW Ka-band observations, the MW frequency that is most suitable for LST sensing. By accounting for differences in diurnal timing (phase lag with solar noon), amplitude, and emissivity we constructed a MW-based LST dataset that matches the diurnal characteristics of the TIR-based LSA SAF LST record. This new global dataset of MW-based LST currently spans the period of 2003-2013 with a 0.25 degree spatial- and 15-minute temporal resolution.\nAs a first test of the functioning of this MW-based LST within the ALEXI framework we ran two parallel implementations of ALEXI: one with the TIR-LST from geostationary MSG satellite as in previous work, and one with the new MW-LST. The MW-LST is treated exactly as the TIR-based LST to calculate the temperature rate of change in the morning hours – no other changes to the ALEXI framework are made. This paper presents an analysis of the clear sky ET estimates for the years 2003-2013. We will explore the level of agreement between the MW- and TIR-based ET and the utility of the MW-ET to add additional cloud screening capability to TIR observations.",

In west central Kyushu, long active fault zone named as Beppu – Haneyama Fault zone runs with E-W direction normal fault zone. The southwest boundary of Beppu Bay is a part of Beppu-Haneyama Fault zone and normal fault of pull apart basin.\n The multi beam sonic data show the characteristic altitude distribution (topography) of steep inclining slope from shore side to the deepest part with 70m below sea level along the coast, and also submarine slidings occurred at off Beppu and off Oita. Within those areas, several blocks of more than 100m has preserved shape and developed to sliding direction. From the viewpoint of sliding topography, sliding movements are thought sector collapse during short interval, and main cause is thought the movement of directly below active fault and related strong seismic motion.\nThe sonic prospecting data show several reflection horizons indicating volcanic ashes and sand seams. Around two submarine sliding deposit areas, continuation of clear reflections are sparse influenced by event sedimentation and thick coarse sediments.\n88 m sediment cores from 7 sites (core length: 8m to 20m long per site) from deepest part and submarine sliding area in late July this year (2015) will make clear that construction age of these topography and construction mechanism from lithological characteristics, and comparison to historical record including large earthquake occurred in 1596.",

            "abstract": "A novel data assimilation framework is evaluated that assimilates passive microwave (PMW) brightness temperature (Tb) observations into an advanced land surface model for the purpose of improving snow depth and snow water equivalent (SWE) estimates across regional- and continental-scales. The multifrequency, multipolarization framework employs machine learning algorithms to predict PMW Tb as a function of land surface model state information and subsequently merges the predicted PMW Tb with observed PMW Tb from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E). The merging procedure is predicated on conditional probabilities computed within a Bayesian statistical framework using either an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) or an Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EnKS). The data assimilation routine produces a conditioned (updated) estimate of modeled SWE that is more accurate and contains less uncertainty than the model without assimilation.\nA synthetic case study is presented for select locations in North America that compares model results with and without assimilation against synthetic observations of snow depth and SWE. It is shown that the data assimilation framework improves modeled estimates of snow depth and SWE during both the accumulation and ablation phases of the snow season. Further, it is demonstrated that the EnKS outperforms the EnKF implementation due to its ability to better modulate high frequency noise into the conditioned estimates. The overarching findings from this study demonstrate the feasibility of machine learning algorithms for use as an observation model operator within a data assimilation framework in order to improve model estimates of snow depth and SWE across regional- and continental-scales.",

            "abstract": "Assessing the climate of Canadian Arctic region is challenging since few meteorological records are available. Interpolated gridded datasets are also of limited use because network density was historically small and resulting values strongly depend on the interpolation method. Reanalysis therefore represent an interesting alternative. The objective of this study was to analyze the performance of reanalysis to represent the precipitation for Canada and especially for the Canadian Arctic.\nThree reanalysis were considered: ERA-Interim, MERRA and CFSR. Annual and monthly precipitations series from these reanalysis were compared to corresponding series from record stations (approximately 1 500 stations across Canada with a few hundreds stations in Northern Canada). Reanalysis grid-box closest to a given station was considered for the comparison. Mean Square Errors (MSE), bias, Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and ratio of variances between precipitation series from each pair station/reanalysis were estimated. These indicators have been used in order to assess the performance of reanalysis to reproduce the sequence of annual and monthly precipitation series. Results shown that, globally, ERA-Interim led to the smallest PCC, followed by MERRA and CFSR for annual precipitation series. All three reanalysis displayed large biases.\nA simple post-treatment method was then applied to the reanalysis series. It was first applied at local scale considering each pair of station/reanalysis. Improvement in MSE and PCC values using post-treated series were significant. In order to be able to use the reanalysis at gird-boxes where no station is available, a regional version of this post-treatment was implemented. This regional version consisted in the estimation of optimal mean regional values of post-treated parameters. Assessment of the performance of this regional post-treatment method was made using cross-validation.",

            "abstract": "For freshwater ecosystems, lakes are the largest contributors of CH4 emissions to atmosphere and may offset the terrestrial land sink. Strong uncertainties remain concerning the driving factors of such emissions. In this study, we compiled literature data on CH4 emission in lakes and we collected ancillary data related to methodology, climate, landscape or lake characteristic. We used studies measuring one or more emission pathways from open waters (i.e. diffusive, ebullitive and storage fluxes), all over the world. Relationships between CH4 emissions, environmental variables, lake characteristics and methodological approaches were investigated through stepwise linear regression and regression trees analysis. Our analysis showed that diffusive flux was the most frequently estimated assuming that others were negligible and considering it as a good surrogate for the total flux. However, when the three forms of open water fluxes were estimated, assuming that diffusive flux is a good surrogate for the total flux would have lead to a 600% underestimation. Differences in environmental variables related to climatic conditions both at regional scale (climatic zone), or at local scale (air temperature, precipitation), induced significant differences in CH4 estimations with higher emissions when temperature was high. Surrounding landscapes were also a significant driver with higher emissions where lakes were located within anthropized areas (urban zones or croplands). We also observed that DOC concentration was positively related to total, diffusive and storage CH4 pathway emissions. Finally we could highlight that methodological approaches related to differences in estimation methods influenced significantly all the pathway emissions that present different methods to obtain estimation values (total, diffusive and ebulitive fluxes). We conclude that the most estimated pathway of CH4 emission from open waters is the less important contributor to total flux from lakes inducing great underestimation of the total emission at regional or global scale. Besides environmental and lake characteristics variables, the methods used to estimate CH4 fluxes should also be considered as a significant source of the great differences observed in estimation fluxes between lakes.",

            "abstract": "Current generation sensors suites such as those included on the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission, Aquarius, and Soil Moisture Active / Passive (SMAP) exploit a combination to provide a greater understanding of geophysical phenomena. While “operationalized” retrieval algorithms require fast forward models, the ability to perform higher fidelity simulations is necessary for understanding the physics of remote sensing problems to test assumptions and to develop parameterizations for the fast models. To ensure proper synergy between active and passive modeling, forward models must be consistent between the two sensor types. This work presents a self-consistent active and passive radiative transfer model for simulating radar and radiometer responses to precipitation.\nTo accomplish this, we extend the Atmospheric Radiative Transfer Simulator (ARTS) version 2.3 to solve the radiative transfer equation for radar under multiple scattering conditions using Monte Carlo integration. Early versions of ARTS (1.1 and later) included a passive Monte Carlo solver, and ARTS is capable of handling atmospheres of up to three dimensions with ellipsoidal planetary geometries. The modular nature of ARTS facilitates extensibility, and the well-developed ray-tracing tools are suited for implementation of Monte Carlo algorithms. Finally, since ARTS handles the full Stokes vector, co- and cross-polarized reflectivity products are possible for scenarios that include nonspherical particles, with or without preferential alignment.\nThe accuracy of the forward model will be demonstrated, and the effects of multiple scattering will be detailed. The three-dimensional nature of the radiative transfer model will be useful for understanding the effects of nonuniform beamfill and multiple scattering for spatially heterogeneous precipitation events. This targets of this forward model are GPM (the Dual-wavelength Precipitation Radar (DPR) and GPM Microwave Imager (GMI)) and airborne sensors used in GPM-supporting ground validation missions.",

To obtain a more detailed picture of the seismicity of the region, an array of 34 ocean bottom seismometers (OBSs) was deployed to record continuous waveform data off the coast of Southern California for 12 months (2010-2011) as part of the ALBACORE (Asthenospheric and Lithospheric Broadband Architecture from the California Offshore Region Experiment) project. To obtain a local event catalog based on OBS data, we make use of a newly developed data processing platform based on Python. The data processing procedure comprises a multi-step analysis that starts with the identification of significant signals above the time-adjusted noise floor for each sensor. This is followed by a time-dependent statistical estimate of the likelihood of an earthquake based on the aggregated signals in the array. For periods with elevated event likelihood, an adaptive grid-fitting procedure is used that yields candidate earthquake hypocenters with confidence estimates that best match the observed sensor signals. The results are validated with synthetic travel times and manual picks. Using results from ALBACORE, we have created a more complete view of active faulting in the California Borderland.",

Users can keep visions private, share them with self-defined groups of other users, or distribute them publicly. Users can also propose “challenges” – specific desired states of metrics for specific parts of the city – and others can post visions in response.

            "abstract": "Large geodetically resolved Slow Slip Events (SSE) beneath the Nicoya Peninsula in Costa Rica have been occurring every 21 months +/- 6 months since the installation of continuous GPS stations in 2003, with smaller shallow events occurring irregularly in between. This recurrence interval appears to continue after the 2012 Nicoya M 7.6 earthquake that ruptured a strongly locked patch [Protti et al., 2014, Xue et al., 2015] located between two recurring and well-imaged regions of shallow and deep slow slip. The most recent SSE began in February of 2014, ~17 months after the Nicoya earthquake and 21 months after the start of an earthquake preceding SSE. Despite the observed regularity in time, the characteristics of the individual SSEs vary greatly, with some having shallow or deep slip dominate and others having a more equal distribution of both shallow and deep slip.\nWe use a modified version of the Extended Network Inversion Filter [e.g. McGuire and Segall, 2003] (ENIF) to identify time dependent characteristics of SSEs before and after the 2012 Nicoya earthquake. Slip in the distinct shallow and deep patches appears to be closely related although not coincident in time, deep slip is slightly delayed compared to the onset of shallow slip for events in 2007 and 2009. Distinct migration both along dip and strike are observed. Further, the ability of the filter to distinguish signal from noise, has allowed for resolution of subtle slip rate variations during the SSEs that correlate reasonably well with previously identified tremor rate [Walter et al , 2011]. Such correlation is less clear in space, possibly due to a combination of uncertainty in tremor locations and inversion regularization. Some coincident migration of slip and tremor did occur during the 2007 event. Investigation of time-dependent slip behaviors of other events is still in progress. A preliminary static inversion of the 2014 event indicates an absence of slip in the shallow slow slip patch that was active during the 2007, 2009 and 2012 SSEs, suggesting a possible change in slip behavior following the 2012 earthquake although not in recurrence interval.",

            "abstract": "In May 2015, we conducted a cruise across the northern Gulf of California, an area of continental rift basin formation and rapid deposition of sediments. The cruise was undertaken aboard the R/V Alpha Helix; our goal was to study variation in superficial conductive heat flow, lateral changes in the shallow thermal conductivity structure, and advective transport of heat across the Wagner basin. We used a Fielax heat flow probe with 22 thermistors that can penetrate up to 6 m into the sediment cover. The resulting data set includes 53 new heat flow measurements collected along three profiles. The longest profile (42 km) contains 30 measurements spaced 1-2 km apart. The western part of the Wagner basin (hanging wall block) exhibit low to normal conductive heat flow whereas the eastern part of the basin (foot wall block) heat flow is high to very high (up to 2500 mWm-2). Two other short profiles (12 km long each) focused on resolving an extremely high heat flow anomaly up to 15 Wm-2 located near the intersection between the Wagner bounding fault system and the Cerro Prieto fault. We hypothesize that the contrasting heat flow values observed across the Wagner basin are due to horizontal water circulation through sand layers and fault pathways of high permeability. Circulation appears to be from west (recharge zone) to east (discharge zone). Additionally, our results reveal strong vertical advection of heat due to dehydration reactions and compaction of fine grained sediments.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we researched the annual radiocesium balance in dam reservoir after the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant accident, to evaluate the retention function of radiocesium. We investigated at two reservoirs of different contamination level of radiocesium: Matsugabo dam on Uda river, and Yokokawa dam on Ota river, and 137Cs was continuously monitored in inflow river water and discharged water from January to December in 2014. Particulate and dissolved 137Cs concentration was measured by the cartridge filter method (Tsuji et al., 2014; Yasutaka et al., 2014) once or twice a month, and concentration of suspended solid was calculated by converting the turbidity measured at intervals of 5-10 minutes. Inflow and outflow rate data were contributed by each dam controlling office.\nAs a result of 137Cs concentration, 137Cs in suspended solid in discharged water remarkably decreased at Matsugabo dam, probably due to the effect of decontamination in upper catchment. On the other hand at Yokokawa dam, decontamination in upper catchment had not been proceeding, 137Cs in suspended solid in discharged water did not decrease. For both reservoir, fluctuating tendency of dissolved 137Cs was observed in inflow and discharged water throughout one year.\nAs to 137Cs balance, at Matsugabo dam, 6.6×108 Bq of dissolved 137Cs and 4.1×109 Bq of particulate 137Cs flowed into the reservoir, 5.7×108 Bq of dissolved 137Cs and 3.0×108 Bq of 137Cs was discharged in 2014. At Yokokawa dam, 3.7×1010 Bq of dissolved 137Cs and 1.3×1011 Bq of particulate 137Cs flowed into, 3.3×1010 Bq of dissolved 137Cs and 1.2×1010 Bq of particulate 137Cs was discharged. In both cases, in spite of the different 137Cs contamination level, although particulate radiocesium storage in the both dam was accumulative, the discharge load of radiocesium as dissolved form did not increase.",

            "abstract": "The majority of the world’s wetlands (~64%) are located in tropical and subtropical humid regions and it is estimated that 47-89% (median 73%) of global wetland methane (CH4) emissions originate in the tropics. While extensive research has been conducted in northern zones to understand biogeochemical controls on wetland CH4 emissions, little research has been conducted across tropical regions. We investigated anaerobic and aerobic CH4 cycling dynamics across a variety of ecosystem types in Gabon, Africa using a combination of in-situ field measurements and controlled laboratory incubations. We found African landscapes to possess highly variable CH4 flux rates both within and across ecosystems, with sources producing up to 155 mmol CH4/m2/day and sinks consuming as much as 53 mmol CH4/m2/day. Gabonese wetlands have CH4 production rates 1-6 orders of magnitude greater than that of higher latitude wetlands and, additionally, a much larger proportion of anaerobic carbon (C) mineralization is converted to CH4 over CO2. Mineral soil wetlands were dominated by acetoclastic methanogenesis (53-87% of total CH4), while the hydrogenotrophic pathway was determined to be the principal pathway in organic soil wetlands (78-96% of total CH4). Finally, we found rates of CH4 oxidation under high CH4 concentrations to be comparatively higher in wetlands, while CH4 oxidation rates under low CH4 concentrations tended to be higher in upland sites. The observed relationships in CH4 production and consumption are not solely explained by temperature or pH, but are likely a result of differences in the dynamics and composition of the microbial communities responsible for the regulation of these processes. In this study, we have provided biogeochemical data that demonstrate the importance of tropical wetlands to the global CH4 cycle and which are vital in paving the way for research investigating the underlying mechanisms responsible for the high CH4 efficiency of this region.",

Model predictions have been compared with natural data related to the Permian-Triassic thinning affecting the continental lithosphere of the Alpine domain, in order to identify which portions of the present Alpine-Apennine system, preserving the imprints of Permian-Triassic high temperature (HT) metamorphism, is compatible, in terms of lithostratigraphy and tectono-metamorphic evolution, with a lithospheric extension preceding the opening of the Ligure-Piemontese oceanic basin. At this purpose age, petrological and structural data from the Alpine and Apennine ophiolite complexes are compared with model predictions from the oceanization stage. Our comparative analysis supports the thesis that the lithospheric extension preceding the opening of the Alpine Tethys did not start on a stable continental lithosphere, but developed by recycling part of the old Variscan collisional suture. The HT Permian-Triassic metamorphic re-equilibration overprints an inherited tectonic and metamorphic setting consequent to the Variscan subduction and collision, making the Alps a key case history to explore mechanisms responsible for the re-activation of orogenic scars.",

            "abstract": "Winter storms pose a number of hazards to coastal communities in the U.S. Northeast including heavy rain, snow, strong wind, cold temperatures, and flooding. These hazards can cause millions in property damages from one storm alone. This study addresses the impacts of winter storms from 2001 - 2012 on coastal counties in the U.S. Northeast and underscores the significant economic consequences extreme winter storms have on property. The analysis on the types of hazards (floods, strong wind, snow, etc.) and associated damage from the National Climatic Data Center Storm Events Database indicates that floods were responsible for the highest damages. This finding suggests that winter storm vulnerability could grow in the future as precipitation intensity increases and sea level rise exacerbate flood losses. Flood loss maps are constructed based on damage amount, which can be compared to the flood exposure maps constructed by the NOAA Office of Coastal Management. Interesting agreements and discrepancies exist between the two methods, which warrant further examination. Furthermore, flood losses often came from storms characterized as heavy precipitation storms and strong surge storms, and sometimes both, illustrating the compounding effect of flood risks in the region. While New Jersey counties experienced the most damage per unit area, there is no discernable connection between population density and damage amount, which suggests that societal impacts may rely less on population characteristics and more on infrastructure types and property values, which vary throughout the region.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - hinest_AGU_2015.pdf\nGeodetic measurements of postseismic deformation are commonly attributed to aseismic slip after an earthquake and/or viscous relaxation of coseismic stresses within the lithosphere. Differentiating between these two mechanisms is crucial for a complete understanding of lithospheric rheology, and may also have implication for model-based seismic hazard assessments. Most attempts to model postseismic deformation with both afterslip and viscous relaxation are hindered by a computationally expensive forward problem, requiring a reduction in the number of model parameters that can be feasibly explored. Consequently, idealized representations of lithospheric viscosity are often assumed, which may be too simplistic to robustly describe the viscosity structure. We present a Kalman filter based method to directly invert postseismic deformation for both fault slip throughout the postseismic period and an arbitrarily discretized lithospheric viscosity structure. Our method is made computationally tractable by approximating viscoelastic postseismic deformation with an easily evaluated truncated series expansion. We apply our method to postseismic deformation following the 2010 El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake, which is ongoing five years later. Even when we account for viscoelastic relaxation, we find that a large amount of afterslip, comparable in magnitude to the mainshock, is needed to describe most of the postseismic data. ",

Assessing the potential of this technique for the exploration of deep geothermal reservoirs was the main motivation of the EstOF project. In September 2014, we deployed a regular grid of 288 Zland nodes over a 30km wide disc (1.5km inter-node spacing) in the Outre-Forêt region (Bas-Rhin, France) encompassing the geothermal sites of Soultz-sous-Forêts and Rittershoffen.\nThe correlation of one month of ambient noise data provides thousands of usable correlations in the 0.2-5Hz frequency range. We clearly observe body waves as well as the fundamental and first harmonic modes of the Rayleigh wave. The latter phases have been used to retrieve group and phase velocity maps using the Eikonal tomography thanks to the high density of the array. Depth inversion of these maps for various frequencies allows us to construct a 3D model of shear wave velocities of the region down to 5km depth. This model, having a lateral resolution of about 2km, appears to be in good agreement with our geological knowledge of the region. This case study validates the use of ambient noise recorded by spatially dense arrays at regional scale as a cheap and robust technique for the exploration of geothermal areas.",

A source synchronous filter (SSF) is a time-frequency filter which only passes a specified width frequency band centered on the time varying frequency of the seismic source. A source delay filter (SDF) is a time-frequency filter which only passes those frequencies from the source within a specified delay time range. Both of these time-frequency filters operate on the uncorrelated vibroseis data and allow separate analysis of the source fundamental frequency and each harmonic. In either technique, the time-frequency function of the source can be captured from the source encoder or specified using two or more time-frequency points.\nSSF and SDF were both used in the processing of the vibroseis data collected in the September 2013 seismic experiment conducted at the NEES@UCSB Garner Valley field site. Three vibroseis sources were used: a 45 kN shear shaker, a 450 N portable mass shaker, and a 26 kN vibroseis truck. Seismic signals from these sources were recorded by two lines of 1 and 3 component accelerometers and geophones, and the Silixa Ltd’s intelligent Distributed Acoustic Sensing (iDASTM ) system connected to 762 m of trenched fiber optical cable in a larger rectangular area. SSF and SDF improved vibroseis data quality, simplified data interpretation, and allowed new analysis techniques.

            "abstract": "Dissolution of carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the major trapping mechanisms for carbon storage in saline aquifers. Due to a small density increase when CO2 dissolves in brine, convection cells may establish and greatly enhance the rate at which CO2 is dissolved. This important and complex process has been then a topic of large interest in the community over the last decade. We have previously shown that there is an interaction between the Capillary Transition Zone (CTZ) in the CO2 plume, and convective mixing, and that this causes significantly enhanced dissolution rates compared to a scenario that most authors have used with no flow across this interface. The rate of dissolution from the plume may also be affected by mineral reactions. Andres and Cardoso [1] showed that for the mineralization of CO2 due to silicate dissolution followed by precipitation of carbonate and clay, there is a threshold reaction rate above which convection does not appear. However, they do not account for the CTZ or depletion of the silicate. We study the impact of the CTZ on convective mixing, in a system that features mineralization of CO2. The reactivity is enhanced with CO2 concentration and with the amount of silicate (anorthite). Results from linear stability analysis and numerical simulations support each other. The rate of CO2 dissolution can be an order of magnitude enhanced by mineralization, when the CTZ and depletion of the anorthite are accounted for. Limiting reaction rates for convection are established as a function of the characteristics of the CTZ.\n[1] Andres, J.T.H. and Cardoso, S.S.S. 2011.

We will present results on the Earth bow shock under different solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field conditions and compare them with results on planar shocks for similar Mach numbers. As the simulation treats only ions kinetically, we will limit our study to the ion scales and beyond, characterizing the nature of fluctuations and ion distribution functions under different conditions and numerical settings. We will also investigate the role of dimensionality of the system, i.e., compare simulations performed in 2D and 3D in ordinary space (with full 3D in velocity space in both cases). In particular, we will characterize the foreshock ULF waves reproduced by the simulations and compare them with quasi-linear theory and observations of ion foreshocks ahead of the quasi-parallel bow shock and interplanetary shocks. The reasons for the differences in the foreshock characteristics under different modeling approximations will be discussed, in particular concerning the oblique propagation and dispersion relations of the foreshock waves, which are markedly different from quasi-linear theory and in quantitative agreement with spacecraft observations.",

            "abstract": "Operationally induced microseismicity reveals brittle failure processes that occur during hydraulic fracturing stimulation of a rockmass. The b-value of the magnitude-frequency distribution is commonly used to characterize the relative abundance of high- to low-magnitude events. In contrast to earthquake fault systems with b ~ 1, microseismicity that is directly associated with hydraulic fracturing is typically characterized by b > 1.5. Recent studies show that such unusually high b-values may be primarily controlled by scaling properties of mechanical bed thickness within the treatment zone, since the occurrence of fracture arrest at bedding boundaries gives rise to stratabound fracture networks. Stress variations also influence the b-value. These concepts provide a framework for microseismic facies analysis, a novel approach for interpretation of microseismicity that facilitates delineation of lithofacies units and stress compartments for characterization of unconventional reservoirs. Microseismic facies units are recognized on the basis of clustering analysis and recognition of distinct sets of microseismic attributes, which include b-value (and other magnitude statistics), duration, transience, seismic moment density and seismic moment release rate in addition to commonly reported characteristics of azimuth and dimensions. A case study is presented, in which microseismic facies analysis is applied to characterize an unconventional reservoir.",

We employ standard time series analyses to determine the frequency distributions of variance in pH, DO, and T and coherence analysis to identify frequency dependent co-variability among the three variables. Statistical analysis is used to identify the probability of a hypoxic event of given strength (e.g., DO < 4.5 mg/l17) lasting for a given duration and compare this between habitats. Joint probability distribution functions of low-DO are computed from the data in the same way. This approach can be used to identify the likelihood of extreme events with respect to specific DO thresholds of physiological relevance for species of interest in MPAs.\nThe time scales and vertical structure of velocities, temperature, and dissolved oxygen associated with low-DO events are also analyzed to determine the dominant transport mechanisms for these events and how they are tied to internal shoaling waves prevalent in the southern part of Monterey Bay. The structure and evolution of shoaling internal \"bores\" are also shown to substantially alter the background nearshore dynamics with their arrival and relaxation. Our work in 2015 is contextualized by multi-year data sets from the three previous years which contain observations of both upwelling and non-upwelling periods.",

            "abstract": "Open biomass burning makes a substantial contribution to the global budget of black carbon, yet models significantly underestimate absorption aerosol optical depth compared to observations by approximately a factor of two over South America. These large differences need to be addressed. Recent work has shown that the number of deforestation fires has decreased across Amazonia over the last decade, giving rise to a decrease in the abundance of biomass burning aerosol across the region. At the same time there has been an increase in the frequency of agricultural burning across regions that have previously been deforested, as well as increased burning in the east of Brazil in the Cerrado regions.\nWe sampled both of these types of open burning extensively during a recent aircraft experiment. Significant concentrations of organic carbon as well as black carbon were observed, with this ratio providing the main control on the single scattering albedo (SSA).Deforestation fires and wild forest fires are prevalent across the south west of the Amazon Basin, where smouldering burning dominates. In the east of Brazil, agricultural burning proceeds via a much more efficient form of combustion and as a result, black carbon is a much larger fraction of the aerosol mass and SSAs are much lower than in the west.\nWe have analysed MISR data across the region to show that whilst aerosol optical depths have decreased during the dry season over the last decade, with greater rates of reduction occurring over the south western margins of Amazonia, absorption aerosol optical depths have significantly increased over the Cerrado and remained constant over south western Amazonia. This has led to a decline in SSA across the whole of the region with greater reductions occurring over the eastern states. This finding is consistent with our aircraft measurements. We will discuss the implications of these changes for air quality and climate across the region.",

To pursue sustainable water resources development, integrity and rationality is important to water management planning. The water quality and the flow regimes of rivers are closely related to each other and affect river ecosystems simultaneously. Therefore, this study collects long-term observational heterogeneity data, which includes water quality parameters, stream flow and fish species in the Danshui River of norther Taiwan, and aims to explore the complex impacts of water quality and flow regime on fish communities in order to comprehend the situations of the eco-hydrological system in this river basin. First, this study improves the understanding of the relationship between water quality parameters, flow regime and fish species by using artificial neural networks (ANNs). The Self-organizing feature map (SOM) is an unsupervised learning process used to cluster, analyze and visualize a large number of data. The results of SOM show that nine clusters (3x3) forms the optimum map size based on the local minimum values of both quantization error (QE) and topographic error (TE). Second, the fish diversity indexes are estimated by using the Adapted network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) based on key input factors determined by the Gamma Test (GT), which is a useful tool for reducing model dimension and the structure complexity of ANNs. The result reveals that the constructed models can effectively estimate fish diversity indexes and produce good estimation performance based on the 9 clusters identified by the SOM, in which RMSE is 0.18 and CE is 0.84 for the training data set while RMSE is 0.20 and CE is 0.80 for the testing data set.",

However, paraglacial systems in arctic, sub-arctic, and alpine regions are changing profoundly as a consequence of climate change. Glacial retreat, increasing permafrost melt, declining winter snowpacks, earlier spring melt, and shifting summer precipitation patterns are modifying the water balance in these areas and increasing environmental vulnerability. Here, we determine the hydrological functioning of groundwater-fed stream networks in Denali National Park, Alaska, demonstrating the importance of hillslope runoff through talus deposits and the significance of preferential flow pathways (PFPs) in supporting the stream networks. We used geochemical (major ions) and stable isotopic (δ2H & δ18O) tracers to identify key water sources, determine flow paths, and highlight spatial and temporal variations in the relative contributions of individual water sources and pathways to streamflow. Multiple flow paths are shown to support streams, with the relative contribution of water sources varying on both inter-annual and seasonal scales. Hydrograph separations confirm hillslope runoff as a key contributor of flow to groundwater fed stream networks. Further, they establish the importance of talus deposits on valley sides as conduits of flow, and their potential importance as headwater aquifers. The implications are that the effects of changing climates within paraglacial environments on hillslope runoff sources will have a greater impact on these biodiversity hotspots than up-valley glacial retreat and associated changes.",

            "abstract": "The Central Valley is a broad alluvial-filled structural trough that covers about 52,000 square kilometers and is one of the most productive agricultural regions in the world. Because the valley is semi-arid and the availability of surface water varies substantially from year to year, season to season, and from north to south, agriculture developed a reliance on groundwater for irrigation. During recent drought periods (2007–09 and 2012–present), groundwater pumping has increased due to a combination of factors including drought and land-use changes. In response, groundwater levels have declined to levels approaching or below historical low levels. In the San Joaquin Valley, the southern two thirds of the Central Valley, the extensive groundwater pumpage has caused aquifer system compaction, resulting in land subsidence and permanent loss of groundwater storage capacity. The magnitude and rate of subsidence varies based on geologic materials, consolidation history, and historical water levels. Spatially-variable subsidence has changed the land-surface slope, causing operational, maintenance, and construction-design problems for surface-water infrastructure. It is important for water agencies to plan for the effects of continued water-level declines, storage losses, and/or land subsidence. To combat these effects, excess surface water, when available, is artificially recharged. As surface-water availability, land use, and artificial recharge continue to vary, long-term groundwater-level and land-subsidence monitoring and modelling are critical to understanding the dynamics of the aquifer system. Modeling tools, such as the Central Valley Hydrologic Model, can be used in the analysis and evaluation of management strategies to mitigate adverse impacts due to subsidence, while also optimizing water availability. These analyses will be critical for successful implementation of recent legislation aimed toward sustainable groundwater use.",

There are, however, uncertainties arising from multiple sources, including parametric uncertainty, which affect model output.

To enhance the credibility of sea ice predictions, it is necessary to understand the sensitivity of model results to uncertainties in input parameters. In this work we conduct a variance-based global sensitivity analysis of sea ice extent, area, and volume. This approach allows full exploration of our 40-dimensional parametric space, and the model sensitivity is quantified in terms of main and total effects indices. The global sensitivity analysis does not require assumptions of additivity or linearity, implicit in the most commonly used one-at-a-time sensitivity analyses. A Gaussian process emulator of the sea ice model is built and then used to generate the large number of samples necessary to calculate the sensitivity indices, at a much lower computational cost than using the full model. The sensitivity indices are used to rank the most important model parameters affecting Arctic sea ice extent, area, and volume. The most important parameters contributing to the model variance include snow conductivity and grain size, and the time-scale for drainage of melt ponds. Other important parameters include the thickness of the ice radiative scattering layer, ice density, and the ice-ocean drag coefficient. We discuss physical processes that explain variations in simulated sea ice variables in terms of the first order parameter effects and the most important interactions among them.",

This tool supports performance trade studies and scientific investigations for both the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), which flies aboard Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO), and the NASA Langley Research Center airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL). The simulation tool models the lidar instrument characteristics, the backscatter signals generated from aerosols, clouds, ocean surface and subsurface, and the solar background signals. The background signals are derived from the simulated aerosol and cloud characteristics, the surface type, and solar zenith angle, using a look-up table of upwelling radiance vs scene type. The upwelling radiances were derived from the CALIOP RMS background noise and were correlated with measurements of the particulate intensive and extensive optical properties, including surface scattering for transparent layers. Tests were conducted by tuning the tool for both HSRL and CALIOP instrument settings and the atmospheres were defined using HSRL measurements from underflights of CALIPSO. For similar scenes, the simulated and measured backgrounds were compared. Overall, comparisons showed good agreement, verifying the accuracy of the tool to support studies involving instrument characterization and advanced data analysis techniques.",

            "abstract": "Hydrology has been at the forefront of developments that improve the way we evaluate model simulations and quantify the resultant prediction uncertainties. A wealth of approaches have resulted from this research, varying in their statistical rigour and assumptions, which has sparked controversy between different factions. Recently, however, there appears to be a growing consensus across these approaches that there is a need to characterise, quantify and account for the effect of observational errors in the performance measures we use to evaluate models. This is particularly the case when we use different catchment information to evaluate model behaviour and our conceptualisations of catchment processes. This presentation will explore this issue by building on our recent efforts to quantify rainfall and discharge uncertainties in a generalised approach. We incorporate these uncertainties within a ‘limits of acceptability’ framework for hypothesis testing through model rejection. We apply this framework within a multi-model framework across a number of catchments to evaluate any systematic model failures outside these limits utilising time step based analyses. We show how constraining model structures and behaviour using observational uncertainties provides a coherent platform for hypothesis testing of different process representations.",

In this study we report long-term active layer trends for characteristic regions of the circumpolar Arctic, with specific emphasis on northern Alaska. We used data from 21 (1995-2015) years of extensive, spatially oriented field observations at Alaskan CALM sites to examine landscape-specific temporal and spatial ALT variability and its relation to climatic forcing and heterogeneity of edaphic properties. Soil consolidation accompanying penetration of thaw into an ice-rich stratum at the base of the active layer may obscure active-layer measurements, resulting in underrepresentation of the overall response of the active layer- upper permafrost system to climatic forcing. Here we provide results of long-term simultaneous monitoring of elevational position of the ground surface and thaw depth at representative Alaska landscapes to evaluate the impact of surface heave and subsidence on traditional active-layer observations.",

Analysis of gravity data suggests that only one high-angle normal fault may exist within the step, near the northern tip of the Hayward fault. To investigate a possible evolution of this fault system, we simulate this stepover with the numerical modeling tool Growth by Optimization of Work (GROW). GROW predicts the evolution of a fracture network by analyzing the gain in efficiency, or change in external work, produced by fracture propagation and interaction. We load the San Pablo Bay stepover models with dextral velocity and normal compression that reflects a range of seismogenic depths. The GROW analysis with overlapping starting fault segments separated by 5 km predicts that the Hayward and Rodgers Creek faults propagate toward one another following a gently curved path. The curved path of the fault segment representing the Hayward fault disagrees with the observed planar fault trace, which suggests that this fault may precede the southern propagation of the Rogers Creek fault. We explore various starting configurations that represent the potential geometry at the onset of interaction between the faults, such as different lengths of the two branches of the southern Rogers Creek fault. Throughout the development of this stepover, we analyze the evolution of external work, and change in external work (ΔWext) due to fault growth, interaction and linkage. Additionally, we use the distribution ΔWext at each increment of fault growth to produce probability density functions (PDFs). These PDFs describe fault propagation path forecasts that are defined by 90% confidence envelopes. The propagation forecasts facilitate analysis of the impact of anisotropy and heterogeneity on propagation path.",

In the cross-border area of five countries (China, Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and Myanmar), the rubber plantation dynamics varied substantially due to the differences in socioeconomic conditions from local to national scales. However, no spatially explicit information available for this region due to very limited efforts in research and monitoring. Our previous studies have proposed a phenology- and multisensor-based approach to map rubber plantation according to its deciduous feature; however, it is still uncertain that whether the approach can be used for the cross-border area. In this study, we aim to assess the potential of the previous algorithm in the study area by integrating a base forest map from 25-m phase-array L-band synthetic aperture radar (PALSAR) orthorectified mosaic imagery and defoliation information from all the available 30-m Landsat archive imagery. Furthermore, we would compare the changes in the rubber plantation pattern in the five countries from 2007 to 2014. The rubber plantation dynamics in individual countries will be analyzed by considering policies and other factors in different countries. The study would provide valuable information for a broad scientific community (e.g., carbon cycle, biodiversity) and forest management departments.",

In the presence of IMF $B_y$, oppositely y-directed stresses exerted on the newly reconnected open flux tubes forces the flux to be added to opposite regions of the lobe between the two hemispheres. For example, a postive IMF $B_y$ results in enhanced flux in the northern dawn and southern dusk lobe. In this paper we study the evolution of these asymmetric stresses. When these stresses are communicated to the different regions of the closed magnetosphere we observe an induced $B_y$ component. The estimates of the timescales on which this process occurs are highly divergent in the literature. We perform a multi-spacecraft and MHD analysis to study the response in different regions of the magnetosphere (on closed field lines) for single events with IMF $B_z<0$ and varying $B_y$ conditions. Using MHD model results and spacecraft data we show how $B_y$ is induced and that this occurs on timescales in the order of tens of minutes. We also use data from AMPERE to investigate the high-latitude ionospheric response to IMF $B_y$.",

We also deduced an expression of the critical confining pressure for explaining the transformation from structure control to stress control of rock mass strength. On this basis, rock mass with a group of joints were divided into four classes according to the relations between rock mass and joints parameters. Then, the possible failure modes and their corresponding conditions were discussed. At last, the strength characteristics of diorite with a group of joints were analyzed. The results showed that the diorite belonged to class rock mass and performed significant anisotropy in compressive strength. At the condition of vertical pressure, the rock start failing after joints at the critical confining pressure of 9.12MPa. However, with the confining pressure increasing, the anisotropy of strength became weak, and the strength of diorite would convert from structure control to stress control under some particular loading directions.",

            "abstract": "Tidewater glaciers exhibit dynamic behaviors across a range of spatial and temporal scales, posing a challenge to both in situ and remote sensing observational strategies. In situ measurements can capture variability over very short time intervals, but with limited spatial coverage and at significant cost and risk to deploy. Conversely, airborne and satellite remote sensing is capable of measuring changes over large spatial extents but at limited temporal sampling. In recent work, we have shown that long-range Terrestrial LiDAR Scanning (TLS) from fixed near-situ locations is capable of combining the rapid acquisition capabilities of in situ measurements with the broad spatial coverage of traditional remote sensing. LiDAR scanners have typically operated for short-duration campaigns (days to weeks) due to the technical complexity of the instrumentation, which has limited their contribution to tidewater glacier studies to “snapshot” observational datasets.\nThis paper describes the development and deployment an autonomous full-waveform, long range (6-10 km) TLS system for extended operation (> 1 year) in a remote Arctic environment. The instrument uses a 1064μm wavelength laser which has been optimized for snow and ice, and allows us to acquire multi-dimensional point-cloud measurements of the lower reaches of the glacier, its terminus and the mélange to distances in excess of 10 km every few hours. The system was deployed at Helheim Glacier, southeast Greenland in late July, 2015. Helheim Glacier is a large tidewater outlet glacier of the Greenland Ice Sheet and the focus of a coordinated interdisciplinary program to study of its dynamics and interaction with the ocean. Results from our year-round scanning instrument will provide new insights into short and long-term ice motion and terminus behavior at temporal and spatial resolutions previously not possible.",

            "abstract": "The Ediacaran to early Cambrian interval (~635-530 Ma) marks a tremendous increase in biotic diversity known as the Cambrian explosion. The magnitude of the biotic evolution has motivated hypotheses evoking a role for abiotic/environmental causal factors. For example, a rotation of the entire solid Earth by 90°, in what has been called an inertial interchange true polar wander (IITPW) event, has been linked to these events. One of the primary data sets motivating IITPW has been the report of nearly orthogonal directions from the Sept-Îles (ca. 565 Ma) intrusion (Quebec, Canada) on the basis of whole rock paleomagnetic analyses. We have found that only one direction (shallow) from our sampling of the Sept-Îles intrusion is carried by single domain magnetic grains and thus can be considered primary (Bono and Tarduno, Geology, 2015). Moreover, we find that the geomagnetic field was reversing during cooling of the intrusion; the small spatial scales on which we see antipodal directions suggest a very rapid reversal rate. Preliminary total-TRM paleointensity results from the Sept-Îles intrusion suggest a low field strength. The high geomagnetic reversal rate and low geomagnetic field intensity that characterize a portion of the Jurassic (ca. 165 Ma) may be an analog for field behavior during the Ediacaran to early Cambrian. This model may provide insight into the development of Earth’s interior; if high thermal core conductivity values are correct, the onset of inner core growth is predicted to have an age similar to that of our directional and paleointensity data. To test these linkages, we investigate dated localities of the Grenville dikes (ca. 590 Ma) from which classic paleomagnetic results on whole rocks (Murthy, 1971) have long figured into debates over the paleolatitude history of Laurentia. New rock- and paleo-magnetic experiments testing single crystal feldspars from Laurentian Ediacaran intrusive units will be discussed, along with new estimates of geomagnetic field intensity prior to the Cambrian.",

Large-nU-Pb geochronological datasets can yield a statistically significant signature from the youngest sub-population of detrital zircons, which we deduce from maximum depositional age (MDA) calculations. MDA is determined through numerous methods such as the mean age of three or more overlapping grain ages at 2σ error, favored in this analysis. Positive identification of the youngest detrital zircon population in a rock is the limiting factor on precision and resolution.\nThe Campanian-Paleogene Nanaimo Group of B.C., Canada, was deposited in a forearc basin, outboard of the Coast Mountain Batholith. The record of a deep-water sediment-routing system is exhumed at Denman and Hornby islands; sandstone- and conglomerate- dominated strata compose a composite sedimentary unit 20 km across and 1.5 km thick, in strike section. Volcanic ashes are absent from the succession, which has been constrained biostratigraphically. Eleven detrital zircon samples are analyzed to define stratigraphic architecture and provide insight into sedimentation rates. Our dataset (n=3081) constrains the overall duration of channelization to ~18 Ma. A series of at least five distinct composite channel fills 3-6 km wide and 400-600 m thick are identified. The MDA of these units are statistically distinct and constrained to better than 3% precision. Sedimentation rates amongst the channel fills increase upward, from 60-100 m/Ma to >500 m/Ma. This is likely linked to the tendency of a slope channel system to be dominated by sediment bypass early in its evolution, and later dominated by aggradation as large-scale levees develop. Channel processes were not continuous, with the longest hiatus ~6 Ma. The large-n detrital zircon dataset provides unprecedented insight into long-term sediment routing, evidence for which is corroborated with classical field-based data collection methods.",

The rapid and cost effective detection of leaks in natural gas distribution is critical to providing a system that is safe for the public and the environment.\nDetection of methane from a mobile platform (vehicles, aircraft, etc.) is an accepted method of identifying leaks. A robust approach to differentiating pipeline gas (thermogenic) from other biogenic sources is the detection of ethane along with methane. Ethane is present in nearly all thermogenic gas but not in biogenic sources and its presence can be used to positively identify a gas sample.\nWe present a mobile system for the simultaneous measurement of methane and ethane that is capable of detecting pipeline leaks and differentiating pipeline gas from other biogenic sources such as landfills, swamps, sewers, and enteric fermentation. The mobile system consists of a high precision GPS, sonic anemometer, and methane/ethane analyzer based on off-axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy (OA-ICOS). In order to minimize the system cost and facilitate the wide use of mobile leak detection, the analyzer operates in the near-infrared portion of the spectrum where lasers and optics are significantly less costly than in the mid-infrared.\nThe analyzer is capable of detecting methane with a precision of <2 ppb (1σ in 1 sec) and detecting ethane with a precision of <30 ppb (1σ in 1 sec). Additionally, measurement rates of 5 Hz allow for detection of leaks at speeds up to 50 mph. The sonic anemometer, GPS and analyzer inlet are mounted to a generic roof rack for attachment to available fleet vehicles. The system can detect leaks having a downwind concentration of as little as 10 ppb of methane above ambient, while leaks 500 ppb above ambient can be identified as thermogenic with greater than 99% certainty (for gas with 6% ethane). Finally, analysis of wind data provides an estimate of leak direction and distance.\nThe system presented provides a robust, cost effective solution to natural gas leak detection and attribution to maximize safety and minimize greenhouse gas impacts of distribution systems.",

Human perturbation of the nitrogen cycle has led to a rise in atmospheric N2O, but large uncertainties exist in the spatial and temporal distribution of its emissions. Here we employ a 4D-Var inversion framework for N2O based on the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model and its adjoint to derive new constraints on the space-time distribution of global land and ocean N2O fluxes. Based on an ensemble of global surface measurements, we find that emissions are overestimated over Northern Hemisphere land areas and underestimated in the Southern Hemisphere. Assigning these biases to particular land or ocean regions is more difficult given the long lifetime of N2O. To quantitatively evaluate where the current N2O observing network provides local and regional emission constraints, we apply a new, efficient information content analysis technique involving radial basis functions. The technique yields optimal state vector dimensions for N2O source inversions, with model grid cells grouped in space and time according to the resolution that can actually be provided by the network of global observations. We then use these optimal state vectors in an analytical inversion to refine current top-down emission estimates.",

            "abstract": "In the face of rising sea levels, the balance of land subsidence, sea level rise and sedimentation is critical for low-lying deltaic regions. Deltas commonly experience subsidence due to compaction of their thick sediment accumulations and other processes. Many are susceptible to growth faulting and seaward collapse of the sediment pile on detachment layers (salt and/or shales) leading to even greater subsidence. We present evidence for moderate subsidence rates and continuing active sedimentation at the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta in Bangladesh. Subsidence rates are based on continuous GPS, including three new coastal stations established in 2012, hourly tide gauge data for 1977–2012 at 16 sites, two historical sites with ages of 300 years (salt-making kilns) and 400 years (Hindu temple), and sedimentation accumulation rates of near-sea-level deposits from hand-drilled tube wells. Results so far suggest that most sites are subsiding at 3–4 mm/y, although some higher rates are recorded. Updated estimates for subsidence will be presented. Two sets of vertical optical strainmeters record sediment compaction and inform its variation with depth. Sedimentation estimates based on sedimentation plots, marker horizons, and surface elevation tables (SETs) suggest that accumulation rates in natural areas near the coast currently compensate for relative subsidence, whereas human-modified areas farther inland receive insufficient sediment and are at risk. We hypothesize that the moderate subsidence rate of the delta is due to buttressing of the margin by the continental rise. The slope-rise break is shallow at 1 km water depth due to the high sediment supply feeding the Bengal Fan. Thus the thick wedge of continental rise sediments rise higher than the top of the weak overpressured sediments in the delta that could act as a décollement surface. This prevents the seaward collapse of the delta and associated higher rates of subsidence.",

The mosaics can be used for real-time, on-line interactive mapping and time series drilling via GeoSynergy webGIS platform. The imagery is of great value for improved, persistent monitoring of global croplands and for the operational in-season analysis and mapping of crops across the globe in USDA FAS purview as mandated by the US government.\nThe presentation will overview operational processing of Landsat-class mosaics in support of USDA FAS efforts and will look into 2015 and beyond.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - IBM_Poster_AGU.pdf\nClimate change is altering environmental conditions and impacting agriculture globally, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Increased severity and duration of droughts coupled with decreased rainfall, mean that farmers have smaller inconsistent water supplies for crop production. Yields are negatively impacted by both deficiencies and excesses in key nutrients, as well as water in the surrounding environment. Small-scale farmers either overlook these nuances, make adjustments based on guesses as field conditions evolve or rely on confusing advice from agronomists and technical experts, who also lack insights in the farmer’s unique operating situation. Thus, their crop yields are often below optimal quantities as farmers are unable to ensure that their crops experience limited stress during development. Precision irrigation scheduling was designed to address this need but is expensive and does not match the mode of operation of the average small-scale farmer. To this end, we have developed a frugal, cloud-integrated, cyber-physical sensing framework which relies on small networks of strategically placed soil moisture sensors together with tank-level sensors and utilizes plant growth models to determine if and how much irrigation is needed. By utilizing weather data to calculate both plant growth and evapotranspiration, we are able to monitor plant health and track development. Combining these calculations with cloud-enabled data management and analytics, we seek to provide small-scale farmers with a low-cost method for precision irrigation management. From both laboratory trials and a case study (a mixed-crop farm in Machakos), we illustrate the effectiveness of our approach for validating the accuracy of sensors and developing models and algorithms for tailored irrigation scheduling.",

Recently updated grids of bathymetry (Jakobsson et al., 2012), gravity anomaly (Gaina et al, 2011) and dynamic topography (Spasojevic & Gurnis, 2012) were used as input data for the algorithm. TeMAr sedimentary thickness grid (Petrov et al., 2015) was modified according to the most recent published seismic data, and was re-gridded and utilized as input data. Other input parameters for the algorithm were calibrated using seismic crustal scale profiles.\nDerived crustal thickness and Moho depth grids cover the area northward from 66° N and fit within a few kilometres with seismic crustal models for the most parts of the High Arctic region. Greater misfit in Moho depth between our results and seismic study (Chain & Lebedeva-Ivanova, 2015) under the northern Canada Basin suggest exceptional property of crust or/and mantel in this part of the Basin. Assumed mantle density of 3.25 kg/cm3provide the best fit for the region; it may indicate pervasive subcontinental lithospheric mantle (Goldstein et al., 2008) under the whole Arctic region. New results show a possible crustal connection between the Alpha and the Lomonosov ridges near the Canadian margin. The deepest Moho depth of c.34 km for Alpha-Mendeleev Ridge System is observed under the southern Mendeleev Ridge.\nThe derived crustal thickness and Moho depth show a substantial improvement from the publicly available grids (CRUST1 (Laske et al., 2013) and GOCE/GEMMA (Reguzzoni et al., 2013); we aim to provide Arctic patch for the CRUST 1.0.",

            "abstract": "The early vision of the mantle crystallizing from the bottom upwards towards the surface has been disputed due to computational data on melt densities supporting crystallization at an intermediate depth and an accumulation of dense melts in the deep mantle. The controversy between the two models arises because the exact nature of the partitioning of iron between solid and liquid phases in the lower mantle remains unclear. In addition, no experimental studies have measured directly the density of melts at the conditions of the deep mantle, even though it is the key parameter controlling the entrainment and/or settling of matter in the deep mantle.\nUsing a novel approach, we measured the density of MgSiO3 amorphous glass in the small sample environment of the diamond anvil cell up to the core-mantle boundary pressure. We discovered that MgSiO3 glass (300 K) and melt (4000 K) are as dense, within the uncertainties, as their crystalline MgSiO3 Bridgmanite counterpart phases in the lowermost mantle. Our data on MgSiO3 glass and melt provide the first experimental evidence for such high-density melts in the deep mantle.\nTaking into account that iron will partition into the melt phase, we conclude that melting in the MgSiO3-FeSiO3 system will produce magmas that are denser than the residual solids, regardless of the exact nature of iron partitioning. This study therefore supports the theory of a deep basal magma ocean concomitant with the late accretion stage of the Earth. Such a magma ocean surrounding the core would be an ideal candidate for storing incompatible elements, thermally insulating the iron-rich core, thus delaying the crystallization time of the inner core and the onset of the geodynamo.",

            "abstract": "The volcanic unrest in and around the Bárðarbunga volcano, between Aug 16th 2014 and Feb 27th 2015, was accompanied by a sequence of large events occurring close to the caldera rim. More than 70 events with M >= 5 were reported by the Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO). The events are in many aspects unusual; 1) Moment tensors have a large negative CLVD component (www.globalcmt.org), 2) Many of the largest events are accompanied by a sudden subsidence at the center of the caldera as measured by GPS (E. Magnússon/B. Ofeigsson) and InSAR (Riel et al 2015), with decreasing steps in time, even for events of the same magnitude, 3) The events have a very long duration for their size (this study), 4) event hypocenters are very shallow (this study), 5) Relatively relocated M < 3 events show subvertical caldera walls (Vogfjord et al, this conference).\nTwo mechanisms for generating earthquakes with large vertical CLVD components in volcanoes have been suggested; 1) slip on a ring fault (Ekström 1994), 2) collapse of an underlying horizontal sill (Riel et al 2015). However, neither model is consistent with all observations. In this presentation we analyze both regional and teleseismic waveforms from the largest of the events in detail, with the objective of deciphering their generating mechanism. Preliminary results indicate that the complex waveforms cannot be replicated by models with slip on differently oriented simple fault planes or vertical ring fault structures.",

            "abstract": "The atmospheric component of HadGEM2-ES has been used to investigate the impacts of local and non-local emissions of anthropogenic sulphur dioxide on the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM). We focus on the very different fast responses to sudden changes in emissions from Asia and Europe. During days 1-40, Asian emissions have an impact on the sulphate burden itself over Asia, resulting in changes to the shortwave energy budget, cooling of East Asia and a weakening of the EASM. In contrast, European emissions have no significant impact on the sulphate burden over Asia, but do produce mid-tropospheric cold and dry anomaly over the European sector which is advected into Asia, where it induces atmospheric and surface feedbacks over Asia and the Western North Pacific, also weakening the EASM. The large scale pattern of changes in land–sea thermal contrast, atmospheric circulation and local precipitation over East Asia from day 40 onwards in both simulations exhibits similar structures, indicating a preferred response, and suggesting that emissions from both regions likely contributed to the observed weakening of the EASM.\nA weakening of the EASM tends to lead to flooding in southern China and drought in the north. Northeast Asia experienced a severe drought in summer 2014 itself within the context of two decades of dry summers. We used HadGEM3-A simulations of summer 2014 to quantify the roles of greenhouse gases, anthropogenic aerosol, and sea surface temperature in the drought. These show reductions in precipitation over East Asia in response to recent changes in sea surface temperature, which are characteristic of the warm phase of the PDO. However, model biases meant that these experiments were unable to capture the observed pattern of precipitation anomalies, thus precluding definitive attribution.\nThese results show mechanisms by which anthropogenic aerosol could have contributed to the observed weakening of the EASM, but suggest that model biases in the Asian summer monsoon need to be reduced in order to enable successful attribution of individual extreme precipitation events.",

            "abstract": "Highly variable spatial and temporal patterns in snow properties are the norm in complex terrain, yet most mountain regions remain significantly under-sampled with respect to in situ data. We argue that significant strides in our understanding of snow processes in montane regions can be made using a regional reanalysis approach that merges information from uncertain model estimates and globally available remote sensing measurements. While many large-scale reanalysis datasets (e.g. NARR, NCEP/NCAR, MERRA, etc.) exist, their coarse spatial resolution and modeling/assimilation approaches are generally insufficient and/or inaccurate for direct application to analysis of snow processes in remote complex mountainous terrain. The newly developed state-of-the-art snow water equivalent (SWE) reanalysis approach presented in this paper is focused on snow and is based on the leveraging of long-term Landsat fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) datasets together with existing meteorological reanalysis products and snow modeling, merging all information streams within a data assimilation framework. The method is applied over the Sierra Nevada (USA) for the Landsat 5 record (1985-2011). The resolution (daily, 90-meter), temporal extent (27 years), and accuracy (mean and root-mean-squared errors less than 3 and 14 cm respectively and correlation greater than 0.94 compared with in situ SWE observations) provide a unique dataset for investigating snow processes. Preliminary analysis has focused on the peak SWE climatology over the reanalysis period. The pixel-wise peak SWE volume over the domain was found to be 19.9 km3 on average with a range of 9.8–35.8 km3. The 27-year climatology for range-wide peak SWE was found to be 16.4 km3 and occurred on 28 March. The results show that the assumption that 01 April SWE is representative of the peak range-wide SWE can lead to significant underestimation both on average (16%) and on an inter-annual basis (up to 47%). The reanalysis is being extended to present using Landsat 7 and 8 data, which will allow for characterizing recent drought years compared to the 30-year climatology. The methods are general and therefore designed to be extended to other important mountain regions with significant seasonal snowpack.",

            "abstract": "The coastal Atacama Desert is home to a complex geo-ecosystem supported by fog with multiple atmospheric and oceanic drivers. Fog collectors in place for the last 17 years reveal that monthly fog intensity and amount are significantly linked to the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO 1+2) with cold (warm) anomalies correlated to increased (decreased) fog (R2 = 0.41). Rainfall, however, can occur during extreme positive ENSO anomalies. Tillandsia landbeckii is an epiarenitic plant common to the coastal Atacama where fog is intercepted by the coastal escarpment between 950-1250 m.a.s.l. These plants possess multiple adaptations to survive exclusively on fog, including the construction of “dune” ecosystems known as “tillandsiales”. Buried T. landbeckii layers in such dunes contain a record of past variations of fog over time (dunes can top 3 m in height) and alternating plant and sand layers are readily visible in dune stratigraphy. Stable N isotopes on modern plants and fog indicate that these plants reflect δ15N values of total N dissolved in fog. We measured δ15N values from buried T. landbeckii layers from five different tillandsiales found across c. 50 km the coastal escarpment. The isotope values in these buried plants indicate a prominent c. 8.0 ‰ shift towards more negative δ15N values on average over the last 3,200 years. Based on differences in δ15N between modern and more extensive “paleo” tillandsiales at one of our lowest elevation study sites, we interpret this shift as an increase in available moisture due to increased fog input during the late Holocene. Increased variability in ENSO as well as increased upwelling and southerly winds along the coastal Atacama would explain in part this increase. Clearly, the Atacama tillandsiales have considerable potential for monitoring past and present change of these large-scale ocean-atmosphere systems.",

            "abstract": "Extensive modeling informed by the growing body of observational data yields important insights to the controlling processes operating across a range of spatiotemporal scales that have influenced the dynamic variability of the Greenland ice sheet. Pressurized basal lubrication enhances ice flow. This lubricating water is largely produced by basal and/or surface melt. For the North East Greenland Ice Stream, elevated geothermal heat flux (GHF) near its onset helps initiate the streaming flow. We suggest that the elevated GHF is likely caused by melt production and migration due to cyclical loading of the lithosphere over glacial timescales. On sub-seasonal timescales, surface meltwater production and transmission to the subglacial environment can enhance flow for pressurized, distributed hydraulic systems and diminish regional sliding for lower-pressure, channelized systems. However, in a warming climate, this lubricating source occurs across an expanding ablation zone, possibly softening shear margins and triggering basal sliding over previously frozen areas. Yet, the existence of active englacial conduits can lead to a plumbing network that helps preserve ice tongues and limit the loss of important buttressing of outlet glacier flow. Ocean forcing has been implicated in the variability of outlet glacier speeds around the periphery of Greenland. The extent and timescale over which those marginal changes influence inland flow depends on the basal rheology that, on a local scale, also influences the concentration of englacial stresses. Detailed observations of a calving event on Helheim Glacier have helped constrain diagnostic simulations of the pre- and post-calving stress states conducted in hopes of informing improved calving relationships. Furthermore, warm-water-mass variability within Irminger/Atlantic Waters off Greenland may play an important role in the monthly modulation of outlet glacier flow speeds, as has been observed for an ice stream draining into Pine Island Bay. However, for large warming, the magnitude and rate of surface warming become increasingly important as the combination of negative surface mass balance and inland drawdown dominate system response. Within this overview, key results from idealized simulations addressing each of these processes will be highlighted.",

            "abstract": "The Kern River Plateau in the southern Sierra Nevada contains Quaternary basalt (~0.1 km3) and rhyolite (~2 km3) that ascended through ~30 km of Mesozoic granitic crust. Basaltic vents include from oldest to youngest: Little Whitney Cone, Tunnel and South Fork Cones, and unglaciated Groundhog Cone. Little Whitney Cone is a 120-m-high pile of olivine-CPX-phyric scoria overlying two columnar jointed lava flows extending to the south and east. Tunnel Cone formed through a Hawaiian style eruption along a 400-m-long north-south trending fissure that excavated at least three 25-65-m-wide craters. Crater walls up to 12 meters high are composed of plagioclase-olivine-phyric spatter-fed flows that dip radially away from the crater center and crumble to form steep unconsolidated flanks. South Fork Cone is a 170-m-tall pile of plagioclase-olivine-phyric scoria that formed as a result of Strombolian to violent Strombolian eruptions. It overlies the South Fork Cone lava, the largest lava flow of the Kern Plateau (~0.05 km3), which flowed 7.5 km west into the Kern River Canyon. Scoria and ash fall deposits originating from South Fork Cone are found up to 2 km from the vent. Groundhog Cone is a 140-m-tall cinder and spatter cone breached on the north flank by a 0.03 km3 lava flow that partially buried the South Fork Cone lava and extends 5 km west to Kern River Canyon. Trends in mineral assemblage, texture, composition, and xenocryst abundance exist as a function of eruption style. Scoria and spatter deposits typically have (1) elevated olivine/plagioclase ratios, (2) oscillatory zoned (An63-An72) plagioclase phenocrysts surrounded by unzoned rims and (3) abundant xenocrysts, where up to 20% of plagioclase >200 micron diameter in some samples are granitoid xenocrysts with resorbed and/or reacted textures overprinted by abrupt compositional changes. In contrast, lava flow samples have (1) reduced olivine/plagioclase ratios and (2) plagioclase aggregates with oscillatory zoned cores (An55-An67) surrounded by normally zoned rims (An38-49). Kern Plateau basalts record a variety of open system magmatic processes that occurred during ascent and storage through thick granitic crust, and results from this study suggest that these processes may influence eruption style and the associated hazard.",

This earthquake occurred within a region of previous great historical subduction earthquakes and may have filled a gap of high seismic potential on the Nazca-South America plate boundary. The event has been the subject of several publications on source rupture mechanism that has been characterized by a series of multiple events, and the seismic moments estimated vary with the frequency content of the data utilized. Some of these studies found that the inferred maximum slip obtained by from wide-band analysis is too small and would suggest that a future large-slip event has yet to occur in the area (Mendoza et al., 1994). We applied a linear scheme finite-fault waveform inversion to the teleseismic P waves, allowing a variable dislocation rise time for every point source on the fault. The results show that rupture propagated 100 km southward, with a total duration of 70 seg. Most of the slip is concentrated on two patches at depth between 25 and 45 km. The patch of maximum slip is near of nucleation zone. After we inverted the earthquake, we modeled the tsunami for this event. We compare run-up and tide gauges observations with the synthetic ones. The result confirms that the slip patch is located between 25 and 45 km depth. This suggests that the source did not break the upper part of the interplate contact zone. Recently studies demonstrated that the 1730 earthquake with epicenter offshore Valparaíso was the largest of the historical events occurred in Central Chile region. It affected a zone stretching for more than 1000 km along the coast from Copiapó to Concepción and caused great damage in Santiago and Valparaíso. It produced a large tsunami that especially affected Valparaíso and Concepción. Therefore, a repeat of this event in the future is not excluded, and thus this region should be carefully surveyed.",

            "abstract": "The marker-in-cell method is generally considered to be a flexible and robust method to model advection of heterogenous non-diffusive properties (i.e. rock type or composition) in geodynamic problems or incompressible Stokes problems. In this method, Lagrangian points carrying compositional information are advected with the ambient velocity field on an immobile, Eulerian grid.\nHowever, velocity interpolation from grid points to marker locations is often performed without preserving the zero divergence of the velocity field at the interpolated locations (i.e. non-conservative). Such interpolation schemes can induce non-physical clustering of markers when strong velocity gradients are present (Jenny et al., 2001) and this may, eventually, result in empty grid cells, a serious numerical violation of the marker-in-cell method. Solutions to this problem include: using larger mesh resolutions and/or marker densities, or repeatedly controlling the marker distribution (i.e. inject/delete), but which does not have an established physical background.\nTo remedy this at low computational costs, Jenny et al. (2001) and Meyer and Jenny (2004) proposed a simple, conservative velocity interpolation (CVI) scheme for 2-D staggered grid, while Wang et al. (2015) extended the formulation to 3-D finite element methods.\nHere, we follow up with these studies and report on the quality of velocity interpolation methods for 2-D and 3-D staggered grids. We adapt the formulations from both Jenny et al. (2001) and Wang et al. (2015) for use on 3-D staggered grids, where the velocity components have different node locations as compared to finite element, where they share the same node location. We test the different interpolation schemes (CVI and non-CVI) in combination with different advection schemes (Euler, RK2 and RK4) and with/out marker control on Stokes problems with strong velocity gradients, which are discretized using a finite difference method. We show that a conservative formulation reduces the dispersion or clustering of markers and that the density of markers remains steady over time without the need of additional marker control.\nJenny et al.

            "abstract": "Desert dust aerosols exert a radiative forcing on the atmosphere, influencing atmospheric temperature structure and modifying radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and surface. As dust aerosols perturb radiative fluxes, the atmosphere responds by altering both energy and moisture dynamics, with potentially significant impacts on regional and global precipitation. Global Climate Model (GCM) experiments designed to characterize these processes have yielded a wide range of results, owing to both the complex nature of the system and diverse differences across models. Most model results show a general decrease in global precipitation, but regional results vary. Here, we compare simulations from GFDL’s CM2Mc GCM with multiple other model experiments from the literature in order to investigate mechanisms of radiative impact and reasons for GCM differences on a global and regional scale. We focus on West Africa, a region of high interannual rainfall variability that is a source of dust and that neighbors major Sahara Desert dust sources. As such, changes in West African climate due to radiative forcing of desert dust aerosol have serious implications for desertification feedbacks. Our CM2Mc results show net cooling of the planet at TOA and surface, net warming of the atmosphere, and significant increases in precipitation over West Africa during the summer rainy season. These results differ from some previous GCM studies, prompting comparative analysis of desert dust parameters across models. This presentation will offer quantitative analysis of differences in dust aerosol parameters, aerosol optical properties, and overall particle burden across GCMs, and will characterize the contribution of model differences to the uncertainty of forcing and climate response affecting West Africa.",

MIS 11 is marked by especially pronounced high latitude warming in the Northern Hemisphere from 410-400 ka and thus presents a natural experiment for investigating the response of Great Basin precipitation to high latitude temperatures.\n\nMIS 11 is recorded by stalagmites LC3 and BT1 from Lehman Caves in Great Basin National Park, Nevada. LC3 represents 378-413 ka, while BT1 has a bottom age of 410 ka. Ongoing U-Th dating will refine chronologies from these samples. We will present stable isotope (δ13C and δ18O) and trace element (Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca) data from these stalagmites to study changes in precipitation recorded in them. Previous studies have shown a relationship between Mg/Ca, Sr/Ca, δ13C and prior calcite precipitation, and thus infiltration rates, in the cave system (Cross et al., 2015; Steponaitis et al., 2015). Meanwhile, δ18O has been shown to reflect larger scale atmospheric circulation.\n\nWe will compare the records to previously published trace element and stable isotope data from more recent interglacials (Lachniet et al., 2014; Cross et al., 2015; Steponaitis et al., 2015) to test whether extensive high-latitude warming during MIS 11 was marked by anomalous precipitation patterns in the Great Basin. As they are coeval, we will also test the reproducibility between the stalagmites.\n\n",

Both ratios are stable during weathering and low-grade metamorphism. Y/Al only depends on fractional crystallization of garnet, xenotime and monazite during magmatogenesis and the degree of partial melting. This already distinguishes individual magmas. Zr/Ti is modified by other phases (rutile, titanite, zircon, ilmenite, biotite, etc) that neither accommodate nor fractionate trivalent cations and provides a totally independent perspective on magmatogenesis.\nThe Y/Al-Zr/Ti plot has no relation to tectonic setting (convergent, rift, intraplate, etc) and is not designed to distinguish lines of descent (calc-alkaline, transitional, etc). Instead, it can discriminate at a very fine scale lavas that share a common regional origin and are therefore confused in classic tectonic discrimination plots. Disentangling individual magma batches is inaccessible to global modeling but important to chronostratigraphers. Application to two well studied examples, Adamello (Alps) and North Anatolia, reproduces known consanguinity and rejects a few dubious ones.",

Recent land cover shifts include degradation in ecosystem function and structure of the grasslands, reduction of vegetation cover, particularly in northeastern Inner Mongolia, and urban expansion around Ulanbaatar. Here we examine the impacts of land cover change using the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS v. 6.0) to test whether or not the land cover changes from 2001-2010 could significantly impact surface energy fluxes enough to alter convection over the regions where grasslands are dominant. We performed this experiment for two distinct sets of boundary conditions: the growing season of 2001 (a drought/dzud year) and 2003 (a wet year). Preliminary results from the model indicate increased cloud cover and lowered daily temperature ranges for the northeastern Mongolian Plateau accompanying patterns of meadow and forest steppe growth. More broadly, the overall trend towards reduced vegetation cover leads to higher screen height temperatures and reduced soil moisture throughout much of the domain, together with a shift of moisture southward of Inner Mongolia. In the desert steppe regions around the Gobi desert, more complex patterns associated with land degradation will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Frictional properties of laboratory and natural fault surfaces are controlled by the collective behavior of microscopic asperity contacts. A fundamental parameter that determines the spatial distribution and average size of asperity contacts on a fault surface is the roughness at all length scales. Average contact sizes for laboratory friction experiments are inferred to be of order 1 to 10 μm, but contact sizes on natural faults are comparatively unknown. Previous studies have quantified surface roughness of exhumed faults over length scales of microns to tens of meters, but roughness at sub-micron length scales has rarely been determined. For length scales of tens of microns and larger, self-affine roughness is observed, exhibiting anisotropic scaling with a Hurst exponent of 0.6 in the slip-parallel direction and 0.8 in the slip-perpendicular direction (Candela et al., 2012). Using intermittent contact atomic force microscopy (AFM), we have probed natural fault surfaces over profile lengths as large as ~100 μm with nanometer resolution in the slip-parallel and slip-perpendicular directions and sub-nanometer resolution in the third dimension. Surface roughness at length scales of tens of microns and smaller also demonstrates a self-affine character, but characterized by a Hurst exponent of 0.7 in both the slip-parallel and slip-perpendicular directions, in contrast to the different slip-parallel and slip-perpendicular values cited above. Taken together, our data and existing roughness data for several other faults demonstrate self-affine geometry over ~13 orders of magnitude in lateral length scale, to scales as small as 10 nm. Roughness measurements in the sub-micron regime allow us to use contact theory to estimate the real area of contact, the mean pressure, and the distribution of contact stresses on a rough fault surface. Calculations using our measured roughness show that contact stresses for asperities microns and smaller in size are large enough to induce plastic deformation. In addition, we hypothesize that the merging of values of the Hurst exponent for both slip-parallel and slip-perpendicular roughness that occurs below a length scale of tens of microns indicates a transition from predominantly brittle deformation at larger scales to plastic deformation at smaller scales.",

However, this partitioning is not sufficiently constrained by energy and mass balances alone. We use a simple energy balance model in which surface temperatures and convective fluxes are determined with the additional thermodynamic constraint of maximum convective power. We assume that convection acts as a perfect heat engine operating at this limit. Applying our approach at regional scales, we find that the geographic variation of heat fluxes in the climatological mean reproduce ECMWF reanalysis with a high correlation (r2 = 0.88) despite a uniform bias.\nOur global estimates of the convective flux and surface temperature, with bias correction, is within 4% of satellite based estimates. Our results show that given total surface radiative forcing, the ratio between the surface cooling fluxes remains nearly constant. This provides an insight into surface energy partitioning that could be useful in setting physical limits to equilibrium climate sensitivity.",

Recent technological developments in space-borne instrumentation have enabled us to observe changes in these gases to a precision necessary to infer for the responsible geographical fluxes. The Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON), comprising a network of upward-looking Fourier transform spectrometers, was established to provide an accurate ground truth and minimize regional systematic bias.\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) has developed a compact, low-cost laser heterodyne radiometer (LHR) for global column measurements CO2 and CH4. This Mini-LHR is a passive instrument that uses sunlight as the primary light source to measure absorption of CO2 and CH4in the shortwave infrared near 1.6 microns. It uses compact telecommunications lasers to offer a low cost (<$30K/unit), suitcase sized, highly sensitive (< 1 ppm for CO2 and <20 ppb for CH4) measurement solution to supplement TCCON measurements.\nWe will deploy Mini-LHR instruments to accompany the NASA AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) which has more than 500 sites worldwide. In addition, the NASA Micro-Pulse Lidar Network (MPLNET) provides both column and vertically resolved aerosol and cloud data in active remote sensing at nearly 50 sites worldwide. Tandem operation with AERONET/MPLNET provides a clear pathway for the Mini-LHR to be expanded into a global monitoring network for carbon cycle science and satellite data validation, offering coverage in cloudy regions (e.g., Amazon basin) and key regions such as the Arctic where accelerated warming due to the release of CO2 and CH4from thawing tundra and permafrost is a concern. These vulnerable geographic regions are not well covered by current space-based CO2 and CH4 measurements. We will present an overview of our instrument development and the implementation of a network based on current and future resources.\nWe will also present preliminary Observing System Simulation Experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of a network Mini-LHR instruments in quantify regional CO2 fluxes, including an analysis of measurement sensitivity, information content, and the impacts of aerosol and how these could minimized by incorporating information from AERONET/MPLNET.",

Kappa is a significant parameter used for identifying the high frequency attenuation behavior of ground motions as well as one of the key parameters for stochastic strong ground motion simulation method. Recently, it has been also used in adjusting ground motion predictions from one region to another. Currently, other than a previous study by the authors, there are no detailed studies on kappa using Turkish strong ground motion datasets. In this study, with the objective of deriving regional kappa models, we examine ground motion datasets from different regions in Turkey with varying source properties, site classes and epicentral distances. Statistical tools are used to investigate the dependency of kappa on these parameters. In addition, potential correlations between kappa and Vs30 values of the stations are also studied. Main findings of this study are regional kappa models on North Anatolian Fault zone. Finally, we also present high-frequency strong motion simulations of past events in the selected regions using the proposed kappa models.

A three year funding was received from NASA to partnership with JSU and MSU under cooperative agreement “Strengthening Global Climate Change education through Remote Sensing Application in Coastal Environment using NASA Satellite Data and Models”. The goal is to increase the number of highschool and undergraduate students at Jackson State University, a Historically Black University, who are prepared to pursue higher academic degrees and careers in STEM fields. A five Saturday course/workshop was held during March/April 2015 at JSU, focusing on historical and technical concepts of math, enginneering, technology and atmosphere and climate change and remote sensing technology and applications to weather and climate. Nine students from meteorology, biology, industrial technology and computer science/engineering of JSU and 19 high scool students from Jackson Public Schools participated in the course/workshop. The lecture topics include: introduction to remote sensing and GIS, introduction to atmospheric science, math and engineering, climate, introduction to NASA innovations in climate education, introduction to remote sensing technology for bio-geosphere, introduction to earth system science, principles of paleoclimatology and global change, daily weather briefing, satellite image interpretation and so on. In addition to lectures, lab sessions were held for hand-on experiences for remote sensing applications to atmosphere, biosphere, earth system science and climate change using ERDAS/ENVI GIS software and satellite tools. Field trip to Barnett reservoir and National weather Service (NWS) was part of the workshop. Basics of Earth System Science is a non-mathematical introductory course designed for high school seniors, high school teachers and undergraduate students who may or may not have adequate exposure to fundamental concepts of the key components of the modern earth system and their interactions. This is an online course that will be delivered using Blackboard platform available at Jackson State University.",

            "abstract": "Ice nucleation on particles is a fundamental atmospheric process, which governs precipitation, cloud lifetimes, and climate. Despite being a basic atmospheric process, our current understanding of ice nucleation in the atmosphere is low. One reason for this low understanding is that ice nuclei concentrations are low (only ~1 in 105 particles in the free troposphere nucleate ice), making it challenging to identify both the composition and sources of ambient ice nuclei. Carbonaceous combustion aerosol produced from biomass and fossil fuel combustion are one potential source of these ice nuclei, as they contribute to over one-third of all aerosol in the North American free troposphere. Unfortunately, previous results from field measurements in-cloud, aircraft measurements, and laboratory studies are in conflict, with estimates of the impact of combustion aerosol ranging from no effect to rivaling the well-known atmospheric ice nuclei mineral dust. It is, however, becoming clear that aerosols from combustion processes are more complex than model particles, and their ice activity depends greatly on both fuel type and combustion conditions.\nGiven these dependencies, we propose that sampling from real-world biomass burning and fossil fuel sources would provide the most useful new information on the contribution of carbonaceous combustion aerosols to atmospheric ice nuclei particles. To determine the specific contribution of refractory black carbon (rBC) to ice nuclei concentrations, we have coupled the Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) to the Colorado State University Continuous Flow Diffusion Chamber (CFDC). The SP2 utilizes laser-induced incandescence to quantify rBC mass on a particle-by-particle basis; in doing so, it also selectively destroys rBC particles by heating them to their vaporization temperature. Thus, the SP2 can be used as a selective pre-filter for rBC into the CFDC. In this work, we will present recent results looking at contribution of diesel engine exhaust to ice nuclei concentrations. Sampling was done for both diesel and biodiesel on fresh emissions and emissions aged up to 18 days equivalent photochemical aging with a Potential Aerosol Mass chamber. Our results show that, for mixed-phase clouds, both fresh and aged (bio)diesel are not likely a significant source of ice nuclei.",

            "abstract": "The observed deuterium excess (d-excess) in ice cores from Summit, Greenland has high summer values and low winter values, which is opposite of the seasonal variations of most northern hemisphere locations. The interpretation of this d-excess seasonality in the context of moisture source changes is made more complicated by possible post-depositional modifications. We investigate potential post-depositional modifications within 3-4 years after precipitation events by collecting precipitation samples and comparing them with snow pit profiles at Summit.\nPrecipitation was sampled on a storm-by-storm basis from July 2011 to September 2014. To assess the effect of wind blown snow on cross-storm contamination, we sampled at three heights (1, 2, and 4 m). Snow pits were sampled in the summers of 2013 and 2015 to span the entirety of our precipitation record. All samples were analyzed for δD and δ18O and d-excess was calculated.\nMixing of snow between different storms was identified only for samples collected at the lowest height. We thus use the samples collected at the top height for interpretation. The annual cycle of precipitation isotopes follow the established seasonal relationship with the average summer enrichment of -217 and -29‰, and winter depletion of -317 and -40‰ for δD and δ18O, respectively. The d-excess shows an average summer maximum of 16‰ and winter minimum of 3‰. In the snow pit, the seasonal amplitude and phase of both oxygen and hydrogen isotopic ratios as well as the d-excess compare remarkably well with those of the precipitation. The profile appeared to be devoid of major post depositional effects except for a thin layer that changed during a melt event in 2012. However, this type of event is extremely rare at Summit, and should not significantly compromise the interpretation of precipitation isotopes in ice cores, except perhaps during climatic warm period summers.\nThe precipitation d-excess seasonality is typically interpreted as resulting from changing moisture sources, but this does not explain the positive relationship between d-excess and d18O at Summit, Greenland. We propose that moisture sublimated from the snow surface, which typically has high d-excess values, may be an important moisture source captured in the isotope record.",

First in the foreland foothills of western Taiwan, based on Be10 cosmogenic and C14 dating the Puakua tableland reveals a recurrent time of about 100-120 Ka of terrace deposits, which are characterized by 4-5 levels of lateritic terraces, with a long-term uplift rate of 1.5-2 mm/yr in the last 450 Ka. Secondly in the eastern Central Range of the Hsinwulyu River, based on linear tilting model and GPS short-term geodetic rate, it exhibits 8-10 levels of recurrent river terrace deposits occurred about every 5 thousands years in the past 50 Ka or so, under a regional uplift rate of 2-8 mm/yr. Finally in the Longitudinal Valley, a plate suture between the rapid moving Philippine Sea plate and the stable Eurasian plate, based on the C14 dating and abundant geodetic data, including leveling, GPS and creep meter, we infer a recurrent time of about 400-600 years for 8-10 levels of uplifted fluvial terraces on the hanging wall of the Longitudinal Valley fault with an uplift rate of 2-3 cm/yr during the past 5-6 Ka. It is still too early to draw any conclusion on scientific explanations for these three types of possible extreme events at a recurrent time of 0.5 ka, 5 ka and 11 ka, respectively. However, possible scenario and causative mechanisms might be anticipated, for instance the global climate influence such as glacial cycle, or regional tectonic effect such as cluster of mega earthquakes in different areas of the Taiwan mountain belt. On the other hand, comparing the terraces in the three different geological/tectonic setting, we found that the recurrent time of terrace deposits shows an inverse proportional relationship to the uplift rate in the local areas, which requires further investigations in terms of data and physical theory.",

            "abstract": "Cirrus clouds in the tropical tropopause play a key role in regulating the moisture entering the stratosphere through their dehydrating effect. Low ice number concentrations and high supersaturations were frequently were observed in these clouds. However, low ice number concentrations are inconsistent with cirrus cloud formation based on homogeneous freezing. Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain this discrepancy, including the inhibition of homogeneous freezing by pre-existing ice crystals and/or glassy organic aerosol heterogeneous ice nuclei (IN) and limiting the formation of ice number from high frequency gravity waves. In this study, we examined the effect from three different parameterizations of in-cloud updraft velocities, the effect from pre-existing ice crystals, the effect from different water vapor deposition coefficients (α=0.1 or 1), and the effect from 0.1% of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) acting as glassy heterogeneous ice nuclei (IN) in CAM5. Model simulated ice crystal numbers are compared against an aircraft observational dataset. Using grid resolved large-scale updraft velocity in the ice nucleation parameterization generates ice number concentrations in better agreement with observations for temperatures below 205K while using updraft velocities based on the model-generated turbulence kinetic energy generates ice number concentrations in better agreement with observations for temperatures above 205K. A larger water vapor deposition coefficient (α=1) can efficiently reduce the ice number at temperatures below 205K but less so at higher temperatures. Glassy SOA IN are most effective at reducing the ice number concentrations when the effective in-cloud updraft velocities are moderate (~0.05–0.2 m s-1). Including the removal of water vapor on pre-existing ice can also effectively reduce the ice number and diminish the effects from the additional glassy SOA heterogeneous IN. We also re-evaluate whether IN seeding in cirrus cloud is a viable mechanism for cooling. A significant amount of negative climate forcing can only be achieved if we restrict the updraft velocity in regions of background cirrus formation to moderate values (~0.05–0.2 m s-1).",

            "abstract": "ePoster - aguFall15.pdf\nNitrous oxide emissions from agricultural lands occur as pulses at short intervals during various times throughout a given year, with the timing and magnitude dependent on management, soil, and climatic conditions. A thorough assessment of N2O emissions from fertilized fields requires methods capable of measuring fluxes at large temporal and spatial scales. A study investigating the effect of fertilizer treatment on the total annual N2O emissions from cornfields in Southern, Ontario, Canada provided the setting to analyze three methods for measuring N2O fluxes. Four 2-ha plots within a homogeneous 30-ha area were each subject to different nitrogen fertilizer source and timing treatments. N2O fluxes were measured using eddy-covariance (EC), multi-plot flux gradient (FG), and chamber techniques. Each method has advantages and disadvantages. Eddy-covariance is a standard method for measuring fluxes at the resolutions required to assess trace gas emissions, but the erratic nature of agricultural N2O fluxes necessitates testing of N2O analyzers, and the application of the EC method to N2O fluxes. This study acted as a field test of the Campbell Scientific TGA200A tunable diode trace gas analyzer. Testing the TGA200A against a TGA100A provided two simultaneous EC-flux measurements of N2O for one plot. Multi-plot FG measurements have the advantage of providing year-round, spatiality integrated, semi-continuous fluxes for side-by-side comparisons of N2O fluxes from separate treatments under similar climatic and soil conditions, but is a less common practice. Chambers have the advantage of being the most direct means of measuring soil fluxes; however, spatial resolution is low, and winter measurements are often impossible. Preliminary results showed that temporal patterns measured by each of the methods matched for three post-fertilizer N2O emission events of one plot. EC fluxes of N2O measured by each of the TGA analyzers correlated well (r2 = 0.90) and values were on average within 7% of one another. N2O fluxes measured by the FG system correlated with the EC fluxes (r2 = 0.75) but magnitudes were slightly lower than the EC fluxes. Chamber measurements confirmed the emission of N2O, but the lack of spatial coverage resulted in poor correlations between the chamber and the EC and FG measurements.",

It is located above a sequence of deformable unconsolidated lacustrine sediments interlayered with strong volcanic rocks. These natural conditions combined with massive groundwater extraction, caused the city to subside unevenly, at rates from 0 to ~370 mm/yr, which we term differential subsidence. Our study focuses on the Collective Transport System (Metro), the massive, widely used transportation system in the city. It has been in operation since 1969. The Metro system carries an average of more than four million passengers per day along its 218 km of railways. This system has been occasionally damaged by ground deformation, in particular Line 12, in which 50% of its stations where shut down just 2.5 years after the beginning of its operation due to faults, “waves” and “bumps” along the line.\nIn this study we used Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) observations to monitor land subsidence throughout the city and infer differential subsidence along the main Metro lines. Our analysis is based on 34 TerraSAR-X and 36 COSMO-SkyMed high-resolution scenes acquired from mid 2011 to mid 2013. The data were processed using the StaMPS InSAR time series technique, which calculates ground displacement time series for more than 2.5 million selected measurement points, typically separated 3-15 meters apart. The differential subsidence along the Metro lines was calculated by averaging subsidence rate within a 30 m radius circles, every 60 m along the lines. We found that the segments with the most differential deformation are in lines 4, 5, 9, A, B and 12. Our easy-to-implement method can be applied to permanent monitor deformation along the railways, as well as serve as a guide for the development of new lines of the Metro system prospected by Mexico’s City government.",

Stratospheric volcanic aerosols reflect sunlight, reducing evaporation, whilst surface cooling stabilises the atmosphere and reduces its water-holding capacity. Circulation changes modulate this global precipitation reduction on regional scales. Despite the importance of rivers to people, it has until now been unclear whether volcanism causes detectable changes in streamflow given large natural variability. Here we analyse the response of 50 major world rivers using observational records, averaging across multiple eruptions to reduce noise. We find statistically significant reductions in flow for the Amazon, Congo, Nile, Orange, Ob, Yenisey and Kolyma amongst others. Results are clearer when neighbouring rivers are combined into regions based on the areas where climate models simulate either an increase or a decrease in precipitation following eruptions. We detect a significant streamflow decrease (p<0.1) in northern South American, central African and high-latitude Asian rivers, and on average across wet tropical and subtropical regions. We also detect a significant increase in southern South American and SW North American rivers. This significant change in global scale streamflow following volcanic eruptions has implications for predicting and mitigating the effects of future eruptions.",

            "abstract": "In the study of the inversion of gravity and magnetic data, the discretization of underground space is usually achieved by the use of structured grids. For instance, using the regular block as the module unit to divide model space in Cartesian coordinate system and the tesseroid in spherical coordinate system. Structured grids show clear spatial structures and mathematical properties. However, the block can only provide a rough approximation to the given terrain and using the tesseroid to approximate the terrain even seems impracticable. These shape determining errors cause the reduction of forward modeling precision. Moreover, the precision decreases again while using the tesseroid as no analytical algorithm has been acquired. On the other hand, since most terrain data has a limited resolution, unstructured grids, based on the polyhedron or tetrahedron, could fill the space completely, which allows us to reduce errors in shape determination to the minima. In addition, the analytical algorithms for polyhedron have been proposed. In our study, we use the tetrahedron as the module unit to divide the underground space. Moreover, based on the former researches, we supplement new analytical algorithms for tetrahedron to forward modeling gravity and magnetic fields and their gradient tensors in both Cartesian and spherical coordinate systems. The algorithm is testified by comparing the forward gravity and magnetic data of a block with the data obtained using the existed algorithms. The absolute difference between these two data is under 10e-9 mGal. Our approach is suitable for the inversion of gravity and magnetic data in both Cartesian and spherical coordinate systems.This study is supported by Natural Science Fund of Hubei Province (Grant No.: 2015CFB361) and International Cooperation Project in Science and Technology of China (Grant No.: 2010DFA24580).",

            "abstract": "Sea surface temperature (SST) variability from Cuba remains relatively unknown compared to the rest of the Caribbean. Cuba sits near an inflection point in the spatial pattern of SST from the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), and long SST records from the region could reveal changes in the influence of this climate system through time. A Siderastrea siderea coral from the Jardínes de la Reina in southern Cuba was drilled to obtain a 220 year long archive of environmental change. The genus Siderastrea has not been extensively studied as an SST archive, yet Sr/Ca ratios in the Cuban core show a clear seasonal signal and strong correlation to instrumental SST data (r2 = 0.86 and 0.36 for monthly and interannual (winter season) timescales, respectively). Annual growth rates (linear extension) of the coral are observed to have a minor influence on Sr/Ca variability, but do not show a direct correlation to SST on timescales from annual to multidecadal. Sr/Ca measurements from the Cuban coral are used to reconstruct monthly and seasonal (winter, summer) SST extending back more than two centuries. Wintertime SST in southern Cuba is compared to other coral Sr/Ca records of winter-season SST from locations sensitive to the NAO in order to investigate the stationarity of the NAO SST ‘fingerprint’ through time.",

            "abstract": "The expected future impacts of climate change can be a manageable problem provided the risks to society can be properly assessed. Given our current understanding of both the climate system and the related decision problems, we strive to develop tools that can assess these risks and provide robust strategies given possible futures. In this talk, we will present two examples from recent work ranging from global to regional scales to highlight these issues. Typically, we begin by assessing the probability of events without information on impacts specifically, however, recent developments allow us to address the risk management problem directly. In the first example, we discuss recent advances in quantifying probability distributions for equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). A comprehensive examination of factors all contributing to the total uncertainty in ECS can include updates to estimates of observed climate changes (oceanic, atmospheric, and surface records), improved understanding of radiative forcing and internal variability, revised statistical calibration methods, and overall longer records. In a second example, we contrast the assessment of probabilistic information for global scale climate change with that for regional changes. The relative importance of model structural uncertainty, uncertainty in future forcing, and the role of internal variability will be compared within the context of the decision making problem. In both cases, robust estimates of uncertainty are desired and needed… but surprises happen. Incorporating these basic issues into robust decision making frameworks is a long-term research goal with near-term implications. ",

            "abstract": "Recently, the Continental Rifting in Africa: Fluids-Tectonic Interaction (CRAFTI) experiment was conducted in northern Tanzania and southern Kenya as a means to better evaluate the effect of tectonic and magmatic strain along the east African rift. Towards this goal S. Roecker has computed a 3D structural model by joint inversion of gravity, local seismic body wave, and surface wave data. The joint inversion in turn produces a quality estimate of the compressional, shear, and density structure in the region. In the process of tomography of local body wave data it was observed that there exist some anomalously deep seismic events. To better quantify these events we look towards waveform modeling in this new and laterally heterogeneous structural model. It is thought that better quantification of later arriving direct and scattered phases will provide better resolved estimates of the event locations and lower the trade-off between source time and depth uncertainty inherent in travel time inversions. Since our main objective is testing the validity of seismic depths in the travel time inversion we will favor a grid search based approach around the current hypocenters using a method similar Zhao, 2006. To expedite processing, we make use of seismic reciprocity and save the strain wave fields produced by impulsive sources at receiver locations in the vicinity of the initial hypocenters. We then perform a moment tensor inversion at each location around the hypocenter, estimate the corresponding source time function, compute the resulting synthetics, and finally calculate a cumulative waveform misfit objective function for all stations. It is thought this procedure should well sample the objective function in the neighborhood of the initial hypocenters and thereby provide an avenue for resolution analysis of the event depths.",

This network is comprised of eight seismo-acoustic array stations(BRDAR, YPDAR, KMPAR, CHNAR, YAGAR, KSGAR, ULDAR, TJIAR). The aperture size of the smallest array is 300m and the largest is about 1.4km. The number of infrasound sensors are between 4(TJIAR) and 18(YAGAR), and 1~5 seismometers are collocated with infrasound sensors. Many interesting infrasound signals associated with different type of sources, such as blasting, large earthquake, bolide, volcanic explosion are detected by KIN in the past 15 years. We have analyzed the infrasound signals possibly associated with the japanese volcanic explosions with reference to volcanic activity report published by Japanese Meteorological Agency. Analysis results of many events, for example, Asama volcano explosion in 2004 and Shinmoe volcano in 2011, are well matched with the official report. In some cases, however, corresponding infrasound signals are not identified. By comparison of the infrasound signals from different volcanoes, we also found that the characteristics of signals are distinguishing. It may imply that the specific volcano has its own unique fingerprint in terms of infrasound signal. It might be investigated by long-term infrasound monitoring for a specific volcano as a ground truth generating repetitive infrasound signal.",

Evaluation against an unprecedented number of aerosol and cloud observations made available through the Global Aerosol Synthesis and Science Project (GASSP), International Arctic Systems for Observing the Atmosphere (IASOA) and the 2013 ACCACIA campaign, suggest that Arctic summertime CCN is well represented in the model. Sensitivity studies indicate that DMS derived nucleation events are the primary source of Arctic summertime aerosol increasing mean (median) surface CCN concentrations north of 70N from 21(14) cm-3 to 46(33) cm-3. However, evaluation against observed aerosol size distributions suggests that UKCA overestimates nucleation mode (~10nm) particle concentrations either due to overestimation of boundary layer nucleation rates or underestimation of the Arctic marine boundary layer condensation sink.",

Reactions of OH with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) initiate a series of reactions that can lead to the production of ozone and secondary aerosols in the atmosphere. An accurate understanding of the major sources of OH is important to develop accurate models of atmospheric chemistry. Nocturnal nitrous acid (HONO) is an important radical resevoir species and releases OH upon photolysis the next morning. Recent studies have indicated higher than expected mixing ratios of HONO during the daytime, suggesting that the production mechanisms of HONO are not fully understood. Additional ambient HONO measurements are necessary to improve our knowledge of the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere.\nMeasurements of HONO were made during summer 2015 using a Laser Photofragmentation/Laser-induced flourescence (LP/LIF) instrument as part of the Indiana Radical, Reactivity and Ozone Production Intercomparison (IRRONIC). This campaign took place in a forested area in the Indiana Research and Teaching Preserve (IURTP) near the Bloomington Campus. In LP/LIF, ambient air is drawn through a 0.035” diameter inlet and expands into a cell held at ~5 torr . HONO within the sampled air mass is photo-fragmented by laser emision at 355 nm and resulting OH fragments are subsequently detected by laser-induced fluorescence at 308 nm.\nIn this presentation the development of the LP/LIF insturment will be discussed and preliminary measurements and model comparisons from the campaign will be presented.",

This interest led to a better understanding of the emissions, now explained by bremsstrahlung from high energy electrons which run away in electric fields associated with thunderstorms. In this presentation we discuss the influence of the scattering for the runaway mechanism and the runaway threshold. We compare the outcome of different models with increasing complexity in the description of the scattering. The results show that the inclusion of the scattering in the model firstly reduces the runaway production by allowing some electrons to diffuse out of the runaway regime before they reach energy high enough to justify a forward scattering model. Secondly they affect the definition of the runaway threshold itself. We purpose a alternative definition applicable for sub-MeV electrons and discuss the impact on runaway rates.",

The study area of this experiment is located in the Sixth Naphtha Cracker Plant, which is beside the estuary of the Jhuoshuei River in the western parts of Taiwan. The island is approximately 22.55 Square kilometers and although, the geology is consisted mostly of sandy soil, the hydraulic conductivity is heterogeneous based on the slug test results. Due to the fact that the study area is an island, the groundwater level is affected by the sea tidal; therefore, 10 observation wells for monitoring the groundwater level have been set and the observation frequency has been taken hourly for a period of seven months. In addition to that, for estimating the heterogeneity hydrogeology distribution field on artificial islands, the technique of inversing and verifying the Virtual Experimental Field (VEF) of the heterogeneity hydrogeology distribution field by using the Monte Carlo method is applied. To complete the experiment, the inverse technique in the study area of the heterogeneity hydrogeology distribution field is followed under the same methods. The purpose of this study is to introduce and estimate the heterogeneous unconfined aquifer for artificial islands, based on the groundwater response to the tidal fluctuation.",

These deposits are the remnants of what is believed to have been a once far larger ‘ice age’, culminating in a last martian glacial maximum. Despite the identification of >1,300 glacier-like forms (GLFs) - the first order component of Mars’ glacial landsystem - in Mars’ mid-latitudes, little is known about their composition, dynamics or former extent. Here, we reconstruct the former 3D extent of a well-studied GLF located in eastern Hellas Planitia. We combine high-resolution geomorphic and topographic data, obtained from the High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera, to reconstruct the GLF’s former limits. We then apply a perfect plasticity rheological model, to generate multiple flow-parallel ice-surface transects. These are combined with the GLF’s boundary to guide interpolation using ArcGIS’ ‘Topo to Raster’ function to produce a continuous 3D surface for the reconstructed former GLF. Our results indicate that, since its reconstructed ‘recent maximum’ extent, the GLF’s volume has reduced by 0.31 km3 and its area by 6.85 km2, or 70%. On-going research is addressing the degree to which this change is typical of Mars’ full GLF population.",

In the transition from oxic to suboxic sediment, a portion of solid Fe is reduced and mobilized as soluble Fe(II) into interstitial water during the oxidation of organic matter. The presence of Fe and its oxidation state in oxic sediment provides insight into an important metabolic and mineral reaction pathway in subseafloor sediment.\nWe recovered bulk sediment and interstitial water at western North Atlantic sites during Expedition 223 on the R/V Knorr in November, 2014. The expedition targeted regions with predominantly oxic sediment and regions with predominantly anoxic sediment, ideal for investigating redox Fe cycling between solid and aqueous phases. At Site 10 (14.4008N, 50.6209W, 4455m water depth), interstitial dissolved oxygen is depleted within the upper few meters of sediment. At Site 12 (29.6767N, 58.3285W, 5637m water depth), interstitial dissolved oxygen is present throughout the cored sediment column (10s of meters).\nHere we present total solid Fe concentration for 45 bulk sediment samples and total aqueous Fe and Mn concentrations for 50 interstitial water samples analyzed via ICP-ES. We additionally present Fe(II) and Fe(III) speciation results from 10 solid sediment samples determined by Mossbauer spectroscopy. We trace downcore fluctuations in Fe in solid and aqueous phases to understand Fe cycling in oxic, suboxic, and transitional regimes. Our preliminary data indicate that solid Fe concentration ranges from 4-6 wt % at the oxic site; aqueous Fe ranges from below detection to 20µM and aqueous Mn ranges from 1 to 125 µM at the anoxic site. In the anoxic sediment (Site 10), 86-90% of the total Fe is oxidized [Fe(III)] and 10-14% as reduced [Fe(II)], compared to 3-6% as reduced [Fe(II)] at the oxic site (Site 12), even in sediment as old as 25 million years.",

            "abstract": "Oil-in-water emulsions are widely employed to promote biotic reduction of contaminants; however, emulsions can also be used to encapsulate and deliver active ingredients required for long-term subsurface treatment. Our research focuses on encapsulating alkalinity-releasing particles in oil-in-water emulsions for sustained control of subsurface pH. Typical characteristics of these emulsions include kinetically stable for >20 hr; 20% soybean oil; 1 g/mL density; 8-10 cP viscosity; and 1.5 µm droplet d50, with emulsions developed for favorable subsurface delivery. The viscosity of the oil-in-water emulsions was found to be a function of oil content. Ultimately we aim to model both emulsion delivery and alkalinity release (from retained emulsion droplets) to provide a description of pH treatment.\nEmulsion transport and retention was investigated via a series of 1-d column experiments using varying particle size fractions of Ottawa sand. Emulsions were introduced for approximately two pore volumes followed by a flush of background solution (approx. ρ=1 g/mL; μ=1cP). Emulsion breakthrough curves exhibit an early fall on the backside of the breakthrough curve along with tailing. Deposition profiles are found to be hyper-exponential and unaffected by extended periods of background flow. Particle transport models established for dilute suspensions are unable to describe the transport of the concentrated emulsions considered here. Thus, we explore the relative importance of additional processes driving concentrated droplet transport and retention. Focus is placed on evaluating the role of attachment-detachment-straining processes, as well as the influence of mixing from both viscous instabilities and variable water saturation due to deposited mass.",

            "abstract": "Episodic sediment failures are recognised on continental slopes around Flemish Pass and Orphan Basin from multibeam bathymetry, seismic reflection profiles and piston cores. Seismic stratigraphy is tied to published long cores with O-isotope data back to before MIS 6 and carbonate rich Heinrich layers in places produce marker reflections in high-resolution sparker profiles. Heinrich layers, radiocarbon dates and peaks in diatom abundance provide core chronology.\nSlope sedimentation was strongly influenced by the Labrador Current and the silty muds show architecture characteristic of contourites. Variation in Labrador Current strength is known from the sortable silt proxy over the past 125 ka. Large slope failures were mapped from seismic reflection profiles and their age estimated from seismic stratigraphy (3–5 ka resolution) and in some cases refined from cores (1–3 ka resolution). Large slope failures occurred apparently synchronously over margin lengths of 50–350 km. Such failures were earthquake triggered: other mechanisms for producing laterally extensive synchronous failure do not apply. Triaxial shear measurements show a Su/σ' ratio of typical slope sediment of 0.48, implying considerable stability. However, some silty muds have Atterberg limits that suggest susceptibility to liquefaction under cyclic loading, particularly in Holocene deposits and by analogy those of past full interglacials. Basal failure planes of some large failures correspond with either the last interglacial or the MIS 6 glacial maximum. Comparison with seismological models suggests that the observed slope failures represent earthquakes ranging from Mw ~5.6 to ~7.6. Mean recurrence interval of M = 7 earthquakes at any point on the margin is estimated at 30 ka from seismological models and 40 ka from the sediment failure record. In northern Flemish Pass, a spatial cluster of several failures over 30 ka preceded by a long interval with no failures suggests that some other mechanism has preconditioned the slope for earthquake triggering. There is circumstantial evidence that such preconditioning is related to excess pore pressures, released by fluid drainage at head scarps.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Fairen et al.pdf\nUnderstanding the geochemical conditions on early Mars requires an explanation for the presence of sulfates and phyllosilicates, which must be also consistent with the absence of widespread sedimentary carbonates. In addition, sulfates and phyllosilicates do not generally occur together on Mars, which has been interpreted as a marker for detached mineral formation due to differing planetary environmental conditions separated dramatically, either in time or in space. Here, thermodynamic equilibrium calculations are used to determine the stability boundaries for phyllosilicates, ferrous and ferric sulfates, carbonates and iron oxyhydroxides precipitation on early Mars, at different atmospheric CO2 pressures and both under reducing and oxidizing conditions. Results suggest that phyllosilicates formed in mildly acidic to alkaline aqueous solutions, with a pH>4 for nontronite and a pH>6 for other smectites with low content in Fe and Mg (montmorillonite, saponite). Sulfate deposition dominates in solutions moderately to highly acidic, with a pH<6 conducive to the synthesis of kieserite. In the overlapping phyllosilicates/sulfates pH range, between 4 and 6, a competition for Mg between nontronite and kieserite is expected, and the formation of nontronite would be favored in areas where SiO2 activity in surface waters was high as a result of intense weathering of the early basaltic crust. Carbonates formed at pH>6, overlapping with the synthesis of low-Fe-Mg smectites. Model calculations anticipate the co-precipitation of smectites and siderite or any alteration product that could have resulted from the later substitution of Fe in siderite, such as Mg- or Mn-carbonate, triggering a competition for Mg between magnesite and low-Fe-Mg smectites. As expected, the model does not predict coeval synthesis of carbonates and sulfates. Goethite and other oxyhydroxides precipitate at pH below 2, a range at which jarosite and goethite are the expected iron-bearing phases. These results suggest that the major water-alteration products on the Martian surface were deposited simultaneously in space and in time, creating diverse geochemical conditions over the entire surface of a cold Mars during the wet Noachian/Hesperian times.",

            "abstract": "Croplands occupy large areas of Earth’s land surface playing a key role in the terrestrial carbon cycle. Hence, it is essential to quantify and analyze the carbon fluxes from those agro-ecosystems, since they contribute to climate change and are impacted by the environmental conditions. In this study we propose a regional modeling approach that combines high spatial and temporal resolutions (HSTR) optical remote sensing data with a crop model and a large set of in-situ measurements for model calibration and validation. The study area is located in southwest France and the model that we evaluate, called SAFY-CO2, is a semi-empirical one based on the Monteith’s light-use efficiency theory and adapted for simulating the components of the net ecosystem CO2 fluxes (NEE) and of the annual net ecosystem carbon budgets (NECB) at a daily time step. The approach is based on the assimilation of satellite-derived green area index (GAI) maps for calibrating a number of the SAFY-CO2 parameters linked to crop phenology. HSTR data from the Formosat-2 and SPOT satellites were used to produce the GAI maps. The experimental data set includes eddy covariance measurements of net CO2 fluxes from two experimental sites and partitioned into gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco). It also includes measurements of GAI, biomass and yield between 2005 and 2011, focusing on the winter wheat crop. The results showed that the SAFY-CO2 model correctly reproduced the biomass production, its dynamic and the yield (relative errors about 24%) in contrasted climatic, environmental and management conditions. The net CO2 flux components estimated with the model were overall in agreement with the ground data, presenting good correlations (R² about 0.93 for GPP, 0.77 for Reco and 0.86 for NEE). The evaluation of the modelled NECB for the different site-years highlighted the importance of having accurate estimates of each component of the NECB. Future works aim at considering systematically post-harvest events (such as re-growths, weeds and intercrops) on NEE assessment and at assimilating radar remote sensing data for estimating GAI and biomass more accurately. This approach is currently being extended to summer crops and it could be applied to larger scales thanks to the recent satellite missions (Landsat-8, Sentinel-1 and 2…).",

            "abstract": "The inversion of ground deformation and gravity data is affected by an intrinsic ambiguity because of the mathematical formulation of the inverse problem. Current methods for the inversion of geodetic data rely on both parametric (i.e. assuming a source geometry) and non-parametric approaches. The former are able to catch the fundamental features of the ground deformation source but, if the assumptions are wrong or oversimplified, they could provide misleading results. On the other hand, the latter class of methods, even if not relying on stringent assumptions, could suffer from artifacts, especially when dealing with poor datasets.\nIn the framework of the EC-FP7 MED-SUV project we aim at comparing different inverse approaches to verify how they cope with basic goals of Volcano Geodesy: determining the source depth, the source shape (size and geometry), the nature of the source (magmatic/hydrothermal) and hinting the complexity of the source. Other aspects that are important in volcano monitoring are: volume/mass transfer toward shallow depths, propagation of dikes/sills, forecasting the opening of eruptive vents.\nOn the basis of similar experiments already done in the fields of seismic tomography and geophysical imaging, we have devised a bind test experiment. Our group was divided into one model design team and several inversion teams. The model design team devised two physical models representing volcanic events at two distinct volcanoes (one stratovolcano and one caldera). They provided the inversion teams with: the topographic reliefs, the calculated deformation field (on a set of simulated GPS stations and as InSAR interferograms) and the gravity change (on a set of simulated campaign stations). The nature of the volcanic events remained unknown to the inversion teams until after the submission of the inversion results.\nHere we present the preliminary results of this comparison in order to determine which features of the ground deformation and gravity source are best retrieved by the different methods, to propose useful guidelines for the proper interpretation of inversion results and to highlighting possible pitfalls. A further aim is to foster a wide discussion about the inversion of ground deformations in the whole Volcano Geodesy community, by eventually proposing a future version 2.0 of this experiment.",

These flares have the potential to produce formaldehyde as the result of incomplete combustion. Formaldehyde emissions are an important precursor to producing hydroxyl radicals and thus can impact atmospheric chemistry and the formation of ozone. Formaldehyde emissions from flares, however, are difficult to measure in situ. Recently, alternative measurement techniques have been developed, like open path optical methods, that allow the direct measurement of flare emissions from the facility’s fence line (Johansson et al., 2014; Pikelnaya, Flynn, Tsai, & Stutz, 2013). This observational data indicates that the emission rate of formaldehyde from flares is about 10-20 times greater than those found in the regulatory models developed by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality’s (TCEQ). This research will use air quality models to quantify the impact that increased formaldehyde emission from flares will have on Houston ozone concentrations. This study relies on the CAMx model (version 6.1) and emission data developed by Alpine Geophysics LLC (AG) and Climate & Atmospheric Research Associates (CARA) based on the combined databases from TCEQ, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and National Emission Inventory (NEI2008). This model also used meteorology data from the results of WRF-ARW dynamics. The CAMx generated process analysis data will also be used to quantify changes in radical budgets and NOx budgets critical to ozone production. ",

Since measurements of major micrometeorological variables are usually lacking for forested sites, physically based or empirical parameterizations are usually applied to calculate the beneath-canopy micrometeorological conditions for snow hydrological modeling. Most of these parameterizations have been developed from observations at selected long-term climate stations. Consequently, the high spatial variability of the micrometeorological variables is usually not taken into account.\nThe goal of this study is to evaluate existing approaches using an extensive dataset collected during five winter seasons using a stratified sampling design with pairs of snow monitoring stations (SnoMoS) at open/forested sites in three study areas (Black Forest region of SW Germany, Brixenbach catchment in the Austrian Alps and the Berchtesgadener Ache catchment in the Berchtesgaden Alps of SE Germany). In total, recordings from 110 station pairs were available for analysis. The measurements of air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and global radiation from the open field sites were used to calculate the adjacent inside forest conditions. Calculation results are compared to the respective beneath-canopy measurements in order to evaluate the applied model algorithms. The results reveal that the algorithms surprisingly well reproduced the inside canopy conditions for wind speed and global radiation. However, air temperature and relative humidity are not well reproduced. Our study comes up with a modification of the two respective parameterizations developed from the paired measurements.",

            "abstract": "Analyzing subduction initiation is key for understanding the coupling between plate tectonics and underlying mantle. Here we focus on supra-subduction zone (SSZ) ophiolites and how their formation links to intra-oceanic subduction initiation in an absolute plate motion frame. SSZ ophiolites form the majority of exposed oceanic lithosphere fragments and are widely recognized to have formed during intra-oceanic subduction initiation. Structural, petrological, geochemical, and plate kinematic constraints on their kinematic evolution show that SSZ crust forms at forearc spreading centers at the expense of a mantle wedge, thereby flattening the nascent slab. This leads to the typical inverted pressure gradients found in metamorphic soles that form at the subduction plate contact below and during SSZ crust crystallization. Former spreading centers are preserved in forearcs when subduction initiates along transform faults or off-ridge oceanic detachments. We show how these are reactivated when subduction initiates in the absolute plate motion direction of the inverting weakness zone. Upon inception of slab-pull due to e.g. eclogitization, the sole is separated from the slab, remains welded to the thinned overriding plate lithosphere and can become intruded by mafic dikes upon asthenospheric influx into the mantle wedge. We propound that most ophiolites thus formed under special geodynamic circumstances and may not be representative of normal oceanic crust. Our study highlights how far-field geodynamic processes and absolute plate motions may force intra-oceanic subduction initiation as key towards advancing our understanding of the entire plate tectonic cycle.",

            "abstract": "Although in the Alps a large amount of continental lithosphere from both European (lower plate) and Adriatic (upper plate) continental margins was absorbed in the sub-lithospheric mantle during Alpine subduction, relict metamorphic and igneous imprints of the Variscan convergence and the successive Pangea break-up are preserved in the continental crust of both margins. These pre-Alpine signatures are preserved either in small volumes within the exhumed continental crust slivers of the axial belt or in the Alpine hinterland and foreland crusts that were never reworked in deep-seated conditions. Because of the common occurrence of metamorphic and igneous markers of the Variscan convergence in the pre-Alpine continental crust, the Permian-Triassic high thermal regime, which left widespread metamorphic and igneous imprints, can be interpreted as the effect of lithospheric thinning leading to continental rifting and subsequent Tethyan ocean opening. In addition, even Permian igneous activity and related basin formation may be interpreted as linked to lithospheric extension leading to the Pangaea break-up and to subsequent oceanization, predating the marine transgression from the east, where the Neotethys Ocean was opening.\nPermian-Triassic HT-LP metamorphic imprints recorded in the Austroalpine continental units are correlatable to this scenario; these peculiar metamorphic patterns have been widely recognized in lower, intermediate and upper continental crust. HT assemblages mark newly differentiated foliations locally associated with discrete shear zones, mainly in metapelites. Ages inferred for Tmax conditions are comprised between 220 and 295 Ma and Jurassic mineral ages are obtained where LP-LT metamorphic imprints, recorded during uplift and associated with fluid circulation, are dominant. The uplift paths are usually characterized by a high T/P ratio and wide parts of the uplift paths occurred under high thermal regime and the exhumation of some of the deep-seated continental crust units occurred up to shallow crustal levels, thus suggesting that several Austroalpine rocks have been tectonically sampled by a thinned continental margin before being subducted during Alpine convergence.",

We are working towards a model that combines both phenotypic and genotypic traits to better predict responses of trees to climate change.\nWe have worked to parameterize a neighborhood dynamics, individual tree forest-gap model called SORTIE-ND, using open data from both the USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory & Analysis (FIA) datasets in California and 30-yr old permanent plots established by the USGS. We generated individual species factors including stage-specific mortality and growth rates, and species-specific allometric equations for ten species, including Abies concolor, A. magnifica, Calocedrus decurrens, Pinus contorta, P. jeffreyi, P. lambertiana, P. monticola, P. ponderosa, and the two hardwoods Quercus chrysolepis and Q. kelloggii.\nDuring this process, we also developed two R packages to aid in parameter development for SORTIE-ND in other ecological systems. MakeMyForests is an R package that parses FIA datasets and calculates parameters based on the state averages of growth, light, and allometric parameters. disperseR is an R package that uses extensive plot data, with individual tree, sapling, and seedling measurements, to calculate finely tuned mortality and growth parameters for SORTIE-ND. Both are freely available on GitHub, and future updates will be available on CRAN.\nTo validate the model, we withheld several plots from the 30-yr USGS data while calculating parameters. We tested for differences between the actual withheld data and the simulated forest data, in basal area, seedling density, seed dispersal, and species composition. The similarity of our model to the real system suggests that the model parameters we generated with our R packages accurately represent the system, and that our model can be extended to include changes in precipitation, temperature, and disturbance with very little manipulaton. We hope that our examples, R package development, and SORTIE-ND module development will enable other ecologists to utilize SORTIE-ND to predict changes in local and important ecoystems around the world.",

However, even small errors in the MISR calibration, especially structured artifacts in the imagery, have a disproportionate effect on the retrieval of aerosol properties from these data. Using MODIS, POLDER-3, AERONET, MAN, and MISR lunar images, we diagnose and correct various calibration and radiometric artifacts found in the MISR radiance (Level 1) data, using empirical image analysis. The calibration artifacts include temporal trends in MISR top-of-atmosphere reflectance at relatively stable desert sites and flat-fielding artifacts detected by comparison to MODIS over bright, low-contrast scenes. The radiometric artifacts include ghosting (as compared to MODIS, POLDER-3, and forward model results) and point-spread function mischaracterization (using the MISR lunar data and MODIS). We minimize the artifacts to the extent possible by parametrically modeling the artifacts and then removing them from the radiance (reflectance) data. Validation is performed using non-training scenes (reflectance comparison), and also by using the MISR Research Aerosol retrieval algorithm results compared to MAN and AERONET.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_DC_Spatial_Variability.pdf\nOn the Antarctic Plateau, the annual snow accumulation and the physical properties of snow close to the surface are characterized by a large spatial variability at the scale of a few metres. As a consequence, two snowpits measured a few metres apart from each other can show significant differences. This variability mainly results from the combination of low annual amounts of precipitation and drift events that redistribute snow. The latter physical process is not simulated by one-dimensional snow evolution models. Here we describe how the detailed snowpack model Crocus is adapted to Antarctic conditions and modified to account for this drift-induced variability using a stochastic snow redistribution scheme. For this, 50 simulations are run in parallel and the corresponding numerical snowpacks are allowed to exchange snow mass according to rules driven by wind speed and snow characteristics. These simple rules were developed and calibrated based on in situ pictures of the snow surface recorded at Dome C for two years, which show the occurrence of snow drift and its impact on snow height variations. At Dome C, the results of these parallel simulations show three substantial improvements with respect to standard Crocus simulations. First, significant and rapid variations of snow height observed in hourly measurements are well reproduced, highlighting the crucial role of snow drift in snow accumulation. Second, the statistics of annual accumulation is successfully simulated, including the years with negative net ablation which are as frequent as 15% in the observations and 11% in the simulation. Eventually, the simulated vertical profiles of snow density and specific surface area down to 50 cm depth are compared to 98 profiles measured at Dome C during the summer 2012–2013. The observed spatial variability is partly reproduced by the new model, especially close to the surface. The erosion/deposition processes also explain why layers with density lower than 250 kg m−3 or specific surface area larger than 30 m2 kg−1 can be found deeper than 10 cm. The proposed parameterization of snow drift may help with the interpretation of ice cores, which largely relies on assumptions about local snow accumulation.",

This information is very important for disaster risk reduction management and crisis relief organizations. Currently, real-time information is derived from few sources such as field reports, traffic camera’s, satellite images and areal images. However, getting a real-time and accurate picture of the situation on the ground remains difficult.\nAt the same time, people affected by natural hazards increasingly share their observations and their needs through digital media. Unlike conventional monitoring systems, Twitter data contains a relatively large number of real-time ground truth observations representing both physical hazard characteristics and hazard impacts. In the city of Jakarta, Indonesia, the intensity of unique flood related tweets during a flood event, peaked at almost 900 tweets per minute during floods in early 2015. Flood events around the world in 2014/2015 yielded large numbers of flood related tweets: from Philippines (85.000) to Pakistan (82.000) to South-Korea (50.000) to Detroit (20.000). The challenge here is to filter out useful content from this cloud of data, validate these observations and convert them to readily usable information.\nIn Jakarta, flood related tweets often contain information about the flood depth. In a pilot we showed that this type of information can be used for real-time mapping of the flood extent by plotting these observations on a Digital Elevation Model. Uncertainties in the observations were taken into account by assigning a probability to each observation indicating its likelihood to be correct based on statistical analysis of the total population of tweets. The resulting flood maps proved to be correct for about 75% of the neighborhoods in Jakarta. Further cross-validation of flood related tweets against (hydro-) meteorological data is to likely improve the skill of the method.",

            "abstract": "Antarctica is a unique and geographically remote environment. Traditional field campaigns investigating geology and vegetation in the region encounter numerous challenges including the harsh polar climate, the invasive nature of the work, steep topography and high infrastructure costs. Additionally, such field campaigns are often limited in terms of spatial and temporal resolution, and particularly, the topographical challenges presented in the Antarctic mean that many areas remain inaccessible. Remote Sensing, particularly hyperspectral imaging, may provide a solution to overcome the difficulties associated with field based mapping in the Antarctic. Planned satellite launches, such as EnMAP and HyspIRI, if successful, will yield large-scale, repeated hyperspectral imagery of Antarctica. Hyperspectral imagery has proven mapping capabilities and can yield greater information than can be attained using multispectral data.\nAs a precursor to future satellite imagery, we utilise hyperspectral imagery from the first known airborne hyperspectral survey carried out in the Antarctic by the British Antarctic Survey and partners in 2011. Multiple imaging spectrometers were simultaneously deployed covering the visible, shortwave and thermal infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. Additional data was generated during a field campaign deploying multiple ground spectrometers covering the same wavelengths as the airborne imagers. We utilise this imagery to assess the current challenges and propose some new solutions for mapping vegetation and geology, which may be directly applicable to future satellite hyperspectral imagery in the Antarctic.",

            "abstract": "The development and deployment of resilience policies within communities in the United States often respond to the place-based, hazard-specific nature of disasters. Prior to the onset of a disaster, municipal and regional decision makers establish long-term development policies, such as land use planning, infrastructure investment, and economic development policies. Despite the importance of incorporating disaster risk within community decision making, resilience and disaster risk are only one consideration community decision makers weigh when choosing how and whether to establish resilience policy. Using a case study approach, we examine the governance, organizational, management, and policy making processes and the involvement of scientific advice in designing and implementing resilience policy in three U.S. communities: Los Angeles, CA; Norfolk, VA; and Flagstaff, AZ. Disaster mitigation or resilience initiatives were developed and deployed in each community with differing levels and types of scientific engagement. Engagement spanned from providing technical support with traditional risk assessment to direct engagement with community decision makers and design of community resilience outreach. Best practices observed include embedding trusted, independent scientific advisors with strong community credibility within local government agencies, use of interdisciplinary and interdepartmental expert teams with management and technical skillsets, and establishing scientifically-informed disaster and hazard scenarios to enable community outreach. Case study evidence suggest science communication and engagement within and across municipal government agencies and scientifically-informed direct engagement with community stakeholders are effective approaches and roles that disaster risk scientists can fill to support resilience policy development.",

This is especially of concern for private and public water supplies in agricultural areas of Wisconsin where land spreading of livestock waste occurs on thin soils overlaying fractured bedrock. Current microbial source tracking (MST) methods for source identification requires the use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. Due to cost, these tests are often not an option for homeowners, municipalities or state agencies with limited resources. The Water and Environmental Analysis Laboratory sought to develop chemical methods to provide lower cost processes to determine sources of fecal waste using fecal sterols, pharmaceuticals (human and veterinary) and human care/use products in ground and surface waters using solid phase extraction combined with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. The two separate techniques allow for the detection of fecal sterol and other chemical markers in the sub part per billion-range. Fecal sterol ratios from published sources were used to evaluate drinking water samples and wastewater from onsite waste treatment systems and municipal wastewater treatment plants. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products indicative of human waste included: acetaminophen, caffeine, carbamazepine, cotinine, paraxanthine, sulfamethoxazole, and the artificial sweeteners; acesulfame, saccharin, and sucralose. The bovine antibiotic sulfamethazine was also targeted. Well water samples with suspected fecal contamination were analyzed for fecal sterols and PPCPs. Results were compared to traditional MST results from the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene. Chemical indicators were found in 6 of 11 drinking water samples, and 5 of 11 were in support of MST results. Lack of detection of chemical indicators in samples contaminated with fecal waste supports the need for confirmatory methods and advancement of chemical indicator detection technologies.",

The current rapid increase in water use is considered unsustainable and threatens human life. In our previous study (Yoshikawa et al., 2014 in HESS), we estimated the time-varying dependence of water requirements from water supply sources during past and future periods using the global water resources model, H08. The sources of water requirements were specified using four categories: rivers, large reservoirs, medium-size reservoirs, and non-local non-renewable blue water (NNBW). We also estimated ΔNNBW which is defined as an increase in NNBW from the past to the future. From the results, we could require the further development of water supply sources in order to sustain future water use. For coping with water scarcity using ΔNNBW, there is need for adaptation measure. To address adaptation measures, we need to set adaptation options which can be divided between ‘Supply enhancement’ and ‘Demand management’. The supply enhancement includes increased storage, groundwater development, inter-basin transfer, desalination and re-use urban waste water. Demand management is defined as a set of actions controlling water demand by reducing water loss, increasing water productivity, and water re-allocation. In this study, we focus on estimating further future water demand under taking into account of several adaptation measures using H08 model.",

A key question in INFLUX is the relative contributions of methane emissions from the local gas distribution system in comparison to biogenic sources, such as the wastewater treatment system and landfills, and of end use emissions from furnaces and other combustion devices downstream of customer gas meters. During February and March, 2015, the Aerodyne van was used to measure methane, ethane, CO2 and other trace gases during mobile sampling traverses through a number of urban and suburban Indianapolis neighborhoods. Signatures of distinct natural gas emissions, biogenic emissions, and combustion emissions were observed in small plumes. In a number of cases, these sources were identified as manhole covers in city streets, where nearby leaks can seep into the local wastewater system. Quantification of ethane and methane from 45 manholes reveal that some had emissions that were clearly biogenic while others had a distinct natural gas signature. This paper describes the results from the analysis of these mobile data in the context of the current Indianapolis methane emission inventory.",

Speleothem stable isotopes are widely used for climate reconstruction, but the isotope-climate relationship is complex in arid-region precipitation, and within-cave processes further complicate climate interpretations. Our isotope results from 3 southeastern Arizona caves, spanning the past 3.5-12 kyr, collectively indicate a weakening monsoon from 7kyr to present. These records exhibit substantial multidecadal-multicentury variability that is sometimes shared, and sometimes independent among caves. Strategies to overcome ambiguities in isotope records include long-term monitoring of cave dripwaters, multi-site comparisons, and multiproxy measurements. Monthly dripwater measurements from two caves spanning several years highlight substantial seasonal biases that create distinct differences in the climate sensitivity of individual cave records. These biases can lead to lack of correlation between records, but also creates opportunities for seasonally specific moisture reconstructions. New preliminary analyses suggest that elemental data can help to unravel the multivariate signal contained in speleothem oxygen isotope records.",

            "abstract": "The ocean is a significant sink for carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning, absorbing roughly a third of human CO2 emitted over the industrial period. This has implications not only for climate but also for the chemical and isotopic composition of the ocean. Human activities have increased the ocean radiocarbon content through nuclear bomb tests in the 1950s-60s, which released a large amount of radiocarbon (14C) into the atmosphere, but fossil fuel emissions are decreasing the radiocarbon content through the release of 14C-depleted CO2. Here, we use the ECCO-v4 ocean state estimate to examine the changing nature of the air-sea flux of radiocarbon and its spatial distribution in the ocean in response to past and future CO2 emissions, the latter taken from the the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) database used in IPCC simulations. In line with previous studies we find that the large air-sea gradient of 14C induced by nuclear bomb testing led to rapid accumulation of radiocarbon in the surface ocean. Surface fluxes of 14C have considerably weakened over the past several decades and in some areas 14C is being returned to the atmosphere. As fossil fuel emissions continue to reduce the atmospheric 14C/C ratio (∆14C), in most RCP scenarios the total ocean 14C inventory starts decreasing by 2030. With strong emissions, the Δ14C of surface waters is driven to increasingly negative values and in RCP 8.5 by 2100 much of the surface ocean has apparent radiocarbon ages in excess of 2000 years, with subtropical gyres more depleted in 14C than the Southern Ocean. Surface waters become significantly more negative in Δ14C than underlying waters. As a result, turning conventional tracer oceanography on its head, recently ventilated waters are characterized by more negative Δ14C values. Similar patterns can be expected for CFCs in the ocean as atmospheric concentrations decrease over the next several decades. Our results have a number of implications, notably for current and planned ocean observation programs, as well as ongoing efforts to exploit radiocarbon to quantify changes in ocean ventilation in response to anthropogenic climate change.",

This plume is drained by several rivers to the Pacific Ocean after flowing through less contaminated, but densely inhabited coastal plains. As the redistribution of radionuclide contaminated sediment could expose the local population to higher radiation rates, novel fingerprinting methods were developed to trace the downstream dispersion of contaminated sediment.\nFirst, the heterogeneous deposition of metastable silver-110 (110mAg) across these coastal catchments was used to investigate sediment migration. In particular, the 110mAg/137Cs activity ratio was measured in soils and river sediment demonstrating the occurrence of a seasonal cycle of soil erosion during typhoons and spring snowmelt in 2011 and 2012. However, due to the rapid decay of 110mAg (half-life of 250 days), alternative methods were required to continue tracking sediment from 2013 onwards. One promising method includes the analyses of plutonium isotopes to further understand sediment migration in the Fukushima region. For example, 241Pu/239Pu atom ratios measured in sediment collected in Fukushima coastal rivers shortly after the accident were shown to be significantly higher (0.0017 – 0.0884) than corresponding values attributed to the global fallout (0.00113 ± 0.00008). Additional analyses were conducted on sediment sampled in 2013 and 2014 after the start of decontamination works. These analyses show that the 241Pu/239Pu atom ratios decreased towards the global fallout values in rivers draining decontaminated paddy fields, demonstrating the effectiveness of remediation works.",

In particular, the AHP enabled the assess the salience, legitimacy, and credibility of the information produced for all involved.

We will report on preliminary mapping results for the Ac-H-2 Coniraya Quadrangle based on Framing Camera (FC) mosaics from the Dawn Approach (1.3 km/px) and Survey (415 m/px) orbits. This quadrangle is located between 21-66°N and 0-90°E and is dominated by mostly highly degraded impact craters of diameters between 50 and 200 km and clusters of small- to midsize impact craters. Color data show that this quadrangle is generally darker than most regions of the southern hemisphere. Two prominent impact craters in this quadrangle have been named Coniraya and Gaue crater, respectively. Coniraya is the largest more or less intact impact crater with a diameter of 136 km, centered at 65.8°N/40.5°E. It appears shallow and its crater rim is heavily degraded but still continuous. At the current image resolution, textural differences between the interior and exterior of the crater are not visible. With a diameter of 84 km, Gaue crater appears to be the freshest large impact crater in this quadrangle. It is located at the eastern border of the Coniraya Quadrangle with a small central peak at 30°N/85.7°E. The crater rim is quite sharp and the ejecta blanket can be traced around the crater to a distance of ~200km from the crater center. Most of the crater floor around the central peak is covered by a smooth uniform unit with a lower impact crater population than the surrounding surfaces. Color data show that this smooth unit is darker than the surrounding surfaces. A similar unit can be found on the floor of a complex cluster of 10-56 km diameter craters at 32°N/40°E. With upcoming higher resolution data we will refine our geologic map and will specifically investigate possible formation processes of these smooth units.",

The NOx mixing ratios show a clear annual cycle; average (±1σ) NO and NO2 mixing ratios during austral spring, summer and autumn were 1±2, 5±5, 2±2 pptv and 1±4, 4±5, 2±4 pptv, respectively. During winter darkness NO and NO2 mixing ratios remained below the limit of detection of 2 and 4.6 pptv, respectively. Average (±1σ) NOx fluxes estimated for selected periods during austral spring (12th – 15th October 2007), summer (16th – 19th December 2007), autumn (21st – 24th February 2007) and winter (11th -13th June 2007) were 1.3±1.6 x1012, 1.1±0.8 x1012, 1.1±2 x1012 and -1.2±0.6 x1012 molecule m-2 s-1, respectively. Emissions of NOx from snow during the sunlit season are expected due to photolysis of nitrate present in surface snow. Surprisingly, the NOx flux in summer was almost comparable to that in spring and fall even though measured nitrate photolysis rate coefficients during summer were 3 times those during the seasons with less available sunlight. Relatively small summer time NOx flux is attributed to reduced upward mixing of snow emissions. Convective mixing during austral spring (February) and fall (October) resulted in a 2 to 4 fold increase in NOx flux when compared to conditions when mixing was dominated by mechanical shear. In contrast, the near absence of convection due to cloudy skies during summer (December) reduces atmospheric turbulence and therefore, the snow to air NOx flux, which is very likely a typical feature of the atmospheric boundary layer in coastal Antarctica.",

This study uses the results of a combined correlation coefficient and empirical orthogonal function analysis to study sea surface temperature anomaly dipoles with inter-annual periodicity, and explore seasonal variability. Previous work has shown that this dipole behavior has remained stable for at least the last century [Reischmann et al., 2014. Previous work has also shown that polar climate dipoles display a clear transfer function on a millennial scale for the last 80,000 years [Oh et al., 2014]. This transfer function has been rigorously tested, demonstrating the usefulness of the method of spectral deconvolution for linearly related climate systems. Here we present different time scales of dipole behavior, their impacts on local climates, and discuss what methods of connection can allow them to remain sustained on a centennial or millennial scale. Multiple climate proxies are necessary to study these time scales and their impacts, from weekly satellite observations which have been extended to a centennial scale via multiple models, to annual or multi-annual lake sediment and dendrochronology records with larger sampling rates and absolute dating uncertainty. Analysis techniques such as spectral deconvolution will make use of the linear nature of these dipole connections to study the energy transfer functions and their physical implications. The longest scale results of this study may be compared to the work establishing the synchronized nature of the polar climates on the millennial scale.",

This study aims to establish a framework for hydrological data assimilation with GRACE. GRACE is an independent and accurate but coarse resolution terrestrial water storage dataset. While the models cannot attain the accuracy of GRACE, they are effective in interpretation and downscaling of the product and providing continuity over space and time. Accurate assimilation of GRACE TWS into LSMs thus will take the best characteristics of each and create a combined product that outperforms each individual source.\nMore specifically, this framework entails a comprehensive analysis of the deficiencies and potential improvements of the satellite data products, the assimilation procedures and error characterization, and assimilation effectiveness. A daily sliding window mascon GRACE TWS product, presented previously, was developed to reduce smoothing in time and space during assimilation into the Community Land Model 4.0. The Ensemble Kalman Filter assimilation algorithms are analyzed and adapted for use with the new products, GRACE error information, and model characteristics. Additional assimilation tools such as Gaspari-Cohn localization and ensemble inflation are implemented and tuned for the model and observation properties. Analysis of the observational data, model data, sensitivity and effectiveness of the assimilation routines, and the assimilated results is done through regional comparison with independent in-situ datasets and external model results.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying ocean heat content and its change is essential for understanding the response of the climate system to radiative forcing because the oceans are the dominant reservoir of heat on Earth. Here we investigate the 2005-2014 ocean heat content change inferred by Argo gridded products provided by three different groups. Overall, we demonstrate a good agreement among the different products despite a few discrepancies at global and regional scales. We found a decadal increase of ocean heat content of 8.19 +/- 0.68 J/yr. This corresponds to an ocean heat uptake of 0.74 +/- 0.06 W/m2, in good agreement with the IPCC-AR5 estimate report of 0.71W/m2 for 1993-2010. As the Argo coverage is not perfect (coastal regions, marginal seas and semi-enclosed seas are not well sampled by the floats), we compare the global ocean heat content (0-2000m) with and without the aforementioned regions using the ORAS4 ocean reanalysis and find no significant differences between the two estimates. We then show that the Southern hemisphere explains about 90% of the net global ocean heat content increase during 2005-2014 while the Northern hemisphere shows large interannual variability and explains only 10% of the net increase. We also find that the maximum warming is centered at 40°S with two main structures located in the Indian and Pacific oceans, suggesting a possible heat penetration due to the wind-driven mean ocean circulation. We finally compare the annually averaged ocean heating rates with the net TOA flux inferred by CERES and the atmospheric reanalysis ERA-Interim. We find that ocean heating rates show large interannual variability associated with a large spread around the mean estimate (based on the three gridded T/S products). We confirm that the mean ocean heating rate is comparable to the net TOA flux for the last decade within observational uncertainties. However, we find a discrepancy for 2013 that could be due to unsampled regions and/or the significant contribution to another climate reservoir.",

Indeed, recent advances [LeBorgne et. al. PRL, 110, 204501, 2013] in the prediction of mixing and scalar dissipation require the distribution of fluid deformation rates as quantitative inputs. However, these measures are often difficult to link to medium properties or statistical heterogeneity controls. To advance this problem, we present a novel Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) to model stochastic evolution of the 3D fluid deformation tensor in a Protean (streamline) coordinate frame. This approach allows topological constraints imposed by the flow kinematics to be naturally obeyed, and furthermore flow features that generate non-Fickian transport can be clearly elucidated. For simple flows, this framework allows the distribution of deformation rates (and hence mixing) to be expressed in terms of heterogenenity controls, and for more complex flows, this approach clearly identifies what flow features govern anomalous transport and how their statistics can be measured as model inputs.",

In the past three decades, although >1600 field manipulative experiments have been conducted globally to explore the response of terrestrial ecosystem to global changes, their findings have not been widely used for facilitating model evaluation or development. Here, we present two examples using experimental studies to benchmark terrestrial ecosystem models. First, we evaluated seven models (GDAY, ORCHIDEE, CABLE, SDGVM, JULES, TECO, and OCN) on their simulated responses of ecosystem carbon storage capacity to CO2 elevation based on results from six Free-Air CO2 enrichment (FACE) experiments in North America. We further applied a traceability analysis to trace the model-to-model difference in CO2 effect on ecosystem carbon storage capacity back to the key processes and parameters in the models. Second, we evaluated two models (DAYCENT and TECO) on their simulated responses of ecosystem CO2 fluxes to experimental warming and increasing precipitation in a temperate steppe in northern China. We found although the models can be tuned to mimic the CO2 dynamics observed by the local eddy flux tower and in the control plots, they cannot well capture the observed experimental effects of warming and increasing precipitation. These results indicate that the widely distributed field experiments can provide useful benchmarks for facilitating evaluation and improvements of terrestrial ecosystem models.",

Our work aims to improve understanding of the atmospheric degradation of fluorotelomer precursor compounds to form the long-chain PFCAs PFOA (C8) and PFNA (C9).\nUsing the atmospheric chemical transport model GEOS-Chem, which uses assimilated meteorology to simulate the atmospheric transport of trace gas species, we investigate the interaction of the atmospheric formation of PFCAs and the atmospheric transport of their precursor species. Our simulations are a first application of the GEOS-Chem framework to PFCA chemistry. We highlight the importance of the spatial and temporal variability of background atmospheric chemical conditions experienced during transport.

These datasets have great potential to advance the prediction of snow hydrology in particular but have had little testing in areas of shallow snowcover. To assess the utility and possibilities of UAV data products for quantifying and predicting the properties and processes of shallow snowcovers, an intensive field campaign took place during the 2015 melt season in a prairie agricultural field in Saskatchewan, Canada. The wheat field with standing stubble (15-35cm) had little topographic relief, a shallow snow (peak <40cm) and became patchy as snowcovered area declined during melt. Over the 25-day melt period 24 flights were performed with a Sensefly Ebee UAV to map the 120 hectare area. Structure from motion techniques, as implemented in Postflight Terra 3D software, generated DSMs and orthomosaics at a 3.5 cm resolution. Orthomosaic analysis quantified snowcovered area at unprecedented accuracy and frequency allowing for new insights into the spatial characteristics of the snowcover depletion process. However, vertical errors of the DSMs were significant (root mean square error of 10-20cm) compared to snow depth, making any comparisons of DSMs too uncertain to be useful for estimating ablation directly. In contrast, the relative accuracy of the DSMs was sufficient to calculate a DSM roughness index that relates to the coefficient of variation of snow water equivalent (SWE), as measured from intensive ground measurements. The DSM roughness index alone can predict the shape of the snow depletion curve and, if used in conjunction with point measured or modelled SWE, can calculate the SWE frequency distribution and snowcover depletion. It is proposed that UAV derived surface roughness, in conjunction with point modelled or observed SWE can provide a simple method to predict areal snowcover depletion without undertaking extensive manual snow surveying, even in shallow snowpack environments where direct measurement of snow surface ablation from UAVs is not possible.",

The objective of this contribution is to position the characterization of NEOs within the public policy process domain as a means to reflect on the science-policy nexus in regard to risks associated with NEOs. This will be accomplished through, first, a brief overview of the science-policy nexus, followed by a discussion of several policy process frameworks, such as agenda setting and the multiple streams model, focusing events, and punctuated equilibrium, and their application and appropriateness to the problem of NEOs. How, too, for example, does NEO hazard and risk compare with other low probability, high risk, hazards in regard to public policy?

Here we attempt to directly quantify the pattern and magnitude of calving and melt at the front of Store Glacier, a major outlet draining the western sector of the Greenland ice sheet. Integration of range-survey technologies on a robust, heavy displacement marine platform coupled with high-resolution photogrammetry allowed the production of accurate, ~m resolution 3d digital terrain models (DTMs) of the glacier front. A swath-interferometric sonar system calibrated via an inertial motion unit stabilized with RTK GPS and vector-compass data-streams was combined with photogrammetric processing of repeat UAV surveys. The results of three repeat surveys across the front of Store Glaciers in 2012 is presented during which significant ice flow, melt and calving events were imaged, complimented with AWS, on-ice GPS stations and time-lapse/video camera sequences. The residual of successive DTMs yield the 3d pattern of frontal change allowing the processes calving and melt to be quantified and constrained in unprecedented detail. The pattern of submarine melt is further validated against indirect estimates of submarine melt derived from oceanographic circulation measurements within the fjord.",

We call this feature as “Diffuse Interplanetary Radio Emission (DIRE)”. The DIRE events are generally associated with intense interplanetary type II radio bursts produced by shocks driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs). DIREs drift like type II bursts in the dynamic spectra, but the drifting feature consist of a series of short-duration spikes (similar to a type I chain). DIREs occur at higher frequencies than the associated type II bursts, with no harmonic relationship with the type II burst. The onset of DIREs is delayed by several hours from the onset of the eruption. Comparing the radio dynamic spectra with white-light observations from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) mission, we find that the CMEs are generally very energetic (fast and mostly halos). We suggest that the DIRE source is typically located at the flanks of the CME-driven shock that is still at lower heliocentric distances.",

This transition and also the formation of garnetite at greater depth (>10 GPa) have been investigated closely in experiments under hydrostatic conditions. However studies of naturally occurring eclogites indicate concurrent plastic deformation and deviatoric stresses during the phase transition may influence the microstructures as well as the rheology of the forming eclogite. In the present project we aim to investigate the influence of plastic deformation on the gabbro to eclogite transition in a simplified basaltic material as well as the transition of eclogite to garnetite at higher pressures.\nStarting materials with a simplified CMNAS composition were synthesized from glass in piston cylinder experiments at 0.5/3 GPa and 950-1000°/1200°C respectively, yielding fine grained (~10-20μm) mixtures of orthopyroxene, clinopyroxene and plagioclase ('gabbro') and omphacite, garnet and quartz ('eclogite'). Transformation experiments were then performed in a pressure range from 3 to 12 GPa at 1200°C in a Dia-type mulitanvil press with six independently movable rams. Pure shear deformation of up to 30% was imposed in the deformation runs with strain rates ranging from 5x10-5 to 5x10-6 sec-1. For comparison static transformation experiments were performed with the same duration (100 to 1000 min). The reaction of the crystalline starting materials was generally sluggish and relatively large overstepping of phase boundaries was needed to induce notable reaction progress as determined by SEM-EDS, -EBSD and EPMA. Preliminary results suggest that concurrent deformation enhanced reaction progress in comparison to static experiments for both investigated transitions, however more experiments are needed to quantify this effect. Deformation was accommodated by intracrystalline plasticity of omphacite as well as diffusion assisted grain (phase) boundary sliding. In the samples deformed at high pressures also garnets developed subgrain structures and dispersions of the crystal lattice orientation consistent with the external deformation geometry indicating intracrystalline plasticity during growth.",

Groundwater is extensively used in the city to compensate for the limited public water supply network and therefore the risk to public health from a rise in NO3- concentration is high. NO3- has been identified as a cofactor for methemoglobinemia in infants, a disease which can lead to death in extreme cases.\n The NO3- levels detected are still below regulatory limits for drinking purposes but strategies are necessary to contain the growing problem. To this end, the main sources and pathways of inorganic compounds containing nitrogen (N) – i.e. nitrate, nitrite (NO2-) and ammonium (NH4+) - were investigated. We combined 3 years of field measurements in the Ciliwung River, the major river flowing through Jakarta, with a distributed river-aquifer interaction model to characterize the N-cycle in both systems and quantify the contribution of river infiltration in the overall groundwater N budget. The computed infiltration fluxes were compared to estimates of leaks from poorly maintained septic tanks, which are extensively used in the city, to identify the main source of groundwater contamination.\n Observations show a strong and interdependent spatial and seasonal variability in the levels of NO3-, NO2- and NH4+ in the river, which is caused by changes in nitrification/denitrification rates due to variations in dissolved oxygen concentrations. Simulation results suggest that such dynamics in the river cause river to aquifer contamination patterns to likewise change over space and time, which leads to heterogeneous vulnerability distributions. The estimated contribution of river-N infiltration to the observed NO3- groundwater levels is small if compared to that originating from all leaking septic tanks inside Jakarta. However, in the vicinity of the Ciliwung, river to groundwater N-loading can play an important role in the local NO3- groundwater levels because it is highly concentrated.",

Although the model results show a similar trend of mass loss, the model responses are not always homogeneous. This may an effect of different employed e.g. numerics, approximation to the Stokes flow, spatial resolution, and initialization methods (spin-up).\nHere, we use the thermomechanical coupled Ice Sheet System model (ISSM) to re-run the SeaRISE experiments using different spin-up strategies. The spatial resolution is kept constant and the higher-order approximation to the Stokes flow is employed. As a first approach we use an inverse method and data assimilation for the basal friction to match present day condition. In contrast to this simulation, we also perform spin-ups with climatic forcing and different parameters for a non-linear sliding law. The simulation results are compared in order to examine the difference in future mass loss.",

Here we examine acoustic emission (AE) records of rock cracking in boulders sitting on the ground in humid-temperate (~1 year of data) and semi-arid (~3 years) locations. We compare on-site average ambient daily temperature for days in which cracking occurs to the average temperatures for those dates derived from local climate records. The temperatures characterizing days on which cracking occurs is similar for both stations (range = -10 C to +30 C); where 21% and 73% of cracking occurs on hot days (> 20C) in the humid and semi-arid climates respectively while 17% and 0.1% occurs on very cold days (-8C to -3C). When days during which cracking occurs are compared to climate averages, 81% (NC) and 51% (NM) of all cracking occurs on days with absolute temperature anomalies >1, regardless of the temperature. The proportion of cracking that occurs on anomalously hot or cold days rises to 92% and 77% when the data is normalized to account for uneven sampling of the days with extreme temperatures. In order to determine to what extent this trend holds true in a more complex setting, we examined an existing 100+ year record of rock falls from Yosemite Valley. Preliminary results, although more equivocal, are consistent with the boulder cracking AE data. We examine the AE datasets in the context of our previous numerical modeling of insolation-driven thermal stress in rock and hypothesize that there is an increased potential for fracture on days with extreme temperatures because 1) thermal-stress is dependent on temperature variance from far-field and/or average rock temperatures and 2) that days with climatologically extreme air temperatures result in maximums in such variance. An implication of our results is that environments with extreme weather variability may have higher thermal breakdown rates, including certain locations today and perhaps more as climate changes.",

In this study we relate the channel recovery path to the quantity and caliber of sediment introduced due to dam construction/removal or erosion caused by flooding. We suggest that the recovery path of a channel depends on the availability of sediment of a size that is transported as bedload during bankfull flows (the “mobile fraction”). We define a ratio, S*, of the sediment volume added to the channel because of the disturbance to the average annual sediment flux. We compare S* values to the recovery path of New England gravel-bedded streams following two dam emplacements and removals and flooding related to Tropical Storm Irene. Pelham Dam in Pelham, MA (removed 2012) and Kendrick Dam in Pittsford, VT (removed 2014) were on similar streams: drainage areas ~25 km2, slopes 1-2%, and bankfull widths ~10 m. Sediment was excavated from both impoundments prior to removal, resulting in lower S* values. Irene-affected study sites are on ~10 gravel-bedded streams in VT, NH, and MA. Sediment input at these sites is due to bank failures and landslides, many of which continue to supply sediment to the channel four years after flooding. To track recovery we collected annual topographic and sediment size data and calculated Shields numbers to determine if channels had reached an equilibrium form. We define equilibrium for bedload rivers as Shields numbers at bankfull discharge equal to that required to initiate bedload transport. Following dam emplacements the channels failed to recover because mobile sediment was unavailable. Fining dominated the recovery at Irene-affected sites (~10% reduction in sediment size) and dam removal sites (up to 30-60% reduction) with little post-disturbance change in channel geometry, possibly due to the limited mobile fraction.",

And they are equally important factor in the loss mechanisms of the same particles. To properly model the radiation belts and these wave particle interactions it is necessary to define the distributions of the wave amplitudes and power. Some theories suggest the wave particle interaction processes are impulsive and therefore influenced more by the largest of wave field strengths, where as other models imply a more stochastic effect and thus dictated by consistent wave power. Likely both processes are in effect, and therefore understanding the distributions and occurrences of both the largest amplitudes and distributive wave mode power are important.

ERE s have killed tens of thousands of people and severely affected millions of people in the past decade alone in India.\nCurrent evidence suggests that the dynamics of the IM, as well as the corresponding frequency and magnitude of daily EREs are changing (Krishnaswamy et al 45(1-2), 175-184, Climate Dynamics 2014).Variability in the Indian monsoon (IM)and associated rain intensitiesis known to be modulated by two ocean atmosphere phenomena, El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). This is compounded by changes in the hydrological cycle due to global warming. There is growing evidence that the proportion of moderate rains have declined and those of sparse and more intense rains have increased. We investigated the role of La Nina and IOD on the time-aggregated as well as time-evolving distribution of daily rain intensities India using data from rain gauges and gridded rain data. We applied dynamic linear models, generalized linear and additive to compare the relative influence of La Nina and IOD on frequency of different daily rain exceedance levels (25, 50,100,150 and 200 mm day-1) as well as trends since 1950.\nOur results indicate that La Nina has a very significant influence on annual frequency of moderate rain intensities (<100 mm day-1), whereas IOD has a greater influence on annual proportion of total rain accounted for by rain intensities above 100 and 150 mm day-1. The observed declining role of La Nina in India in recent decades, potentially more moisture availability under climate change, and the strengthening of the IOD due to warming of the Western Indian Ocean could strengthen the shift towards more extreme rain events in the coming decades.",

            "abstract": "The legacy of wildfire is recorded in the geologic record, due to the stability of charcoal. Well-preserved charcoal is abundant in paleo-soils and sediments, documenting paleo-fires affecting even the earliest land plants. The dominant role of fire in shaping the biosphere is evidenced by some 40% of the land surface which is occupied by fire-prone and fire-adapted biomes: boreal forest, savanna, grassland, and Mediterranean shrubland. While fire ecologists appreciate the role that fire played in the evolution of these ecosystems, and climate scientists appreciate the role of these biomes in the regulation of Earth’s climate, our understanding of the system of fire-vegetation-climate feedbacks is poor. This knowledge gap exists because we lack tools for evaluating change in fire regimes of the past for which climate proxy records exist. Fire regime is a function of fire frequency and fire intensity. Although fire frequency estimates are available from laminated sediment and tree ring records, tools for estimating paleo-fire intensity are lacking. We have recently developed a chemical proxy for fire intensity that is based upon the molecular structure of charcoal, assessed using solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The molecular dimensions of aromatic domains in charcoal increased linearly (R2 = 0.9) with the intensity (temperature x duration) of heating. Our initial field-based validation in prescribed fires shows a promising correlation (R2 = 0.7) between the proxy-based estimates and thermistor-based measurements of fire intensity. This presentation will discuss the competencies and potential limitations of this novel proxy.",

            "abstract": "Satellite altimetry has been traditionally used in the past to infer elevation of land ice, quantify changes in ice topography and infer mass balance over large and remote areas such as the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Radar Altimetry (RA) is particularly well suited to this task due to its all-weather year-round capability for observing the ice surface. However, monitoring of ice caps has proven more challenging. The large footprint of a conventional radar altimeter and relatively coarse ground track coverage are less suited to monitoring comparatively small regions with complex topography, so that mass balance estimates from RA rely on extrapolation methods to regionalize elevation change.\nSince 2010, the Synthetic Interferometric Radar Altimeter (SIRAL) on board the ESA radar altimetry CryoSat mission has collected ice elevation measurements over ice caps. Ground track interspacing (~4km at 60°) is one order of magnitude smaller than ERS/ENVISAT missions and half of ICESAT’s, providing dense spatial coverage. Additionally the Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometric (SARIn) mode of CryoSat provides a reduced footprint and the ability to locate accurately the position of the surface reflection. Conventional altimetry provides the elevation of the Point Of Closest Approach (POCA) within each waveform, every 250 m along the flight path. Time evolution of POCA elevation is then used to investigate ice elevation change.\nHere, we present an assessment of the geodetic mass balance of Icelandic ice caps using a novel processing approach, swath altimetry, applied to CryoSat SARIn mode data. In swath mode altimetry, elevation beyond the POCA is extracted from the waveform when coherent echoes are present providing between one and two orders of magnitude more elevations when compared to POCA. We generate maps of ice elevation change that are then used to compute geodetic mass balance for the period 2010 to 2015. We compare our results to estimates generated using only POCA as well as to validation datasets, and we discuss the impact of swath mode altimetry on the spatial resolution and precision of the resulting elevation change and mass balance estimates.",

Through observation of anomalous transmission of VHF electromagnetic (EM) waves beyond line-of-sight, appearance of anomalies in the atmosphere before earthquakes (EQs) has been verified. In the present paper the observations of Atmospheric parameters such as Atmospheric Temperature, relative humidity and Atmospheric refractivity and its variation prior to the Earthquake are presented. In order to identify the anomalies in atmospheric parameters we analyzed the data for a period of seven years (2009=2015) around the Nepal Earthquake epicenter. The mean and standard deviation of the atmospheric parameters were obtained; it is observed that the increase in atmospheric temperature before 1 day of the Earthquake was found to be the highest in all the seven years. The temperature was higher than the M+2σ. The similar results were obtained for atmospheric refractivity.",

            "abstract": "The origin of the seismic velocity anomalies imaged by tomography models is still under debate. Could it be mainly thermal? Which part is due to compositional differences? One of the main recent scientific advances is the design of new higher-resolution tomography models. The amplitude of the velocity anomalies from these new models is much larger than the amplitude of the previous generation of tomography models. Another major scientific advance is the assembly of thermodynamic databases, which allow a more realistic interpretation of tomography models. When we couple the new tomography models with thermodynamic constraints and assume a purely thermal origin for the seismic velocity variations, we obtain lateral temperature variations on the order of ±1000K. This unrealistic range forces us to consider the effect of compositional variation on seismic velocities. Within this study we explore a wide range of mantle compositions and derive for each of them the physical properties, such as the seismic velocities, densities and temperatures. We provide a range of possible mantle structures, with different partitioning between thermal and chemical origin, in agreement with the observed seismic velocities and the thermodynamic constraints.",

            "abstract": "How carbon cycles are regulated by temperature remains a substantial uncertainty in our understanding of how watersheds will respond to ongoing climate change. Aquatic ecosystems are significant components of carbon flux to the atmosphere and ocean, yet we have limited understanding of how changing thermal regimes will alter rates of ecosystem metabolic processes, and, therefore, aquatic contributions to carbon cycles at watershed to global scales. Watershed geomorphology controls the landscape-scale distribution of organic material that can form the metabolic base of aquatic ecosystems, which will likely affect the temperature sensitivity of aquatic ecosystem metabolism. Across 23 streams in a boreal river basin, we estimated how temperature sensitivity of ecosystem respiration (ER), an important component of the aquatic C cycle, varied among streams with different watershed characteristics. We found that geomorphic conditions imposed strong ultimate controls on temperature sensitivity: ER in streams draining flat watersheds was much more sensitive to temperature than streams draining steeper watersheds. Further, we show that the link between watershed geomorphology and temperature sensitivity was related to changes in the quality of carbon substrates across the gradient in watershed slope. These results suggest that geomorphic conditions will ultimately control how carbon processing responds to warming climate, thereby affecting carbon transport and storage, and likely food web responses, in river networks.",

The experimental setup is a rectangular container filled with a saturated sediment column overlaid by a dyed water layer. Air is injected centrally from the bottom of the container. The quantification of the total concentration uptake inside the sediment layer has been carried out experimentally using image processing technique. The spread of dye concentration from the overlying water into the sediment layer showed two distinct patterns, i.e. a conically developing shape for fine sand and horizontal front propagation for the medium and coarse ones. Based on the physical processes involved we introduce a novel pressure boundary condition for numerical simulation of the concentration uptake within the sediment layer that mimicked well the experimental observations. Furthermore, we obtained two empirical relations for the total concentration uptake as well as the dye propagation area as a function of the injected air. This finding plays a significant role for a quantitative estimation of downward flux of organic and particulate matter in the vicinity of gas seeps.",

The observations were recorded around the comet’s perihelion (i.e., ~0.3 AU) during the period $09-16$ March 2013. The HVECs are moving near-radially in the anti-sunward direction with bulk speeds at their initial detection ranging from 200–400 km s-1 followed by an appreciable acceleration up to speeds of 450–600 km s-1, which are typical of slow to intermediate solar wind speeds. The HVECs do not show any significant expansion as they propagate. The while-light images do not provide direct insight into the composition of the expelled clumps, which could potentially be composed of fine, sub-micron dust particles, neutral atoms and molecules, and/or ionized atomic/molecular cometary species. Although solar radiation pressure plays a role in accelerating and size sorting of small dust grains, it cannot accelerate them to velocities >200 km s-1 in the observed time interval of a few hours and distance of <106 km. Further, order of magnitude calculations show that ionized single atoms or molecules accelerate too quickly compared to observations, while dust grains micron sized or larger accelerate too slowly. We find that neutral Na, Li, K, or Ca atoms with β > 50 could possibly fit the observations. Just as likely, we find that an interaction with the solar wind and the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF) can cause the observed clump dynamical evolution, accelerating them quickly up to solar wind velocities. We thus speculate that the HVECs are composed of charged particles (dust particles) or atoms accelerated by radiation pressure at β > 50 values. In addition, the data suggest that clump ejecta initially move along near-radial, bright structures, which then separate into HVECs and larger dust grains that steadily bend backwards relative to the comet's orbital motion due to the effects of solar radiation and gravity. These structures gradually form new striae in the dust tail.",

This eruption was first detected in real time by the newly operational Ocean Observatories Initiative cabled instrumentation at Axial (Delaney, AGU-2015, Wilcock, AGU-2015, Caplan-Auerbach, AGU-2015). Two prior eruptions have been observed since routine observations began in the 1990’s, one in January 1998 and the other in April 2011.\nPrecise water pressure measurements made on the volcano have documented an inflation/deflation cycle within Axial’s summit caldera for the past 15 years. These data are now being supplemented by repeat bathymetric mapping by AUV. The long-term pattern appears to be “inflation predictable”, in which eruptions are triggered at or near the same level of inflation. This pattern allowed us to successfully forecast in September 2014 that the next eruption was expected to occur at Axial sometime in 2015 (a 1-year time window). It is noteworthy that the rate of inflation between the 2011 and 2015 eruptions was about 4 times higher than between the 1998 and 2011 eruptions (60 cm/yr vs. 15 cm/yr).\nSubsidence at the caldera center began at 06:00 on 24 April (all times GMT) and amounted to 2.2 m by 02:00 on 25 April (20 hours in), 2.4 m by 00:00 on 28 April, and 2.45 m by 05 May when subsidence ended and re-inflation began (which has continued ever since). This amount of subsidence is similar to that observed during the 2011 eruption, but in 2015 the initial rate of subsidence was higher (11 cm/hr during the first 20 hours vs. 7 cm/hr in 2011) and the duration appears to have been longer (11 days vs. 6 days). Also, the 1998 and 2011 eruptions occurred along the southeastern edge of the caldera and along Axial’s south rift zone, whereas the 2015 eruption occurred along the north rift zone (Kelley, AGU-2015). Here we present preliminary results of our August 2015 post-eruption geodetic survey and response cruise. In 2013 we increased our network of geodetic stations at Axial, which will provide us with more resolution in modeling the movement of magma associated with the eruption and subsequent recharge. We will also present preliminary maps of the new lava flows.",

HW has its maximum frequency over central eastern China. Over the core region (26°-31°N, 112°-117°E), there are 59 dry HW events occurrence during the past 34 years (1979-2012). Among 59 HW events, 23 events are associated with the dry phase of QBW. The dry phase of QBW corresponds to the low-level anticyclonic anomaly, upper-level cyclonic anomaly and anomalous descent over the HW core region. The circulation anomalies cause the westward extension of the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) and results in extreme dry HW. Further analysis found that the generation of the QBW over the HW core region was associated with both a northwestward propagation of tropical low-level disturbances and an eastward propagation of mid-latitude upper-level disturbances along westerly jet. We also found that the HW frequency over the core region increased from 1.14 times/year to 2.83 times/year, which was essentially attributed to the growth of QBW-associated HW events.",

            "abstract": "Flow and transport of water and solutes within the Critical Zone are coupled to regolith formation. For example, the depth to unweathered bedrock is often related to both near-surface interflow and deep groundwater flow paths. Here, we explore the coupling of flow and reaction at the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (SSHCZO), a first-order catchment developed on shale in Pennsylvania. One important chemical reaction in the watershed is weathering of clay that releases magnesium (Mg) to solution. Two major flowpaths occur in the catchment: 1) deep deoxygenated groundwater flow in the permanently saturated zone, ranging from deeper than 15 m beneath the ridge to 4 –10 m beneath the valley, and 2) oxygenated interflow which transports water through the shallow subsurface. Interflow, mostly constrained to the upper ~6 m, largely leaves the catchment as stream flow. The interflow contribution to the stream carries 80% of the Mg flux from clays. Conversely, 20% of the Mg flux from the catchment is released by chlorite oxidation at 10 to 15 m depth and leaves as deep groundwater flow. Reaction fronts for feldspar and illite lie as nested fronts above the chlorite front. The deepest reaction under the ridge, dissolution of pyrite, is attributed to diffusion of oxygen into rock at the permanent water table. This front is manifested as an increase in sulfur and ferrous iron in drill core material from just below the water table at tens of meters of depth beneath the ridge. In contrast, S and Fe(II) concentrations indicate pyrite oxidation proceeds to 6-8 m under the valley due to oxygen-rich interflow. It is likely that the depth to which oxygenated interflow water penetrates under the valley governs the dissolution rate of pyrite. Pyrite oxidation is thus the first of a cascade of reactions that lead to regolith production under the catchment. In turn, transformation of bedrock to regolith impacts porosity and permeability and water flowpaths. Geomorphological incision at the valley floor may even be initiated by the mixing of interflow and groundwater flow under the channel that causes pyrite oxidation.",

            "abstract": "Determining the relative roles of frequent and infrequent events on landscape form and material transport has implications for understanding landscape development, and informs planning and infrastructure decisions. Flooding due to Tropical Storm Irene in 2011 provides a unique opportunity to examine the effects of a rare, major disturbance across a broad area (14,000 km2). Intense flooding caused variable but widespread channel and riparian reconfiguration, including 995 channel-adjacent mass-wasting events, collectively referred to here as landslides, that mostly occurred in glacial deposits. Of these, about half involved reactivation of existing scars. Landslides were generally small, ranging from 60 - 26,000 m2 in planform, and covered less than 0.01 % of land in the region, yet sediment input from landslides alone (131 mm/kyr when integrated over the study area) exceeded inferred local background erosion rates by 60 times. If Irene inputs are included in a thirty-year erosion record, the estimated erosion rate, 7.2 mm/kyr, aligns closely with long-term regional rates of 5-10 mm/kyr. Landslides also input trees to streams, increasing large wood influence on those reaches. Combined wood and sediment inputs contributed to channel changes downstream of landslides. In four years since Irene, terrestrial lidar and suspended sediment sampling has documented continued large wood and sediment input. Erosion occurred on each of seventeen monitored landslides during snowmelt, but is otherwise limited except during intense precipitation and/or flood events. Repeat lidar models have recorded erosion of up to 5,000 m3 on a single slide in one year, including as much as 4000 m3 during a single event. Tree fall on scarps during erosion events creates sediment traps at the base of landslides, contributing to an observed return to equilibrium slopes. Despite trapping, substantial sediment continues to enter streams. Ninety-five suspended sediment samples from forty sites show that landslides remain important sediment sources. Across a range of flows, 2014 - 2015 sediment flux for a given discharge is an order of magnitude higher than pre-Irene flux. Though landslide slope relaxation suggests incipient recovery from Irene, persistent rapid erosion of large wood and sediment indicates that recovery is still on-going.",

            "abstract": "The largest earthquakes in Saudi Arabia occur at the northwestern boundary of the Arabian plate on a system of left-lateral transform faults extending from the Red Sea in the South and North through the Gulf of Aqaba.\nThe last major earthquake along this boundary occurred in November 1995 and in a complex tectonic setting offshore in the Gulf of Aqaba, consisting of several transform faults and pull-apart basins.\nVarious authors have studied this earthquake in the past, either by using geodetic radar (InSAR) or teleseismic (P and S waves) data, and several source models of the earthquake rupture and the active fault segments have been proposed. However, these source models differ significantly from each other and it still remains unclear which fault segments within the Gulf were activated during the event. There are various reasons for these differences. Teleseismic data alone cannot locate the event well, whereas the lack of near field co-seismic displacement data (due to the event’s offshore location) and the quasi north-south oriented strike-slip faulting of the earthquake result in a low SNR in the radar data. Consequently, the uncertainties of inferred model parameters are large and have not been properly estimated so far.\nIn this work, we use radar data from two additional tracks that have not been used before, which provides a more complete displacement field of the earthquake. By using multiple aperture radar interferometry it is possible to better constrain the south-north oriented strike-slip component. In addition, we include both the geodetic data and the teleseismic data in a joint inversion setup allowing combining the strengths of each dataset to constrain the model parameters. By including the full data-variance covariance-matrixes in Bayesian inference sampling, we estimate the model-uncertainties and the related range of likely source models. Consequently, we re-evaluate, which fault segments were activated during the earthquake in the Gulf of Aqaba.\nOur results show that the InSAR data cannot alone properly constrain the parameters of the activated faults within the gulf. In addition, the teleseismic data clearly show that the earthquake consisted of a few sub-events and that the earthquake ruptured from South to North close to the eastern shore of the Gulf of Aqaba.",

One way to mitigate the need to expand landfill sites across NA is waste diversion for use as alternative fuel in industries such as cement manufacture. Currently, waste plastic, tires, waste shingles and other high carbon content waste destined for landfill are being explored, or currently used, as an alternative supplemental fuels for use in cement kilns across NA. While this is an attractive, environmentally sustainable solution, significant knowledge gaps remain in our fundamental understanding of whether these alternative fuels may lead to increased air pollution emissions from cement kilns across NA. The long-term objective of using TEMPO is to advance fundamental understanding of uncharacterized air pollution emissions and to assess the actual or potential environmental and health impacts of these emissions from cement kilns across NA. TEMPO measurements will be made in concert with in-situ observations augmented by air dispersion, land-use regression and receptor modelling. This application of TEMPO follows on from current research on a series of bench scale and pilot studies for Lafarge Canada Inc., that investigated the change in combustion emissions from various mixtures of coal (C), petroleum coke (PC) and non-recyclable alternative fuels. From our work we demonstrated that using an alternative fuel mixture in a cement kiln has potential to reduce emissions of CO2 by 34%; reduce NOx by 80%, and reduce fuel SO2 emissions by 98%. We also provided evidence that there would be a significant reduction in the formation of secondary ground-level ozone (O3) and secondary PM2.5 in downwind stack plumes if alternative waste derived fuels are used. The application of air dispersion, source apportionment, land use regression; together with remote sensing offers a powerful set of tools with the potential to improve air pollution community exposure research in NA. The application of the new NASA TEMPO satellite to track the dispersion of SO2, PM2.5 and NO2 in plumes and secondary O3 and aerosol formation downwind of cement kilns opens up an exciting new avenue of air pollution research in NA.",

            "abstract": "The Miocene was a period of climatic extremes, with indirect records suggesting major retreat and advance of Antarctica's ice sheets. Climatic warmth of the Early Miocene and Miocene Climatic Optimum (MCO; ~17-15 Ma) was followed by cooler conditions and growth of the East Antarctic ice sheet (EAIS) during the middle Miocene Climate Transition (MMCT; ~14-15 Ma). This cooling occured with decreasing CO2 levels and deepening of the CCD. Weathering on Antarctica associated with ice sheet variability likely played a role in global climate, but the temporal and spatial evolution of the EAIS is not constrained well enough to characterize this relationship. We use Pb and Nd isotopes of authigenic Fe-Mn oxide coatings, which preserve bottom water compositions, and associated detrital bulk deep sea sediments, to provide new insights into continental weathering and ice sheet evolution during the Miocene. Comparison of Pb IC’s of coupled detrital and authigenic phases are used to reconstruct chemical weathering patterns. In contrast, Nd IC’s provide insights into bedrock erosion and ocean circulation patterns. Study sites are located on Maud Rise (ODP Sites 689 and 690) in the Atlantic sector, and on Kerguelen Plateau (ODP Site 744) off of Prydz Bay.\nResults reveal increased offsets between seawater and detrital Pb IC’s during the Early Miocene and MCO, and decreased values and offsets during the MMCT and Late Miocene for all three sites, a pattern that is most pronounced at Maud Rise. There is a long-term trend to more unradiogenic Nd IC and more radiogenic Pb IC values of detrital sediments during the MMCT and Late Miocene. Comparison with modern day coretop data suggest this pattern indicates increased supply of local continental material. Our data suggest enhanced chemical weathering accompanied reduced ice volume and high atmospheric CO2 during the Early Miocene and MCO, likely contributing to the drawdown of CO2 that lead to the MMCT, as well as deepening of the CCD. Growth of the EAIS during the MMCT and the Late Miocene resulted in increased input of continental material into the Southern Ocean and reduced chemical weathering. Similarities in the records from these two locations demonstrate these changes were continental in scale, indicating a major role for the EAIS in global climate change during the Miocene.",

            "abstract": "In contrast to the global warming trend and the loss of Arctic sea ice, the Southern Ocean has exhibited a gradual decrease in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and a net expansion of the sea ice cover over recent decades. Moreover, historical simulations with CMIP5 global climate models do not reproduce the observed cooling around Antarctica and, instead, predict slow but steady warming and sea ice loss.\nHere we identify enhanced Ekman transport as a possible mechanism allowing the Southern Ocean to cool. We further discuss the discrepancy between observations and CMIP5 historical simulations. The latter do not represent consistently the strengthening and the poleward shift of the Southern Hemisphere surface westerlies – due to internal variability or an inadequate representation of ozone forcing. We propose that under a realistic evolution of surface winds, CMIP5 models can produce cooling trends around Antarctica with magnitudes and spatial patterns similar to observations. To that end we consider the unforced preindustrial control runs of CMIP5 models and examine periods with multi-decadal trends in the speed and position of the Southern Hemisphere surface westerlies that are comparable to the 1979-2014 trends. Strengthening and southward displacement of surface winds produce an SST dipole around Antarctica: cooling south of 50S and warming in a zonal band along 30-50S, similar to observed patterns. The wind-induced cooling trends in the Southern Ocean are large enough to locally overwhelm the effect of greenhouse gas forcing.\nWe reconcile our findings with those of modeling studies which suggest that poleward intensification of the westerlies leads to warming rather than cooling trends around Antarctica. We show that the Southern Ocean response to a wind perturbation is non-monotonic in time. An initial cooling regime can transition into a warming regime. Some of the inter-model diversity in these fast and slow responses is related to differences in the models’ mean background stratification of the Southern Ocean.",

In particular, an additional emission case named STD case, which combines the most recent issued emission standards for specific industrial sources, is developed for 2012-2014. The inter-annual trends in emissions and VCDs match well except for SO2, and the revised emissions in STD case improve the comparison, implying the benefits of emission control for most recent years. Satellite retrieval error, underestimation of emission reduction and improved atmospheric oxidization caused the differences between emissions and VCDs trend of SO2. Coal-fired power plants play key roles in SO2 and NOX emission reduction. As suggested by VCD and emission inventory, the control of CO in 11th five year plan (FYP) period was more effective than that in the 12th FYP period, while the SO2 appeared opposite. As the new control target added in 12th FYP, NOX emissions have been clearly decreased 4.3 Mt from 2011 to 2014, in contrast to the fast growth before 2011. The inter-annual trends in NO2 VCDs has the poorest correlation with vehicle ownership (R=0.796), due to the staged emission standard of vehicles. In developed regions, transportation has become the main pollutants emission source and we prove this by comparing VCDs of NO2 to VCDs of SO2. Moreover, air quality in mega cities has been evaluated based on satellite observation and emissions, and results indicate that Beijing suffered heavily from the emissions from Hebei and Tianjin, while the local emissions tend to dominate in Shanghai.",

            "abstract": "One of the main benefits of the delay-Doppler altimeter (DDA) is the improved resolution of the system along the satellite track. By means of an unfocussed Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) processing technique, the altimeter footprint along the flight direction can be reduced by an order of magnitude with respect to conventional altimeters. However, with the delay-Doppler processing the resolution improvement occurs only on the along-track direction, while the across-track direction remains pulse-limited. The result is an elongated footprint perpendicular to the satellite flight path.\nThe combination of the effects of several scatterers within the footprint can lead to random variations of the DDA waveforms, preventing conventional retracking techniques from retrieving geophysical parameters from altimeter data. This is particularly significant in the case of sea ice, where the coherent response from leads can completely exceed the response from the actual ice surface.\nWe have developed a processing technique that allows the separation of the coherent and incoherent scattering components from SAR altimetry waveforms. The technique is similar to the one used in imaging SAR systems, and is based in the exploitation of the phase history of coherent targets during their illumination period with the antenna beam.\nFor the development of the technique we have used the CryoSat-2 SAR Mode data. The starting point of our processing is the full bit rate (FBR) I/Q complex echo samples. By accounting for the phase evolution of the static targets in the scene, it is possible to correct the phase of the FBR complex echoes along the aperture, which allows to perform an inter-burst coherent averaging, potentially, as long as the target illumination time. This reduces the incoherent components of the radar signal, which results in a radar waveform that contains only the coherent scattering component. The coherent component can later be removed from the original delay-Doppler waveform.\nFor the case of sea-ice studies this technique can be used to separate the contribution from leads and ice floes, which can potentially be used to determine the sea-ice freeboard. In this paper we present the first results obtained with CryoSat-2 data over the Arctic, that show the potentialities of this technique.",

Here, we apply these new parameterizations within MIT Regional Climate Model (MRCM), a modified version of Regional Climate Model, version 3 (RegCM3) including the land surface scheme Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS) and recently developed parameterizations for the convective cloud cover and convective rainfall. The performance of the new parameterizations with MRCM is evaluated using 21-years regional climate model simulations over the upper Blue Nile basin. The new parameterizations improve the simulations of the water and energy budgets, and the simulations of the shape of the seasonal cycle and magnitude of rainfall over the basin compared to observations. On the other hand, the improvement in the simulations of cloud cover is reflected in the magnitudes of the simulated outgoing longwave radiation and planetary albedo, in comparison to satellite observations. The resulting increase in the net radiation at the surface increases the amount of evapotranspiration, impacting the simulated runoff over the basin bringing it closer to gauge observations.",

            "abstract": "Methane gas flux from the seafloor to atmosphere is an important variable for global carbon cycle and climate models, yet is poorly constrained. Methodologies used to estimate seafloor gas flux commonly employ a combination of acoustic and optical techniques. These techniques often use hull-mounted multibeam echosounders (MBES) to quickly ensonify large volumes of the water column for acoustic backscatter anomalies indicative of gas bubble plumes. Detection of these water column anomalies with a MBES provides information on the lateral distribution of the plumes, the midwater dimensions of the plumes, and their positions on the seafloor. Seafloor plume locations are targeted for visual investigations using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) to determine bubble emission rates, venting behaviors, bubble sizes, and ascent velocities. Once these variables are measured in-situ, an extrapolation of gas flux is made over the survey area using the number of remotely-mapped flares. This methodology was applied to a geophysical survey conducted in 2013 over a large seafloor crater that developed in response to an oil well blowout in 1983 offshore Papua New Guinea. The site was investigated by multibeam and sidescan mapping, sub-bottom profiling, 2-D high-resolution multi-channel seismic reflection, and ROV video and coring operations. Numerous water column plumes were detected in the data suggesting vigorously active vents within and near the seafloor crater (Figure 1). This study uses dual-frequency MBES datasets (Reson 7125, 200/400 kHz) and ROV video imagery of the active hydrocarbon seeps to estimate total gas flux from the crater. Plumes of bubbles were extracted from the water column data using threshold filtering techniques. Analysis of video images of the seep emission sites within the crater provided estimates on bubble size, expulsion frequency, and ascent velocity. The average gas flux characteristics made from ROV video observations is extrapolated over the number of individual flares detected acoustically and extracted to estimate gas flux from the survey area. The gas flux estimate from the water column filtering and ROV observations yields a range of 2.2 – 6.6 mol CH4 / min.",

            "abstract": "Mobility and cycling of mercury (Hg) in soils is important. Hg leaching results in its transport to wetlands, where Hg methylates and bioaccumulates through aquatic food webs. It has been shown that Hg cycle in soil is controlled by organic matter (OM) quantity as well as quality. The latter is indicated by increase of Hg/C ratio as C/N decreases by decomposition. Here we investigate the Hg-C relationship in a temperate forest soil in Hanover, NH, with a focus of examining the control of OM quality on soil Hg accumulation and mobility. We use δ13C as an indicator of carbon quality.\n The soil samples from A, B and C horizons were separated into six particle size fractionations from <25 µm to 1 mm. Both the bulk soil and particle size separates were analyzed for Hg concentrations, carbon content (C%), δ13C, and Hg partition coefficient (Kd =mg gSoil–1/mg Lsolution–1). We found that the bulk Hg concentration decreases significantly with increasing δ13C (R2=0.90, p <0.0001), but Hg/C increases with δ13C (R2=0.59, p =0.009). Both Hg/C and δ13C increase with soil depth, and at a given horizon, they both increase with decreasing particle size. These results indicate that high Hg/C ratios are associated with aged, decomposed, and low quality OM. Mostly likely, this accumulation of Hg in older OM is a result of retention of Hg upon carbon loss during soil respiration. However, the relationship between particle size and Hg/C is significantly different among different horizons; the most prominent relationship occurs at the deepest C horizon. This cross effect of horizon and particle size cannot be explained by normal aging of the OM through decomposition, pointing to mechanisms of changing in Hg bonding characteristics with OM aging or particle aggregation. The measured Kd value decreased with increasing δ13C (R2=0.43, p =0.0031), indicating that Hg associated with older OM is more subject to leaching compared to younger, fresher OM. This association can also be partitioned into effects of of both soil horizon and particle size.\nThis work demonstrates that soil δ13C is a useful tool for studying coupled Hg and C cycles in soils. Linking other methods characterizing bonding characteristics of Hg may bring additional insights to accumulation and mobility of Hg in association with changing chemical and physical properties of OM.",

            "abstract": "The soil carbon (C) pool may play an important role in determining the rate of climate change, but its response to future atmospheric conditions is uncertain. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations, warming and nitrogen enrichment are known to affect plant productivity and soil microbial communities, with possible consequences for the turnover rate of soil C pools. Can we improve predictions of soil C dynamics under global change scenarios by informing soil C models with data from manipulative experiments? In a previous analysis, we combined meta-analysis with data assimlation and showed how elevated CO2 increases decomposition rates in a one-pool soil C model. Two-pool models may better represent long-term soil C dynamics, but when we refit our data to a two-pool soil C model, we arrived at similar conclusions. In addition, elevated CO2 decreased the carbon use efficiency of soil microbes, thereby further reducing the potential for soil C storage. We also present preliminary results from a two-pool analysis on the effect of warming on soil C dynamics. We will discuss the so-called “false priming effect” (i.e., the idea that a step increase in soil C input increases the size of the labile soil C pool, giving the impression of an increase in overall decomposition rates), and possible approaches to correct for this effect. To rule out the possibility of artifacts associated with simplified model structures, we suggest that future data-assimilation efforts on soil C dynamics be done using multi-pool models. Models that explicitly represent microbial dynamics may yield important insights as well. However, as models become more complicated, they must also be more constrained by empirical data. We will outline a few approaches on how to do this.",

In the present study, the performance of the Earth\nNetworks Total Lightning Network (ENTLN) is studied using rocket-triggered lightning data acquired at\nthe International Center for Lightning Research and Testing (ICLRT), Camp Blanding, Florida.\nIn the present study, 18 flashes triggered at ICLRT in 2014 were analyzed and they comprise of 78\nnegative cloud-to-ground return strokes. The geometric mean, median, minimum, and maximum for the\npeak currents of the 78 return strokes are 13.4 kA, 13.6 kA, 3.7 kA, and 38.4 kA, respectively. The peak\ncurrents represent typical subsequent return strokes in natural cloud-to-ground lightning.\nEarth Networks has developed a new data processor to improve the performance of their network. In\nthis study, results are presented for the ENTLN data using the old processor (originally reported in 2014)\nand the ENTLN data simulated using the new processor. The flash detection efficiency, stroke detection\nefficiency, percentage of misclassification, median location error, median peak current estimation error,\nand median absolute peak current estimation error for the originally reported data from old processor\nare 100%, 94%, 49%, 271 m, 5%, and 13%, respectively, and those for the simulated data using the new\nprocessor are 100%, 99%, 9%, 280 m, 11%, and 15%, respectively. The use of new processor resulted in\nhigher stroke detection efficiency and lower percentage of misclassification. It is worth noting that the\nslight differences in median location error, median peak current estimation error, and median absolute\npeak current estimation error for the two processors are due to the fact that the new processor\ndetected more number of return strokes than the old processor.",

In this work, we analyze the portion of the Nazca-SouthAmerican plates subduction zone affected by the 1868 southern Peru and 1877 northern Chile mega-earthquakes. The 1868 and 1878 events defined a seismic gap that did not experience a large earthquake for over 124 years. Only recently, the 1995 Mw 8.1 Antofagasta, 2001 Mw 8.4 Arequipa, 2007 Mw 7.7 Tocopilla, and 2014 Mw 8.2 Pisagua earthquakes released only a small fraction of the potential slip budget, thereby raising concerns about continued seismic and tsunami hazard. We use over a decade of observations from continuous and campaign GPS networks to analyze inter-seismic strain accumulation, as well as co-seimic deformation associated to the more recent earthquakes in the in the Central Andean region. We obtain inferences of slip (and back-slip) behavior using a consistent and robust inversion framework that accounts for the spatial variability of the constraint provided by the observations on slip across the subduction megathrust. We present an updated inter-seismic coupling model and estimates of pre-, co- and post- seismic slip behavior associated with the most recent 2014 Mw 8.2 Pisagua earthquake. We analyze our results, along with published information on the recent and historical large earthquakes, to characterize the regions of the megathrust that tend to behave aseismically, and those that are capable to accumulate a slip budget (ultimately leading to the generation of large earthquakes), to what extent such regions may overlap, and discuss the potential for large earthquakes in the region.",

The surprisingly large amount of damage from weak bedrock ground motions raises questions of whether and how the local geologic materials beneath the city amplify ground motions. In particular, how much and at what frequencies do the southeast-thickening sedimentary strata of the Atlantic Coastal Plain (ACP) strata, sitting on crystalline bedrock, amplify and possibly trap energy? Between November 2014 and August 2015, we used 27 seismometers to measure ground motions across the city during teleseismic and regional earthquakes. Four sites on Piedmont crystalline rocks in NW Washington served as bedrock reference sites, and 23 sites were on ACP strata between 11 m and 200 m thick. Recordings of teleseisms and regional earthquakes provide data with sufficiently high signal-to-noise for computing spectral ratios of the horizontal ground shaking relative to the average of the 4 bedrock sites. Preliminary results are consistent with the primary influence on the amplitudes of ground motions coming from the ACP strata. At frequencies below 1 Hz most sites showed little difference in amplification relative to bedrock, suggesting that basement rocks beneath the ACP strata exert little influence on ground shaking. Strong spectral amplifications of a factor or 10 or greater at frequencies of 1 Hz and above are interpreted as being caused by the ACP strata, with the largest amplitudes at frequencies near the fundamental resonance frequency. A gradual decrease in amplification with higher frequencies above the fundamental peak is consistent with harmonics and resonances from within ACP strata. Results indicate significant amplification of ground motions in the DC area, the frequencies of which will be compared to the resonant frequencies of the damaged buildings.",

With the cBathy code (Holman et al., 2013) fully operational, bathymetry results with 0.5 metres accuracy have been regularly obtained at Duck, USA. cBathy is based on observations of the dominant frequencies and wavelengths of surface wave motions and estimates the depth (and hence allows inference of bathymetry profiles) based on linear wave theory. Despite the good performance at Duck, large discrepancies were found related to tidal elevation and camera height (Bergsma et al., 2014) and on the camera boundaries. A tide dependent floating pixel and camera boundary solution have been proposed to overcome these issues (Bergsma et al., under review). The video-data collection is set estimate depths hourly on a grid with resolution in the order of 10x25 meters.\nHere, the application of the cBathy at Porthtowan in the South-West of England is presented. Hourly depth estimates are combined and analysed over a period of 1.5 years (2013-2014). In this work the focus is on the sub-tidal region, where the best cBathy results are achieved. The morphology of the sub-tidal bar is tracked with high spatio-temporal resolution on short and longer time scales. Furthermore, the impact of the storm and reset (sudden and large changes in bathymetry) of the sub-tidal area is clearly captured with the depth estimations. This application shows that the high spatio-temporal resolution of cBathy makes it a powerful tool for coastal research and coastal zone management.",

The radiocesium deposited in Fukushima area have been transported in river networks. The monitoring started at 6 sites from June 2011. Subsequently, additional 24 monitoring sites were installed between October 2012 and January 2013. Flow and turbidity (for calculation of suspended sediment concentration) were measured at each site, while suspended sediments and river water were collected every one or half month to measure Cs-134 and Cs-137 activity concentrations by gamma spectrometry.\nOur monitoring result data demonstrated that the Cs-137 activity concentration in sediment eroded from the runoff-erosion plot, has been almost constant for the past 3 years, however the Cs-137 concentration of suspended sediment from the forested catchment showed a slight decrease through with time. On the other hand, the suspended sediment from paddy fields and those in river water from large catchments exhibited rapid decrease in Cs-137 activity concentration with time. The decreasing trend of Cs-137 activity concentration was fitted using a two-component exponential model. Differences in the exponential reduction rates of the model were compared and discussed with respect to various land uses and catchment scales. Such analysis can provide important insights into the future prediction of radiocesium wash-off from catchments with different land uses.",

            "abstract": "Despite the global importance of the Congo Basin, which is the second largest river basin in the world, only a small number of studies to date have focused on its hydro-climatic variability. The limited understanding of climate dynamics in the Congo Basin is in part due to the lack of the in situ monitoring of climate variables in that area. Given the vast size of the Congo Basin, remote sensing observations provide the only viable approach to understanding the spatial and temporal variability of the basin’s hydro-climatic patterns. To apprehend the water cycle of the Congo basin it is important to know how the freshwater is stored in this basin and its spatial and temporal dynamics. In this study, a multi-satellite approach is proposed to estimate the water stored in the floodplains of the Congo Basin at monthly time-scale using the surface water extent from the Global Inundation Extent Multi-Satellite (GIEMS) and the water level fluctuations derived from ENVISAT Radar Altimeter. The combination of these datasets for their overlapping period of record, from 2003 to 2007, enabled us to compute water level maps from which we estimated surface water storage in the Congo Basin.",

            "abstract": "The intra-seasonal variability of land-atmosphere coupling for the mid- to high-latitude regions of North America is investigated using carefully designed experiments performed with the fifth generation Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM5). We ran a coupled CRCM5 simulation, where the land and the atmosphere interact freely, and an uncoupled CRCM5 simulation, where the soil moisture is prescribed, to evaluate the coupling strength under current climatic conditions. Both simulations were driven by ERA-Interim reanalysis for the 1981 – 2010 period at 0.44˚ horizontal resolution, over a North American domain.\nAnalysis of the coupled and uncoupled simulations reveals that soil moisture/temperature coupling is strong over the Canadian Prairies during the summer, spring and fall seasons. The underlying mechanisms, however, vary with season. During the summer months, soil moisture affects the partitioning of net surface radiation into latent and sensible heat fluxes, which then influences the two-meter temperature through evaporative cooling. For the transition months (spring and fall), on the other hand, soil moisture variation - particularly moisture phase, i.e. the fractional liquid and frozen water contents, play a role in altering the surface albedo, which in turn modifies the absorbed shortwave and the emitted longwave radiations. In particular, the outgoing longwave radiation influences the two-meter temperature through radiative cooling. Surface temperature variability during the transition months is also reflected in the snow depth variability, which in turn affects surface albedo, emissivity and soil moisture again through a feedback loop. We also assessed the impact of coupling on temperature extremes during the transition seasons and found a strong relationship between coupling strength and the number of hot days during spring.",

            "abstract": "The leading modes of the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) rainfall variability and their seasonal predictability are investigated using the CFSv2 hindcasts initialized from multiple ocean analyses over the period of 1979-2008 and observation-based analyses. It is shown that the two leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes of the observed ASM rainfall anomalies, which together account for about 34% of total variance, largely correspond to the ASM responses to the ENSO influences during the summers of the developing and decaying years of a Pacific anomalous event, respectively. These two ASM modes are then designated as the contemporary and delayed ENSO responses, respectively. It is demonstrated that the CFSv2 is capable of predicting these two dominant ASM modes up to the lead of 5 months. More importantly, the predictability of the ASM rainfall are much higher with respect to the delayed ENSO mode than the contemporary one, with the predicted principal component time series of the former maintaining high correlation skill and small ensemble spread with all lead months whereas the latter shows significant degradation in both measures with lead-time. A composite analysis for the ASM rainfall anomalies of all warm ENSO events in this period substantiates the finding that the ASM is more predictable following an ENSO event. The enhanced predictability mainly comes from the evolution of the warm SST anomalies over the Indian Ocean in the spring of the ENSO maturing phases and the persistence of the anomalous high sea surface pressure over the western Pacific in the subsequent summer, which the hindcasts are able to capture reasonably well. The results also show that the ensemble initialization with multiple ocean analyses improves the CFSv2’s prediction skill of both ENSO and ASM rainfall. In fact, the skills of the ensemble mean hindcasts initialized from the four different ocean analyses are always equivalent to the best ones initialized from any individual ocean analysis, although the best performer varies with lead-time and starting calendar month.",

            "abstract": "Recently developed conceptual frameworks and new observations have improved our understanding of hyporheic temperature dynamics and their effects on channel temperatures. However, hyporheic temperature models that are both simple and useful remain elusive. As water moves through hyporheic pathways, it exchanges heat with hyporheic sediment through conduction, and this process dampens the diurnal temperature wave of the water entering from the channel. This study examined the mechanisms underlying this behavior, and utilized those findings to create two simple models that predict temperatures of water reentering the channel after traveling through hyporheic pathways for different lengths of time. First, we developed a laboratory experiment to represent this process and determine conduction rates for various sediment size classes (sand, fine gravel, coarse gravel, and a proportional mix of the three) by observing the time series of temperature changes between sediment and water of different initial temperatures. Results indicated that conductions rates were near-instantaneous, with heat transfer being completed on the scale of seconds to a few minutes of the initial interaction. Heat conduction rates between the sediment and water were therefore much faster than hyporheic flux rates, rendering reasonable an assumption of instantaneous conduction. Then, we developed two simple models to predict time series of hyporheic water based on the initial diurnal temperature wave and hyporheic travel distance. The first model estimates a damping coefficient based on the total water-sediment heat exchange through each diurnal cycle. The second model solves the heat transfer equation assuming instantaneous conduction using a simple finite difference algorithm. Both models demonstrated nearly complete damping of the sine wave over the distance traveled in four days. If hyporheic exchange is substantial and travel times are long, then hyporheic damping may have large effects on channel temperature. This underscores the importance of maintaining channel complexity for stream thermal heterogeneity and temperature regulation.",

The processes involving fracture initiation and growth in rocks often span broad time scales and size scales, contributing to the complexity of these problems. To better understand fracture behavior, the authors propose an initial investigation comparing the fracture testing techniques of notched three-point bending (N3PB), short rod (SR), and double torsion (DT) on geomaterials using computational analysis. Linear softening cohesive fracture modeling (LCFM) was applied using ABAQUS to computationally simulate the three experimental set-ups. By applying material properties obtained experimentally, these simulations are intended to predict single-trace fracture growth. The advantages and limitations of the three testing techniques were considered for application to subcritical fracture propagation taking into account the accuracy of constraints, load applications, and modes of fracture.\nThis work is supported as part of the Geomechanics of CO2 Reservoir Seals, a DOE-NETL funded under Award Number DE-FOA-0001037.

Studies also suggest that increasing anthropogenic aerosol forcing in the East and South Asia can affect the Asia monsoon system. It is therefore likely that the increased aerosol loadings of sulfates and black carbons over TP and its surrounding areas can affect the precipitation over TP in at least two ways—directly by changing the vertical radiative heating/cooling distributions on TP through aerosol-cloud interactions and indirectly by perturbing the dynamics through differential heating/cooling between TP and the neighboring areas. Here, we conduct WRF simulations to investigate the direct and cloud adjustment effects of aerosols on the phase and amplitude of the ISVs. Multiple-component aerosols from data assimilation system are used to drive the aerosol-radiation and aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions. Preliminary results show that the aerosol optical depth is small over TP, but quite large in the surrounding areas. Simulation results of both the local aerosol-cloud-radiation interactions and the responses of aerosol-dynamics coupling will be presented and discussed.",

Recent efforts demonstrate that geochemical, vegetation and climate models can be linked to understand the controls on solute fluxes in the critical zone. These efforts also elucidate field weathering rates and mineralogical evolution. To investigate the controls on shale weathering and solute flux, we developed a baseline shale weathering and solute flux model utilizing field observations from the Susquehanna Shale Hills Critical Zone Observatory (SSHCZO). Our modeling approach linked the physically-based land surface hydrologic model, Flux-PIHM (Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model), to the numerical chemical weathering model WITCH.\nWe are progressively testing the importance of mineral reactive surface area, aspect, clay thermodynamic constants, and vegetation cycling (uptake and decomposition) on soil water solute fluxes. Under baseline conditions, WITCH simulated the range in soil water Mg2+ concentrations observed on the sun-facing hillslope but slightly underestimated the concentrations observed on the shaded slope. The baseline WITCH modeling suggests Mg2+ solute concentrations are primarily controlled by clay weathering but that Ca2+, K+, Na+ and Si are driven by other critical zone processes.\nThe inclusion of aspect resulted in lower recharge rates on the sun-facing side because ET was higher on that side. This in turn also resulted in lower soil water solute concentrations on the shaded hillslope. Cooler temperatures on that side also reduced the simulated chlorite and illite dissolution rates.

            "abstract": "The S-transform methodology is based on Stockwell transforms, which is a form of a short Fourier transform, with a time domain transform window defined by a Gaussian function. The Gaussian function has a standard deviation equal to the frequency of interest. Applying the transform to multiple frequencies of interest results in a time/frequency spectrogram, which has the advantage of being simply invertible back to the time domain. This allows for the calculation of instantaneous frequency/time phase and amplitude measurements, which makes 2D signal filtration of surface waves possible. By solving for the transverse angle of propagation of narrow band filtered Love waves at a range of periods (8-25s) we calculate a vector of possible azimuths, one at each period. We then average over all the bands of interest to determine the mean angle of propagation. To avoid using unreliable low signal-to-noise (SNR) azimuth estimates, we use a SNR weighted average to more accurately reflect the overall signal propagation azimuth. We then use the mean signal azimuth to design a 2D Love wave rejection filter that will reject off-azimuth noise and then invert this to the time domain for an improved signal on the propagation azimuth.\nWe apply this method to the 2009 Democratic People’s Republic of Korea nuclear test. After testing the weighted averaging approach, the SNR ratio increases by a factor of 2 overall, and a signal on the transverse component is identified as a Rayleigh wave that “leaked” into the transverse component. Without this method, there could have been improper Love wave signal identification for the event. Using this innovative SNR weighted averaging technique to calculate propagation angle indicates that S-transform filters can lower the noise level by a factor of 2 or more, helping with low SNR events, and remove Rayleigh “leakage” into the transverse channel.",

The Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) instrument on ICESat-2 will utilize a photon counting lidar which utilizes low power laser pulse with detectors sensitive at the single photon level. Due to this type of detector, any returned photon whether from the reflected signal or solar background can trigger a detection event. The ATLAS instrument will record the arrival time associated with a single photon detection that can occur anywhere within the vertical distribution of the reflected signal, that is, anywhere within the vertical distribution of the canopy. One of the uncertainties facing the ecosystem community is a comprehensive understanding of the performance of ICESat-2 will be for various ecosystems. Specifically, which ecosystems –and to a greater extent- what amount of canopy cover will create constraints on the ability to derive relative canopy height from ICESat-2 measurements. This paper aims to provide the science and user community of the ICESat-2 land/vegetation data products with a realistic understanding of the performance characteristics and subsequent data quality and the associated errors. To simulate ICESat-2/ATLAS data, data from small-footprint waveform lidar are the best surrogate for empirically deriving simulated ICESat-2 data as the entire temporal profile of the laser energy is recorded on each waveform. As such, a normalized waveform is the probability of where a photon is returned from the reflecting surface along the laser line-of-sight. Using this empirical approach, simulated ICESat-2 data can be developed for a variety of ecosystems ranging from sparse shrublands to dense forests. Relative canopy heights from simulated ICESat-2 data are evaluated against the canopy heights derived from source small-footprint lidar data to provide a baseline uncertainty for specific ecosystems.",

To that end, we used a suite of true/proxy portable instruments (XRF, LIBS, XRD, near-IR and mid-IR spectrometers), to measure the chemical and spectral characteristics of young basaltic flows (erupted December 1974, or D1974) within the southwest rift zone of Kilauea, Hawaii. The D1974 lavas exhibit multiple flow morphologies and textures, and have undergone alteration by a variety of processes, including acid weathering, oxidation and devitrification. The mineralogy, chemistry and infrared spectral properties of select samples from these altered surfaces have been well characterized by previous groups using high resolution (e.g. SEM, TEM) and/or laboratory measurements (XRD, Mossbauer, infrared). Typical alteration products include coatings of Fe-Ti-oxide +/- an overlying silica-rich coating. Coatings are commonly discontinuous and vary in color. Oxidation fronts are also present, most visible as reddish brown discoloration along the edges of broken and uplifted flow crusts. The previous detailed characterizations provide the basis for evaluating instrument performance and also allow us to assess areas where portable instruments can contribute new information to current understanding. These areas include characterizing the spatial variability in alteration chemistry/mineralogy, relating chemical/mineralogical properties to texture and context, and comparing chemical/mineralogical variations with infrared spectral properties. Because infrared spectra are commonly used to assess compositional variations of a site remotely, either from the ground or from orbit, relating changes in chemistry and mineralogy to spectral variations is particularly important. Last, the D1974 site provides an excellent location to test the performance of portable chemical instruments on coated surfaces of variable texture. Results from this multi-technique approach will be presented at the meeting.",

The occurrence of these bubble plumes close to the outcrop of the hydrate stability zone led to the hypothesis that some of the methane is derived from dissociation of hydrate caused by an observed 30 year warming trend in the ocean bottom water at around 400 m depth. A further hypothesis suggests that the methane seepage has been occurring for 3000 years and that the formation and dissociation of gas hydrate has focussed the flow of methane to the site of the plumes. In this modelling study, a range of numerical models have been built to examine particular aspects of the Svalbard system to improve our understanding of the migration of methane in the sediments beneath the plumes and how hydrate formation and dissociation may influence methane flow. The choice of equation for the hydrate stability curve is shown to be a significant factor in determining the location of the hydrate stability zone in relation to the plumes, and could therefore affect the interpretation of methane migration pathways. Numerical models are used to examine the effect of seasonal ocean temperature fluctuations on the flux of methane at the seabed. The release of methane is shown to be affected by the period of the temperature cycles compared to the rate of methane supply. Finally 2D models of methane flow at the base of the hydrate stability zone are used to examine how methane migration might be affected by the presence of hydrates. The models consider the degree to which methane migrates upslope beneath the hydrate stability zone compared to entering the hydrate stability zone and forming hydrate. The results obtained from these modelling studies build on previous work by a number of authors to improve the conceptual model of methane migration at the edge of the hydrate stability zone.",

For many developing countries, including many of those in Africa, this is a significant challenge as it requires establishing a robust and sustainable GHG inventory system. In order to help support these efforts, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has worked in collaboration with the UNFCCC to assist African countries in establishing sustainable GHG inventory systems and generating high-quality inventories on a regular basis. The sectors we have focused on for these GHG inventory capacity building efforts in Africa are Agriculture and Land Use, Land-use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) as these tend to represent a significant portion of their GHG emissions profile and the data requirements and methodologies are often more complex than for other sectors. To support these efforts, the U.S. EPA has provided technical assistance in understanding the methods in the IPCC Guidelines, assembling activity data and emission factors, including developing land-use maps for representing a country's land base, and implementing the calculations. EPA has also supported development of various tools such as a Template Workbook that helps the country build the institutional arrangement and strong documentation that are necessary for generating GHG inventories on a regular basis, as well as performing other procedures as identified by IPCC Good Practice Guidance such as quality assurance/quality control, key category analysis and archiving. Another tool used in these projects and helps country's implement the methods from the IPCC Guidelines for the Agriculture and LULUCF sectors is the Agriculture and Land Use (ALU) tool. This tool helps countries assemble the activity data and emission factors, including supporting the import of GIS maps, and applying the equations from the IPPC Guidelines to estimate the carbon stock changes and emissions of non-CO2 GHG for all land uses and management practices as identified in the IPCC Guidelines at the Tier 1 or Tier 2 level.",

Studies show that coastal estuaries and marsh systems are at the risk of losing their productivity under increasing rates of SLR (Donnelly and Bertness, 2001; Warren and Niering, 1993). The integrated hydrodynamic-marsh model (Hagen et al., 2013 & Alizad et al., 2015) uses a set of parameters and conditions to simulate tidal flow through the salt marsh of Plum Island Estuary, Massachusetts. The hydrodynamic model computes mean high water (MHW) and mean low water (MLW) and is coupled to the zero-dimensional Marsh Equilibrium Model (Morris et al. 2002) to estimate changes in biomass productivity and accretion.\nThe coupled hydrodynamic-marsh model was used to examine the effects of different scenarios of SLR (Parris et al., 2012) on salt marsh productivity for the year 2100 in the Plum Island Estuary. In this particular study, responses of salt marsh production for different scenarios of SLR were compared. The study shows higher productivity of salt marsh under a low SLR scenario and lower productivity under the higher SLR. The study also demonstrates the migration of salt marshes under higher SLR scenarios.\n",

The region’s climate is characterized by low and extremely variable precipitation that occurs on a seasonal cycle consisting of winter precipitation, spring drought, summer precipitation and fall drought. Under these highly variable and water-limited growth conditions, grasses and shrubs each exhibit adaptive strategies that provide distinct competitive advantages. Such adaptations are expressed in numerous ways, including not only unique physiognomy and physiology (such as C4 photosynthetic pathway in grasses), but also distinctly different patterns of seasonal growth, or phenology. We developed a satellite-based optical remote sensing methodology that exploits these differential phenologies to enable improved detection, mapping and monitoring of the distribution, surface cover and photosynthetic activity of the separate grass and shrub components of the landscape.\nWe applied and tested the approach in an approximately 27,000 km2 study in southern Arizona and the adjacent Mexican border region (see figure). We used a 15-year (2000-2014) time-series of satellite-derived vegetation index data (MSAVI2) from the Terra MODIS sensor to characterize the integrated landscape phenology among years, and gridded (PRISM) precipitation data for the same period to support analysis of the observed variability. We combined this analysis with information extracted from two years of multi-date Landsat observations. Our method detects and maps the distributions and the seasonal and interannual dynamics of the separate grass and shrub components of the landscape across a full range of vegetation compositions, from pure grassland to pure desert scrub (displayed in the figure, respectively, as deep green and deep red). \nThe results provide ecologically and climatically relevant information that is not typically available from conventional satellite-based approaches to landscape phenology and vegetation mapping. The conceptual approach and methodology open avenues to new insights and applications in land change science and land resource management.",

Because rhizobacterial biofilms are a major sink for plant-derived carbon and source for soil organic matter (SOM), and Fe (hydr)oxides have reactive surfaces that influence the stability of microbial biomass and SOM, PCA-producing rhizobacteria could influence soil carbon fluxes. Large populations of Pseudomonas fluorescens strains producing PCA in concentrations up to 1 µg/g root have been observed in the rhizosphere of non-irrigated wheat fields covering 1.56 million hectares of central Washington state. This is one of the highest concentrations ever reported for a natural antibiotic in a terrestrial ecosystem (Mavrodi et al. 2012, Appl Environ Microb 78: 804).\nMicroscopic comparisons of PCA-producing (PCA+) and non-PCA-producing (PCA-) rhizobacterial colony morphologies, and comparisons of Fe extractions from rhizosphere soil inoculated with PCA+ and PCA- strains suggest that PCA promotes biofilm development as well as dramatic Fe transformations throughout the rhizosphere (unpublished data). In order to illustrate PCA-mediated interactions between biofilms and Fe (hydr)oxides in the rhizosphere, identify the specific Fe phases favored by PCA, and establish the ramifications for stability and distribution of microbial biomass and SOM, we have collected electron micrographs, X-ray fluorescence images, X-ray absorption near-edge spectra, and secondary-ion mass spectrometry images of wheat root sections inoculated with 15N-labelled PCA+ or PCA- rhizobacteria. These images and spectra allow us to assess the accumulation, turnover, and distribution of microbial biomass, the associations between Fe and other nutrients such as phosphorus, and the redox status and speciation of iron in the presence and absence of PCA. This information provides a starting point to model the impact of PCA upon carbon fluxes in Columbia Basin agro-ecosystems and other environments where PCA-producing bacteria are prevalent.",

We focus initially on case studies of the Bishop Tuff, the Fish Canyon Tuff, and the Siberian Traps. We consider the response to these events in multiple climate states. Additionally, we use estimates of the localized rates of silicate weathering following each of these events to explicitly model the extended CO2 drawdown without a parameterized global silicate weathering feedback.

So 1,2,4-TCB is the contaminant of concern in this study. As chemical oxidation technology is a common in-site remediation technique, hydrogen peroxide, sodium sulfate and the two-mixed oxidants under the catalytic condition are used to remove 1,2,4-TCB from groundwater. By changing the values of temperature and pH in the experiments, the best conditions for chemical oxidation with oxidants mentioned above were determined. The fluorescent brightener of PF, manufactured by the former chemical plant, was added to groundwater to evaluate whether its existence made an impact on the chemical oxidation. 1-D sand column tests were conducted to study the degradation effect by using the chemical oxidation technology. The experiment results showed that single oxidant and mixed both oxidants can remove 1,2,4-TCB completely. The oxidation efficiency of both oxidants is influenced by temperature and pH. For hydrogen peroxide, the oxidation efficiency decreases with the increase of pH, while, for sodium sulfate, the efficiency is high under the mild acidic condition. The fluorescent brightener PF has an impact on the oxidation efficiency, with negative effect on the oxidation with hydrogen peroxide but positive effect with sodium sulfate. 1-D sand column tests testified the degradation of 1,2,4-TCB by the chemical oxidation with hydrogen peroxide and sodium sulfate.\n KEY WORDS: 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene，hydrogen peroxide，sodium persulfate，optical brightener PF，chemical oxidation\n Acknowledgements\nFunding for this research from DuPont Company and NSFC Project No. 41472212.",

To detect signals and associate them into robust event hypotheses in an automatic pipeline we created a global grid (GG) of master events with a diversity of waveform templates. For the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), the GG provides an almost uniform distribution of monitoring capabilities and adjustable templates. For seismic areas, we select high quality signals at IMS stations from earthquakes. For test sites, signals from UNEs are best templates. Global detection and association with cross correlation technique for research and monitoring purposes demands templates from master events outside the regions of natural seismicity and test sites. We populate aseismic areas with masters having synthetic templates calculated for predefined sets of IMS array stations. We applied various technologies to synthesize most representative signals for cross correlation and tested them using the Reviewed Event Bulletin (REB) issued by the International Data Centre (IDC). At first, we tested these global sets of master events and synthetic templates using IMS seismic data for February 13, 2013 and demonstrated excellent detection and location capability. Then, using the REB and cross correlation bulletins (XSELs) experienced analysts from the IDC compared the relative performance of various templates and built reliable sets of events and detections for machine learning. In this study, we carefully compile global training sets for machine learning in order to establish statistical decision lines between reliable and unreliable event hypotheses, then apply classification procedures to the intermediate automatic cross correlation bulletin based on the GG, and compile the final XSEL, which is more accurate and has lower detection threshold than the REB.",

For that reason, permit authorities initially enforced no monitoring requirements on the operating companies. After a series of events perceived by local residents, a scientific monitoring survey was conducted over several years, revealing several hundred induced earthquakes at one project site.\nWe summarize results from monitoring at this site, including absolute locations in a local 3D velocity model, relocations using double-difference and master-event methods and focal mechanism determinations that show a clear association with fault structures in the reservoir which extend down into the underlying crystalline basement. To better constrain the shear wave velocity models that have a strong influence on hypocentral depth estimates, several different approaches to estimate layered vp/vs models are employed.\nResults from these studies have prompted permit authorities to start imposing minimal monitoring requirements. Since in some cases these geothermal projects are only separated by a few kilometers, we investigate the capabilities of an optimized network combining the monitoring resources of six neighboring well doublets in a joint network. Optimization is taking into account the -- on this local scale, urban environment -- highly heterogeneous background noise conditions and the feasibility of potential monitoring sites, removing non-viable sites before the optimization procedure. First results from the actual network realization show good detection capabilities for small microearthquakes despite the minimum instrumentational effort, demonstrating the benefits of good coordination of monitoring efforts.",

            "abstract": "There is widespread consensus that climate change is contributing to rapid vegetation shifts in the ecologically sensitive Arctic tundra. These tussock grass dominated systems are shifting to tussock/woody shrub communities leading to likely alterations in carbon (C) sequestration and ecosystem productivity, which in turn can manifest in “greening” and changes in normalized difference vegetation index values (NDVI). While the expansion of woody vegetation is well established, our understanding of the ecosystem dynamics associated with this new habitat remain largely unknown. To untangle how the Arctic tundra may be impacted by these vegetation shifts we paired vegetation measurements (i.e. shrub biomass, leaf area, and shrub canopy area) and ecosystem C fluxes (e.g. net ecosystem exchange, NEE, and ecosystem respiration) with ground-level measurements of NDVI. Measurements were conducted at the Toolik Field Station in dry heath and moist acidic tundra habitats which are two primary habitat types on the North Slope of Alaska. We found strong positive relationships between shrub leaf area and biomass as well as shrub canopy area and biomass, relationships that were corroborated with NDVI measurements. This lends support for the use of NDVI as a proxy measurement of leaf area and shrub biomass. Additionally, NDVI was negatively correlated with ecosystem respiration across habitats, with respiratory fluxes consistently higher in the moist acidic relative to the dry heath tundra. Finally, we observed a significant positive nonlinear relationship between NEE and NDVI (R2~0.8; P<0.01). Shrub removal revealed that NEE was strongly controlled by woody shrubs. The positive relationship between NDVI and NEE highlights the potential shifts in the C balance of the Arctic tundra associated with woody encroachment. This increased plant productivity may offset greenhouse gas losses from permafrost degradation contributing some resilience to this system otherwise considered a greenhouse gas source. Such ground-truthed relationships can facilitate assessments of long-term trends in NDVI and their ramifications on ecosystem C cycling processes. These relationships will enhance our ability to predict shifts in standing biomass, C-cycling, and improve the use of satellite products to assess change.",

The FACE campaign critically relies on a successful monitoring and understanding of the large variety of ecohydrological processes occurring across many interfaces, from deep soil to above the tree canopy.\nAt the land-atmosphere interface, soil moisture and temperature are key variables to determine the heat and water exchanges, crucial to the vegetation dynamics as well as to groundwater recharge.\nTraditional solutions for monitoring soil moisture and temperature such as remote techniques and point sensors show limitations in fast acquisition rates and spatial coverage, respectively. Hence, spatial patterns and temporal dynamics of heat and water fluxes at this interface can only be monitored to a certain degree, limiting deeper knowledge in dynamically evolving systems (e.g. in impact of growing vegetation).\nFibre optics Distributed Temperature Sensors (DTS) can measure soil temperatures at high spatiotemporal resolutions and accuracy, along kilometers of optical cable buried in the soil. Heat pulse methods applied to electrical elements embedded in the optical cable can be used to obtain the soil moisture.\nIn July 2015 a monitoring system based on DTS has been installed in a recently forested hillslope at BIFoR in order to quantify high-resolution spatial patterns and high-frequency temporal dynamics of soil heat fluxes and soil moisture conditions. Therefore, 1500m of optical cables have been carefully deployed in three overlapped loops at 0.05m, 0.25m and 0.4m from the soil surface and an electrical system to send heat pulses along the optical cable has been developed. This paper discussed both, installation and design details along with first results of the soil moisture and temperature monitoring carried out since July 2015.\nMoreover, interpretations of the collected data to investigate the impact on soil moisture dynamics of i) forest evolution (long timescale), (ii) seasonality and, (iii) high-frequency forcing, are discussed.",

The presence of two small reservoirs (R1: 13-16 m and R2: 8-9 m) with impermeable boundaries provides an opportunity to study a saline formation for geological storage both in the field and in a laboratory context.\nThis integrated monitoring concept was first applied at Maguelone for characterization of the reservoir state before and during N2 and CO2 injections as part of the MUSTANG FP7 project. Multimethod monitoring was shown to be sensitive to gas storage within a saline reservoir with clear data changes immediately after the beginning of injection. Pressure remains the first indicator of gas storage at ~8-9 m depth in a small permeable unit (gravels/shells) under the Holocene lagoonal sediments. A good correlation is also obtained between the resistivity response and geochemical parameters from pore fluid sampling (pH, minor and major cation concentrations) at this depth.\nOn the basis of previous gas injection experiments, new holes were drilled as part of PANACEA (EC project) in 2014, including an injection hole targeted for injection at 8-9 m depth in the R2 reservoir in order to have gas injection and gas storage at the same depth, a single hole multi-parameter observatory, and a seismic source hole. A total volume of ~48 m3 of CO2 was injected over ~2 hours on December 4, 2014. The injection rate varied from 24 to 30 m3/h, with a well head pressure of 1.8 bars. All downhole monitoring technologies (resistivity, temperature, pressure, SP and seismic measurements) were combined in the single hole observatory. Such device allows monitoring the downhole system before and after injection and the gas migration from the injection hole, helping to characterize the transport mechanism. Decreasing the number of monitoring-measurements and verification (MMV) holes enables a significant decrease of gas leakage risk. This specific monitoring approach is expected to give information about the safety and reliability of CO2 storage operation that guarantees public acceptance.",

This knowledge is significant for various environmental research questions, particularly with regard to the recent climate change. This study shows an innovative approach to retrieve land surface emissivity (LSE) and LST by using thermal infrared (TIR) data from satellite sensors, such as SEVIRI and AATSR.\nSo far there are no methods to derive LSE/LST particularly in areas of highly dynamic emissivity changes. Therefore especially for regions with large surface temperature amplitude in the diurnal cycle such as bare and uneven soil surfaces but also for regions with seasonal changes in vegetation cover including various surface areas such as grassland, mixed forests or agricultural land different methods were investigated to identify the most appropriate one.\nThe LSE is retrieved by using the day/night Temperature-Independent Spectral Indices (TISI) method, and the Generalised Split-Window (GSW) method is used to retrieve the LST. Nevertheless different GSW algorithms show that equal LSEs lead to large LST differences. Additionally LSE is also measured using a NDVI-based threshold method (NDVITHM) to distinguish between soil, dense vegetation cover and pixel composed of soil and vegetation. The data used for this analysis were derived from MODIS TIR.\nThe analysis is implemented with IDL and an intercomparison is performed to determine the most effective methods. To compensate temperature differences between derived and ground truth data appropriate correction terms by comparing derived LSE/LST data with ground-based measurements are developed. One way to calibrate LST retrievals is by comparing the canopy leaf temperature of conifers derived from TIR data with the surrounding air temperature (e.g. from synoptic stations).\nProspectively, the derived LSE/LST data become validated with near infrared data obtained from an UVA with a TIR camera (TIRC) onboard, and also compared with ground-based measurements.\nThis study aims to generate an appropriate method by integrating developed correction terms to eventually obtain a high correlation between all, LSE/LST, TIRC and ground truth data.",

            "abstract": "Recent paleoclimate reconstructions have challenged the traditional view that Northern Hemisphere insolation and associated feedbacks drove synchronous global climate and ice-sheet volume during the last glacial cycle. Here we focus on the response of the Patagonian Ice Sheet, and demonstrate that its maximum expansion culminated at 28,400 ± 500 years before present (28.4 ± 0.5 ka), more than 5,000 years before the minima in 65°N summer insolation and the formally-defined Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) at 21,000 ± 2,000 years before present. To investigate the potential drivers of this early LGM (eLGM), we simulate the effects of orbital changes using a suite of climate models incorporating prescribed and evolving sea-ice anomalies. Our analyses suggest that Antarctic sea-ice expansion at 28.5 ka altered the location and intensity of the Southern Hemisphere storm track, triggering regional cooling over Patagonia of 5°C that extends across the wider mid-southern latitudes. In contrast, at the LGM, continued sea-ice expansion reduced regional temperature and precipitation further, effectively starving the ice sheet and resulting in reduced glacial expansion. Our findings highlight the dominant role that orbital changes can play in driving Southern Hemisphere glacial climate via the sensitivity of mid-latitude regions to changes in Antarctic sea-ice extent.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - HydroQGIS_Poster.pdf\nMany aspects of hydrology are tightly coupled with geospatial data. For this reason, geospatial information systems (GIS) are often incorporated into work flows for analyzing hydrological data. These disjoint work flows, however, often require many steps and different applications to achieve the desired results.\nSimplifying the workflow involved in regional flood peak scaling studies motivated the creation of the HydroQGIS plugin. Flood frequency analysis presents one of the largest hurdles in studying regional flood peak scaling. HydroQGIS aids these studies with a set of tools that reduce the time to perform flood frequency analsyis on USGS gauging stations. HydroQGIS is a framework for hydrological geospatial plugin development for Quantum GIS (QGIS). It uses the cross-platform nature of QGIS, QT, and Python to create a set of tools to help simplify the work flow of hydrological data searching, gathering, and analysis into a single application that can be used by users on any platform.\nHydroQGIS combines the Quantum GIS plugin framework with various web-services to couple data and analysis in a uniform environment. QGIS provides a fully functioning GIS application on top of which plugins can be developed. The HydroQGIS plugin focuses on data acquisition and analysis from the geospatial domain. The design of HydroQGIS facilitates quick development of additional tools, used independently or in conjunction with other developed utilities, to streamline data acquisition and analysis.\nHydroQGIS currently implements an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Watershed Delineation tool using the EPA Waters web service, as well as a United States Geological Survey (USGS) gauging station search using the USGS Instantaneous Values web service. These tools provide a unified GIS interface that allows users to locate and map gauging stations and watersheds using any base map of their choice. These tools, while useful by themselves, also support a flood frequency analysis (FFA) utility based on USGS Bulletin 17B guidelines. The FFA tool acquires and analyzes historical flood peak data for USGS gauging stations across the country. Combined with the USGS gauging station search tool, this provides a simple, easy to use work flow for developing flood frequency curves or for comparing flood behaviors at different sites.",

            "abstract": "Because Mars has no intrinsic magnetic filed, the solar wind directly interacts with the planetary ionosphere. Under this circumstance, the planetary ionopause represents a density discontinuity surface and a velocity shear surface between the magnetized solar wind flow and the planetary ionosphere. The ionopause is subject to the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability [Amerstorfer et al., 2010], which is expected to play a role in removing ionospheric materials from the planet. In addition, the KH instability may cause a dawn-dusk asymmetry at the magnetopause because of the finite Larmor radius (FLR) effect of ions [Nagano, 1978]. At an ionopause, for the same reason, the KH instability may cause an asymmetry in the direction of the solar wind motional electric field.\nTerada et al. [2002] pointed out using a global hybrid simulation that the KH instability at the Venusian ionopause develops asymmetrically through the acceleration of ionospheric ions in the direction of the solar wind motional electric field. It is known that the ion FLR effect, the gravitational stabilizing effect, the effect of the thickness of the boundary layer, etc. determine the initial growth of the KH instability. However, it was difficult to separately evaluate each contribution of these effects with the global hybrid simulation. Because of this, quantitative evaluations of these competing effects at the Martian ionopause have not yet been done.\nIn this study, to model a more realistic condition of Mars, we have performed simulation runs with a density gradient in the direction of the velocity shear (horizontal direction) in the Martian ionosphere. Our past simulations, which used a periodic boundary condition, had a peak of momentum at the ionopause in the initial condition, so that the growth rate of the KH instability can be over-estimated. This problem is partly resolved by employing this realistic condition. Accordingly, it is expected that the growth rate of the KH instability decreases near the subsolar point, but increases at high SZAs due to the horizontal density gradient compared to our previous results, resulting in a different atmospheric escape rate. In this presentation, initial results obtained from the numerical simulation that considers the horizontal density gradient will be presented.",

In this paper, neutral vertical wind data from Brazil FPI observations at around 240 km altitude during 2009 to 2015 are used for the study of the equatorial vertical wind and neutral temperature variation during geomagnetic activity times. First, the observations during several particular storm periods will be analyzed. Secondly, Epoch analysis will be used to bin all the observed events together to investigate the climatological features of vertical wind and temperature during storms. The results will give us an unprecedented view of the nighttime vertical wind and neutral temperature variations at low latitudes, which is critical to specify the dynamics of the upper atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "The depth of the Lithosphere-Asthenosphere boundary (LAB) beneath the ocean is widely accepted to increase with the age of the oceanic plate. In particular, in the first 30-50 My, the thickness of the Lithosphere increases almost linearly to about 60-70 km, for a number of models of the LAB formation. Observations from the Pacific plate generally support this hypothesis (e.g. Schmerr, 2012). However, measures of the LAB depth beneath old oceanic plates seem to indicate an almost constant depth of about 70-80 km for oceanic plate older than 50-60 Ma (e.g. Kumar and Kawakatsu, 2011), in dis-agreement with most of the earliest LAB model (e.g. half-space cooling). In this study, we present the first measurement of the LAB depth beneath a 250Myr old ocean, the Ionian plate, obtained from the analysis of teleseismic waveforms recorded at two Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBS) deployed on the ocean floor. From such recordings, we compute two independent data-set of S receiver function (S-RF), a widely used tool for estimating the depth of the LAB. The S-RF data sets indicate the presence of a negative S-wave velocity discontinuity (i.e. where Vs decreases with depth) at 75 +/- 10 km depth, which is interpreted as the LAB. Insights into the evolution of the oceanic LAB during subduction are obtained by comparing the LAB depth found from the analysis of the S-RF data-sets, with the LAB depth beneath the Calabrian arc, obtained from the analysis of a huge P receiver function data-set.",

Here we present results that address causes of the streamflow changes, focusing on a clearer understanding of the relationship between the land surface physics and the evolving characteristics of the meteorological forcings. Results for regional hydrologic model experiments are presented that address the roles of changes in weather statistics, land-cover change, and changes in seasonality.

            "abstract": "Among the many factors influencing the complex process of lava flow emplacement, the interaction with the substrate onto which flow is emplaced plays a central role. Lava flows are rarely emplaced onto smooth or regular surfaces. For example, at Kīlauea Volcano, Hawai‘i, lava flows regularly flow over solid rock, vegetation, basaltic or silica sand, and man-made materials, including asphalt and concrete. In situ studies of lava-substrate interactions are inherently difficult, and often dangerous, to carry-out, requiring the design of controllable laboratory experiments.\nWe investigate the effects of substrate grain size, cohesion, and roughness on flow mobility and morphology through a series of flow experiments using analog materials and molten basalt. We have developed a series of experiments that allow for adjustable substrate parameters and analyze their effects on lava flow emplacement. The first set of experiments are performed at the Fluids Mechanics Laboratory at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory and focus on two analog materials: polyethylene glycol (PEG), a commercially available wax, and corn syrup. The fluids were each extruded onto a series of scaled substrate beds to replicate the emplacement of lava in a natural environment.\nPreliminary experiments demonstrated that irregular topography, particularly topography with a height amplitude similar to that of the flow itself, can affect flow morphology, width, and velocity by acting as local barriers or culverts to the fluid. This is expected from observations of fluid flow in natural environments.\nA follow-up set of experiments will be conducted in Fall 2015 at the Syracuse University (SU) Lava Project Lab. In this set, we will pour molten basalt directly onto a series of substrates representing natural environments found on the Earth and other rocky bodies in the Solar System. These experiments will allow for analysis of the effects of basaltic composition and high temperatures on lava-substrate heat transfer and mechanical interactions. Results will be used to improve current lava flow prediction models as well as increase our understanding of the evolution of volcanic regions on the Earth and other planets.",

Previous laboratory-based geotechnical studies attest that the slope is per sestable and that seismic events in an order of magnitude M5.7 may have triggered the slope sediments to fail.\nHere we present geotechnical in situ data (sedimentary strength, pore pressure), which were obtained with RV Poseidon in summer 2014 using the static CPTU system GOST. The CPTU system provided high-resolution geotechnical profiles of the uppermost sediments to a maximum penetration depth of ~ 20 m at six sites within the landslide features and beside them in undisturbed slope sediments as reference. The CPTU data reveal the occurrence of mechanically weaker zones (MWZ) by the drop of sedimentary strength. These zones are interbedded by coarser, more competent layers. The occurrence of sensitive fine-grained material may be responsible for the loss of strength in the deeper portion (appx. 12 to 18 m below seafloor). An 1D infinite pseudo-static stability analysis attests that the mechanically weaker zones (MWZ) correlate well with portions, where the Factor of Safety (FoS) ≤ 1 (meta-stable to unstable) indicates permanent deformation or failure in case additional dynamic load is induced by an earthquake. Thus, the mechanically weak layers can be considered as one important pre-condition for landslide activity. In conclusion, the integration of in situ CPTU data with geophysical data improves soil characterization and hence foster a better understanding of the pre-conditioning factors for slope instability at the upper continental slope off Vesterålen. Risk assessment for the present-day slope off Vesterålen is particularly crucial, because the opening of the region for offshore oil and gas exploration is controversially debated.",

            "abstract": "Thermally driven flows over simple slopes are a relevant research topic, not only per se, but also as a source of key concepts for understanding and modelling many other flows over more complex topographies. However, compared to down-slope, up-slope flows have received much less attention in the literature. Indeed, to investigate katabatic winds many extensive and well equipped field measurements were performed in recent years under various research projects, and a series of high-resolution numerical simulations were run. On the contrary, few field experiments have provided detailed datasets documenting the development of anabatic flows, and the analysis of numerical investigations still relies on Schumann’s (1990) pioneering LES simulations. Also, analytic solutions - such as Prandtl’s (1942) constant-K profiles - reproduce fairly well katabatic flows, but are definitely inadequate to accurately reproduce field data for up-slope flows (Defant 1949).\nIn particular, some open questions still claim for further investigations, such as the conditions of instability of slope-parallel flow vs. vertical motions, and the related possible occurrence of flow separation, and the similarity analysis of slope-normal velocity profiles of temperature anomaly, wind intensity and turbulence related quantities.\nHere a review of the state of the art on the subject is proposed, along with some insights into possible future developments.\n",

In Baltimore, where the observed downtown-rural temperature difference (as measured by NOAA stations) can reach 5°C, low-income neighborhoods are almost entirely covered by impervious surfaces like concrete but lack trees and parks. Their urban-rural temperature difference is then expected to exceed the reported one. However, that difference is not well quantified because these areas lack weather station coverage. Additionally, high resolution satellite imagery shows only land surface temperatures (inadequate for policy and health interventions) and may miss severe heat events. To remedy this, a low-cost monitoring network was installed in East Baltimore over summer 2015 aiming to characterize spatial and temporal variability and examine how heat excess varies during heat events. Results confirm that E. Baltimore exceeds downtown temperatures and show that a dense network of low cost sensors can help attribute temperature anomalies to local features such as land cover, building density and tree canopy.",

It is a cultural melting pot that affords little time for a rich and fruitful melded product to develop. I will argue and present that in my field of oil spills, there have been great strides to overcome this challenge by having these different groups meet and learn about each other.\nWhile it is one thing to have “exchanged business cards” prior to a crisis, what do you do when the “response” is greeted with academic scientists who want to help?\nI will argue that you can distill this other challenge to two simple points: (1) the responders need to communicate what they need, what resources they have, how fast they need answers, and what level of certainty they will accept and (2) academics need to understand that responders have little time for a 60-slide PowerPoint presentation on a potentially unproven approach, a long list of publications, and a discussion on H-factors. Simply, academic researchers need to provide a frank and brief description on what they can do, the logistics it demands, and a willingness to be part of a team that simply wants to “put out the fire”, save lives, and reduce damages with the potential for little reward from academia’s perspective.\nIt can take eight years to get tenure in academia, but a responder at a hazard event may only have eight hours to make a decision with whatever intelligence they have. And that’s the rub: wanting to help is just not enough. Academics have to show that you can make a timely difference for the response.

            "abstract": "A better knowledge on the microphysics of tropical continental convective systems is needed in order to improve quantitative precipitation measurements in the Tropics. Satellite passive microwave estimation of tropical rainfall could be improved with a better parameterization of the icy hydrometeors in the Bayesian RAIN estimation algorithm (BRAIN, Viltard et al., 2006) used over continental tropics. To address this important issue specific campaigns that combine aircraft based in situ microphysics probing and polarimetric radar have been organized as part of the CNES/ISRO satellite mission Megha-Tropiques. The first microphysics validation campaign was set up in Niamey in August 2010. The field deployment included the AMMA-CATH 56 rain gages, 3 disdrometers, 2 meteorological radars including the C-band MIT and the Xport X-band dual polarisation radar, and a 4 weeks campaign with the instrumented Falcon 20 from the french operator for environmental research aircrafts equipped with several microphysics probes and the 94Ghz cloud radar RASTA. The objective is to combine scales and methods to converge towards a parameterization of the ice size, mass and density laws inside continental Mesoscale Convective System (MCS). The Particle IDentification algorithm (PID) developed by the Colorado State University (CSU) adapted to the band X by B. Dolan (Dolan et al. 2009) is used to classify seven kind of particles: drizzle or light rain, moderate to heavy rain, wet and dry graupel, wet and dry aggregates and ice crystals. On a limited number of systems, the airborne microphysics sensors provide a detailed in situ reference on the Particle Size Distribution (PSD) that can be compared with the radar PID in the radar pixels located along the flight trajectory. An original approach has been developed for the radar – in situ comparison: it consists in simulating synthetic radar variables from the microphysics probe information and compare the 2 data sets in a common 'radar space'. The consistency between the 2 types of observation is good considering the differences in sampling. The time evolution of the hydrometeor types and their relative proportion in the convective and stratiform regions are analyzed for the 13rd August 2010 MCS.",

            "abstract": "Projections indicate that increasing population density, food production, and urbanization in conjunction with changing climate conditions will place stress on water resource availability. As a result, a holistic understanding of current and future water resource distribution is necessary for creating strategies to identify the most sustainable means of accessing this resource. Currently, most water resource management strategies rely on the application of global climate predictions to physically based hydrologic models to understand potential changes in water availability. However, the need to focus on understanding community-level social behaviors that determine individual water usage is becoming increasingly evident, as predictions derived only from hydrologic models cannot accurately represent the coevolution of basin hydrology and human water and land usage. Models that are better equipped to represent the complexity and heterogeneity of human systems and satellite-derived products in place of or in conjunction with historic data significantly improve preexisting hydrologic model accuracy and application outcomes. We used a novel agent-based sociotechnical model that combines the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and Agent Analyst and applied it in the Nzoia Basin, an area in western Kenya that is becoming rapidly urbanized and industrialized. Informed by a combination of satellite-derived products and over 150 household surveys, the combined sociotechnical model provided unique insight into how populations self-organize and make decisions based on water availability. In addition, the model depicted how population organization and current management alter water availability currently and in the future.",

The system tracks and collects meteorological data parameters and visualizes this data in near real time, using a MEAN development stack to create an HTML5 based tool that can send commands to the vehicle, parse incoming data, and perform other functions to store and serve data to other devices.\nNASA developers and science educators working on this project saw an opportunity to use this emerging technology to address a gap identified in science education between middle and high school curricula. As students learn about data analysis in elementary and middle school, they are taught to collect data from in situ sources. In high school, students are then asked to work with remotely sensed data, without always having the experience or understanding of how that data is collected.\nWe believe that using ROVs to create a “big data progression” for students will not only enhance their ability to understand how remote satellite data is collected, but will also provide the outlet for younger students to expand their interest in science and data prior to entering high school.\nIn this presentation, we will share and discuss our experiences with ROVs, APIs and data viz applications, with a focus on the next steps for developing this emerging capability.",

Examining changes in these parameters in fossil reefs can inform reconstructions of past sea-level behavior and, indirectly, ice sheet dynamics. Here we provide a detailed examination of fossil reefs from Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e. These fossil reefs are located in the granitic Seychelles, which is tectonically stable site and far-field from the former margins of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. To reconstruct relative sea level (RSL), we combine RTK and Total Station elevation surveys with sedimentary and taxonomic evaluations of eight fossil reef sites. Carbonate coralgal reef buildups of the shallowest portion of the reef are preserved in limestone outcrops that are protected by granite boulder overhangs. Two primary outcrop morphologies were observed at these sites: plastering and massive. Plastering outcrops manifest as thin (~ 1 m height x 1 m width x 0.5 m depth) vertical successions of reef framework and detritus, while massive outcrops are larger (~ 2-6 m height x 2-6 m width x 1-2 m depth). The base of these limestone outcrops consistently record a period of reef growth, characterized by corals or coralline algae colonizing the surface or face of a granite boulder and building upwards. This lower reefal unit is capped by a disconformity that is commonly overlain by coral rubble or a ~10 cm thick layer of micrite. Rubble units contain coarse fragments of the coralgal reef buildups while micrite layers consist of a relatively homogeneous fine-grained carbonate, bearing coral-dwelling, Pyrgomatid barnacles. In many of the outcrops, this succession is repeated upsection with another unit of coralgal reef framework capped by a disconformity that is recognized by the sharp transition to coral rubble or micrite with barnacles.\nWe identified four distinct fossil coralgal assemblages in the limestone outcrops. These assemblages are consistent with modern assemblages which constrain the paleo-water depth histories at each site. The combination of reef taxonomy as well as accretion hiatuses provides robust control on the reef, and thus sea-level, history of this region, and by extension, global mean sea level, during MIS 5e.",

Why have so few taken any action?\nMost studies of public response to climate change have focused on information deficit approaches. Many in the general public and environmental community have presumed that the public’s failure to engage is a function of lack of concern about climate change. Instead, using interviews and ethnographic research on how knowledge of climate change is experienced in everyday life I describe “the social organization of climate denial” and discuss how it impacts classroom learning and the broader social understanding of climate change. Disturbing emotions of guilt, helplessness and fear of the future arose when people were confronted with the idea of climate change. People then normalized these disturbing emotions by changing the subject of conversations, shifting their attention elsewhere, telling jokes, and drawing on stock social discourses that deflected responsibility to others. The difficulty people have in making sense of climate change is in direct relation to the social world around them. This research suggests that educational strategies in the classroom and for the general public that consider and target the social, cultural and political aspects of the meaning of climate change will be most effective (in addition to factors that affect individual cognition).",

            "abstract": "In the classical picture of heterogeneous nucleation, spherical liquid caps, characterized by a contact angle, appear on a surface at supersaturated conditions, and if these caps are larger than so called critical size, they grow spontaneously, whereas smaller caps will evaporate. In reality, vapor adsorption takes place already at subsaturated conditions, and depending on the substrate-vapor interactions, the adsorbed layer may consist of clusters centered on so called active sites. The extent of adsorption can be calculated using adsorption isotherms which give the average adsorption layer thickness as a function of vapor saturation ratio, provided that adsorption constants (characterizing the substrate-vapor interactions) are known. We recently proposed a new theory (Laaksonen, J. Phys. Chem. A., 2015) that combines adsorption and heterogeneous nucleation so that it can be used to calculate both the adsorption layer thickness at subsaturated conditions, as well as the onset supersaturation for nucleation. We showed that the new theory performs much better than the classical theory both with flat surfaces, and in the case of water vapor nucleating on SiO2, TiO2, and Ag2O nanoparticles (Laaksonen and Malila, ACPD, in press). Here, we review the new theory, and compare its predictive capability to that of the classical heterogeneous nucleation theory. We furthermore discuss the potential use of the new theory for calculation of condensation and deposition mode ice nucleation in the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of Xe isotope ratios in ocean island basalts (OIB) suggest that Earth's mantle accreted heterogeneously, and that compositional remnants of accretion are sampled by modern, high-3He/4He OIB associated with the Icelandic and Samoan plumes [1]. If so, the high-3He/4He source may also have a distinct oxygen isotopic composition from the rest of the mantle. Here, we test if the major elements of the high-3He/4He source preserve any evidence of heterogeneous accretion using measurements of three oxygen isotopes on olivine from a variety of high-3He/4He OIB locations. To high precision, the ∆17O value of high-3He/4He olivines from Hawaii, Pitcairn, Baffin Island and Samoa, are indistinguishable from bulk mantle olivine (Δ17OBulk Mantle - Δ17OHigh 3He/4He olivine = -0.002 ± 0.004 (2 x SEM) ‰). Thus, there is no resolvable oxygen isotope evidence for heterogeneous accretion in the high-3He/4He source. Modelling of mixing processes indicates that if an early-forming, oxygen-isotope distinct mantle did exist, either the anomaly was extremely small, or the anomaly was homogenised away by later mantle convection.\nThe δ18O values of olivine with the highest 3He/4He ratios from a variety of OIB locations have a relatively uniform composition (~5 ‰). This composition is intermediate to values associated with the depleted MORB mantle and the average mantle. Similarly, δ18O values of olivine from high-3He/4He OIB correlate with radiogenic isotope ratios of He, Sr, and Nd. Combined, this suggests that oxygen remains coupled to the more incompatible elements during melt production and migration and that the intermediate δ18O value is a feature of the mantle source. The processes responsible for the δ18O signature of high-3He/4He mantle are not certain, but δ18O-87Sr/86Sr correlations indicate that it may be connected to a predominance of a HIMU-like (high U/Pb) component or other moderate δ18O components recycled into the high-3He/4He source.\n[1] S.

            "abstract": "It is well known that fluids play a crucial role in subduction evolution. For example, mechanical weakening along tectonic interfaces, due to high fluid pressure, may enable oceanic subduction. Hence, the fluid content seems to be a critical parameter for subduction initiation. Studies have also shown a correlation between the location of slab dehydration and intermediate seismic activity. Furthermore, expelled fluids from the subduction slab affect the melting temperature, consequently, contributing to partial melting in the wedge above the down-going plate and extensive volcanism. In summary, fluids have a great impact on tectonic processes and therefore should be incorporated into geodynamic numerical models. Here we use existing approaches to couple and solve fluid flow equations in the SLIM-3D thermo-mechanical code. SLIM-3D is a three-dimensional thermo-mechanical code capable of simulating lithospheric deformation with elasto-visco-plastic rheology. It has been successfully applied to model geodynamic processes at different tectonic settings, including subduction zones. However, although SLIM-3D already includes many features, fluid migration has not been incorporated into the model yet. To this end, we coupled solid and fluid flow assuming that fluids flow through a porous and deformable solid. Thereby, we introduce a two-phase flow into the model, in which the Stokes flow is coupled with the Darcy law for fluid flow. Ultimately, the evolution of porosity is governed by a compaction pressure and the advection of the porous solid. We show the details of our implementation of the fluid flow into the existing thermo-mechanical finite element code and present first results of benchmarks and experiments. We are especially interested in the coupling of subduction processes and the evolution of the magmatic arc. Thereby, we focus on the key factors controlling magma emplacement and its influence on subduction processes.",

            "abstract": "Lasting success of the Green Revolution in Punjab, India relies on continued availability of local water resources. Supplying primarily rice and wheat for the rest of India, Punjab supports crop irrigation with a canal system and groundwater, which is vastly over-exploited. The detailed data required to physically model future impacts on water supplies agricultural production is not readily available for this region, therefore we use Bayesian methods to estimate hydrologic properties and irrigation requirements for an under-constrained mass balance model. Using measured values of historical precipitation, total canal water delivery, crop yield, and water table elevation, we present a method using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to solve for a distribution of values for each unknown parameter in a conceptual mass balance model. Due to heterogeneity across the state, and the resolution of input data, we estimate model parameters at the district-scale using spatial pooling. The resulting model is used to predict the impact of precipitation change scenarios on groundwater availability under multiple cropping options. Predicted groundwater declines vary across the state, suggesting that crop selection and water management strategies should be determined at a local scale. This computational method can be applied in data-scarce regions across the world, where water resource management is required to resolve competition between food security and available resources in a changing climate.",

            "abstract": "The Izu-Bonin-Mariana intraoceanic arc system, in the western Pacific, results from ~52 My of subduction of the Pacific plate beneath the eastern margin of the Philippine Sea plate. Four sites were drilled south of the Bonin Islands during IODP Expedition 352 and 1.22 km of igneous basement was cored upslope to the west of the trough. These stratigraphically controlled igneous suites allow study of the earliest stages of arc development from seafloor spreading to convergence. We present the preliminary results of a detailed major and trace element (ICPMS) study on 128 igneous rocks drilled during Expedition 352.\nMainly basalts and basaltic andesites were recovered at the two deeper water sites (U1440 and U1441) and boninites at the two westernmost sites (U1439 and U1442). Sites U1440 and U1441 basaltic suites are trace element depleted (e.g. Yb 4-6 x PM); they have fractionated REE patterns (LREE/HREE = 0.2-0.4 x C1-chondrites) compared to mid-ocean ridge basalts. They have compositions overlapping that of previously sampled Fore-Arc Basalts (FAB) series. They are characterized also by an increase in LILE contents relative to neighboring elements up-section (e.g. Rb/La ranging from <1 to 3-7 x PM at Site U1440) suggesting a progressive contamination of their source by fluids. This process in turn may have favored melting and efficient melt extraction from the source and thus its extreme depletion. Boninites are depleted in moderately incompatible elements with a decrease in their contents up-section (e.g. Yb = ~6.2 to 2.8 x C1-chondrite at Site U1439). These changes in trace element contents are associated with the development of a positive Zr-Hf anomaly relative to neighboring elements and a strong increase in LILE (e.g., Zr/Sm=~1 to 2.6 x PM and Rb/La=1-2 to 10-18). The progressive upward depletion of boninitic lavas could reveal the incorporation of harzburgitic residues from FAB generation into their mantle source.",

            "abstract": "Iron minerals play important roles in governing soil nutrient availability and carbon dynamics. Periods of intermittent anoxia (low-oxygen) in upland soils can drive microbial reduction and dissolution of iron minerals. However, quantifying ecosystem-scale iron reduction in upland soils is challenging. The key condition necessary for soil iron reduction is water saturation of soil micropores, even if the entire soil profile is not flooded. We assessed soil moisture and texture across three first-order watersheds at the Calhoun Critical Zone Observatory in South Carolina, USA over one year using electromagnetic induction (EMI). From these point measurements, we have created monthly maps of interpolated soil moisture. From the EMI data, we found that locations that remain relatively wet or dry throughout the year are not related to hill-slope position but to differences in soil texture along a catena. Across a gradient of soil moisture and texture (based on soil conductivity from the EMI probe) we installed passive redox sensors and conducted in situ iron reduction experiments. This data will be presented and the relationships between iron reduction, the spatial distribution of soil moisture/clay content, and the significance of these data with respect to soil carbon cycling will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "It took half a century for Wegener's continental drift theory to be accepted as a fundamental element of the plate tectonic theory. Another half a century on, we are still unsure of the driving mechanism for plate tectonics: is it dominated by thermal convection, gravitational forces, or by a combination of mechanisms? Nonetheless, breakthroughs in the past decades put us in a position to make a major stride in answering this question. These include: (1) widely accepted cyclic occurrences of supercontinent assembly and break-up (whereas random occurrence of supercontinents was an equal possibility in the 1990s); (2) the discovery of two equatorial and antipodal large low seismic velocity provinces (LLSVPs) that dominate the lower mantle and appear to have been the base for almost all mantle plumes since at the Mesozoic, and of subduction of oceanic slabs all the way to the core-mantle boundary, which together suggesting whole-mantle convection; (3) the\nrecognition of true polar wander (TPW) as an important process in Earth\nhistory, likely reflecting Earth's major internal mass redistribution\nevents; and (4) rapidly enhancing computer modelling power enabling us to simulate all aspect of Earth's dynamic inner working. Many new yet often controversial ideas have been proposed, such a possible coupling in time (with an offset) and space between supercontinent cycle and superplume (LLSVP) events which oppose to the idea of static and long-lived LLSVPs, and the orthoversion v.s. introversion or extroversion models for supercontinent transition. To fully utilise these advances as well as the rapidly expanding global geoscience databases to address the question of how Earth works, an UNESCO-IUGS sponsored IGCP project No. 648 was formed to coordinate a global cross-disciplinary effort. We aim to achieve a better understanding of the supercontinent cycle, and examine the relationship between supercontinent cycle and global plume events. We will establish a series of global geological and geophysical databases to enable the geoscience community to make data-rich visual paleogeographic reconstructions using software like GPlates. In addition, the project will bring the geotectonic and the geodynamic modelling communities together to test global geodynamic models into the geological deep time.",

Understanding the complexity of seismic sources, beside its importance from a theoretical standpoint, responds to the fundamental challenge of improving the calculation of the ground motion and tsunami inundation variability for future earthquakes, especially in the near-field where usually major damage occurs.\nIn the last 10 years, the surge of great earthquakes, the increasing number and quality of near-field observations and the exponential growth of computational resources boosted the seismologist capability of reconstructing the spatio-temporal evolution of rupture processes, even for strong earthquakes.\nHere we present an inverse method we developed in recent years and applied to study several events occurred in different tectonic environment and spanning a wide range of magnitude, from strong to great earthquakes. Our inverse technique belongs to a well-known class of optimization methods based on simulated annealing algorithms. One of the key point of this inverse method relies on its capability of performing an efficient importance sampling of the model space, the latter being characterized by high dimensionality (>100), to build up an ensemble of good data fitting models. Then, the algorithm performs a statistical analysis of the model ensemble to extract stable features of the earthquake source model together with the associated uncertainty.\nA further key point of the method is the possibility to jointly invert for different datasets (strong motion, static and high rate GPS, InSAR data, tide gauges and ocean bottom pressure gauges), each probing different characteristics of the source process and having different spatio-temporal resolution. Relevant case studies will be presented to discuss ongoing and future improvements.",

In contrast, a new model termed “orthoversion”, predicts a new supercontinent will form 90° away from the previous one, somewhere along the subduction girdle encircling its predecessor. As continents are expected to aggregate over mantle convective downwellings, orthoversion predicts that a continent central to the assembling supercontinent would plot 90° away from the center of the dispersing continent. Supercontinent centers can be quantified by identifying the long-lived axis of oscillatory true polar wander associated with each supercontinent cycle; measuring the angle between two successive true polar wander axes allows one to test between the various models (0˚, 90˚, or 180˚) of supercontinent formation. The past three supercontinents (Pangea, Rodinia, and Nuna) appear to follow the 90° “orthoversion” model closely. Orthoversion predicts that Amasia will take form ~100 million years from now over the North Pole by closing the Caribbean and Artic oceans which are located in Pangea’s subduction girdle.",

            "abstract": "Soil erosion is one of the main processes influencing land and water degradation at the global scale. Identifying the main sediment sources is therefore essential for effective soil erosion management. Accordingly, caesium-137 (137Cs) concentrations were used to quantify the relative contribution of surface and subsurface erosion sources in a lowland drained catchment in France. As 137Cs concentrations are often dependent on particle size, specific surface area (SSA) and novel Thorium (Th) based particle size corrections were applied. Surface and subsurface samples were collected to characterize the radionuclide properties of potential sources. Sediment samples were collected during one hydrological year and a sediment core was sampled to represent sediment accumulated over a longer temporal period. Additionally, sediment from tile drains was sampled to determine the radionuclide properties of sediment exported from the drainage network. The results highlight a substantial enrichment in fine particles and associated 137Cs concentrations between the sources and the sediment. The application of both correction factors reduced this difference, with the Th correction providing a more accurate comparison of source and sediment samples than the SSA correction. Modelling results clearly indicate the dominance of surface sources during the flood events and in the sediment core. Sediment exported from the drainage network was modelled to originate predominantly from surface sources. This study demonstrates the potential of Th to correct for 137Cs particle size enrichment. More importantly, this research indicates that drainage networks may significantly increase the connectivity of surface sources to stream networks. Managing sediment transferred through drainage networks may reduce the deleterious effects of suspended sediment loads on riverine systems in similar lowland drained agricultural catchments.",

            "abstract": "Flow speeds of Greenland outlet glaciers play an important role in modulating ice sheet mass balance. Flow variability is dictated by how outlet glaciers respond to unknown or poorly constrained perturbations in their boundary conditions; identifying the physical processes controlling outlet glacier flow variability is key to improving models of ice sheet evolution. In this study, we use satellite remote sensing data, in situ observations, and numerical models to explore the boundary conditions that control the unique flow behavior of two West Greenland outlet glaciers.\nKangerdlugssup Sermerssua (KS) and Kangilerngata Sermia (KGS), exhibit seasonal flow variability that is anti-correlated with surrounding glaciers. Both glaciers decelerate in the spring when meltwater becomes available. The seasonal deceleration is usually on the order of 10% the annual average speed, and lasts ~2 months. During high melt years, the deceleration is highly exaggerated (~80% of the annual average), causing a near shutdown of glacier flow along the lower 20 km of the trunk. For example, in 2010 KS decelerated from its average speed of ~2000 m/yr to 250 m/yr; the deceleration and the acceleration back to its average speed took roughly 2 months. Force balance analyses show that both glaciers have anomalously low driving stress and basal drag values. We hypothesize that glaciers with low basal drag are particularly sensitive to variations in subglacial water. The discrete decelerations and reactivation of these two unique glacier systems allow us to analyze the complicated evolution of subglacial hydrologic systems and their interaction with ice velocity and force components.",

In addition, processes involved in earthquake generation and the physics of short-term seismic transients, 4D deformations to understand earthquake cycle processes, fluid activity monitoring and seismicity under the sea floor using existing autonomous instrumentation, early warning and development of real-time shake and loss information, real- and quasi-real-time earthquake and tsunami hazard monitoring and earthquake-induced landslide hazard topics are also covered within MARSite. In particular, achievements and progress in the design and building of a multi-parameter borehole system consisting of very wide dynamic range and stable borehole (VBB) broad band seismic sensor, with incorporated 3-D strain meter, tilt meter, and temperature and local hydrostatic pressure measuring devices would be reported.

            "abstract": "ePoster - Rachael Bullock_AGU poster.pdf\nTo improve our understanding of the factors controlling rupture propagation to the surface it is critical to constrain the frictional properties and deformation mechanisms of shallow crustal fault zones in poorly lithified sediments.\nWe performed a set of rotary shear friction experiments on clay-rich, carbonate synthetic gouges, from the seismogenic Masada (Dead Sea) fault zone in Israel. The experiments were run at low- (0-130 μm/s) and high-velocity (1.3 m/s), at normal stress of 1-18 MPa (equivalent to a depth range of 0.05-1 km), and under room-humidity, water-saturated and brine-saturated conditions.\nDuring rate and state, low-velocity experiments at 1 MPa, all gouges behave in a velocity-strengthening manner, particularly when fluid-saturated. During high-velocity experiments at 1 MPa, all gouges have large slip weakening distances of >16 m. In both cases, the dominant deformation mechanism is distributed particulate flow. During low-velocity experiments at 18 MPa, a transition to velocity-weakening behaviour is observed in the room-humidity and water-saturated gouges at displacements > 15 cm, corresponding to shear localization. However, the brine-saturated gouge remains velocity-strengthening throughout. The dominant deformation mechanism in these gouges is distributed cataclasis. During high-velocity experiments at 18 MPa, all gouges exhibit small slip-weakening distances of <1.7 m for dry gouges, and <<0.1 m for fluid saturated gouges, which also exhibit low fracture energy. The dominant deformation mechanism is localized cataclasis in the dry gouge, with evidence for frictional heating, and distributed particulate flow in the fluid-saturated gouges, with no evidence of significant frictional heating.\nOur results show that the lack of fracturing during seismic faulting in saturated, clay-rich sediments will result in earthquakes rupturing the faults having very low fracture energy, thus greatly facilitating rupture propagation to the surface. The fact that fluid-saturated gouges, at low normal stress, deform via the same mechanism (particulate flow) at both sub-seismic and seismic slip velocities, suggests that it is not possible to use microstructural observations alone to differentiate seismic from aseismic fault gouges in shallow-crustal, fluid-saturated fault zones.",

All the proxies changed little during Unit I (13-11.3ka B.P.) and revealed the climate kept in a relative stable level. Obvious fluctuation happened in Unit II (11.3-10.1ka B.P.) and the temperature kept decreasing more than 1ka till the Younger Dryas event, showed a well regional response to global climate changes. While continuous warming trend resumed again in Unit III (10.1-8 ka B.P.), which may be the signal for Holocene warm period.

            "abstract": "Traditional methods used to calculate recurrence rate of volcanism, such as linear regression, maximum likelihood and Weibull-Poisson distributions, are effective at estimating recurrence rate and confidence level, but these methods are unable to estimate uncertainty in recurrence rate through time. We propose a new model for estimating recurrence rate and uncertainty, Volcanic Event Recurrence Rate Model. VERRM is an algorithm that incorporates radiometric ages, volcanic stratigraphy and paleomagnetic data into a Monte Carlo simulation, generating acceptable ages for each event. Each model run is used to calculate recurrence rate using a moving average window. These rates are binned into discrete time intervals and plotted using the 5th, 50th and 95th percentiles. We present recurrence rates from Cima Volcanic Field (CA), Yucca Mountain (NV) and Arsia Mons (Mars). Results from Cima Volcanic Field illustrate how several K-Ar ages with large uncertainties obscure three well documented volcanic episodes. Yucca Mountain results are similar to published rates and illustrate the use of using the same radiometric age for multiple events in a spatially defined cluster. Arsia Mons results show a clear waxing/waning of volcanism through time. VERRM output may be used for a spatio-temporal model or to plot uncertainty in quantifiable parameters such as eruption volume or geochemistry. Alternatively, the algorithm may be reworked to constrain geomagnetic chrons. VERRM is implemented in Python 2.7 and takes advantage of NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib libraries for optimization and quality plotting presentation. A typical Monte Carlo simulation of 40 volcanic events takes a few minutes to couple hours to complete, depending on the bin size used to assign ages.",

All of these developments are resulting in the development of standards and services implemented and used by their regional communities.\nThe Ocean Data Interoperability Platform (ODIP) project is supported by the EU FP7 Research Infrastructures programme, National Science Foundation (USA) and Australian government and has been initiated 1st October 2012. Recently the project has been continued as ODIP 2 for another 3 years with EU HORIZON 2020 funding. ODIP includes all the major organisations engaged in ocean data management in EU, US, and Australia. ODIP is also supported by the IOC-IODE, closely linking this activity with its Ocean Data Portal (ODP) and Ocean Data Standards Best Practices (ODSBP) projects.\nThe ODIP platform aims to ease interoperability between the regional marine data management infrastructures. Therefore it facilitates an organised dialogue between the key infrastructure representatives by means of publishing best practice, organising a series of international workshops and fostering the development of common standards and interoperability solutions. These are evaluated and tested by means of prototype projects.\nThe presentation will give further background on the ODIP projects and the latest information on the progress of three prototype projects addressing:\nestablishing interoperability between the regional EU, USA and Australia data discovery and access services (SeaDataNet CDI, US NODC, and IMOS MCP) and contributing to the global GEOSS and IODE-ODP portals;\nestablishing interoperability between cruise summary reporting systems in Europe, the USA and Australia for routine harvesting of cruise data for delivery via the Partnership for Observation of Global Oceans (POGO) global portal;\nestablishing common standards for a Sensor Observation Service (SOS) for selected sensors installed on vessels and in real-time monitoring systems using sensor web enablement (SWE)",

Previous studies have shown an ULF foreshock boundary exists upstream of the Earth, Venus and Saturn bow shocks below which no interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) fluctuations are present. Using data from Venus Express (VEX) magnetometer, we revisit the properties of the ULF boundary upstream of Venus bow shock after the study reported from PVO data by Greenstadt et al., JGR, 1987. On the basis of 1 Hz magnetic field measurements form VEX, we precisely investigate the boundary of monochromatic foreshock ULF waves at Venus for IMF cone angle from 10 to 70 degrees. Similarly to Earth and Saturn boundaries, we found that Venusian ULF foreshock boundary characteristics are very sensitive to the IMF direction. Precisely, both Earth and Venus boundary have a similar slope with respect to the Sun-Earth direction. Interestingly we have found that Venus ULF foreshock boundary slope increases monotonically with the IMF cone-angle. This results clearly contrasts with previous determinations.",

The short duration and distance between the events poses the question of whether these two events are related. We combine existing seismic data from permanent networks in Alaska and Canada, including temporary aftershock deployments (both on land and ocean-bottom sensors) installed in the Haida Gwaii islands, to search for precursory activity prior to each of the events. In order to improve the catalog completeness, we utilize a matched-filter technique to identify potential missing earthquakes before and after each mainshock. This technique utilizes existing cataloged waveforms as templates to identify repeating or nearby earthquakes with high cross-correlations. We examine the seismic activity prior to and following each event and determine whether any dynamic or delayed triggering of earthquakes or tremor occurs regionally due to these earthquakes. We find small earthquakes on the Fairweather Fault, near Glacier Bay, directly triggered in the minutes after the Haida Gwaii event. In addition, preliminary evidence suggests the Haida Gwaii earthquake triggered some seismicity in the rupture region of the Craig earthquake over the ~2 month period of time between the mainshocks. We plan to assess whether the later-occurring Craig earthquake triggered any increase in aftershock activity within the Haida Gwaii rupture region. The static and dynamic transmission of stresses from large earthquakes has important implications for transient fault zone loading in areas adjacent to those initial rupture zones. This study should shed some light on large earthquake interactions at various distance scales and future seismic risks across Alaska and western Canada.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_GEM2.pdf\nIn Antarctica, ice crystals (platelets) form and grow in supercooled waters below ice shelves. These platelets rise and accumulate beneath nearby sea ice to form a several meter thick sub-ice platelet layer. This special ice type is a unique habitat, influences sea-ice mass and energy balance, and its volume can be interpreted as an indicator for ice – ocean interactions. Although progress has been made in determining and understanding its spatio-temporal variability based on point measurements, an investigation of this phenomenon on a larger scale remains a challenge due to logistical constraints and a lack of suitable methodology.\nIn the present study, we applied a lateral constrained Marquardt-Levenberg inversion to a unique multi-frequency electromagnetic (EM) induction sounding dataset obtained on the ice-shelf influenced fast-ice regime of Atka Bay, eastern Weddell Sea. We adapted the inversion algorithm to incorporate a sensor specific signal bias, and confirmed the reliability of the algorithm by performing a sensitivity study using synthetic data. We inverted the field data for sea-ice and sub-ice platelet-layer thickness and electrical conductivity, and calculated ice-volume fractions from platelet-layer conductivities using Archie’s Law. The thickness results agreed well with drill-hole validation datasets within the uncertainty range, and the ice-volume fraction also yielded plausible results. Our findings imply that multi-frequency EM induction sounding is a suitable approach to efficiently map sea-ice and platelet-layer properties. However, we emphasize that the successful application of this technique requires a break with traditional EM sensor calibration strategies due to the need of absolute calibration with respect to a physical forward model.",

Department of Energy has funded a series of chemical tests at the National Nuclear Security Site (NNSS) in Climax Stock granite as part of the Source Physics Experiment (SPE) with the aim of gaining a better understanding of the generation and propagation of seismic energy from underground explosions in hard rock media. To date, four tests have been conducted in the same borehole with yields of 100, 1000, 900 and 100 kg at different depths of burials. The nominal scaled depths of burial are 938, 363, 376 and 1556 m/kt1/3 compared to standard containment practices of ~120 m/kt1/3. A quite dense array of free field accelerometers were installed around the borehole, both on and off shot depth. Acceleration data were corrected for shock-generated baseline-shifts, and free field ground velocity waveforms were obtained. This work concentrates on the qualitative analysis of the reduced displacement potentials and the explosion source spectra for the last shot of the series (SPE-4Prime) and the comparison of the obtained results against the previous events. Finally, the results obtained from the experimental data are compared to the Mueller-Murphy empirical explosion model both using the Heard and Ackerman and Denny and Johnson cavity radius scaling laws.",

            "abstract": "We compare two Big Data technologies, SciDB and Spark, for performance, usability, and extensibility, when applied to a representative Earth science use case. SciDB is a new-generation parallel distributed database management system (DBMS) based on the array data model that is capable of handling multidimensional arrays efficiently but requires lengthy data ingest prior to analysis, whereas Spark is a fast and general engine for large scale data processing that can immediately process raw data files and thereby avoid the ingest process. Once data have been ingested, SciDB is very efficient in database operations such as subsetting. Spark, on the other hand, provides greater flexibility by supporting a wide variety of high-level tools including DBMS’s.\nFor the performance aspect of this preliminary comparison, we configure Spark to operate directly on text or binary data files and thereby limit the need for additional tools. Arguably, a more appropriate comparison would involve exploring other configurations of Spark which exploit supported high-level tools, but that is beyond our current resources. To make the comparison as “fair” as possible, we export the arrays produced by SciDB into text files (or converting them to binary files) for the intake by Spark and thereby avoid any additional file processing penalties.\nThe Earth science use case selected for this comparison is the identification and tracking of snowstorms in the NASA Modern Era Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) reanalysis data. The identification portion of the use case is to flag all grid cells of the MERRA high-resolution hourly data that satisfies our criteria for snowstorm, whereas the tracking portion connects flagged cells adjacent in time and space to form a snowstorm episode.\n\nWe will report the results of our comparisons at this presentation.",

            "abstract": "Estimates of actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) at field scale over the growing season are required for improving agricultural water management, particularly in water limited and drought prone regions. Remote sensing data from multiple platforms such as airborne and Landsat-based sensors can be used to provide these estimates. Combining these data with surface energy balance models can provide ETa estimates at sub- field scale as well as information on vegetation stress and soil moisture conditions. However, the temporal resolution of airborne and Landsat data does not allow for a continuous ETa monitoring over the course of the growing season. This study presents the application of a hybrid ETa modeling approach developed for monitoring daily ETa and root zone available water at high spatial resolutions.\nThe hybrid ETa modeling approach couples a thermal-based energy balance model with a water balance-based scheme using data assimilation. The two source energy balance (TSEB) model is used to estimate instantaneous ETa which can be extrapolated to daily ETa using a water balance model modified to use the reflectance-based basal crop coefficient for interpolating ETa in between airborne and/or Landsat overpass dates. Moreover, since it is a water balance model, the soil moisture profile is also estimated.\nThe hybrid ETa approach is applied over vineyard fields in central California. High resolution airborne and Landsat imagery were used to drive the hybrid model. These images were collected during periods that represented different vine phonological stages in 2013 growing season. Estimates of daily ETa and surface energy balance fluxes will be compared with ground-based eddy covariance tower measurements. Estimates of soil moisture at multiple depths will be compared with measurements.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the statistics of records in the time series of crackling bursts emerging during the compressive failure of porous materials. Bursts of local breaking events are generated by computer simulations of the uniaxial compression of cylindrical samples in a discrete element model. We show that the number of records grows as a decelerating power law of the number of events followed by an acceleration immediately prior to failure. The size of records has a power law distribution with an exponent significantly smaller than the one of the complete burst size distribution. The lifetime of records proved to be also power law distributed with a relatively low exponent. Analyzing the behavior of average quantities of records we show the existence of a characteristic record rank k* which separates two regimes of the time evolution of the fracture process: the beginning of the failure process is characterized by the slow-down of record breaking due to the effect of disorder. Then record breaking accelerates as macroscopic failure is approached when spatial and temporal correlations dominate.\nScaling analysis revealed that the size distribution of records of different ranks has a universal form independent of the record rank. Sub-sequences of bursts enclosed by consecutive records are characterized by a power law size distribution with an exponent which decreases as failure is approached. Our analysis revealed that records have a strong effect on the structure of the surrounding time series: high rank records are preceded by bursts of increasing size and waiting time between consecutive events and they are followed by a relaxation process. In principle the results could be used to improve forecasting of catastrophic failure events, if they can be observed reliably in a single experiment in real time.",

            "abstract": "The planet Mercury has been studied by the space mission Mariner 10, in the 1970's, and by the MESSENGER mission launched in 2004. Interest in the first planet of the Solar System has now been renewed by the launch in 2017 of the BepiColombo mission. MESSENGER and BepiColombo give access to information about the local conditions of the magnetosphere of Mercury. This data must be evaluated in the context of the global interaction between the solar wind and the planet's magnetosphere. Global scale simulations of the planet's environment are necessary to fully understand the data gathered from in-situ measurements. We use three-dimensional simulations to support the scientific goals of the two missions.\nIn contrast with the results based on MHD (Kabin et al., 2000) and hybrid codes (Kallio et Janhumen, 2003; Travnicek et al., 2007, 2010; Richer et al., 2012), the present work is based on the implicit moment Particle-in-Cell (PiC) method, which allows to use large time and space steps, while granting access to the dynamics of the smaller electron scales in the plasma. The purpose of these preliminary PIC simulations is to retrieve the top-level features of Mercury's magnetosphere and its frontiers. We compare the results obtained with the implicit moment PiC method against 3D hybrid simulations.\nWe perform simulations of the global plasma environment of Mercury using the solar wind conditions measured by MESSENGER. We show that complex flows form around the planet, including the development of Kelvin-Helmoltz instabilities at the flanks. We evaluate the dynamics of the shock, magnetosheath, magnetopause, the reconnection areas, the formation of plasma sheet and magnetotail, and the variation of ion/electron plasma flows when crossing these frontiers. The simulations also give access to detailed information about the particle dynamics and their velocity distribution at locations that can be used for comparison with data from MESSENGER and later on with the forthcoming BepiColombo. A particular emphasis is given on the new information gathered from the electron dynamics, which is unaccessible with any other kind of simulations.\nThe research reported here received support by the European Commission via the DEEP and DEEP-ER projects and by the computational infrastructure of the VSC (Belgium).",

The development of the model consists of an initial phase of active oceanic subduction and a second phase, after collision, of pure gravitational evolution; in addition, it considers 3 different velocities of active subduction. Our results show that accounting for mantle hydration is essential to produce small-scale convective flows in a wedge area with the consequent recycling and exhumation of subducted material. In addition, the dynamics of hydrated areas are strictly correlated to the thermal state at the external boundaries of the mantle wedge, and the extension of hydrated areas is independent from the subduction velocities when mantle hydration and shear heating are simultaneously considered during the active subduction phase. During the pure gravitational phase, the hydrated portion of the wedge undergoes a progressive enlargement for models with a high subduction velocity during the previous active phase. Finally, a comparison between the predicted P/T ratios and the P-T conditions recorded by markers during subduction, which show metamorphic gradients that are traditionally considered to be distinctive examples of different phases of evolution in an ocean/continent subduction complex, supports the notion that contrasting P-T conditions can contemporaneously characterize different portions of the subduction system during successive phases of modeled subduction-collision.",

The major objective of MAPS is the trial run of the laboratory and airborne measurement and the preparation for the sensor calibration. From these campaigns, it is possible to increase the accuracy of air quality model and also to assess the retrieval algorithm for Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS). The Geostationary Trace-gas and Aerosol Sensor Optimization (GEO-TASO) instrument which will be onboard aircraft utilizes Offner spectrometer with a 4 mirror telescope. For the data processing, we plan to develop the wavelength calibration algorithm for the raw measurements from this airborne hyperspectral sensor. The important parameters considered in spectral calibration of radiance spectra are absorption of ozone and ring effect. We would adapt the similar process with the heritage programs such as OMI, GOME and OMPS and so on. However, the airborne flying environment in troposphere would be different compared to GEMS’s geostationary orbit. Therefore, the parameters which cause wavelength change could be different. For example, the variation of aircraft altitude would bring additional uncertainties in wavelength change. Here, the GEMS prototype algorithm is applied to Geo-TASO measurement to derive slit functions and check wavelength shift. And the algorithm sensitivity to each parameter will be examined. Through these tests, the characteristics of each parameter and their correlation will be used to refine the GEMS algorithm and to futher KORUS-AQ study.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates the potential of the ASD-WhiteRef system for monitoring CO2 fluxes and vegetation biophysical parameters (such as e.g. fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation - fapar, canopy total chlorophyll content - TotChl). The ASD-WhiteRef is an automated system designed for continuous and unattended acquisition of radiometric data using an ASD FieldSpec Pro spectroradiometer. The ASD-WhiteRef system was installed in May 2013 at the EC tower (at a height of 6 m, with a field of view of 25°) of the FLUXNET Monte Bondone site (IT-MBo), which is a representative of a typical extensively-managed, low-productive meadow of the Italian Alps.\nVegetation hyperspectral reflectance and EC observations were collected on a continuous basis for three growing seasons covering periods of extreme weather conditions (both hot/dry and rainy periods), while fapar and TotChl were determined periodically (at around weekly intervals) during two growing seasons at different vegetation development stages by means of line quantum sensors and UV-VIS spectroscopy method, respectively.\nIn order to characterize the interannual dynamics in grassland CO2 fluxes three approaches were used: i) linear regression between CO2 fluxes and spectral vegetation indices – VI (model 1); ii) linear regression between CO2 fluxes and a product of VI and PAR (model 2), iii) partial least squares regression (PLSR) using simultaneously the full set of ASD-WhiteRef reflectance spectra (2151 bands, 350-2500 nm) to predict CO2 fluxes. In addition, model i) and model iii) were tested also for predicting fapar and TotChl variability. The range of presented VIs contained both VIs derived from the Sentinel-2 bands simulation and VIs calculated using all two-band combinations of wavelengths available from the ASD-WhiteRef hyperspectral dataset.\nThe findings of the study highlight the potential of vegetation spectroscopy to monitor temporal variations in key drivers of photosynthesis process in grassland ecosystem and further upscaling of the observations.",

The goal of this course is to educate students on the data available and scope of GIS applications in Earth science across the CDI climate themes. Real world applications and datasets serve as a pedagogical tool that provide a useful medium for instruction in scientific geospatial analysis and GIS software. With a wide range of potential research areas that fall under the rubric of “Earth science”, thematic foci can help to structure a student’s understanding of the potential uses of GIS across sub-disciplines, while communicating core data processing concepts.

            "abstract": "Deriving crop pattern with high accuracy is of great importance for characterizing landscape diversity, which affects the resilience of food webs in agricultural systems in the face of climatic and land cover changes. Landsat sensors were originally designed to monitor agricultural areas, and both radiometric and spatial resolution are optimized for monitoring large agricultural fields. Unfortunately, few clear Landsat images per year are available, which has limited the use of Landsat for making crop classification, and this situation is worse in cloudy areas of the Earth. Meanwhile, the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data has better temporal resolution but cannot capture fine spatial heterogeneity of agricultural systems. Our question was to what extent fusing imagery from both sensors could improve crop classifications. We utilized the Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model (STARFM) algorithm to simulate Landsat-like images at MODIS temporal resolution. Based on Random Forests (RF) classifier, we tested whether and by what degree crop maps from 2000 to 2014 of the Arlington Agricultural Research Station (Wisconsin, USA) were improved by integrating available clear Landsat images each year with synthetic images. We predicted that the degree to which classification accuracy can be improved by incorporating synthetic imagery depends on the number and acquisition time of clear Landsat images. Moreover, multi-season data are essential for mapping crop types by capturing their phenological dynamics, and STARFM-simulated images can be used to compensate for missing Landsat observations. Our study is helpful for eliminating the limits of the use of Landsat data in mapping crop patterns, and can provide a benchmark of accuracy when choosing STARFM-simulated images to make crop classification at broader scales.",

A total of 583 pairs of high-quality SWS measurements utilizing the PKS, SKKS, and SKS phases demonstrate primarily N-S fast orientations with an average splitting delay time of approximately 1.2 s. An absence of periodic azimuthal variation of the observed splitting parameters indicates the presence of simple anisotropy, and lack of correlation between surficial features and the splitting parameters suggests that the origin of the observed anisotropy is primarily asthenospheric. Receiver function H-k stacking reveals crustal thicknesses ranging from 25 to 36 km, and Vp/Vs measurements ranging from 1.73 to 1.93, suggesting a spatially heterogeneous crustal structure and composition. The apparent depths of the seismic discontinuities (d410 and d660) bordering the mantle transition zone (MTZ) increase beneath Cenozoic volcanoes in central Libya, suggesting lower-than-normal upper mantle velocities. One of the most significant features in the resulting MTZ thickness map is a region in eastern Libya which has a MTZ thickness of about 270 km, indicating a colder than normal MTZ probably associated with subducted slabs.",

            "abstract": "Understanding off-fault deformation and distribution of displacement rates associated with disconnected strike-slip faults requires a three-dimensional view of fault geometries. We address problems associated with distributed faulting by studying the Mojave segment of the East California Shear Zone (ECSZ), a region dominated by northwest-directed dextral shear along disconnected northwest- southeast striking faults. We use a combination of cross-sectional interpretations, 3D Boundary Element Method (BEM) models, and slip-rate measurements to test new hypothesized fault connections. We find that reverse faulting acts as an important means of slip transfer between strike-slip faults, and show that the impacts of these structural connections on shortening, uplift, strike-slip rates, and off-fault deformation, help to reconcile the overall strain budget across this portion of the ECSZ. In detail, we focus on the Calico and Blackwater faults, which are hypothesized to together represent the longest linked fault system in the Mojave ECSZ, connected by a restraining step at 35°N. Across this restraining step the system displays a pronounced displacement gradient, where dextral offset decreases from ~11.5 to <2 km from south to north. Cross-section interpretations show that ~40% of this displacement is transferred from the Calico fault to the Harper Lake and Blackwater faults via a set of north-dipping thrust ramps. Late Quaternary dextral slip rates follow a similar pattern, where 1.4 +0.8/-0.4 mm/yr of slip along the Calico fault south of 35°N is distributed to the Harper Lake, Blackwater, and Tin Can Alley faults. BEM model results using revised fault geometries for the Mojave ECSZ show areas of uplift consistent with contractional structures, and fault slip-rates that more closely match geologic data. Overall, revised fault connections and addition of off-fault deformation greatly reduces the discrepancy between geodetic and geologic slip rates.",

            "abstract": "Over a decade since its discovery, it is disconcerting that we know so little about the kinematics of the tremor source. One could say we are hampered by low signal-to-noise ratio, but often the LFE signal is large and the \"noise\" is just other LFEs, often nearly co-located. Here we exploit this feature to better characterize the tremor source. A quick examination of LFE catalogs shows, unsurprisingly, that detected magnitudes are large when the background tremor amplitude is large. A simple interpretation is that small LFEs are missed when tremor is loud. An unanswered question is whether, in addition, there is a paucity of small LFEs when tremor is loud. Because we have both the LFE Green's function (from stacks) and some minimum bound on the overall LFE rate (from our catalogs), tremor waveforms provide a consistency check on any assumed magnitude-frequency (M-f) distribution.\nBeneath southern Vancouver Island, the magnitudes of >10^5 LFEs range from about 1.2-2.4 (Bostock et al. 2015). Interpreted in terms of a power-law distribution, the b-value is >5. But missed small events make even this large value only a lower bound. Binning by background tremor amplitude, and assuming a time-invariant M-f distribution, the b-value increases to >7, implying (e.g.) more than 10 million M>1.2 events for every M=2.2 event. Such numbers are inconsistent with the observed modest increase in tremor amplitude with LFE magnitude, as well as with geodetically-allowable slips. Similar considerations apply to exponential and log-normal moment-frequency distributions. Our preliminary interpretation is that when LFE magnitudes are large, the same portion of the fault is producing larger LFEs, rather than a greater rate of LFEs pulled from the same distribution. If correct, this distinguishes LFEs from repeating earthquakes, where larger background fault slip rates lead not to larger earthquakes but to more frequent earthquakes of similar magnitude. One possible explanation, that LFEs represent the high-frequency end of a continuous spectrum of slip rates, and that large LFEs are just those where more of the slip occurs in the tremor frequency band, finds no support from stacked templates, in that the corner frequencies of both large- and small-magnitude LFEs are very similar (~2 Hz) and lie within our bandpass.",

Our work has two main goals: 1) To better understand the tectonics of a prominent example of continental collision, and 2) To assess the improvements in earthquake location possible as a result of joint inversion.\nThe body wave dataset is mainly derived from previous work on location calibration and includes the first-arrival P and S phases of 2500 earthquakes whose initial locations qualify as GT25 or better. The surface wave dataset consists of Rayleigh wave group velocity measurements for regional earthquakes, which are inverted for a suite of period-dependent Rayleigh wave velocity maps prior to inclusion in the joint inversion for body wave velocities. We use gravity anomalies derived from the global gravity model EGM2008. To avoid mapping broad, possibly dynamic features in the gravity field intovariations in density and body wave velocity, we apply a high-pass wavenumber filter to the gravity measurements. We use a simple, approximate relationship between density and velocity so that the three datasets may be combined in a single inversion.\nThe final optimized 3D Vp and Vs model allows us to explore how multi-parameter tomography addresses crustal heterogeneities in areas of limited coverage and improves travel time predictions. We compare earthquake locations from our models to independent locations obtained from InSAR analysis to assess the improvement in locations derived in a joint-inversion model in comparison to those derived in a more traditional body-wave-only velocity model.",

Arctic organic carbon storage has seen increased attention in recent years due to large potential for carbon releases following thaw. Our knowledge about the exact scale and sensitivity for a phase-change of these C stocks are, however, limited. Minor variations in Gross Primary Production (GPP) and Ecosystem Respiration (Reco) driven by changes in the climate can lead to either C sink or C source states, which likely will impact the overall C cycle of the ecosystem. Eddy covariance data is usually used to partition Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) into GPP and Reco achieved by flux separation algorithms. However, different partitioning approaches lead to different estimates. as well as undefined uncertainties.\nThe main objectives of this study are to use model-data fusion approaches to (1) determine the inter-annual variability in C source/sink strength for an Arctic fen, and attribute such variations to GPP vs Reco, (2) investigate the climate sensitivity of these processes and (3) explore the uncertainties in NEE partitioning. The intention is to elaborate on the information gathered in an existing catchment area under an extensive cross-disciplinary ecological monitoring program in low Arctic West Greenland, established under the auspices of the Greenland Ecosystem Monitoring (GEM) program. The use of such a thorough long-term (7 years) dataset applied to the exploration in inter-annual variability of carbon exchange, related driving factors and NEE partition uncertainties provides a novel input into our understanding about land-atmosphere CO2 exchange.",

Photogrammetry is the traditional technique for deriving terrain elevation. The elevation of the top of a tree canopy can be directly measured from stereo imagery but winter images are required to get the elevation of ground surface because stereo images are acquired by optical sensors which cannot penetrate dense forest canopies with leaf-on condition.\nSeveral spaceborne stereoscopic systems with higher spatial resolutions have been launched in the past several years. For example the Chinese satellite Zi Yuan 3 (ZY-3) specifically designed for the collection of stereo imagery with a resolution of 3.6 m for forward and backward views and 2.1 m for the nadir view was launched on January 9, 2012. Our previous studies have demonstrated that the spaceborne stereo imagery acquired in summer has good performance on the description of forest structures. The ground surface elevation could be extracted from spaceborne stereo imagery acquired in winter. This study mainly focused on assessing the mapping of forest biomass through the combination of spaceborne stereo imagery acquired in summer and those in winter.\nThe test sites of this study located at Daxing AnlingMountains areas as shown in Fig.1. The Daxing Anling site is on the south border of boreal forest belonging to frigid-temperate zone coniferous forest vegetation The dominant tree species is Dhurian larch (Larix gmelinii). 10 scenes of ZY-3 stereo images are used in this study. 5 scenes were acquired on March 14,2012 while the other 5 scenes were acquired on September 7, 2012.

            "abstract": "Many regions rely on quality groundwater to support urban growth. Groundwater quality often responds in a complex manner to stressors such as land use change, climate change, or policy decisions. Urban growth patterns in mid-sized cities, especially ones that are growing urban centers in water-limited regions in the western US, control and are controlled by water availability and its quality. We present a case study from southeastern Idaho where urban growth over the past 20 years has included significant ex-urban expansion of houses that rely on septic systems rather than city sewer lines for their wastewater treatment. Septic systems are designed to mitigate some contaminants, but not others. In particular, nitrates and emerging contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals, are not removed by most septic systems. Thus, even well-maintained septic systems at sufficiently high densities can impact down gradient water quality.\nHere we present patterns of nitrate concentrations over the period from 1985-2015 from the Lower Portneuf River Valley in southeastern Idaho. Concentrations vary from 0.03 to 27.09 nitrate-nitrogen mg/L, with average values increasing significantly over the 30 year time period from 3.15 +/- 0.065 to 3.57 +/- 0.43 mg/L. We examine temporal changes in locations of nitrate hotspots, and present pilot data on emerging contaminants of concern. Initial results suggest that high nitrate levels are generally associated with higher septic densities, but that this pattern is influenced by legacy agricultural uses and strongly controlled by underlying aquifer properties. Future work will include more detailed hydrological modeling to predict changes in hotspot locations under potential climate change scenarios.",

            "abstract": "We present a petrological and magnetic study of a suite of serpentinized peridotites from the Pindos ophiolite spanning a wide range in the degree of serpentinization (from ~10 to 100%). The Pindos ophiolite, in Northern Greece, is a portion of Late Triassic oceanic lithosphere obducted during the convergence of the Apulian and Pelagonian micro-continents. This ophiolite is interpreted mainly as the result of a supra-subduction zone spreading process but its complete history remains largely unknown. Therefore, it is not clear when the ultramafic section was exposed to fluid circulation that resulted in its serpentinization. Element partitioning during serpentinization reactions is dependent on parameters such as temperature and water-rock ratio. In particular, they affect the behavior of the iron released by olivine, which can be taken up either by magnetite, serpentine and/or brucite. Analyses of the reaction products are therefore a key to constrain the conditions during the main stage of the alteration. Our study was designed to gain insight on the conditions prevailing during hydration. Our results indicate that even fully serpentinized samples have a very low magnetization and magnetite content. Moreover, microprobe and μXanes results show that serpentine is the main host of iron in the divalent but also trivalent form. These results are compared with a set of data from serpentinized ultramafics sampled from the ocean floors, as well as from various other ophiolites. We suggest that serpentinization at Pindos occurred at relatively low-temperature (less than 200 °C), therefore not at a ridge environment. In addition, we stress that the presence of trivalent iron in serpentine indicates that serpentinization may remain a producer of hydrogen even when very little magnetite is formed.",

            "abstract": "Abundance ratios of refractory elements in bulk compositions of chondritic meteorites show limited variability relative to CI chondrites, typically < 10%. Whether or not this was also the case for the building materials of the terrestrial planets remains an important open question with implications for planetary chemistry and chronology (e.g. the Sm/Nd ratio of the terrestrial planets). The limited variation of these elements in chondrites has been explained by complete condensation of these elements from solar gas into oxides, silicates and metal. However, small systematic differences in abundances and ratios of specific refractory elements in different groups of chondrites suggest variable mixing ratios of refractory components in different compartments of the solar nebula. The systematic fractionations of Re/Os, Y/Ho (and other REE) between different classes of chondrites, the presence of strongly fractionated refractory metal nuggets in some carbonaceous chondrites and stable isotope variations of nucleosynthetic origin (Ru, Mo, Ti, Cr) in the bulk rocks and in leachates of chondrites suggest that the origin of refractory element fractionations in chondrites is more complicated than assumed in early models. Abundance ratios of refractory siderophile elements in physically separated components of unequilibrated chondrites show that components of the least equilibrated chondrites (petrologic type 2 to 3.4) display larger variations than bulk rocks (e.g., Pt/Ir, Rh/Ir, Ru/Ir, Re/Os vary by 20-30% or more). These data and the isotopic variations are difficult to ascribe to parent body processes or metal-sulfide-silicate partitioning during chondrule formation. Rather the different end members appear to preserve differences inherited from fractional condensation or evaporation of dust precursors of chondrules, matrix and Fe-Ni metal that were later efficiently mixed in nebular compartments to yield approximately CI chondrite like ratios of refractory elements. Larger fractions of dust processed at higher temperatures may have existed in the terrestrial planet zone in comparison to the early main belt. Thus, modest differences in the ratios of refractory elements of the building materials of the terrestrial planets vs. main belt objects such as chondrite parent bodies can be expected.",

This student-focused STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) program combines problem-based learning modules, Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) aligned curriculum, and live interactive webinars with mission scientists to create authentic research opportunities and career-ready experiences that prepare and inspire students to pursue STEM occupations. Primarily for high school students, the program employs distance-learning technologies to stream live presentations from mission scientists, archive those presentations to accommodate varied schedules, and collaborate with other student teams and scientists. Like its predecessor, the Mars Exploration Student Data Team (MESDT) program, the Student PI is free and open to teams across the country. To date, students have drafted research-based reports using data from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Mini-RF instrument and the MESSENGER Mercury orbiter, with plans to offer similar programs aligned with additional NASA missions in the future pending available funding. Overall, the program has reached about 600 students and their educators. Assessments based on qualitative and quantitative data gathered for each Student PI program have shown that students gain new understanding about the scientific process used by real-world scientists as well as gaining enthusiasm for STEM. Additionally, it is highly adaptable to other disciplines and fields.

            "abstract": "The Arctic and North Atlantic have experienced pronounced changes over the 20th and early 21st centuries, including a rapid loss of Arctic sea ice over the last several decades and prominent multidecadal variability in both ocean temperatures and sea ice. Here we use suites of climate model simulations to probe some of the factors responsible for the multidecadal variability in the Atlantic/Arctic system. We show that multidecadal fluctuations of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) induce multidecadal fluctuations of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). A positive phase of the NAO is associated with strengthened westerly winds over the North Atlantic. These winds extract more heat than normal from the subpolar ocean, thereby increasing upper ocean density, deepwater formation, and the strength of the AMOC and associated poleward ocean heat transport. In model simulations the observed negative phase of the NAO in the 1960s and 1970s led to a weaker than normal AMOC, reduced poleward ocean heat transport, a cold North Atlantic, and an increase in Arctic sea ice extent in both winter and summer. The NAO strengthened from the 1970s to the mid 1990s, leading to an increase of the AMOC and a warming of the North Atlantic. The increased heat transport extended throughout the North Atlantic, into the Barents Sea, and finally into the Arctic, contributing to a rapid reduction of sea ice in the 1990s through the 2000s. Feedbacks involving shortwave radiation are an important component of the overall changes. In these model simulations as much as 1/3 of the recent reduction of Arctic sea ice is associated with the NAO-induced AMOC and heat transport increase. Since the mid 1990s the NAO has changed from a strong positive phase to a more neutral phase. In our model simulations this weakens the AMOC and poleward ocean heat transport, and diminishes the contribution of ocean heat transport to the reduction of Arctic sea ice extent. Considered in isolation, the reduction in ocean heat transport implies a possible moderation in the rate of Arctic sea ice loss in the coming decade.",

An effective mix of short-term management actions can augment existing infrastructure, potentially forestalling new development. Likewise, coordinated expansion of infrastructure such as regional interconnections and shared treatment capacity can increase the effectiveness of some management actions like water transfers. Highly adaptable decision pathways that mix long-term infrastructure options and short-term management actions require decision triggers capable of incorporating the impact of these time-evolving decisions on growing water supply needs. Here, we adapt risk-based triggers to sequence a set of potential infrastructure options in combination with utility-specific conservation actions and inter-utility water transfers. Individual infrastructure pathways can be augmented with conservation or water transfers to reduce the cost of meeting utility objectives, but they can also include cooperatively developed, shared infrastructure that expands regional capacity to transfer water. This analysis explores the role of cooperation among four water utilities in the ‘Research Triangle’ region of North Carolina by formulating three distinct categories of adaptive policy pathways: independent action (utility-specific conservation and supply infrastructure only), weak cooperation (utility-specific conservation and infrastructure development with regional transfers), and strong cooperation (utility specific conservation and jointly developed of regional infrastructure that supports transfers). Results suggest that strong cooperation aids the utilities in meeting their individual objections at substantially lower costs and with fewer irreversible infrastructure options.",

Implementation evaluation examines how and the extent to which program activities are delivered as intended, including the extent to which activities reached the targeted participants. Outcome evaluation is comprised of a systematic examination of the effects that a program has on program participants, such as changes in knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, values, and behaviors.\nIn this presentation, presenters will share insights on evaluating the implementation, outcomes, and impacts associated with an online science curriculum for K-2 students. The science curriculum was designed to provide students with access to science concepts and skills in an interactive and innovative environment, and teachers with embedded, aligned, and on-demand professional development. One of the most important—and challenging—steps in this evaluation was to select outcomes that were well-defined, measurable, and aligned to program activities, as well as relevant to program stakeholders. An additional challenge was to measure implementation given limited access to the classroom environment. This presentation will include a discussion of the process evaluators used to select appropriate implementation indicators and outcomes (teacher and student), design an evaluation approach, and craft data collection instruments. Although examples provided are specific to the K-2 science intervention, the best practices discussed are pertinent to all program and event evaluations.\nImpact evaluation goes beyond implementation and outcome evaluation to inform whether a program is working or not. It requires a comparison group to inform what outcomes would have been in the absence of the intervention. As such, this presentation will also include a discussion of impacts, including how impacts are defined and measured, and some common challenges in evaluating program impact.",

Volcanic tremor amplitude (RSAM) above the background noise was first detected at seismic stations located at the foot of the Pico cone, about 08 UTC on November 23, 2014. A short-lasting, pre-eruptive tremor burst ca. 09:45 UTC forerun by about 1.5 hours the syn-eruptive tremor, which started between 11:12-11:15 UTC and was taken as the most reliable marker of the eruption onset. Spaceborne observation of MIR-TIR radiances with 15-minute refresh by payload SEVIRI onboard geostationary Meteosat-10, orbiting at 0°N-0°E over the Gulf of Guinea, pointed to a slightly later onset (11:15-11:30). Initial, radiant flux derived effusion rates were in the order of 16± 4 m3/s, with an isolated peak of 27 ± 8 m3/s reached on November 27, then slowly declined. RSAM and effusion rate series kept fairly well correlated in time, with tremor amplitude variations slightly ahead of radiance changes all the time. While villages located 1700m a.s.l. at the foot of Pico were largely destroyed by the early December, continued advance of lavas led to concern that the main flow could escape the summit caldera and propagate downslope to the northeast, threatening urban areas. Near-realtime monitoring of effusion rates became crucial to compute limiting flow lengths, and to assess that rates and volumes were not sufficient to sustain lava flow escapes. The 20 m3/s alert threshold was not approached anymore after December 9.

            "abstract": "Fallout tephra in marine sediment provide an excellent archive of explosive arc volcanism that can be directly related to the other parameters of climate change, such as ice volume data, IRD (ice-rafted debris) input, etc. Current studies are based on 'discrete' tephra beds, which are produced by major eruptions and visible with the naked eye. Yet the more common, but less explosive arc eruptions that are more continuous through time produce 'disperse' tephra, which is concealed by the non-volcanic host sediment and invisible to the eye. The proportion of disperse tephra in marine sediments is known to be significant and may be critical in elucidating potential synchronicity between arc volcanism and glacial cycles.\nWe conducted a pilot study in young sediments of IODP Hole 1437B drilled at 31°47.3911′N and 139°01.5788′E at the rear-arc of the Izu Bonin volcanic arc. By means of δ18O (Vautravers, in revision), eleven climatic cycles are recorded in uppermost 120 meter of carbonate mud that is interspersed by cm-thick tephra fallout layers. We selected six tephra layers, ranging from 0.2 to 1.16 million years in age, and sampled those vertically, starting from carbonate mud below the basal contact throughout the typical gradational top into the carbonate mud above. From each tephra bed, volcanic particles (>125 micrometer) were handpicked. All other samples were powdered and leached in buffered acetic acid and hydroxylamine hydrochloride to remove the carbonate and authigenous fraction, respectively. Major and trace element abundances (except for SiO2) from all samples were determined by ICP-MS and ICP-OES methods.\nStrong binary mixing trends are revealed between the pure tephra end member, and detrital sediment component. The tephra is derived from the Izu Bonin volcanic front and rear-arc, while the sediment component is presumably transported by ocean surface currents from the East China Sea. Our data show that mixing proportions change systematically with sample percentage left after leaching and the stratigraphic position of sample, implying that the composition of the aluminosilicate fraction is an indicator of the percentage of disperse ash present in the carbonate mud. This data leave potential to investigate temporal trends. Our results are currently being refined with radiogenic isotope data.",

The main goal is the generation of satellite-based climate data records that meet the challenging requirements of the Global Climate Observing System. The objective target within the ESA Cloud_cci project is the generation of long-term coherent cloud property datasets covering 33 years that also provide mathematically consistent uncertainty information following the optimal estimation (OE) retrieval theory. The cloud properties considered are cloud mask, cloud top level estimates, cloud thermodynamic phase, cloud optical thickness, cloud effective radius and post processed parameters such as cloud liquid and ice water path.\nIn this presentation we will discuss the benefit of using an optimal estimation retrieval framework, which provides consistence among the retrieved cloud variables and pixel-based uncertainty estimates based on different passive instruments such as AVHRR, MODIS and AATSR. We will summarize the results of the project so far along with ongoing further developments that currently take place. Our results will be compared with other well-established satellite data records, surface observations and cloud climatologies (e.g., PATMOS-X, ISCCP, CLARA-A2, MODIS collection 6, SYNOP). These inter-comparison results will indicate the strengths and weaknesses of the Cloud_cci datasets. Finally, we will present long-term time series of the retrieved cloud variables for AVHRR (1982-2014) that enable global, multi-decadal analyses of clouds.",

To address this issue, we develop two methods, Surrogate/Model Mixed Ensemble (SMME) and Monte Carlo Pattern/Residual (MCPR), and apply them to construct joint probability density functions (PDFs) of temperature and precipitation change over the 21st century for every county in the United States. Both methods produce likely (67% probability) temperature and precipitation projections consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's interpretation of an equal-weighted Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) ensemble and also include extreme temperature pathways that, while not present in general circulation model (GCM) ensembles, cannot be ruled out according to climate sensitivity uncertainty estimates. For example, both probabilistic methods indicate that, under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5, there is a 5% chance that Washington, D.C. could warm by at least 7 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, roughly 1 degree warmer that the hottest CMIP5 model projection. Joint PDFs of temperature and precipitation change that attempt to represent uncertainties embedded in modeling future climate at local scales, such as these, are ripe for input into impacts models (e.g. crop, energy, human health) that are used for studying strategies for adaptation and decision making under uncertainty.",

Here we investigate the plumbing systems, dynamics, and processes that drive eruptions at these systems. These are key questions for improving hazard evaluation, and better understanding the unrest associated with these types of volcanoes. The petrology and geochemistry from six historical eruptions (1947-2006) of Mayon volcano (Philippines) shows that all lavas are basaltic andesite with phenocrysts of plagioclase + orthopyroxene (Opx) + clinopyroxene. Opx crystals show a variety of compositions and zoning patterns (reverse, normal or complex) with Mg# (= 100 *Mg/[Mg+Fe]) varying from 67 to 81. The simplest interpretation is that the low Mg# parts of the crystals resided on an upper crustal and crystal rich reservoir that was intruded by more primitive magmas from which the high Mg# parts of the crystals grew. Modelling Mg-Fe diffusion in Opx shows that times since magma injection and eruption range from a few days up to 3.5 years in all of the investigated eruptions. The longest diffusion times are shorter than the repose times between the eruptions, which implies that crystal recycling between eruptive events is negligible. This is a surprising result that shows that for each eruption a different part of the evolved crystal-rich plumbing system is activated. This can be due to random intrusion location or an irreversibility of the plumbing system that prevents multiple eruptions from the same crystal-rich part. Moreover, we find that the number of intrusions markedly increases before each eruption in a non-linear manner. Such an increased rate of intrusions with time might reflect non-linear rheological properties of the crystal-rich system, of the enclosing rocks, or the non-linear evolution of crystal-melt reaction-dissolution fronts during magma intrusions.",

In addition, rapid delivery of terrestrial material to the deep-sea environment allows the correlation of these marine records to European terrestrial climate records. This unique marine-ice-terrestrial linkage makes the Shackleton Site the ideal reference section for studying Quaternary abrupt climate change. The main objective of studying Site U1385 is to establish a marine reference section of Pleistocene climate change. We generated (sub)millennial-scale (~600 year interval) dinoflagellate cyst (dinocyst) assemblage records from Shackleton Site U1385 (IODP Expedition 339) to reconstruct sea surface temperature (SST) and productivity/upwelling over the last 152 kyrs. In addition, our approach allows for detailed land-sea correlations, because we also counted assemblages of pollen and spores from higher plants. Dinocyst SST and upwelling proxies, as well as warm/cold pollen proxies from Site U1385 show glacial-interglacial, orbital and stadial-interstadial climate variability and correlate very well to Uk’37, planktic foraminifer δ18O and Ca/Ti proxies of previously drilled Shackleton Sites and Greenland Ice Core δ18O. The palynological proxies capture (almost) all Dansgaard-Oeschger events of the last glacial cycle, also before ~70 ka, where millennial-scale variability is overprinted by precession. We compare the performance and results of the palynology of Site U1385 to proxies of previously drilled Shackleton Sites and conclude that palynology strengthens the potential of this site to form a multi-proxy reference section for millennial scale climate variability across the Pleistocene-Holocene. Finally, we will present a long-term paleoceanographic perspective down to ~150 ka.",

However, only LFEs or tremor have been identified and studied in detail along strike-slip faults, like the San Andreas Fault (SAF). Here, we present evidence for VLFEs on the SAF near Parkfield, California. Using data from permanent broadband stations and a temporary deployment of 13 broadband stations installed in 2010-2011 near Cholame, California, we detect 5 VLFEs, with 1 VLFE occurring unambiguosly when there is visible tremor activity. We check that the signals we detect are local by confirming that they appear only on stations within a 70 km radius, and removing time periods when teleseismic events occur, as identified in the global Centroid Moment Tensor (CMT) and the Northern California Seismic Network (NCSN) catalogs. VLFEs have to-date been observed to only occur simultaneously in time and space with tremor activity, but our detections suggests that VLFEs can occur independent of tremor along strike-slip faults. This may indicate that the slipping patches that produce slow earthquakes in transform faults have different mechanical properties than the patches in subducting plates, althought it does not rule out that VLFEs are only observed with tremor in subduction zones simply due to detection methods. An approximate estimation of the apparent velocity, based on a grid-search location using variance reduction, suggests that the observed phase velocity of the VLFEs is ~ 3km/s, corresponding to surface waves. We perform a focal mechanism inversion with a grid search to find a more precise location, depth and orientation of the VLFEs. These results provide new insight into the behavior of the SAF and more generally contribute to an improved understanding of transform fault systems.",

Here, we develop a Bayesian approach that fuses different data-streams to optimize fossil fuel emission (F), land use change emission (L), land sink (B) and ocean sink (O) at a 5-year time step from 1980 to 2014. Here we show that the optimization decreases uncertainties compared with those of the carbon budget established by Global Carbon Project (GCP) and the IPCC where single datasets are used and the land sink deduced as a residual from other terms. Uncertainties of F, L, B and O are reduced by 11%, 26, 36% and 40% compared to those of the GCP budget. Fossil fuel and land use change emissions show a significantly increasing and decreasing trend, respectively, while no significant trend is detected for land and ocean uptakes. We infer with a 93% confidence that the net biosphere uptake with land use change (BL) has increased since 1980. After a further decomposition of the net land flux, sum of L and B, into gross terrestrial fluxes of primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (TER), we attribute the increase of B+L to a faster growth of GPP than TER from 1980~1984 to 1990~1994 and a lower decreasing rate of GPP than TER in the 2000s. This approach can be potentially implemented on a yearly basis in future with growing observation-based datasets.",

            "abstract": "The contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) to future sea-level rise is uncertain. Observations reveal the important role of basal water in controlling ice-flow to the ice sheet margin. In Greenland, drainage of large volumes of surface meltwater to the ice sheet bed through moulins and hydrofracture beneath surface lakes dominates the subglacial hydrological system and provides an efficient means of moving mass and heat through the ice sheet. Ice surface and bed topography influence where meltwater can access the bed, and the nature of its subsequent flow beneath the ice. However, no systematic investigation into the influence of topographic variability on Greenland hydrology and dynamics exists. Thus, physical processes controlling storage and drainage of surface and basal meltwater, and the way these affect ice flow are not comprehensively understood. This presents a critical obstacle in efforts to predict the future evolution of the GrIS.\nHere we present high-resolution satellite mapping of the ice-surface drainage network (e.g. lakes, channels and moulins) and measurements of seasonal variations in ice flow in south west Greenland. The region is comprised of three distinct subglacial terrains which vary in terms of the amplitude and wavelength and thus the degree to which basal topography is reflected in the ice sheet surface. We find that the distribution of surface hydrological features is related to the transfer of bed topography to the ice sheet surface. For example, in areas of thinner ice and high bed relief, moulins occur more frequently and are more uniformly dispersed, indicating a more distributed influx of surface-derived meltwater to the ice sheet bed. We investigate the implications of such spatial variations in surface hydrology on seasonal ice flow rates.",

The mission of this Sustainability Research Network is to provide a logical, science-based framework for evaluating the environmental, economic, and social trade-offs between development of natural gas resources and protection of water and air resources and to convey the results of these evaluations to the public in a way that improves the development of policies and regulations governing natural gas and oil development.\nCurrently, there are a wide range of estimates of the probability of shallow aquifer contamination. There are a series of independent events that must occur to allow hydrocarbon migration and estimates were made of these probabilities. An analysis of data from drilling in the Wattenberg field, CO was made to quantify the probability of contamination.\nIt has been determined that there are five events that must each independently happen to allow the migration of fracturing fluids, and there are three events that must occur independently for the migration of hydrocarbons. The lower number of independent events, which must arise for hydrocarbon migration to occur, explains the infrequent, but well publicized natural gas migrations in poorly constructed wellbores, and the lack of such publicized events of hydraulic fracturing fluid contamination, which was confirmed by our analysis.\nThe significance of these results is to help quantify the risks associated with natural gas development, as related to the contamination of surface aquifers. These results will help shape the discussion of the risks of natural gas development and will assist in identifying areas of improved well construction and hydraulic fracturing practices to minimize risk.",

            "abstract": "A 1200 km long array of seismic observatories from James Bay to the Atlantic coast covers nearly 2 Ga in time, from the Archean Superior Province to the Paleozoic Appalachian Orogen.\nWe use traditional (P-to-SV) receiver function analysis for detailed characterization of the lithospheric mantle along the array, focusing on the 5–15 s delay range where direct conversions from within the lithosphere and crustal multiples are expected.\nSuperior craton sites show exceptionaly clear receiver functions dominated by the first crustal multiple. Also, a negative phase consistent with impedance decrease at the Mid-Lithospheric Discontinuity (~8 s delay) is observed north of 51°N, within the La Grande and Opinaca terranes of the Superior province. In the Opatica terrane further south we see a positive phase at similar delays instead. This implies a downward impedance increase 70-80 km deep within the lithosphere, consistent with the Hales discontinuity. In the Abitibi terrane just north of the Grenville Front we see evidence for two impedance drops in the 60-130 km depth range. Within the Proterozoic Grenvile province receiver functions vary with direction at individual sites, and lack regional consistency. Crustal multiples are noticeably weaker. South of 49°N we once again find negative phases in the 8-10 s delay range. While weak and directionally-dependent in the central Grenville province, these phases are clear near the Appalachian Front (AF), and are followed by positive phases, suggesting thin low-velocity layers in the lower part of the lithosphere. Similarity of receiver function signatures on opposite sides of the AF suggests continuity of the lithosphere beneath it.\nSouth of the AF and north of the Norumbega Fault Zone (NFZ) in Maine we find positive phases at ~10 s delays. The implied increase in impedance at ~75 km depth is puzzling. We also find previously-reported weak negative phases in the 6-8 s delay range. South of the NFZ a strong negative phase at ~9 s delay likely marks the bottom of the lithosphere. ",

            "abstract": "The Paranaguá terrane is mainly constituted by an arc-related granitic complex, spread in a large NE-SW elongated stripe, located in Southern Ribeira Belt, Southeastern Brazil. The country rocks of these granites occur as a disrupted folded belt composed of metassedimentary rocks and gneissic-migmatitic rocks in split basement nuclei. The southern part of the Paranaguá Terrane is characterized by high angle tectonics; on the other hand, the northern portion by low angle tectonics. The transcurrent shear zones of Southern Paranaguá Terrane, comprising a sinistral kinematic with oblique component, are marked by the coexistence of strike-slip and down-dip lineations. The thrust shear zones represent a large front collision, located in the Northern Paranaguá Terrane, with north-northwest convergence and oblique components. The transition between these two distinct tectonic styles is given by N-S faults associated with a transpressive regime, with lateral ramp characteristics. Different generations of granite intrusions took place during the magmatic arc development, with petrographic, lithogeochemical and isotopic similarities suggesting emplacement stages during a late collisional event. Older U-Pb zircon ages between 620-610 Ma indicate the presence of a relatively early magmatism associated to the first stages of subduction in southern Paranaguá Terrane. The main magmatic period is characterized by Neoproterozoic records obtained by U-Pb zircon, which give ages between 600-580 Ma. Furthermore, the metamorphic peak of the metassedimentary sequence, with U-Pb monazite age of 599 ± 5 Ma, is quite close to the main magmatic events. In addition, the U-Pb zircon records obtained in crystals rims of deformed granitoids and late leucogranitic veins show ages between 530-480 Ma. This geological context suggests a complex history for Gondwana agglutination, with late stages at Cambro-Ordovician’s Buzios Orogeny.",

            "abstract": "To fully utilize the excellent spatial coverage and temporal resolution offered by satellite resources for estimating ecological variables, fine-scale observations are required for comparison, calibration and validation. Lidar instruments have proved effective in estimating the properties of vegetation components of ecosystems, but they are often challenged by occlusion, especially in structurally complex and spatially fragmented ecosystems such as tropical forests. Increasing the range of view angles, both horizontally and vertically, by increasing the number of scans, can mitigate occlusion. However these scans must occur within the window of temporal stability for the ecosystem and vegetation property being measured.\nThe Compact Biomass Lidar (CBL) is a TLS optimized for portability and scanning speed, developed and operated by University of Massachusetts Boston. This 905nm wavelength scanner achieves an angular resolution of 0.25 degrees at a rate of 33 seconds per scan. The ability to acquire many scans within narrow windows of temporal stability for ecological variables has facilitated the more complete investigation of ecosystem structural characteristics, and their expression as a function of view angle. The lightweight CBL has facilitated the use of alternative deployment platforms including towers, trams and masts, allowing analysis of the vertical structure of ecosystems, even in highly enclosed environments such as the sub-canopy of tropical forests where aerial vehicles cannot currently operate.\nWe will present results from view angle analyses of lidar surveys of tropical rainforest in La Selva, Costa Rica where the CBL was deployed at heights up to 10m in Carbono long-term research plots utilizing a portable mast, and on a 25m stationary tower; and temperate forest at Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, USA, where the CBL has been deployed biannually at long-term research plots of hardwood and hemlock, as well as at heights of up to 25m utilizing a stationary tower.",

            "abstract": "Fast and accurate radiative transfer model is the key for satellite data assimilation for remote sensing application. The simulation of the satellite remote sensing radiances is very complicated since many physical processes, such as absorption, emission, and scattering, are involved due to the interactions between electromagnetic radiation and earth surface, water vapor, clouds, aerosols, and gas molecules in the sky. The principal component-based radiative transfer model (PCRTM) has been developed for various passive IR and MW instruments.\nIn this work, we extended PCRTM to including the contribution from solar radiation. The cloud/aerosol bidirectional reflectances have been carefully calculated using the well-known Discrete-Ordinate-Method Radiative Transfer (DISORT) model under over 10 millions of diverse conditions with varying cloud particle size, wavelength, satellite viewing direction, and solar angles. The obtained results were compressed significantly using principal component analysis and used in the mono domain radiance calculation.\nWe used 1352 different atmosphere profiles, each of them has different surface skin temperatures and surface pressures in our training. Different surface emissivity spectra were derived from ASTER database and emissivity models. Some artificially generated emissivity spectra were also used to account for diverse surface types of the earth. Concentrations of sixteen trace gases were varied systematically in the training and the remaining trace gas contributions were accounted for as a fixed gas. Training was done in both clear and cloudy skies conditions. Finally the nonlocal thermal equilibrium (NLTE) induced radiance change was included for daytime conditions.\nWe have updated the PCRTM model for instruments such as IASI, NASTI, CrIS, AIRS, and SHIS. The training results show that the PCRTM model can calculate thousands of channel radiances by computing only a few hundreds of mono radiances. This greatly increased the computation efficiency since we do not need to calculate the millions of mono radiances and do the convolution process.\nThe results from fast PCRTM_Solar simulation were compared to the instrument observed data. The simulated results were excellently agreed with the observations.",

However, over the last 5 years, Sao Paulo has experienced multiple years of below average rainfall.\nIn this study, we try to explain the climatic drivers and mechanisms behind the observed drought over Sao Paulo using a combination of observations and model simulations. We analyse observed precipitation, air temperature and sea surface temperature (SST) datasets over the recent past to characterise the climate anomalies and visualize the extent of the drought. We then use the Hadley Centre Climate model (HadCM3) with prescribed observed SST anomalies to probe the possible causes behind the drought.

            "abstract": "There is a region of 20-24 M.y. old seafloor on the eastern flank of the East Pacific Rise, offshore of Costa Rica, where the advective heat loss from the crust is 60-85% of lithospheric. Much of this advective flux occurs through basement outcrops that penetrate regionally thick sediments, but rates and patterns of hydrothermal circulation in this area are poorly understood. We have run a series of numerical simulations of coupled fluid-heat transport to assess how crustal aquifer and outcrop properties and the distance(s) between outcrops control ridge-flank hydrothermal flows in this setting. Extracting a large fraction of lithospheric heat through this process requires crustal aquifer permeability on the order of 10-10 to 10-9 m2, values considerably higher than seen on other ridge flanks (where advective heat extraction is less efficient). In simulations using two crustal outcrops having a different size, vigorous discharge of outcrop-to-outcrop flow is favored through the smaller and/or less permeable outcrop. In addition, simulations with a larger grid (40 km square versus 20 km square) result in higher fluid flow rates, apparently because there is more heat to be mined by flow between the outcrops. For simulations matching regional heat extraction observations, the outcrop-to-outcrop flow rates from the smaller outcrops are 1,000-3,000 kg/s (for the smaller grids) and 2,000-10,000 kg/s (for larger grids), values consistent with predictions made on the basis of a regional heat flux budget. In many simulations, local convection in and out of individual, large outcrops also removes a significant fraction of lithospheric heat. Additional simulations were conducted with three or four outcrops per simulation grid, to further explore relationships between the geometry, properties, and advective heat extraction.",

To identify patterns that favor enhanced GrIS surface melt and their decadal changes, we first develop a summer Arctic synoptic climatology by employing a nonlinear classification technique known as the self organizing map (SOM). This is applied to daily JJA sea level pressure (SLP) and 500 hPa geopotential height fields obtained from the Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) reanalysis product from 1979 to 2014. Model output from Modèle Atmosphérique Régional (MAR) is used to relate meteorological conditions and subsequent Greenland surface melt anomalies to particular circulation regimes. \nResults demonstrate that circulation patterns featuring positive SLP anomalies from Greenland to the Beaufort Sea support the largest positive surface melt anomalies, particularly over western Greenland. These patterns facilitate strong meridional transport of heat and moisture, contrasted by a dominant zonal flow across the North Atlantic during periods of low surface melt. Additionally, composites of energy balance components reveal that melt events are favored under clear conditions generating positive shortwave radiation anomalies rather than increased downwelling longwave radiation occurring with increased cloud cover. Sea surface temperature anomalies suggest that there may be a linkage between surface melt and recent sea ice loss around Greenland, though a causal relationship is not established. We assess decadal shifts in the SOM nodes, finding an increased frequency of upper level patterns favoring higher 500 hPa geopotential heights primarily over Greenland. The observed increases in GrIS melt through the time period coincides with this shift in SOM node frequency.",

In recent years, satellite instruments have been effectively enhanced with their spatiotemporal sampling and precision strategies, with a focus on improving the confidence levels in the source-sink estimations at spatial scales relevant for policy-makers. However, accurately identifying the regional sources and sinks of CO2 using the available observations and techniques is highly complicated due to their insufficient spatial and temporal representativeness that misses the detailed information about the processes and the transport. Here, we will demonstrate the potential of space-borne monitoring of the CO2 column on inferring sources and sinks of CO2 at the regional scale. One of the main goals of this study is to assess the capability of a proposed satellite mission, Carbon Monitoring Satellite (CarbonSat), to quantify emission patterns of moderate to strong localized sources, taking into account a realistic description of the retrieval errors, the spatiotemporal distributions of CO2 and atmospheric transport. CarbonSat will provide measurements of the column averaged mixing ratios of CO2 and CH4 at a high spatial resolution (2km x 3km) over the entire globe with contiguous sampling over a 200 km wide swath. In this study, we use a high-resolution modeling framework consisting of the Weather Research Forecasting model with greenhouse gas module (WRF-GHG) and the Vegetation Photosynthesis Respiration Model (VPRM), to simulate CO2 concentrations for a domain centered on Berlin in Germany (a typical mid-scale city). An analysis is carried out for CarbonSat’s overpasses (using pseudo observations) for one reference year. A simple Bayesian inversion is performed to estimate the emission budget with associated uncertainty. Additionally, results from our preliminary analysis using observations from Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) to assess the usefulness of these column measurements to estimate the regional distribution of CO2 surface fluxes will be presented.",

            "abstract": "We used active source wide-angle seismic data to determine a crustal structure beneath the onshore-offshore area of Hong Kong at the southern end of a broad belt dominated by Late Mesozoic intrusive and extrusive rocks in the coastal region of Southeast China. High-resolution tomographic images provide direct seismic evidence for the magmatic plumbing system of Late Mesozoic calderas. A localized high-velocity anomaly is revealed in the lower crust offshore between Hong Kong and Dangan Island, which may reflect basaltic underplating that induced voluminous silicic eruptions and granitoid plutons in the onshore-offshore area of Hong Kong. Tilted high-velocity zones are revealed in the entire crust beneath Dangan Island and the Late Mesozoic calderas of Hong Kong, which may reflect ascending magma chambers. We propose a paleo-Pacific plate subduction model to interpret our tomographic results and the generation of strong granitic magmatism in the Hong Kong area. Combining the tomographic image beneath the Lianhuashan Fault Zone with the distribution of Late Mesozoic calderas, we infer that the Lianhuashan Fault Zone might be the dominant magmatic conduit for mantle-derived magmas ascending to the upper crust. In addition, intersecting faults with different orientations could control the distribution and geometry of the vents, calderas, dykes and plutons and play an important role in forming magma conduits for individual volcanoes.\nKeywords: Basaltic underplating; Magmatic plumbing; Southeast China; Calderas; Active-source seismic tomography",

            "abstract": "Throughout the Midwestern US and other poorly drained agricultural regions, phosphorus (P) transport in tile drainage is of increasing environmental concern. Significant P loads are often measured in subsurface drainage water despite the normally high P adsorption capacity of subsoils, which suggest that the high P loadings observed in tile drainage water during storm events are the result of P bypassing the soil matrix via macropore flow. The objectives of this study were to quantify event water delivery to tile drains via macropore flow paths during storm events and to determine the effect of tillage practices on event water and P delivery to tiles. Tile discharge, total dissolved P (DP) and total P (TP) concentrations, and stable oxygen and deuterium isotopic signatures were measured from two adjacent tile-drained fields in Ohio, USA during seven spring storms. Fertilizer was surface-applied to both fields and disk tillage was used to incorporate the fertilizer on one field while the other remained in no-till. Results showed that event water accounted for between 26 and 69% of total tile discharge from both fields, with tillage substantially reducing the maximum contributions of event water. Following fertilizer application, median DP concentration was significantly greater in the no-tilled fields (1.19 mg/L) compared to the tilled field (0.66 mg/L). Concentrations remained significantly greater in the no-tilled field compared to the tilled field for the five monitored storms (>1 month) after fertilizer application. Both DP and TP concentrations in the no-tilled fields were significantly related to event water contributions to tile discharge, while only TP concentration was significantly related to event water in the tilled field. Collectively, results suggest that macropore flow is an important flow pathway in tile-drained landscapes and that incorporating surface-applied fertilizers has the potential to substantially reduce the risk of P loss from tile-drained fields.",

The following study presents global fire datasets and environmental variables used to build spatial statistical baseline models of fire probability and examine the environmental controls on fire activity. As the UN Sendai Framework requires an update of hazard databases and an integration additional manmade hazards in the calculation of risks, this global fire study examines the magnitude and direction of change over two projection periods, 2010–2039 and 2070–2099. From the GCM ensemble results, the study identified areas of consensus for increases or decreases in fires. This type of information may inform policies and strategies of fire-prone nations to better utilize baseline and projection geo-information for enhancing disaster preparedness for what the Sendai Framework is calling an effective response, and to “Build Back Better” in recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction. Certain biomes are sensitive to constraints on biomass productivity while others to atmospheric conditions promoting combustion. Substantial and rapid shifts are projected for future fire activity across vast portions of the globe. In the near term, the most consistent increases in fire activity occur in biomes with already somewhat warm climates; decreases are less pronounced and concentrated primarily in a few tropical and subtropical biomes. However, models do not agree on the direction of near-term changes across more than 50% of terrestrial lands. Although these models demonstrated that long-term environmental norms captured chronic fire probability patterns, future work is needed to assess how annual variation in climate variables could add more explanatory power. This study provides an examination of global disruptions to fire activity using a multi-model ensemble of GCM projections, an important step toward assessing fire-related vulnerabilities to humans and the ecosystems upon which they depend. This kind of global research follows the Sendai Framework’s people centered approach and applies to multiple levels of DRR work, from local to international.",

            "abstract": "Period dependent shortwave and longwave feedback parameters are derived from the CERES EBAF-TOA data from March 2000 through May 2014. The algorithm uses time series of top-of-atmosphere reflected shortwave and emitted longwave irradiances, as well as surface skin temperature monthly deseasonalized anomalies. The time series is converted to the period domain by Fourier transfer and feedback parameters are derived from the amplitude ratio of the reflected shortwave or emitted longwave anomalies to the surface skin temperature anomalies multiplied by the cosine of the phase shift (FFT approach). While feedback parameters vary significantly depending on the period, they appear to converge as the period increases. Once they are sorted into period bins with the width of 1 year and mean values from all bins are averaged, the global mean value agrees with that derived from a simple linear regression to their uncertainty. The FFT approach provides a method to screen feedback parameters with shorter periods (less than a year) that contribute to the variability significantly. While feedback parameters derived from current CERES observation of 15 years differ from climate feedback parameters, their relationship to climate feedback parameters can be tested with climate models. The advantage of the FFT approach as opposed to a linear regression is that it can derive time-scale dependent feedback parameters. In addition, period dependent feedback parameters can be used to assess a linear system assumption for shorter periods (less than 10 years) and provide a guide on the length of the data record needed to accurately infer climate feedback parameters.",

            "abstract": "The acidification and deoxygention of modern oceans are major environmental concerns to the international community. The effects of ocean acidification and deoxigention in the biogeochemical cycles of modern tropical oceans are poorly constrained mainly due to the lack of empirical and quantitative data. The Cretaceous World witnessed several period of potential ocean acidification and deoxygenation, which resulted from the rapid additions of volcanic derived CO2 to the atmosphere. The effects of ocean acidification and deoxygenation on the Cretaceous biogeochemical cycles are evidenced mainly by major global C-isotope anomalies. These anomalies parallel the occurrence of organic rich black shales as well as major decreases in the deposition of shallow marine carbonates worldwide. Here we use detailed C- and Sr- chemostratigraphy as well as published bioestratigraphic information and volcanic zircon U-Pb ages to precisely constrain the geochemical and sedimentologic expression of the Cretaceous OAES along a tropical epicontinental sea, the La Luna Sea. Our multi-pronged approach allows identifying the occurrence of several of the Cretaceous Oceanic Anoxic Events (OAEs) in carbonate units paleogeographically located along the northern most part of the La Luna Sea, i.e. Weissert-OAE-(Palanz and Rosablanca Formations), Faraoni-(Rosablanca Formation), AOE1a-(Paja and Fomeque Formations, Cogollo Group), OAE1c-(Cogollo Group), OAE2-(Cogollo Group), OAE3-(La Luna Formation). These events are preserved in highly euxinic - organic rich “black shales” successions deposited along the deepest part of the seaway at the Middle Magdalena Valley and Cundinamarca Basin; Weiser-OAE-(Lutitas de Macanal Formation), OAE1a-(Paja Formation, Fomeque Formation), OAE1C-(San Gil Formation). Regional changes in depositional settings and sedimentary facies preserving the different Cretaceous OAEs were likely the result of the combined action of regional changes in paleogeography and tectonic regimes and changes in the physicochemical conditions of the Cretaceous seawater along the tropical La Luna epicontinental seaway.",

            "abstract": "Although shale oil/gas production in the US has increased exponentially, the low energy recovery is a daunting problem needed to be solved for its sustainability and continued growth, especially in light of the recent oil/gas price decline. This is apparently related to the small porosity (a few to a few hundred nm) and low permeability (10-16-10-20 m2) of tight shale formations. The fundamental question lies in the anomalous behavior of fluids in nanopores due to confinement effects, which, however, remains poorly understood.\nIn this study, we combined experimental characterization and observations, particularly using small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), with pore-scale modeling using lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), to examine the fluid behavior and fluid-solid interactions in nanopores at reservoir conditions. Experimentally, we characterized the compositions and microstructures of a shale sample from Wolfcamp, Texas, using a variety of analytical techniques. Our analyses reveal that the shale sample is made of organic-matter (OM)-lean and OM-rich layers that exhibit different chemical and mineral compositions, and microstructural characteristics. Using the hydrostatic pressure system and gas-mixing setup we developed, in-situ SANS measurements were conducted at pressures up to 20 kpsi on shale samples imbibed with water or water-methane solutions. The obtained results indicate that capillary effect plays a significant role in fluid-nanopore interactions and the associated changes in nanopore structures vary with pore size and pressure. Computationally, we performed LBM modeling to simulate the flow behavior of methane in kerogen nanoporous structure. The correction factor, which is the ratio of apparent permeability to intrinsic permeability, was calculated. Our results show that the correction factor is always greater than one (non-continuum/non-Darcy effects) and increases with decreasing nanopore size, intrinsic permeability and pressure. Hence, the confined fluids in nanoporous media exhibit significantly different behavior from bulk fluids, which has important implications for developing better production strategies for unconventional reservoirs.",

Specifically models tend to exhibit a North Atlantic jet (and associated storm track) that is too zonal, extending across central Europe, when it should tilt northward toward Scandinavia. GCM's consistently predict substantial changes in the large scale circulation in this region, consisting of a localized anti-cyclonic circulation, centered over the Mediterranean and accompanied by increased aridity there and increased storminess over Northern Europe.\nHere, we present preliminary results from experiments that are designed to address the question of what the impact of the climatological circulation biases might be on this predicted future response. Climate change experiments will be compared in two versions of the Community Earth System Model: the first is a free running version of the model, as typically used in climate prediction; the second is a bias corrected version of the model in which a seasonally varying cycle of bias correction tendencies are applied to the wind and temperature fields. These bias correction tendencies are designed to account for deficiencies in the fast parameterized processes, with an aim to push the model toward a more realistic climatology.\nWhile these experiments come with the caveat that they assume the bias correction tendencies will remain constant with time, they allow for an initial assessment, through controlled experiments, of the impact that biases in the climatological circulation can have on future predictions in this region. They will also motivate future work that can make use of the bias correction tendencies to understand the underlying physical processes responsible for the incorrect tilt of the jet.",

As a result of improved recording technology, continuous waveform data archives are available starting in 1998. This continuous dataset, from 1998-present, represents a wealth of potential insight into spatio-temporal seismicity patterns, earthquake physics and mechanics of the San Jacinto Fault Zone. However, the volume of data renders manual analysis costly. In order to investigate the characteristics of the data in space and time, an automatic earthquake location catalog is needed. To this end, we apply standard earthquake signal processing techniques to the continuous data to detect first-arriving P-waves in combination with a recently developed S-wave detection algorithm. The resulting dataset of arrival time observations are processed using a grid association algorithm to produce initial absolute locations which are refined using a location inversion method that accounts for 3-D velocity heterogeneities. Precise relative locations are then derived from the refined absolute locations using the HypoDD double-difference algorithm. Moment magnitudes for the events are estimated from multi-taper spectral analysis. A >650% increase in the S:P pick ratio is achieved using the updated S-wave detection algorithm, when compared to the currently available catalog for the ANZA network. The increased number of S-wave observations leads to improved earthquake location accuracy and reliability (ie. less false event detections). Various aspects of spatio-temporal seismicity patterns and size distributions are investigated. Updated results will be presented at the meeting.",

            "abstract": "Suprathermal electrons (E ~70eV-2keV) in the pristine solar wind are comprised of two populations: a halo and a field aligned, antisunward propagating strahl. In the past it has been shown that suprathermal electron population must exist already in the solar corona, but should be focused in a very narrow beam due to the effect of the diverging interplanetary magnetic field in the interplanetary space. However the observations show much wider strahl and the presence of approximately isotropic halo. It has been speculated in the past that the finite strahl widths and the halo itself are formed due to scattering of the strahl electrons by sunward propagating whistler waves. In this work we perform a statistical study of the interaction of the strahl electrons with whistler waves by comparing the average strahl widths during times of pristine solar wind in the presence and absence of these waves at different electron energies. We find that the whistler waves may cause widening of the electron strahl, but only in a limited range of electron energies, between ~200eV and 530eV. We discuss our findings in terms of possible instabilities that may cause the whistler waves to appear and resonantly interact with the electrons.",

Typically, during the dry summers, these ecosystems are characterized by a simple dual PFTs system with strong-resistant woody vegetation and bare soil, since grass died. The coupled use of sap flow measurements and eddy covariance technique is essential to estimate Evapotransiration (ET) in an heterogeneous ecosystem. An eddy covariance – micrometeorological tower has been installed since 2003 and 33 thermo-dissipation probes based on the Granier technique have installed at the Orroli site in Sardinia (Italy). The site landscape is a mixture of Mediterranean patchy vegetation types: wild olives, different shrubs and herbaceous species, which died during the summer. The sensors have been installed at the Orroli site into 15 wild olives clumps with different characteristics in terms of tree size, exposition to wind and solar radiation and soil depth. A network of 30 soil moisture sensors has also been installed for monitoring soil moisture spatial and temporal dynamics and their correlation with trees. Sap flow measurements show the significantly impacts on ET of soil moisture, radiation, vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and interestingly of tree position into the clump, showing double rates for the trees inside the wild olive clumps. The sap flow sensor outputs are analyzed for estimating innovative allometric relationships between sapwood area, diameter, canopy cover area, which are needed for the correct upscale of the local tree measurements to the site plot larger scale. Finally using an innovative scaling procedure, the sap-flow transpiration at field scale have been compared to the eddy covariance ET, showing the approximation of the eddy covariance technique. Finally the impact of environmental factors on ET for different soil depth and tree position is demonstrated.",

The algorithms developed for individual tree detection are commonly focusing on finding tree tops to allocation the tree positions.

This research applies a machine learning algorithm, mean shift, to position individual trees based on the density of LiDAR point could instead of detecting tree tops. The study site locates in a dense oak forest in Indiana, US. The selection of mean shift kernels is discussed. The constant and dynamic bandwidths of mean shit algorithms are applied and compared.",

            "abstract": "It is recognized that land ecosystems sequester a significant fraction of anthropogenic carbon emissions, and that the magnitude of the \"land sink\" appears to be increasing through time. This observation has led to the hypothesis that forest ecosystems are experiencing more rapid growth than their historical norm, due to some combination of CO2 fertilization, longer growing seasons, nitrogen deposition, and more intensive management. Direct evidence for growth enhancment has been reported from experimental plots, where long-term (historical) rates of biomass accumulation appear lower than contemporary rates derived from remeasurement of individual trees. However, the approach has not been pursued at a national scale. Since the late 1990's the US Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program has standardized plot locations across the United States, and has systematically remeasured tree and plot attributes on 5-year (east) or 10-year (west) cycles. In principle, these remeasured plots provide a robust dataset for comparing contemporary and historical growth rates. In this talk we review approaches for performing this comparison at both plot and tree scales. We find that recent plot-level biomass accumulation rates from the eastern US do show more rapid growth than would be expected from historical biomass-age curves, with enhancement factors of up 2x. However, the implicit inclusion of \"cryptic\" or older disturbances in the historical curves hinders a definitive interpretation. Stand-level age-biomass simulations confirm that disturbance events must be included in the remeasured data set in order to provide comparability with historical curves. Remeasured DBH measurements from individual trees may provide a more robust approach for examining the issue.",

Yet there is much spread across models in the amplitude and time scale of the equilibration, so that even the sign of the implied recent-decade SST response to ozone depletion is not robust.\nHere we use the framework of a simple layered model (representing mixed layer, seasonal thermocline and upper permanent thermocline of the SO south of the polar front) combined with observations of the SO, to derive constraints on the equilibrium response of the real-world SO to annually-repeating seasonal SAM forcing. We obtain simple expressions for the equilibrium response in terms of the SAM-induced air-sea fluxes of heat and momentum and the SO horizontal and vertical temperature stratifications. These are then evaluated using satellite observations and atmospheric reanalysis data, as well as in-situ ocean climatologies.\nOur estimates suggest that, for observed characteristics (mixed layer depths, stratification, phasing of the SAM-forcing in season and space), the well-documented surface-forced fast SO SST cooling is large in comparison to the dynamically-induced subsurface-forced warming, and thus also largely sets the sign and amplitude of the equilibrium response.\nExploration of the parameter space of coupled model versus observed ratios of horizontal to vertical stratifications provides a rationale for the discrepant equilibrium responses.",

            "abstract": "The winter season over North America during 2013/14 was dominated by a persistent ridge-trough that brought warm and dry conditions to the southwestern U.S., and markedly cold temperatures to central and eastern North America [Wang et al., 2014; Hartmann, 2015]. In addition, several cold air outbreaks occurred during the winter season, the strongest of which was around 7 January 2014 and led to minimum daily temperature records being set at many weather stations including Atlanta, Austin, Chicago and New York [Screen et al., in press]. This study uses a novel decomposition of wave variability into standing and travelling components [Watt-Meyer and Kushner, 2015] to diagnose the anomalous circulation of the 2013/14 winter season. This spectral decomposition is an improvement on previous methods because it explicitly accounts for the covariance between standing and travelling waves, and because the real-space components of the signal can be easily reconstructed. An index representing the ridge-trough dipole is computed using mid-tropospheric heights and shown to be well correlated with surface temperatures over central and eastern North America. The contributions to this dipole index from standing waves, westward travelling waves, and eastward travelling waves are calculated. The analysis demonstrates that the cold air outbreak of 7 January 2014 was driven by a synoptic wave of record breaking amplitude intensifying a persistent background amplification of the typical ridge-trough structure seen during North American winter.",

However, a major limitation of repeat altimetry measurements, such as air and space-based surveys, is that variations in the density of surface accumulation and the firn layer must be constrained in order to relate changes in ice thickness to the overall ice sheet mass imbalance. The temporal variability of accumulation thickness and firn compaction rate is poorly constrained, particularly in regions subject to surface melt and refreezing. Additionally, recent warming and extreme melt events may be substantially changing the density of the firn, affecting altimeter measurements. This knowledge gap about snow accumulation and firn density, therefore, is a critical challenge to the ICESat-2 mission objectives. Our in-situ sensor packages, dubbed the Compaction Reconnaissance of Arctic Glacial Snow (CRAGS), will aid the deconvolution of surface change observations, with the goal of providing an operational system in concert with the launch of ICESat-2. The CRAGS prototype was deployed in April 2014 at 69.0754N, -45.6603E, and two fully-equipped systems were deployed in April 2015 at 69.0952N, -46.4446E and 69.0527N, -44.4281E. CRAGS is a tower system equipped with three instruments for measuring snow accumulation: a strain sensor, a sonar, and a snow scale. These systems will be taking measurements for at least two more years, but they are designed to last longer with limited maintenance. The use of a modular tower design allows for them to be extended higher for many years of observations. This method will supplement air and space-based observations, providing the polar science community with valuable ground-truth data regarding the state of the interior of the Greenland ice sheet.",

These questions have been a matter of debate for some time. Lower Cretaceous terrestrial deposits in NW China, provide an opportunity to examine this problem. Here we present high-resolution magnetostratigraphic results for two Lower Cretaceous successions, the Liupanshan Group (Liupanshan Basin) and the Hekou Group (Longzhong Basin), NW China, and propose a minor revision for the CNS.\nThe Liupanshan Group is a ~1300-m thick succession and comprises the alluvial-fluvial- lacustrine clastic sediments and carbonate rocks and gypsiferous mudstones. Samples from 457 levels were measured on the 2G cryogenic magnetometer after demagnetization. Six normal-polarity and five reversed-polarity magnetozones were obtained, which are correlated with the M3n to the M-‘2r’ of the GPTS of Gradstein (2012). The paleomagnetic data allow us to assign the Liupanshan Group to the interval from 131 Ma to 106 Ma (Barremian to Late Albian). The Hekou Group is 3700-m thick and consists of fluvial, lacustrine and deltaic sandstones, mudstones, conglomerates. 28 normal-polarity and 27 reversed-polarity magnetozones were observed from the thermal demagnetization for ~ 800 samples, and they can be reasonably correlated to the M15 thorough M-“2r” of GPTS of Gradstein (2012). This correlation yields an age control for the Hekou Group of 139–106 Ma (Valanginian- Albian). The different basal age of these two basins indicates that the Hekou Basin was initially developed prior to the Liupanshan Basin, but they stopped to develop almost at the same time.\nWe found a short minus magnetozone in the upper part of the two groups, lying between M-‘1r’ and M-‘2r’ of the C34 of GPTS, equivalent to the reversed-polarity subzone (G2003) reported by Gilder et al. (2003) in a basalt from the Tuoyun Basin, NW China. Finally, we propose an alternative version for the C34 (CNS), i.e., the CNS comprises five normal subchrons (labeled as C34n.1n to C34n.5n) which are separated by four minus subchrons (including M’-1r’ (ISEA), G2003, M’-2r’ and M’-3r’). We firstly and clearly confirm the duration of G2003 as 0.2 Myr and M’-2r’ as 1.5 Myr.\nAcknowledgement: This study was supported by Chinese NSF (No. 41272127)",

The reservoir interval is a Morrowan age fluvial sand deposited in an incised valley. The sands are between 10 to 25m thick and located about 2800m below the surface. Primary oil recovery began in 1958 and by the late 1960’s secondary recovery through waterflooding was underway. In 2009, Chaparral Energy began tertiary recovery using 100% anthropogenic CO2 sourced from an ethanol and a fertilizer plant. This constitutes carbon sequestration and fulfills the DOE’s initiative to determine the best approach to permanent carbon storage.\nOne purpose of the study is to understand CO­2 migration from injection wells. CO2­ plume spatial distribution for this project is analyzed with the use of time-lapse 3D vertical seismic profiles centered on CO2 injection wells. They monitor raypaths traveling in a single direction compared to surface seismic surveys with raypaths traveling in both directions. 3D VSP surveys can image up to 1.5km away from the well of interest, exceeding regulatory requirements for maximum plume extent by a factor of two. To optimize the timing of repeat VSP acquisition, the sensitivity of the 3D VSP surveys to CO2 injection was analyzed to determine at what injection volumes a seismic response to the injected CO­2 will be observable. Static geologic models were generated for pre-CO2 and post-CO2 reservoir states through construction of fine scale seismic based geologic models, which were then history matched via flow simulations. These generated static states of the model, where CO2­ replaces oil and brine in pore spaces, allow for generation of impedance volumes which when convolved with a representative wavelet generate synthetic seismic volumes used in the sensitivity analysis.\nFunding for the project is provided by DOE’s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) under Award No. DE-FC26-05NT42591.",

            "abstract": "Lateral export of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from groundwater to surface waters is often poorly quantified in GHG budgets of terrestrial ecosystems, including boreal forests. The importance of lateral CO2 export through groundwater for net ecosystem carbon balances is becoming increasingly evident. However, riparian zones in the boreal landscape often exhibit redox characteristics that promote production also of N2O and CH4, that may reach surface waters and add to the total GHG emissions. We estimate annual and seasonal groundwater export of CO2, N2O and CH4 from a boreal forested catchment (11.9 ha) draining into a 1st order stream and quantify the total emission of greenhouse gases across the soil/stream interface. We present annual GHG export for two years, one with annual discharge close to the long–term average and one when discharge was twice as high. During the year with normal discharge export of CO2, N2O and CH4 were 12.3, 0.0015, and 0.00014 g m-2 year-1, respectively, while the export during the wet year was 14.9, 0.001 and 0.0001 g m-2 year-1. In terms of CO2 equivalents the GHG export was dominated by CO2, 96% and 91% for the normal and we year, respectively. Corresponding contributions for N2O were 4% and 9%, respectively, while export of CH4 was <0.1% during both years. While the export of CO2 was evenly distributed between the growing season and the non-growing season, most of the N2O and CH4 export occurred during the non-growing season. Through measurements of groundwater nitrate concentrations the validity of the existing IPCC emission factor EF5-g for N2O emissions was tested. It showed that this emission factor underestimates actual groundwater N2O emissions from the catchment by 2-3 orders of magnitude.",

            "abstract": "Although a poleward migration of the location of tropical cyclone (TC) lifetime-maximum intensity (LMI) during the past several decades had been identified recently, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. Using a global coupled model and a high-resolution regional atmosphere model, here we demonstrate that the weakening ocean vertical mixing in the ocean after mid-1970s could be the main cause of the poleward migration. Results from sensitivity experiments of the coupled model show that, with weakening tidal mixing, the sea surface temperature (SST) has an increasing trend over the mid-latitude coastal regions of both northwestern Pacific and the northwestern Atlantic, which is consistent with the observations. The increasing SST over the mid-latitude coastal regions provides more potential energy for the TC development and favors a poleward shift of the TC LMI from the tropics. The high-resolution regional atmosphere model forced with this SST variation produces a 1~2-latitute migration of the location of TC LMI away from the tropics. Our finding that the variation of the location of TC LMI is constrained by the decadal change of ocean forcing contributes to the projection of TC activity in the future.",

We will describe an Optimal Estimation (OE) retrieval method that will use three wavelengths of aerosol backscattering (3β) and two wavelengths of aerosol extinction (2α). We will also describe how to use the OE framework to retrieve vertical profiles simultaneously using altitude resolved HSRL data. Finally, we will describe how to include additional measurements (e.g. polarimeter or Sun photometer) for improved aerosol microphysical property retrievals. In a traditional aerosol retrieval algorithm, one solves for aerosol size distributions under various parameter space (rmin, rmax, real and imaginary refractive index) using Tikhonov (or other) regularization and then selects physically and mathematically meaningful solutions from hundreds of thousand retrievals. In an attempt to speed up the retrieval and to provide retrieval error estimates, the OE method solves for all related aerosol microphysical parameters (e.g. number concentrations, particle size distribution, real and imaginary part of refractive indices) simultaneously in a maximum-likelihood sense by fitting the observed data. Other quantities such as effective particle radius, surface area concentration, volume concentration, and single scattering albedo are also derived from the retrieved size distribution and the number concentrations. We will show preliminary results using both simulated data and airborne measurements from HSRL-2. Coincident airborne in-situ and surface remote sensing datasets will be used to evaluate the performance of the new OE algorithm.",

In the Nagahama Bay of the island, venting hydrothermal fluids from iron oxyhydroxide mounds on the seafloor. Using a light microscopy, numerous twisted stalk structures in the deposits were observed, suggesting the presence of neutrophilic iron-oxidizing microbial communities. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene-tagged fragments followed by correlation analysis showed that iron-oxidizing Zetaproteobacteria inhabit the iron deposits in the vicinity of anaerobic iron-reducing bacteria, indicating the occurrence of iron cycling mediated by the microbial ecosystem. We successfully identified Zetaproteobacteria cells using CARD-FISH technique at the different depths of the cored sample, suggesting that the number of Zetaproteobacteria cells and the frequency of the twisted stalk structures are not always consistent. In stalk-abundant horizons that harbor relatively small Zetaproteobacteria populations, accumulation of polyphosphate within Zetaproteobacteria cells was clearly observed. This indicates that Zetaproteobacteria physiologically store energy and phosphorus substrates during the active iron oxidation. In marked contrast, in other horizons with fewer stalks and large populations of Zetaproteobacteria, polyphosphate was rarely observed in the cells, suggesting that Zetaproteobacteria have already used up the intracellular reservoir of energy and phosphorous substrates, and the iron-oxidizing activity is most likely lower than those cells inhabiting the redox interface.",

Current hydrological models simplify surface-subsurface (hyporheic) exchange by treating each domain separately, constraining turbulent flows to the water column. Studies have shown, however, that turbulence penetrates into permeable sediments. Evidence is lacking for how this highly coupled flow regime influences hyporheic exchange.\nWe characterized the dynamics of turbulent exchange between surface and porewaters in a 2.5 m recirculating flume. The channel was packed with 3.8 cm PVC spheres to form a coarse gravel bed, with a total depth of 21 cm. We implanted microsensors onto an array of spheres to measure in situsalt concentrations within the streambed. Water was recirculated in the channel, and concentrated salt solution was continuously injected upstream of the sensor array.\nWe observed solute exchange increased with free-stream Reynolds number and decreased with depth in the sediment bed. Mass of injected solute remaining in the bed decreased rapidly in all cases, with only 10-30% of mass recovered 50 cm downstream of the injection point at Re = 25,000. We observed high-frequency (1-10 Hz) concentration fluctuations at bed depths of at least 4.75 cm, and sporadic low-frequency fluctuations at depths of 12.5 cm. Spectral analysis revealed increased filtering of high frequencies with depth. We used particle-tracking simulations to fit depth-dependent turbulent diffusion profiles to experimental results. These results demonstrate that free-stream turbulence impacts hyporheic mixing deep into permeable streambeds, and mixing is strongly influenced by the coupled surface-subsurface flow field.",

There has also been evidence that the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere (MLT) is 2-D turbulent. In this talk we will review high latitude velocity and electric field data from a variety of satellites, and show that the measured electric field structures are consistent with this hypothesis, particularly when Bz is northward. These fields will mix the ubiquitous plasma density gradients at high latitudes and create the structured ionosphere we observe for any direction of the IMF. If this interpretation is correct, then it is unnecessary to invoke ExB instabilities to explain high latitude ionospheric plasma density and velocity structures. Anisotropy in the auroral plasma is produced by the strong geomagnetic field, which sets up the conditions for 2-D turbulence in the medium. The physics of 2-D turbulence is such that the energy in the system cascades to large scales and eventually fills the available system. This explains the fact that the polar cap occasionally exhibits large-scale vortices when Bz is northward. The spectrum of electric field fluctuations at high k numbers in the system follows the predictions of 2-D turbulence theory, consistent with satellite and rocket observations.",

Microfluidic devices provide a consistently reliable real-time means to quantitatively measure, control and reproduce the dynamic nature of these stresses. As an example, accelerated adaptation from genetic mutations have been observed in E. coli as it responds to gradients of Ciprofloxacin (Zhang et. al. 2011). However, the mechanisms by which bacteria respond to antibiotic gradients, as well as the effect of changes in how the stressor is applied, have not been systematically studied. In this study, newly designed and fabricated microfluidic devices with porous media have been utilized to determine the chemical stress fields that enhance adaptation and thus to test how E. coli bacterial communities adapt to antibiotic stresses. By applying antibiotic and nutrient into inlet channels adjacent to either side of the porous media inoculated with E. coli, a gradient of antibiotic was formed. Hydrogel barriers were selectively photo-polymerized in between of the inlet channels and the porous media to prevent any undesired convection. Hence, chemical solute can only be transported by diffusion, creating a reproducible antibiotic gradient over the porous media. The bacteria were also constrained by the hydrogel boundary barriers from escaping the porous media. Preliminary results suggest that E. coli moves freely with respect to Ciprofloxacin concentrations. In addition, and unexpectedly, the E. coli colonies exhibit a concentric pulsed growth front radiating away from the point of inoculation within the micromodel ecosystem and pulse over the porous media containing antibiotic. The bacteria at the growth front grow into long filaments (up to 100µm) while the bacteria in the inner concentric area are normal size. We hypothesize that the frontier bacteria, which are first exposed to the unfavorable antibiotic concentrations, may initially collapse the gradient and thus reduce the concentration, leaving more favorable growth conditions for the migration of newly replicated bacteria. This approach will also be used to screen other environmental stresses, including nutrient limitation and temperature change.",

These regions are very sensitive to climatic changes and the potential for maintaining tree-covers will be altered in the next decades. Therefore, reforestation planning needs predicting the future \"climatic tree-cover potential\": the optimum tree-fraction sustainable in future climatic states.\nGlobal circulation models projections provide possible future climatologies for the 21st century. These can be used at the global scale to force a land-surface model, which in turn simulates the vegetation development under these conditions. The tree cover leading to an optimum development may then be identified. We propose here to run a state-of-the-art model and to assess the span and the relevance of the answers that can be obtained for reforestation planning.\nThe ORCHIDEE vegetation model is chosen here to allow a multi-criteria evaluation of the optimum cover, as it returns surface climate state variables as well as vegetation functioning and biomass products. It is forced with global climate data (WFDEI and CRU) for the 20th century and models projections (CMIP5 outputs) for the 21st century. At the grid-cell resolution of the forcing climate data, tree-covers ranging from 0 to 100% are successively prescribed. A set of indicators is then derived from the model outputs, meant for modulating reforestation strategies according to the regional priorities (e.g. maximize the biomass production or decrease the surface air temperature). The choice of indicators and the relevance of the final answers provided will be collectively assessed by the climate scientists and reforestation project management experts from the KINOME social enterprise (http://en.kinome.fr). Such feedback will point towards the model most urging needs for improvement.",

We consider the mechanisms by which they warm the Arctic basin; finding that the structure of the warming associated with moisture intrusions is bottom amplified in the deep and marginal sea-ice zones. In the Barents Sea the minimum sea-ice concentration caused by intrusion occurs 5 days after the passage of the moisture in the reanalysis dataset. We find that the entire Arctic is in a state of cooling in the absence of a moisture intrusion event and that there is a positive trend in the number of these intrusion events crossing 70N during December and January; which has resulted in a significant trend of intense moisture fluxes over the Barents region in particular. We find that the trend in moisture intrusion events a can explain roughly 50% of the surface temperature and 40% of the sea-ice concentration trends in December and January. In general the CMIP5 datasets capture the impacts of these events quite realistically. There is a tendency for the moisture fluxes through 70N to be underestimated in most models. The factors that lead models to have quantitatively similar statistics to the reanalysis is also addressed.",

            "abstract": "Storm surge has enough destructive power to damage buildings and infrastructure, erode beaches, and threaten human life across large geographic areas, hence posing the greatest threat of all the hurricane hazards. The United States Gulf of Mexico has proven vulnerable to hurricanes as it has been hit by some of the most destructive hurricanes on record. With projected rises in sea level and increases in hurricane activity, there is a need to better understand the associated risks for disaster mitigation, preparedness, and response. GIS has become a critical tool in enhancing disaster planning, risk assessment, and emergency response by communicating spatial information through a multi-layer approach. However, there is a need for a near real-time method of identifying areas with a high risk of being impacted by storm surge.\nResearch was conducted alongside Baron, a private industry weather enterprise, to facilitate automated modeling and visualization of storm surge inundation and vulnerability on a near real-time basis. This research successfully automated current flood hazard mapping techniques using a GIS framework written in a Python programming environment, and displayed resulting data through an Application Program Interface (API). Data used for this methodology included high resolution topography, NOAA Probabilistic Surge model outputs parsed from Rich Site Summary (RSS) feeds, and the NOAA Census tract level Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI). The development process required extensive data processing and management to provide high resolution visualizations of potential flooding and population vulnerability in a timely manner. The accuracy of the developed methodology was assessed using Hurricane Isaac as a case study, which through a USGS and NOAA partnership, contained ample data for statistical analysis. This research successfully created a fully automated, near real-time method for mapping high resolution storm surge inundation and vulnerability for the Gulf of Mexico, and improved the accuracy and resolution of the Probabilistic Storm Surge model.",

Tropospheric VCD data from Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME), SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY), Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and GOME-2, retrieved from the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) and OMI National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) standard products, are utilized to investigate the annual trends of NO2, SO2, and HCHO VCDs from 2001 to 2015. They are also compared with simulations from Community Multi-scale Air Quality Model (CMAQ) based forecast system by the Integrated Multi-scale Air Quality System for Korea (IMAQS-K) of Ajou University. Until 2011, the changes in NO2 VCD over East Asian countries agree well with the findings of previous research, including the impact of the economic downturn during 2008–2009 and the subsequent quick recovery in China. After peaking in 2011, the NO2 VCD observations from active instruments (OMI and GOME-2) over China started to show a slower decreasing trend, mostly led by the rapid changes in the BTH region in northern China. On the other hand, SO2 started to decline earlier, from 2007, but inclined back from 2010 to 2012, and then back to declining trend since 2012. While satellite observations show dramatic recent changes, the model could not reproduce those changes mostly due to its use of fixed emission inventory. We conclude that rapid update of latest emission inventory is necessary for an accurate forecast of regional air quality in east Asia, especially for upcoming international sports events in PyeongChang (Korea), Tokyo (Japan) and Beijing (China) in 2018, 2020 and 2022, respectively.",

            "abstract": "The problem of climate data homogenization has predominantly been addressed by testing the likelihood of one or more breaks inserted into a given time series and modeling the mean to be stationary in between the breaks. We recast the same problem in a slightly different form: that of detecting step-like changes in noisy data, and observe that this problem has spawned a large number of approaches to its solution as the “edge detection” problem in image processing. With respect to climate data, we ask the question: How can we optimally separate step-like from smoothly-varying low-frequency signals?\nWe study the hypothesis that the edge-detection approach makes better use of all information contained in the time series than the \"traditional\" approach (e.g. Caussinus and Mestre, 2004), which we base on several observations. 1) The traditional formulation of the problem reduces the available information from the outset to that contained in the test statistic. 2) The criterion of local steepness of the low-frequency variability, while at least hypothetically useful, is ignored. 3) The practice of using monthly data corresponds, mathematically, to applying a moving average filter (to reduce noise) and subsequent subsampling of the result; this subsampling reduces the amount of available information beyond what is necessary for noise reduction.\nMost importantly, the tradeoff between noise reduction (better with filters with wide support in the time domain) and localization of detected changes (better with filters with narrow support) is expressed in the well-known uncertainty principle and can be addressed optimally within a time-frequency framework. Unsurprisingly, a large number of edge-detection algorithms have been proposed that make use of wavelet decompositions and similar techniques.\nWe are developing this framework in part to be applied to a particular set of climate data from Greenland; we will present results from this application as well as from tests with “benchmark” and synthetic data.",

            "abstract": "Recent observations and modelling studies investigating the dynamic response of land-terminating regions of the Greenland ice sheet to a warmer climate remain at best unreconciled and at worst equivocal and contradictory. Some studies suggest that ice flow will be regulated over annual time scales by the development of efficient subglacial drainage. Others suggest that such self-regulation processes may not be effective at higher elevations and that the recent and projected expansion of supraglacial lakes further into the ice sheet interior has lead to increased ice flow at high elevations. On the other hand, the observation that rapid in situ supraglacial lake drainage events may be triggered by precursory basal motion have led to the argument that, by inference, such lake drainage in the interior may be impossible, or at least hindered, by reduced strain rates and lack of surface crevasses in these regions. The response of the Greenland ice sheet to a warmer, wetter climate, in which late summer and autumnal cyclonic weather events drive widespread melt, rainfall and transient accelerations may also need to be accounted for in assessments of future Greenland ice mass loss if predicted changes in Greenland’s climate are realised. This talk will critically assess recent insights gained into this topic, attempt to resolve some of them, and suggest directions for future research.",

            "abstract": "The thermal coupling between air and ground temperatures is investigated herein for General Circulation Models (GCMs) that participated in the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). For each simulation, we evaluate the regional relationship between air and ground temperatures to study surface energy fluxes and the attenuation of the annual temperature signal across the air-ground interface and into the shallow subsurface for North America. Our results show that the transport of energy across the air-ground interface and into the shallow subsurface is different across GCMs and is dependent on the land surface models that each employs. The variability of the difference between air and ground temperatures is high among simulations and is not dependent on the depth of the bottom boundary of the subsurface soil model. The difference between air and ground temperatures differs significantly from observations. Additionally, while the variability among GCMs can be explained by the physics of the land surface models, the regional variability of the air-ground coupling is associated with the model treatment of soil properties as well as snow and vegetation processes within GCMs. The difference between air and ground temperatures at high latitudes within the majority of the CMIP5 models is directly proportional to the amount of snow on the ground, due to the insulating effect of snow cover. On the other hand, the difference between air and ground temperatures at low latitudes within some of the CMIP5 models is inversely proportional to the vegetation cover (leaf area index), due to changes in latent and sensible heat fluxes. The large variability among GCMs and the marked dependency of the results on the choice of the land-surface model illustrates the need for improving the simulation of air-ground coupling in land-surface models towards a robust simulation of near-surface processes, such as permafrost and soil carbon stability within GCMs.",

            "abstract": "Investigating characteristics of plasma waves observed by scientific satellites in the Earth’s magnetosphere and plasmasphere is the effective key to understand not only generation mechanisms of the waves but also a plasma environment which influences its generation and propagation conditions. In particular, direction finding of plasma waves is most important for understanding these characteristics.\n The wave distribution function (WDF) method was proposed for direction finding of VLF waves in the Earth’s magnetosphere/plasmasphere. This method assumes that the observed signals are combinations of a continuum of superposed plane waves of different frequencies, propagating in different directions with no mutual phase coherence. Under this assumption, the WDF method can estimate a WDF as directional distribution of wave energy density by using a spectral matrix which is composed by cross spectra of observed signals. However, the WDF estimation is ill-posed problem, that is, the solution is not determined uniquely. Models as additional information for WDF must be needed to determine the solution uniquely. Many models have been proposed until now such as the Gaussian distribution model, and Markov random field model. The estimation using these models works well if the sample number of observed signals is large enough to calculate spectral matrices exactly. Actually the number of sample observed by satellites is very few. We therefore must take into account that the spectral matrix which can be used for WDF estimation contains uncertainty.\n First, to treat the uncertainty, we used the Bayesian inference, and we introduced probability density distribution which determines relationship between observed and theoretical spectral matrices. Second, we studied Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods as a Bayesian inference method for WDF estimation. The performance of proposed inference methods is evaluated by using computer-generated data. The PFX subsystem of EXOS-D (Akebono) satellite measures two components of electric field and three components of magnetic field in the VLF range using wire and loop antennas, respectively. The measurement of the five components enables us to estimate wave directions without ambiguity. By using the PFX data, we also evaluated the performance of our proposed method.",

            "abstract": "Carbon masses in and fluxes from the mantle are topics of intense community interest, but remain uncertain. Recent (2010-2015) estimates of ridge carbon fluxes and total mantle C concentrations each vary by a factors of 30 (0.3-8.4 X 1014 g CO2/year) and 38 (20-765 ppm C), respectively. Early estimates of C fluxes at ridges depended chiefly on C/3He ratios, but the recognition of kinetic C/He fractionation during degassing renders these estimates unsound. Methods based on CO2/Nb and CO2/Ba ratios benefit from a greatly expanded set of observations of minimally degassed MORB glasses and melt inclusions, as well as new constraints on the Nb and Ba concentrations of mean oceanic crust. Quite liberal bounds on MORB CO2/Nb and CO2/Ba of 550±250 and 125±50, combined with the ALLMORB (Gale et al. 2013) or global average MORB of Arevalo and McDonough (2010) concentrations of Nb and Ba yield fluxes of 2.1±1.3 X 1014 g CO2/year, thereby reducing the ridge flux uncertainty to a factor of 4. The C flux from oceanic islands, however, remains almost entirely unconstrained. For bulk mantle C, estimates based on He and Ar suffer from problems similar to those related to fluxes – C/He/Ar are strongly fractionated by degassing. As the upper mantle reservoir is well-constrained by sampling from MORB, uncertainty derives chiefly from the deep (OIB source) reservoir . High average mantle C (e.g. 300 or 765 ppm C; Dasgupta and Hirschmann, 2010; Marty, 2012) requires a deep C-rich reservoir that is a large fraction of the mantle (>30%), which means that it must be in part primitive (i.e. it is volatile-rich but cannot be chiefly recycled) and is too large to be “hidden”, so should be sampled by OIB. Assuming source Ba and Nb concentrations similar to primitive mantle, bulk mantle with 300 or 765 ppm C require OIB sources with CO2/Ba >700-1400 and CO2/Nb>2800-5200, and would produce magmas (with appropriate Ba and Nb concentrations for OIB) with 20-40 wt.% CO2. These are far beyond any observations for OIB CO2/Ba and CO2/Nb, even with the most extensive corrections for deep degassing, and are petrologically inconsistent with the major element compositions of such lavas. The highest plausible C content of the mantle remains poorly constrained, but is undoubtedly far less than the high values among recent estimates, likely by a factor of at 3 or more.",

Here we carry out PIC Riemann simulations to explore electron energization including its dependence on parameters. One-dimensional Riemann simulations, with its simple magnetic geometry, facilitate the study of the reconnection outflow far downstream of x-line in much more detail than is possible with conventional reconnection simulations. We examine the behavior of the electron temperature in this configuration. We find that the electron temperature in the exhaust increases and approaches a constant. Since the heating is independent of the x-line in the Riemann model, these results suggest that electron heating in the exhausts can extend to macroscopic scales in the corona. In runs with guide field, such heating only weakly depends on the proton-to-electron mass ratio used in the simulation. The scaling of the electron temperature increment with the available magnetic energy is discussed and comparisons with conventional reconnection simulations are made.",

Three fluxgate magnetometers have been respectively deployed at the cusp latitudes in the both hemispheres, Zhongshan Station (69°S 76°E in GEO, same hereafter) in Antarctica, Yellow River Station (79°N 12°E) and KHO (78°N 16°E) in the Arctic. Another fluxgate magnetometer has been set at Karholl Base (66°N 17°W) in the Iceland, which is located under the radiation belt or near the auroral zone. These magnetometer record data in three orthogonal components with sample frequency at 25 Hz. Observational data have been accumulated since February 2013. Preliminary analysis show that two types of ULF wave activities appears frequency on the observation regions, one is the broadband wave, which can occur over a frequency range 0.5-10 Hz and above, and in three components or only in the transversal components, and the other is the narrowband waves, which are generally limited within a frequency range below 0.5 Hz, and usually associated with harmonic components, in 8, 9 and 10 Hz, and basically occur on the transversal x and y components. Detailed wave properties and conjugated characteristics are under investigated and on progress.",

The last recorded eruptive activity took place in August 1950 from the flanks of Kawah Plupuh and in October 1950 by the NW part of the Gunung Welirang.\nThis strato-volcano is characterized by a solfataric area, with high T-vent fumarole at least up to 220°C, located mainly in the Welirang crater zone where sulphur deposits are abundant. In addition, several hot springs vent from the flanks of the volcano, indicating the presence of a large hydrothermal system\nDuring July 2015 we carried out a geochemical field campaign on the Arjuno-Welirang volcano-hydrothermal system area sampling water and dissolved gases from the thermal and cold springs located on the flanks of the volcano and from two high-T fumaroles located on the summit area of Welirang. Hydrothermal springs reveal temperatures up to 53°C and pH between 6.2 and 8.2. The hydrothermal springs show a volatile content (mainly CO2 and He) that is several order of magnitude higher than the Air Saturated Waters values (ASW) indicating a strong gas/water interaction processes between waters of meteoric origin and deep volatiles of volcanic origin.

Due to climate change, reduction of snowfall amount, reduction of snow cover and change in snowmelt timing, change in river discharge are of increasing concern. So, the evaluation of snow water amount is crucial for assessing the impact of climate change on water resources in Japan.\nTo validate the snow simulation of the land surface model, time and spatial distribution of the snow water equivalent was estimated using the observed surface meteorological data and RAP (Radar Analysis Precipitation) data. Target area is Hakusan. Hakusan means ‘white mountain’ in Japanese. Water balance of the Tedori River Dam catchment was checked with daily inflow data.\nAnalyzed runoff was generally well for the period from 2010 to 2012. From the result for 2010-2011 winter, maximum snow water equivalent in the headwater area of the Tedori River dam reached more than 2000mm in early April. On the other hand, due to the underestimation of RAP data, analyzed runoff was under estimated from 2006 to 2009. This underestimation is probably not from the lack of land surface model, but from the quality of input precipitation data. In the original RAP, only the rain gauge data of JMA (Japan Meteorological Agency) were used in the analysis. Recently, other rain gauge data of MLIT (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism) and local government have been added in the analysis. So, the quality of the RAP data especially in the mountain region has been greatly improved. \"Reanalysis\" of the RAP precipitation is strongly recommended using all the available off-line rain gauges information. High quality precipitation data will contribute to validate hydrological model, satellite based precipitation product, GCM output, etc.",

The amount of water drained is known (7000 km3 resulting in a lowering of the water level 25 m), but the duration of the drainage and thus the magnitude of the discharge is not securely known. Here we present geomorphic and sedimentologic observations and modeling results that allow estimates of the peak velocity, peak discharge and overall drainage duration for the event. Newly available LiDAR based digital elevation models of the highlands has allowed identification of the boulder bars and fields formed during the drainage. D­90 measurements on sediment in these deposits were used in velocity equations available in the literature, and they predict velocities ranging from 8 to 18 m/sec. Grain-size in these boulder deposits decreases downflow. The morphology of the boulder deposits varies with paleo-water depth. We also modeled the drainage duration assuming a simple ice-breach model. This model produced a peak velocity of 12 m/sec, agreeing well with the sediment data. This peak occurred about 5 months after the initial breach. The entire drainage took less than two years, although 75% of the drainage occurred within the first year.",

Estimates for the Earth's mantle, however, are less accurate owing to the sparsity of Eoarchean mantle-derived rocks with undisturbed 147Sm-143Nd systematics. This study attempts to establish a coherent 142,143Nd dataset for the Eoarchean mantle using well-preserved ultramafic rocks from the Nulliak assemblage (Labrador). Samples include meta-dunites, -pyroxenites and -peridotites exhibiting only minor serpentinization and limited element mobility. The presence of \"Barberton type\" komatiitic compositions (low Al/Ti, HREE depletion) is suggestive of a deep mantle source. 146,147Sm-142,143Nd and 187Re-187Os analyses yield a crystallization age of 3.78±0.09 Ga with ε143Ndi=1.5±0.2 and ε142Nd=8.6±2 ppm. This 142,143Nd signature yields a model age of mantle differentiation of 4.43±0.05 Ga (assuming a BSE with chondritic Sm/Nd and ε142Nd=0). Superchondritic Sm/Nd compositions for the BSE would translate into older model ages. Irrespective of the choice of primitive mantle composition, Nulliak ultramafics provide differentiation ages 100 Ma older than those estimated from Akilia tonalites but remarkably similar to that estimated from the 2.7 Ga Theo's flow (Abitibi). If Nulliak ultramafics originated from deep melting of a hot plume, their model age could reflect the early onset of magma ocean crystallization in the lowermost mantle.",

            "abstract": "To explore the relationships between subduction dynamics and the megathrust earthquake potential, we have recently developed a numerical model that bridges the gap between processes on geodynamic and earthquake cycle time scales. In a self-consistent, continuum-based framework including a visco-elasto-plastic constitutive relationship, cycles of megathrust earthquake-like ruptures were simulated through a purely slip rate-dependent friction, albeit with very low slip rates (van Dinther et al., JGR, 2013). In addition to much faster earthquakes, a range of aseismic slip processes operate at different time scales in nature. These aseismic processes likely accommodate a considerable amount of the plate convergence and are thus relevant in order to estimate the long-term seismic coupling and related hazard in subduction zones. To simulate and resolve this wide spectrum of slip processes, we innovatively implemented rate-and state dependent friction (RSF) and an adaptive time-stepping into our continuum framework.\nThe RSF formulation, in contrast to our previous friction formulation, takes the dependency of frictional strength on a state variable into account. It thereby allows for continuous plastic yielding inside rate-weakening regions, which leads to aseismic slip. In contrast to the conventional RSF formulation, we relate slip velocities to strain rates and use an invariant formulation. Thus we do not require the a priori definition of infinitely thin, planar faults in a homogeneous elastic medium.\nWith this new implementation of RSF, we succeed to produce consistent cycles of frictional instabilities. By changing the frictional parameter a, b, and the characteristic slip distance, we observe a transition from stable sliding to stick-slip behaviour. This transition is in general agreement with predictions from theoretical estimates of the nucleation size, thereby to first order validating our implementation. By incorporating adaptive time-stepping based on a fraction of characteristic slip distance over maximum slip velocity, we are able to resolve stick-slip events and increase computational speed. In this better resolved framework, we examine the role of aseismic slip on the megathrust cycle and its dependence on subduction velocity.",

As it flows away from the valleys of the Cordillera Blanca, the Rio Santa takes out pollution from numerous sources, including acid mine drainage and natural sulfide oxidation by-products. The Rio Santa dry season discharge decline that is projected to be a consequence of glaciers retreat will probably have implications for the evolution of water pollution. This threat makes the characterization of the actual contamination mechanisms of primary importance.\nThe present study focuses, first, on the spatiotemporal variability of heavy metal contamination across the entire Rio Santa Watershed and secondly on differentiating anthropogenic and natural contaminated sites. First, a macroscale sampling has been done during the summer 2013 to provide an overview of the contamination by trace metal, in water, suspended sediments and riverbed sediments. In addition, 30 water samples were taken from a point next to the city of Huaraz at a frequency of once every 2 weeks and analyzed for trace metals. Secondly, in order to identify hydrochemical contaminant origin dependant signatures in the Rio Santa watershed, 5 areas of known contamination origins were sampled during the summer 2014.Spatially speaking, we observed that most pollution is located in the south of the watershed, and that a large part of the arsenic that reaches the Santa in an aqueous phase does not make it to the outlet but remains trapped in the riverbed. Annual variation in water shows a very unusual fluctuation in Mn compare to other trace metal which are relatively stable. By differencing anthropogenic and natural sites and by considering glaciers melt and decrease water in future what would be the impact of the part of natural contaminated sites versus anthropogenic, mining and cities, on the water quality? Preliminary results show that anthropogenic sites show high level of As and Cd but natural contaminated sites show high level of Al, Fe and Mn.",

This unique characteristic makes it useful in studying sudden ionospheric disturbances and/or anomaly especially those related to prompt X-ray flux output from solar flares and gamma ray bursts (GRBs). However, strong geomagnetic disturbances and/or storm conditions are known to produce large and global ionospheric disturbances, which can significantly affect VLF radio propagation in the D region ionosphere. Other than X-ray flux enhancement of amplitude and phase, diurnal VLF signature may convey other important information especially those related to geomagnetic disturbance/storm induced ionospheric changes. In this paper, using the data of three propagation paths (at latitudes 40-54), we performed detail analysis of the trend of variations of aspects VLF diurnal signal under varying solar and/or geomagnetic space environmental conditions for identification of possible geomagnetic footprint on the ionosphere. We found that trend of variations significantly reflected the prevailing space weather conditions of various time scales. The `dipping' of the signal diurnal amplitude have shown noteworthy consistency with significantly geomagnetic perturbed and/or storm conditions in the time scale of 1-2 days. We also found that dipping of most MDP signal occurred irrespective of the time (of the day), which an event happened, while those of MBSR, MASS, SRT and SST appear to largely depend on event occurrence time and/or duration. Pre-sunset event had more influence on the SST and MASS (dusk signal), while pre-sunrise event had more influence on the SRT and MBSR (dawn signal), and depending on the duration of the event, impact could be extended to the neighbouring point/component in succession. The induced dipping varied with geomagnetic activity/event intensity and/or duration, as well as the signals' propagation paths. With lesser or significantly reduced geomagnetic activity on the day following a main event, the post-storm day signal exhibited a tendency of recovery to pre-storm level. We further investigated correlation between ionospheric anomalies attributed to seismic events and solar-induced magnetosphere variations.",

Distance-time diagrams resulting from the combination of white-light corona, IP Type-II radio, and in situ data lead to the formulation of descriptive profiles of each CME's journey toward Earth. Furthermore, two different methods to track and predict the location of CME-driven IP shocks are presented. The linear method, solely based on Wind/WAVES data, arises after key modifications to a pre-existing technique that linearly projects the drifting low-frequency Type-II emissions to 1 AU. This upgraded method improves forecasts of shock arrival time by almost 50%. The second predictive method is proposed on the basis of information derived from the descriptive profiles, and relies on a single CME height-time point and on low-frequency Type-II radio emissions to obtain an approximate value of the shock arrival time at Earth. In addition, we discuss results on CME-radio emission associations, characteristics of IP propagation, and the relative success of the forecasting methods.",

            "abstract": "Nitric acid (HNO3), the gas-phase precursor to aerosol nitrate is known to rapidly transfer to aerosols where NH4+ is in excess to SO42- present in the aerosol, but the HNO3 is also subject to the slower uptake onto sea salt and dust laden particles. Understanding the competition between these routes is necessary to predict the NO3- distribution and impact on aerosols. In this study, we investigated the conditions leading to predominant fine or coarse mode aerosol nitrate using an hourly MARGA 2S dataset from an urban site in Hong Kong. The hourly dataset of inorganic ions (SO42-, NH4+, NO3-, Na+, Cl-, Ca2+, K+, Mg2+) in 2 size ranges (fine, < 2.5 μm; fine+coarse, < 10 μm) and water-soluble gases (HNO3, HCl, and NH3) spanning more than 1 year provides a rich trove for analyzing aerosol nitrate chemistry and the underlying mechanisms that ultimately determine the fraction of NO3- in the fine mode. The urban site in this study is initially characterized for seasonal environmental conditions and the aerosol chemical composition. The relationship between excess NH4+ and NO3- in the fine mode is detailed and contrasted with the influence on fine mode NO3- from uptake on sea salt and dust, which is typically relegated as a ‘coarse-mode’ mechanism. The distribution of NO3- in the fine and coarse modes is compared with the distribution of the other inorganic ions, where sea-salt ion (Na+, Mg2+) distributions yield the highest explained variability for the nitrate distributions. As a complement to that finding, the cation equivalency (excluding NH4+) in the coarse mode proves to be a crucial factor in leveraging the distribution away from fine mode nitrate. The uptake potential of the water-soluble gases is used to drive a mass transfer model and compare with thermodynamic equilibrium results. In the modeling, the partitioning cycles of fine and coarse mode aerosol nitrate highlight the dynamic relationship between NO3- and Cl- in both the fine and coarse modes, where the replacement of Cl- with NO3- is much faster in the fine mode due to shorter mass transfer time scales and more efficient evaporation of the Cl- in smaller particles.",

            "abstract": "How does the Earth’s deep mantle convection affect surface climate change? Volcanism in various geological settings, including  mid-ocean ridges, volcanic arcs, rift zones and sites with intraplate volcanism, releases volatiles to Earth’s surface. The amount and composition of these volatiles influence the evolution Earth’s ocean, crust and atmosphere, which in turn control the evolution of the biosphere. While there are constraints of Earth’s degassing from the geochemistry of samples  in some localized regions, a quantification of the time evolution of degassing on a global scale remains largely unknown.\nIn this study, we run geodynamical calculations with a full 3D spherical geometry to explore the amount of partial melting in the shallow part of Earth’s mantle and implied degassing at a global scale. The plate motion history for the last 200 Ma or longer is employed as time-dependent velocity boundary condition for mantle flow. Using the temperature, pressure and composition in mantle convection models, we calculate the degree of partial melting in different geological settings. We show that the melt flux at mid-ocean ridges generally increases linearly with the speed of plates, with some perturbations due to changes of length of mid-ocean ridges. Generally, this melt flux is about 2-3 times in the past 200 million years than that of the present-day Earth. The present-day melt flux is ~20 km3/year, but this value reaches ~40 km3/year at about 80Ma, and ~60 km3/year at about 120-160Ma. Given estimates of volatile content in the source regions where partial melting occurs and the melt flux we calculate, we quantify the evolution of degassing rate (of CO2) at mid-ocean ridges, hotspots, large igneous provinces, and subduction zones.",

The amount and nature received depends on terrestrial carbon source strength, processing and losses of carbon during transport, and hydrologic connectivity between terrestrial and aquatic systems. While much research has been done on terrestrial DOC dynamics along terrestrial-aquatic flowpaths, there is still considerable uncertainty in many areas including the importance of different carbon sources, microbial metabolism and sorption of DOC, and processing of carbon in groundwater. Here we investigate DOC dynamics in soils, groundwater, and stream waters at the USGS Water, Energy, and Biogeochemical (WEBB) Program research site in northern Wisconsin. This site is well-suited for studying DOC dynamics as soils are sandy and homogenous with small DOC sorption potential, and previous work has characterized the hydrology of the region in detail. We collected water samples over two years from soil pit lysimeters along a series of hillslope transects, from shallow and deep groundwater wells, and from a first-order stream receiving these waters. We measured DOC concentration, DOC optical properties, and biodegradability of DOC. Combined with historical DOC and companion water chemistry data we characterize DOC generation and loss along the following flowpaths: 1) infiltration through the unsaturated zone to the groundwater table, 2) shallow groundwater flow, and 3) long groundwater flowpaths of different origin (lake-derived vs. terrestrial-derived water).",

The instrument comprises a receiver with 0.4 m telescope and InGaAs pin detectors coupled to 12-bit, 200 MS/s waveform digitizers. For on-site ground testing, the 2-μm CO2 IPDA lidar was installed inside a trailer located where meteorological data and CO2 mixing ratio profiles were obtained from CAPABLE and LiCoR in-suite sampling, respectively. IPDA horizontal ground testing with 860 m target distance indicated CO2 sensitivity of 2.24 ppm with -0.43 ppm offset, while operating at 3 GHz on-line position from the R30 line center. Then, the IPDA lidar was integrated inside the NASA B-200 aircraft, with supporting instrumentation, for airborne testing and validation. Supporting instruments included in-situ LiCoR sensor, GPS and video recorder for target identification. Besides, aircraft built-in sensors provided altitude, pressure, temperature and relative humidity sampling during flights. The 2-mm CO2 IPDA lidar airborne testing was conducted through ten daytime flights (27 hours flight time). Airborne testing included different operating and environmental conditions for flight altitude up to 7 km, different ground target conditions such as vegetation, soil, ocean, snow and sand and different cloud conditions. Some flights targeted power plant incinerators for investigating IPDA sensitivity to CO2 plums. Relying on independent CO2 in-situ sampling, conducted through NOAA, airborne IPDA CO2 sensitivity of 4.15 ppm with 1.14 ppm offset were observed at 6 km altitude and 4 GHz on-line offset frequency. This validates the 2-μm double-pulse IPDA lidar for atmospheric CO2 measurement.",

At strongly coupled margins, a locked interface will result in additional tensional stress downdip in the slab. When an underthrusting earthquake ruptures along the plate boundary, it may temporarily reduce the magnitude of the downdip tensional stresses. Stress field variations may be manifest as changes in the seismicity rate and/or the orientation of the principal stress axes. One of the largest recent underthrusting earthquakes was the 11 March 2011 MW 9 Tohoku earthquake at the highly-coupled Japan Trench. Japan has high-resolution seismic networks and earthquakes catalogs, and we use NIED earthquake hypocenter and focal mechanism catalog of earthquakes >Mw 3.5 from 1997-2015 to investigate possible temporal and spatial variations in the downdip intraslab stress field related to the Tohoku earthquake. To ensure that we only include intraslab earthquakes, we analyze earthquakes >60 km depth. From 60-200 km depth, the subducting slab has a double seismic zone (DSZ) with predominantly down-dip compressional earthquakes near the slab surface and predominantly down-dip extensional earthquakes 20-30 km deeper. We divide the subducting slab into three spatial bins covering the main rupture area (37.5°－39.5°), the region to the north of the rupture area (39.5°－41.5°), and the region to the south of the rupture area (35.5°－37.5°). For each bin, after separating earthquakes in the two planes of the DSZ, we compute the seismicity rate and invert the focal mechanisms for the principal stress axes. To investigate temporal variations, we separate earthquakes before and after the Tohoku earthquake and use a damped inversion to minimize model complexity and only keep changes required by the data. Following the Tohoku earthquake, for the bin including the rupture area, we observe a small increase in seismicity <70 km depth in the upper plane of the DSZ.",

            "abstract": "Some L-type asteroids (collectively called \"Barbarians\") are known to exhibit an anomalous polarimetric behavior, whose origin - still to be elucidated - can be related to compositional and/or scattering effects. The fact that these asteroids belong to the same taxonomic class (following the De Meo 2009 classification, including NIR) implies that composition must play a role. Sunshine et al. 2008 showed that these asteroids contain high amounts of CAIs, possibly hinting to a formation in an early proto-planetary environment, very rich in refractory material. On the base of this evidence, we started an observational campaign to increase the data coverage of these objects, by obtaining new NIR spectra, photometric and polarimetric measurements. Our first results show that the peculiar features are not restricted to polarimetry. In particular we show the existence of an anomalous distribution of the rotation periods, and a possible relation between CAI abundance and albedos determined by WISE. We tentatively discuss a possible scenario justifying the different observed features. ",

            "abstract": "Water movement through soils is often dominated by preferential flow processes such as fingering and macropore flow. Traditional models of flow in the unsaturated zone are based on the diffusion or Richards equation and assume that diffusive (surface-tension viscous) flow is the only flow process. These models are incapable of accurately simulating preferential flow. Several alternative approaches, including kinematic wave, transfer function, and water-content wave models, have been suggested for simulating water movement through preferential flow paths. The source-responsive model proposed by Nimmo (2010) and Nimmo and Mitchell (2013) is unique among such models in that water transfer from land surface to depth is controlled by the water-application rate at land surface. The source-responsive model has been coupled with a one-dimensional version of the Richards-equation based model of variably saturated flow, VS2DT. The new model, can simulate flow within the preferential (S) domain alone, within the diffuse (D) domain alone, or within both the S and D domains simultaneously. Water exchange between the two domains is treated as a first-order diffusive process, with the exchange coefficient being a function of soil-water content. The new model was used to simulate field and laboratory infiltration experiments described in the literature. Simulations were calibrated against measured soil water contents with the PEST parameter estimation package; values for hydraulic conductivity and 3 van Genuchten and 3 source-responsive parameters were optimized. Although exact matches between measured and simulated water contents were not obtained, the simulation results captured the salient characteristics of the published data sets, including features typical of preferential as well as diffusive flow. Results obtained from simulating flow simultaneously in both the S and D domain provided better matches to measured data than results obtained from simulating flow independently in either the S or the D domain, indicating the importance played by flow in each of the domains. The coupled model can be used to investigate the contributions of S- and D-domain flows to infiltration and subsequent redistribution of subsurface water and to identify the conditions that promote preferential or diffuse flow.",

            "abstract": "Complex fractured networks in the subsurface control the flow of fluids in many applications, and accurately modeling their interaction with wells is critical to understanding their behavior. For tight sand and shale formations, fluid flow is primarily restricted to fractures within each rock layer. NFFLOW was designed by the Department of Energy to model gas well production from naturally fractured reservoirs. NFFLOW is a discrete fracture simulator, with every fracture and rock matrix in the domain handled individually. One-dimensional models are used calculate the flow through connected fractures and flow from the surrounding rocks into fractures. Flow into wellbores are determined from the combined flux from connecting fractures and adjacent rock matrices. One-dimensional fluid flow equations are used because they are extremely fast to solve and represent a reasonable approximation of the physical behavior of fluids in most of the reservoir. However, near the wellbore those models become inaccurate due to gas flow convergence, which is a multidimensional situation. We present a method to correct the one-dimensional models, using data from two-dimensional fluid flow models, while maintaining the original simulator speed. By applying corrections from the two-dimensional model, the one-dimensional models can better account for gas flow convergence into the wellbore as well as the location of the wellbore within the rock strata.\nCorrections were successful in scaling the one-dimensional flow rates to match the two dimensional values over a wide range of parameters for both fracture flow and porous media flow into the wellbore. This is shown to increase the accuracy of history matching to production data for a wide range of wells, allowing for better modeling and prediction of future productivity. With an accurate history match established, NFFLOW can then be used to investigate issues such as the ability of the formation to sequester carbon dioxide or the effects of additional hydraulic fracturing on fluid transport.",

The Whillans Ice Stream Subglacial Access Research Drilling (WISSARD) project recently sampled sediments and water from Subglacial Lake Whillans (SLW) and its hydrologically connected grounding zone where this lake system empties beneath the Ross Ice Shelf. Here we highlight findings on the diversity and metabolic capabilities of the microbial community detected in these samples. We utilized a hot water drill with a novel filtration and UV treatment system to insure that our entry and sampling did not contaminate our samples or the pristine subglacial ecosystem. Geochemical and microbiological data suggests the water column hosts an active microbial community sustained by the production of fixed carbon from chemosynthesis with energy derived from reduced nitrogen, sulfur, and iron compounds. These energy sources appear to be influenced by bedrock weathering at the sediment surface. For example, dominant 16S rRNA gene phylotypes in the water column suggest ammonia oxidation as a potential source of chemoautotrophic energy. While in the SLW surficial sediments, diversity analysis of functional genes involved in both sulfur oxidation and sulfate reduction (aprA, dsrA, and rdsrA), aprA gene abundance, and 16S rRNA gene analysis indicate that sulfur-oxidizing microbes are dominant. These preliminary results represents the first data on microbial community structure and function from an Antarctic subglacial lake and its grounding zone.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Hunter_AGU Poster Draft_Revised_1.pdf\nIn fluvial ecosystems the alternation of deposition and resuspension of particles represents an important pathway for the downstream translocation of microbes and organic matter. Such particles can originate from algae and microbes, the spontaneous auto-aggregation of organic macromolecules (e.g., “river sown”), terrestrial detritus (traditionally classified as “particulate organic matter”), and erosive mineral and organo-mineral particles. The transport and retention of particles in headwater streams is associated with biofilms, which are surface-attached microbial communities. Whilst biofilm-particle interactions have been studied in bulk, a mechanistic understanding of these processes is lacking. Parallel macroscale/microscale observations are required to unravel the complex feedbacks between biofilm structure, coverage and the dynamics of deposition and resuspension.\nWe used recirculating flume mesocosms to test how changes in biofilm structure affected the deposition and resuspension of clay-sized (< 10 μm) particles. Biofilms were grown in replicate 3-m-long recirculating flumes over variable lengths of time (0, 14, 21, 28, and 35) days. Fixed doses of fluorescent clay-sized particles were introduced to each flume and their deposition was traced over 30 minutes. A flood event was then simulated via a step increase in flowrate to quantify particle resuspension. 3D Optical Coherence Tomography was used to determine roughness, areal coverage and height of biofilms in each flume. From these measurements we characterised particle deposition and resuspension rates, using continuous time random walk modelling techniques, which we then tested as responses to changes in biofilm coverage and structure under both base-flow and flood-flow scenarios. Our results suggest that biofilm structural complexity is a primary control upon the retention and downstream transport of fine particles in stream mesocosms.",

            "abstract": "The explosive energy release in solar eruptive phenomena is believed to be due to magnetic reconnection. In the standard model for coronal mass ejections (CME) and/or solar flares, the free energy for the event resides in the strongly sheared magnetic field of a filament channel. The pre-eruption force balance consists of an upward force due to the magnetic pressure of the sheared field countered by a downward tension due to overlying unsheared field. Magnetic reconnection disrupts this force balance; therefore, it is critical for understanding CME/flare initiation, to model the onset of reconnection driven by the build-up of magnetic shear. In MHD simulations, the application of a magnetic-field shear is a trivial matter. However, kinetic effects are dominant in the diffusion region and thus, it is important to examine this process with PIC simulations as well. The implementation of such a driver in PIC methods is challenging, however, and indicates the necessity of a true multiscale model for such processes in the solar environment. The field must be sheared self-consistently and indirectly to prevent the generation of waves that destroy the desired system. Plasma instabilities can arise nonetheless. In the work presented here, we show that we can control this instability and generate a predicted out-of-plane magnetic flux. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Award No. AGS-1331356.",

            "abstract": "It is expected that the frequency and magnitude of extreme climatic events will increase in coming decades with an anticipated increase in losses from climate hazards. In the Gulf Coastal region of the United States, climate hazards/disasters are common including hurricanes, drought and flooding. However, the capacity to adapt to extreme climatic events varies across the region. This adaptive capacity is linked to the magnitude of the extreme event, exposed infrastructure, and the socio-economic conditions across the region. This study uses hierarchical clustering to quantitatively integrates regional socioeconomic and biophysical factors and develop socio-ecological typologies (SET). The biophysical factors include climatic and topographic variables, and the socio-economic variables include human capital, social capital and man-made resources (infrastructure) of the region. The types of the SET are independent variables in a statistical model of a regional variable of interest. The methodology was applied to US Gulf States to evaluate the social and biophysical determinants of the regional variation in social vulnerability and economic loss to climate hazards. The results show that the SET explains much of the regional variation in social vulnerability, effectively capturing its determinants. In addition, the SET also explains of the variability in economic loss to hazards across of the region. The approach can thus be used to prioritize adaptation strategies to reduce vulnerability and loss across the region.",

Streamflow and sediment drains to Apalachicola Bay within the Northern Gulf of Mexico, resulting in a direct influence on the ecology of the region, in particular seagrass and oyster production. This study examines the seasonal response of overland flow and sediment loading in the Apalachicola River under projected climate change scenarios and land use land cover (LULC) change. A hydrologic model using the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was developed for the Apalachicola region to simulate daily discharge and sediment load under present (circa 2000) and future conditions (circa 2100) to understand how parameters respond over a seasonal time frame to changes in climate only, LULC only, and coupled climate / LULC. These physically-based models incorporate digital elevation model (DEM), LULC, soil maps, climate data, and management controls. Long Ashton Research Station-Weather Generator (LARS-WG) was used to create stochastic temperature and precipitation inputs from four Global Climate Models (GCM), each under Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) carbon emission scenarios for A1B, A2, and B1. These scenarios represent potential future emissions resulting from a range driving forces, e.g. social, economic, environmental, and technologic. Projected 2100 LULC data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) EROS Center was incorporated for each corresponding IPCC scenario. Results from this study can be used to further understand climate and LULC implications to the Apalachicola Bay and surrounding region as well as similar fluvial estuaries while providing tools to better guide management and mitigation practices.",

Being able to model both accurate surface topography and, thanks to the free surface, realistic subduction (Crameri et al., 2012b), we are able to thoroughly investigate the link between individual topographic signals and subduction parameters.\nFor this, we use global mantle models with a free surface that are calculated by the finite-volume code StagYY (e.g., Tackley 2008) using a multi-grid method on a fully staggered grid. We apply the sticky-air method with carefully chosen parameters (Crameri et al., 2012b) to approximate the free surface. A weak hydrated crustal layer ensures stable, on-going subduction (Crameri and Tackley, 2015). The dynamically fully self-consistent model is calculated in either a 2-D or 3-D Cartesian geometry and has an initial subduction zone to produce plate convergence.\nWe systematically test the topography signal depending on (i) shallow slab-dip, (ii) slab buoyancy (iii) radial mantle viscosity, (iv) plate strength, and (v) 3-D mantle flow. Results from our detailed parameter study include general trends and highlight slab dip and mantle viscosity as major agents for upper plate deflection and the slab buoyancy for lower plate deflection.\nREFERENCES\nCrameri, F., et al.

            "abstract": "CO2, the most important greenhouse gas (GHG) in the atmosphere, plays a pivotal role in climate change. The long term increase in its atmospheric abundance after the Industrial Revolution is attributed to the emissions from anthropogenic activities, especially fossil fuel combustion. CO is a product of inefficient combustion and can be used as a surrogate tracer for identifying the anthropogenic and biospheric signal of CO2 from the atmospheric observation. India is the second largest populous country in the world and share significant contribution in the emissions of greenhouse gases mainly CO2. The budget of CO2, estimated from top-down and bottom-up approaches, shows large uncertainties over the South Asian region than other continents. One of the major sources of these large uncertainties is the lack of spatial and temporal observations. An attempt has been made using a year-long period to study the variability of the levels of CO2 and CO at an urban site Ahmedabad (23.03oN, 72.58oE, 55m AMSL), in the western India using a highly sensitive cavity ring down spectroscopy technique. The diurnal cycles of CO2 and CO show distinct features to each other due to their diverse sources and sinks. Two significant peaks during the morning and evening hours have been observed in the diurnal cycle of CO2 while in the case of CO evening peak is significantly higher than the morning peak. The afternoon levels of CO2 are observed lower during monsoon, which shows the significant uptake of CO2 from the biosphere during this season. The diurnal amplitude of CO2 is found largest around 41 ppmv in autumn and lowest around 12 ppmv in monsoon. The seasonal cycles calculated from the afternoon average monthly CO2 show the minimum levels during monsoon and maximum during spring. In case of CO minimum levels are observed in monsoon while maximum are observed in winter. The seasonal amplitude is observed around 15.02 ppmv and 0.27 ppmv for CO2 and CO respectively. Further, the co-relation of CO2, with CO is used to identify the dominant source types in different seasons. More details of the levels, the amplitude of diurnal as well as seasonal variations of CO2 and CO in different seasons and their mutual interrelationship will be presented during the presentation.",

For each of the years investigated, unconventional well counts were obtained for counties in the surrounding states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, and Virginia, and counties exceeding a threshold of 0.05 wells/km2 were designated as counties with a high density of wells. The back-trajectories for each year were separated into two groups: those which passed through counties containing a high density of wells, and those which did not. Back-trajectories passing through high-density counties were further screened by applying a height criterion where trajectories beyond 10% above the mixing layer were excluded. Preliminary results indicate that air parcels with back-trajectories passing within the boundary layer of counties with a high density of unconventional natural gas wells correspond to significantly greater concentrations of observed ethane at these downwind monitors.",

These megaslides comprise two sets of stacked allochthonous masses within the Upper Miocene-Quaternary sedimentary record, now described as Mass-Transport Complexes (MTCs): the Amapá Megaslide Complex (AMC) and the Pará-Maranhão Megaslide Complex (PMMC). Individual megaslides of both MTCs can mobilize to deep waters up to kilometer thick sedimentary series as allochthonous masses with different flow directions, degrees of sediment disruption and internal coherence. Megaslides spread downslope over areas as large as thousands of km2, attaining dimensions comparable to the world's largest mass-transport deposits. The basal and largest megaslide of the AMC (AM1 megaslide) is a quite unique example of mass-transport deposit, since it is interpreted as a dominant carbonate allochthonous mass sourced from a mixed carbonate-siliciclastic platform. According to stratigraphic correlations with global sea-level positions, platform instability would have been triggered between the late Miocene and the end of the Early Pliocene by gravitational collapse of the mixed platform under its own weight, after successive subaerial exposures which were able to generate karstification processes. Siliciclastic-type megaslides, on the other hand, are all sourced from large upslope slide and/or rotated blocks (up to 60 km large in the case of the PMMC).Stratigraphic correlations evidenced that horizon equally acts as the upper décollement level for the gravity tectonic system that operates in the regional scale of the Foz do Amazonas basin. In such a context, results of this work evidence complex links between variable modes of gravity deformation (gravity tectonics and mass wasting), all induced by instability created from a condensed section prone to produce pore fluid overpressure.",

The correlation equation does not exploit the additivity approach introduced by Yao et al. (1971), but includes mixed terms that account for the mutual interaction of concomitant transport mechanisms (i.e., advection, gravity and Brownian motion) and of finite size of the particles (steric effect). The correlation equation is based on a combination of Eulerian and Lagrangian simulations performed, under Smoluchowski-Levich conditions, in a geometry which consists of a sphere enveloped by a cylindrical control volume. The normalization of the deposited flux is performed accounting for all of the particles entering into the control volume through all transport mechanisms (not just the upstream convective flux as conventionally done) to provide efficiency values lower than one over a wide range of parameters. In order to guarantee the independence of each term, the correlation equation is derived through a rigorous hierarchical parameter estimation process, accounting for single and mutual interacting transport mechanisms. The correlation equation, valid both for point and finite-size particles, is extended to include porosity dependency and it is compared with previous models. Reduced forms are proposed by elimination of the less relevant terms.\n",

            "abstract": "The advantage of active microwave remote sensing on the sensitivity of polarization characteristic, backscatter intensity and phase characteristics to soil moisture demonstrates its potential to map and monitor relative soil moisture changes and drought information with high spatial resolution. However, the existence of soil surface condition and vegetation effects confounds the retrieval of soil moisture from active microwave, and therefore limits its applications on soil moisture retrieval and drought monitoring. To research how to reduce the effect of soil roughness and wheat cover with multi- incident angles and multi polarization active microwave remote sensing data, MIMICS and AIEM models were used to simulate the backscattering coefficient of winter wheat covered field. The interaction between winter wheat at main growth stages and microwave was analyzed. The effects of surface roughness and physical parameters of wheat on the backscattering characteristics and the variation of different incident angles and different polarization conditions are simulated and analyzed emphatically. Then scattering coefficient information of winter wheat covered area at different wheat growth stage was measured with a C band ground-based scattering meter. At the same time, biomass, leaf area index and soil rough degree, soil water content and other related parameters are collected. After comparing and analyzing the measured data and the simulated data at different incident angles and different polarization modes, we propose an approach of using multi polarization and multi angle data to eliminate the soil roughness and wheat vegetation effects and performing the inversion of soil moisture. Using the Radarsat2 satellite SAR data and ground-based scatter data gotten at the same period in 2012, soil moisture information of greater area is obtained, and then the drought information is obtained, which is consistent with the measured results.",

On selected days, continuous ground-based measurements were complemented by airborne PTR-MS measurements from NASA P-3B aircraft vertical profiles over Platteville. The spirals were further supported by pressurized canister samples analyzed by a GC-MS for a suite of VOCs. The data were used to characterize the variability of benzene at the collection site. Exceptionally high measurements of benzene from the southwest constrain a gas field benzene source that has been observed in previous studies. The chemistry at the site is heavily influenced by oil and gas activity, with local sources of benzene creating mixing ratios comparable to benzene measured over the Denver urban area.",

It was used to test different hypotheses about relationships between these properties (e.g. water content in minerals and their Poisson's ratio). Furthermore, a scheme to model the average elastic properties, i.e. the bulk modulus KS, based on mineral density and composition was developed.\nBirch´s law, a linearity between density ρ and wave velocity (e.g. vp.), is frequently used in seismic and seismology to derive density of the Earth´s interior from seismic velocities. Applying the compiled mineral data contradicts the use of a simple velocity-density relation (e.g. Gardner´s relation, 1974).\nThe presented model-approach to estimate the minerals´ bulk moduli Ks (as Voigt-Reuss-Hill average) is based on the idea of pressure-temperature (p-T) dependent ions´ bulk moduli. Using a multi-exponential regression to ascertain the ions´ bulk moduli and by applying an exponential scaling with density ρ, their bulk moduli could be modelled. As a result, > 88 % of the 258 bulk moduli data are predicted with an uncertainty of < 20 % compared to published values. Compared to other models (e.g. Anderson et al. 1970 and Anderson & Nafe 1965), the here presented approach to model the bulk moduli only requires the density ρ and chemical composition of the mineral and is not limited to a specific group of minerals, composition, or structure. In addition to this, by using the pressure and temperature dependent density ρ(p, T), it is possible to predict bulk moduli for varying p-T conditions.\n",

            "abstract": "Degrading groundwater quality due to saltwater intrusion is one of the key challenges affecting many island aquifers. These islands hold limited capacity for groundwater storage and highly dependent on recharge due to precipitation. But its ease of use, natural storage and accessibility make it more vulnerable to exploitation and more susceptible to encroachment from its surrounding oceanic waters. Estimating the extent of saltwater intrusion and the state of groundwater resources are important in predicting and managing water supply options for the community. In Guimaras island, central Philippines, increasing settlements, agriculture and tourism are causing stresses on its groundwater resource. Indications of saltwater intrusion have already been found at various coastal areas in the island. A Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based approach using the GALDIT index was carried out. This includes six parameters assessing the seawater intrusion vulnerability of each hydrogeologic setting: Groundwater occurrence, Aquifer hydraulic conductivity, Groundwater Level above sea, Distance to shore, Impact of existing intrusion and Thickness of Aquifer. To further determine the extent of intrusion, Landsat images of various thematic layers were stacked and processed for unsupervised classification and electrical resistivity tomography using a 28-electrode system with array lengths of 150 and 300 meters was conducted. The GIS index showed where the vulnerable areas are located, while the geophysical measurements and images revealed extent of seawater encroachment along the monitoring wells. These results are further confirmed by the measurements collected from the monitoring wells. This study presents baseline information on the state of groundwater resources and increase understanding of saltwater intrusion dynamics in island ecosystems by providing a guideline for better water resource management in the Philippines.",

            "abstract": "The process restoration philosophy promotes the reinstatement of natural process (particularly the continuum of sediment transport processes) at the catchment scale. Associated with this approach is the concept that river biological communities, having evolved under natural/ un-impacted conditions, will respond positively to the reinstatement of natural physical function. The application of this ‘let-the-river-do-the-work’ approach is regarded as providing a sustainable alternative to traditional more ‘hard engineering’ approaches. However, often the reality is that full restoration of the controlling physical processes at the catchment scale is not feasible due to a variety of constraints (e.g. altered geomorphic regime, agriculture, infrastructure/ services, urban development, costs, etc.) and less ambitious objectives have to be set. Thus, under these typical constrained circumstances, can process restoration still be applied and, given the fundamental assumption of biophysical linkage, can ecology still be expected to respond positively? To elucidate these issues, we present four case studies from Scotland which represent the spectrum of process restoration application relating to almost no design constraints to very significant limitations (culvert daylighting within a housing development). We highlight that, despite significant constraints, physical river processes can (and should) always be considered in restoration design. The case studies demonstrate that natural physical processes (evidenced through indicators of sediment transport) quickly reinstate following construction; this was despite significant local constraints but reliant on physical/ geomorphic process being explicitly incorporated into to the design approach. Furthermore, evidence of associated improvements to the ecological/ habitat/ biotic condition of the restored sections of river were observed.",

            "abstract": "Ports are vital to the global economy, but assessments of global exposure to flood risk have generally focused on major concentrations of population or asset values. Few studies have examined the impact of extreme inundation events on port operation and critical supply chains. Extreme water levels and recurrence intervals have conventionally been estimated via analysis of historic water level maxima, and these vary widely depending on the statistical assumptions made. This information is supplemented by near-term forecasts from operational surge-tide models, which give continuous water levels but at considerable computational cost.\nAs part of a NERC Infrastructure and Risk project, we have investigated the impact of North Sea tidal surges on the Port of Immingham, eastern, UK. This handles the largest volume of bulk cargo in the UK and flows of coal and biomass that are critically important for national energy security. The port was partly flooded during a major tidal surge in 2013. This event highlighted the need for improved local forecasts of surge timing in relation to high water, with a better indication of flood depth and duration.\nWe address this problem using a combination of data-driven and numerical hydrodynamic models. An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is first used to predict the surge component of water level from meteorological data. The input vector comprises time-series of local wind (easterly and northerly wind stress) and pressure, as well as regional pressure and pressure gradients from stations between the Shetland Islands and the Humber estuary. The ANN achieves rms errors of around 0.1 m and can generate short-range (~ 3 to 12 hour) forecasts given real-time input data feeds. It can also synthesize water level events for a wider range of tidal and meteorological forcing combinations than contained in the observational records. These are used to force Telemac2D numerical floodplain simulations using a LiDAR digital elevation model of the port. Functional relationships between peak water level and surge 'shape' allow estimation of flood depths and durations for any location. Supplementing existing surge warning systems, our approach predicts the location and duration of flooding in detail, and allows port managers to take steps to minimize its impact on the most critical aspects of port operation.",

Many attempts to design policy for carbon management have been limited, ineffective, or otherwise unsuccessful in part due to inadequate capacity to observe carbon sources and sinks with sufficient measurement certainty and at appropriate spatial scale. Too often, policy designers fail to understand the complexities of carbon science and carbon researchers fail to align at least a portion of their science goals with policy requirements. The carbon monitoring systems research and applications activities under the auspices of the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration have significantly advanced both science and applications. To further this necessary symbiosis, this paper will synthesize current and prospective spatial and temporal requirements for emerging policy needs, discuss likely requirements for measurement certainty, and draw lessons from experiences in policies designed to monitor and manage other natural resources for which scientific research necessarily influenced policy design and effectiveness.",

            "abstract": "Tabular dunites in ophiolites are thought to form high-permeability, melt channels due to a positive feedback between melt flow and melt-solid reaction in the upper mantle. Reaction-infiltration instability (RII) theory predicts whether or not channels emerge from background flow. To test the applicability of RII theory to mantle rocks, we sandwiched a partially molten rock between a melt reservoir and a porous sink. Hot-pressed 50:50 mixtures of olivine (Ol) and clinopyroxene (Cpx) with either 4, 10 or 20 vol% alkali basalt formed ~4 mm long cylinders of partially molten rock. Source and sink are disks of alkali basalt and porous alumina. We annealed the melt-rock-sink triplets for up to 5 h at a confining pressure of Pc=300 MPa with effective pressure Pe=0 to 299.9 MPa at T=1200° or 1250°C.\nThe melt fraction in the partially molten rock influences the permeability, which, together with the applied pressure gradient, controls the melt migration velocity. The temperature influences the reaction rate. Melt velocity and reaction rate are fundamental parameters in RII theory. In experiments, two distinct features form due to melt migration, 1) a planar reaction layer (RL) and 2) finger-shaped channels. Both the RL and the channels contain Ol+melt with no Cpx, indicating that the reaction melt1+Cpx→melt2+Ol occurs. The channels develop only if the melt velocity is >5µm/s. Once a channel reaches the porous sink, a large increase in the effective permeability is detected. The morphology and spacing of the channels depends on the initial melt fraction. With 20 vol% melt, multiple, voluminous channels with a spacing of 1.8±0.5 mm develop. At lower melt contents, fewer, thinner channels with a spacing of ~3 mm develop. The channel spacing predicted by theory is about a factor 2-4 smaller than observed.\nOur results indicate that RII theory provides a solid framework for investigating melt migration in experiments and potentially a basis for extrapolation to mantle conditions.",

            "abstract": "Increased radiative forcing has resulted in the global warming that includes the warming in air and soil over the past decades. The warming at the Earth’s surface propagates or conducts downward into the ground and modifies the ambient ground thermal regime. In addition to the surface radiation that directly heats the soil, the other soil heat fluxes associated with atmospheric circulations of various scales are important mechanisms as well. The quantification of the causal relationships between the radiation, large scale atmospheric circulations and soil temperature change in the upper few meters on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) is the objective of this study.\nDaily soil temperature data during 1980-2013 at various depths from surface down to 3.2 m depth at 88 stations located on the TP obtained from China Meteorological Administration are used to investigate the changes in soil temperature. After the quality control, the Mann-Kendall trend, EOF and regression analyses are applied to analyze the soil temperature and radiation data. The Mann-Kendall test shows that soil temperature at layers above 3.2-m-depth increases from 1980 to 2013 at most stations on the TP, although the warming rate varies among stations. Time series of the EOF analysis shows that a hiatus in the soil temperature warming has occurred since 2004 on the TP, which is several years behind the hiatus of the global warming but is similar to the air temperature change on the TP. Besides, we do not find a clear phase delay from the surface to the 3.2m level. Net surface solar radiation, long wave radiation that partly reflects the greenhouse gases forcing, latent and sensible heat fluxes are examined to understand the underlying mechanisms for the distinct warming of the soil on the TP. Contributions of the atmospheric circulation changes, induced by either internal variability or external forcing or both of the two factors, are also examined. The above analysis results will be presented at the conference.",

San Antonio College, and the Science Education Resource Center (SERC). We present results from classroom testing and assessment of the GETSI Ice Mass and Sea Level Changes module that utilizes geodetic data to teach about ice sheet mass loss in introductory undergraduate courses. The module explores the interactions between global sea level rise, Greenland ice mass loss, and the response of the solid Earth. It brings together topics typically addressed in introductory Earth science courses (isostatic rebound, geologic measurements, and climate change) in a way that highlights the interconnectivity of the Earth system and the interpretation of geodetic data. The module was tested 3 times at 3 different institution types (R1 institution, comprehensive university, and community college), and formative and summative assessment data were obtained. We will provide an overview of the instructional materials, describe our teaching methods, and discuss how formative and summative assessment data assisted in revisions of the teaching materials and changes in our pedagogy during subsequent implementation of the module. We will also provide strategies for faculty who wish to incorporate the module into their curricula. Instructional materials, faculty and student resources, and implementation tips are freely available on the GETSI website.",

            "abstract": "We analyze daily extremes of precipitation produced with a polar-optimized version of the Advanced Weather Research and Forecasting (ARW-WRF) model that simulated 19 years on the domain developed for the Regional Arctic System (RASM) model. Analysis focuses on Alaska, because of its proximity to the Pacific and Arctic oceans, both of which provide a large moisture fetch inland. Alaska’s topography also has an important impact on orographically-forced precipitation. In order to understand the circulation characteristics conducive for extreme precipitation events, we use Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to find general patterns of circulation behavior. The SOM algorithm employs an artificial neural network that uses an unsupervised training process. In our analysis, we use mean sea level pressure (MSLP) anomalies to train the SOM.\nWe examine daily widespread extreme precipitation events, defined as at least 25 grid points experiencing 99th percentile precipitation. Using the SOM procedure, we map days with widespread extremes onto the SOM’s array of circulation patterns. This mapping aids in determining which nodes are being accessed at higher frequencies, and hence, which circulations are more conducive to extreme events. We show that there are multiple circulation patterns responsible for extreme precipitation differentiated by where they produce extreme events in our analysis region. Additionally, we plot composites of several meteorological fields for SOM nodes being accessed by both extreme and non-extreme events to determine what specific conditions are necessary for a widespread extreme event. Composites of individual nodes (or of adjacent nodes in SOM space) produce more physically reasonable circulations as opposed to composites of all extreme events, which can include multiple synoptic circulation regimes. We also trace the temporal evolution of extreme events through SOM space. Thus, our analysis lays the groundwork for diagnosing differences in atmospheric circulations and their associated widespread, extreme precipitation events.",

Upon entering high school the mentored students themselves enrolled in the Science Research program and continued for 4 years, culminating with their participation in Science Research 4. This allowed them to continue conducting original scientific research, act as mentors to 8th grade geoscience students and to provide teacher training for both middle and high school teachers conducting inquiry-based science lessons. Of the 7 Science Research 4 students participating since 2010, 100% plan on majoring or minoring in a STEM - related field in college and their individual research projects have been been granted over 70 different awards and honors in science fair and symposia including a 3rd and 4th place category awards at two different international science fairs - the International Sustainable Energy Engineering and Environment Project (iSWEEP) and the International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF). Science Research 4 students developed and conducted a Society for Science and the Public affiliated science fair for middle school students enrolled in an 8th grade honors geoscience program allowing over 100 students from 5 middle schools to present their research and be judged by STEM professionals. Students with research judged in the top 10% were nominated for participation in the National Broadcom MASTERS program which they successfully entered upon further mentoring from the Science Research 4 students. 8th grade enrollment in the Science Research program for 2015 increased by almost 50% with feedback from students, parents and teachers indicating that the mentorship and participation in the 8th grade science fair were factors in increasing interest in continuing authentic scientific research in high school.",

            "abstract": "Cinder Cone is located in the northeast corner of Lassen Volcanic Center, approximately 35 km southeast of Old Station, California. The area consists of a cinder cone constructed of loose scoria, lava flows and a 13-16 km diameter ash deposit. According to radiocarbon ages from trees affected by the lava flows and paleomagnetic data, Cinder Cone erupted in about 1650 AD (1). The youngest products of the Cinder Cone eruption are two Fantastic Lava Beds flows which are basaltic andesite and andesite with olivine (1). Samples were collected along the longest flow from Cinder Cone, the Fantastic Lava Beds Flow 2 (4.5 km) at approximately 0.5 km interval. The samples contain olivine, plagioclase and clinopyroxene phenocrysts in fine grained groundmass with varying vesicularity. Quartz xenocrysts also occur. SEM-Back Scatter Electron images are used to map and quantify groundmass crystallinities along the length of the Fantastic Lava Beds flow 2 and of tephra units. The average area of groundmass plagioclase crystals increases along the length of the lava flow from 94.7 to 292.6 µm2. The number of groundmass plagioclase crystals per area (µm2) decreases from 0.0045 to 0.0018 from proximal to distal samples. Crystals also become blockier in distal samples along the lava flow. The larger number of crystals per area in near vent samples establishes a baseline from which we interpret crystal growth and nucleation to have occurred in the flow channel. Increasing crystal size and a decrease in the number of crystals per area indicates growth dominated nucleation during cooling and crystallization in the flow channel. Relative cooling rates along the length of the flow from proximal to distal samples can be inferred based on groundmass crystallinities, distance travelled and estimates of flow and crystallization rates.

            "abstract": "Seal integrity of cap-rock is a critical constraint on the long term performance of CO2 containment site. During fluid migration, the coupled geochemical reaction of minerals and geomechanical deformation of rock matrix may affect the seal integrity. The potential leakage of injected CO2 from cap-rock through preexisting fractures/faults represents a major concern associated with geological storage of CO2. To address the fundamental question of CO2 leakage through subcritical growth of fractures driven by chemically reactive fluid across caprocks, we build a Dugdale cohesive model. Ahead of the physical crack tip, a narrow band of cohesive zone is assumed to exist with the upper and lower cohesive surfaces held by the cohesive traction. In the vicinity of the crack tip, minerals dissolve due to the acidic environment and migrate from the physical crack tip into the cohesive zone causing damage of rock matrix in the form of a reduction of cohesive traction.Focusing on the dissolution of calcite and following the stress corrosion theory, we assume the degradation of cohesive traction is linearly proportional to the concentration of Ca2+whose evolution follows the reactive diffusion equation. Using a critical crack opening displacement criterion, the subcritical propagation behavior of crack due to stress corrosion is captured and the rate-limiting effects including the chemical reactions to produce the Ca2+ and the transport of minerals along the newly generated fracture cohesive zone are incorporated. Subcritical crack growth rate under different chemical environment conditions is examined and compared with the experimental fracture mechanics testing.",

            "abstract": "As global freshwater sources decline due to environmental contamination and a growing population, more sustainable wastewater renovation techniques will need to be applied to ensure freshwater for future generations. One such example of a sustainable solution is called the Living Filter, located on the campus of Pennsylvania State University. For fifty years, Pennsylvania State University has sprayed treated wastewater onto agricultural fields and forest ecosystems, leaving natural processes to further filter the wastewater. This cyclical process is deemed sustainable because the freshwater is recycled, providing drinking water to an increasing university population and nutrients to agricultural crops, without causing major environmental catastrophes such as fish kills, eutrophication or groundwater contamination. At first glance this project seems sustainable and effective, but for how long can this setup continue without nutrient overloading and environmental contamination? To be truly declared sustainable, the hopeful answer to this question is indefinitely.\nUsing a combination of soil core and monitoring tools, ecosystem indicators such as soil nutrient capacities, moisture levels, and soil characteristics were measured. Comparing data from the initial system installation to present data collected from soil cores showed how ecosystems changed over time. Results revealed that nitrate concentrations were elevated through the profile in all land use types, but the concentrations were below EPA threshold. Soil characteristic analysis including particle size distribution, soil elemental composition, and texture yielded inconclusive results regarding which factors control the nitrate accumulation most significantly.\nThe nitrate depth profile findings suggest that spray irrigation at the Living Filter under the current rates of application has not caused the ultimate stage of nitrogen saturation in the spray irrigation site. Variations in land use present interesting findings about causation for differences in nitrate concentrations. From the viewpoint of nitrate accumulation and potential for environmental contamination, the Living Filter continues to serve as a viable mechanism for absorbing nutrient discharge and serving as the final stage of wastewater treatment.",

At the same time, West Antarctica is currently one of the most rapidly warming regions on Earth. Under future, warmer conditions, it is believed that total snowfall and accumulation will increase over these already high accumulation areas, which could act to mitigate some of the dynamic ice losses. Using a variety of cores collected between 2000 and 2010, we investigate the variations and trends in snow accumulation over the past two centuries from the area in and around the Pine Island and Thwaites catchments. Furthermore, we combine the firn core records with atmospheric reanalysis data to assess any controls on recent accumulation (post-1979) to understand potential future changes. We additionally use radar-derived accumulation rates from the past century to support interpretation of the firn core records and to help us understand the spatial representativeness of the records. Because the records from all three data sources (firn cores, reanalysis, and radar data) are in agreement, we find that the recent accumulation history of Pine Island and Thwaites is well-constrained at the catchment scale.",

Observed losses in Arctic sea-ice during September are greater than the majority of models in the CMIP5 archive and the multi-model average. In contrast Antarctic sea-ice has increased in contrast to an expected decline.\nWe have carried out a set of perturbations to the HadCM3 model in which we changed the maximum ice area (a proxy for ice leads), albedo parameterizations, ice thermal conductivity and ocean diffusion. Changes in these parameters affected ice extent in both the Arctic and Antarctic. We used these simulations to identify four parameters that had most impact on minimum and maximum sea-ice extent in both hemispheres. To tune the model we used a Gauss-Newton algorithm to adjust those four parameters to minimize differences between simulated and observed sea-ice extents. With this new parameter set we then simulated the period 1940 to 2015 and compared with the default configuration of HadCM3.\nCompared to the default configuration the perturbed model had greater summer sea-loss in the Arctic and is consistent with observed loss estimates. However, in the Antarctic neither the perturbed or default simulations show an increase in sea-ice extent. This is in contrast to the observations which do show an increase in sea-ice extent.",

The speleothem formed over the last 1000 years and is still growing. High-accuracy U/Th datings have indicated exceptionally high growth-rates of up to 2 mm per year. This, together with a well expressed annual layering, makes the Proserpine stalagmite an ideal candidate for high-resolution paleoclimate reconstructions of the last millennium.\nPrevious work, including over 10 years of cave monitoring, has already learned us how short-term, i.e. decadal to seasonal, climate variations are incorporated within speleothem calcite from the Han-sur-Lesse cave system. It has been shown that δ18O and δ13C stable isotopes and trace element proxies of recently formed calcite reflect seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation of the near-cave environment (Verheyden et al, 2008; Van Rampelbergh et al., 2014).\nNow, this knowledge was used to infer local climate parameters further back in time to the period of +/- 1620-1630 CE, corresponding to one of the cold peaks within the Little Ice Age. Speleothem calcite was sampled at sub-annual resolution, with approximately 11 samples per year, for stable isotope analysis. LA-ICP-MS and µXRF analyses resulted in time series of trace elements. Preliminary results indicate a well expressed seasonal signal in δ13C and trace element composition but a multi-annual to decadal trend in δ18O. This combined proxy study eventually enables comparison of the expression of seasonality and longer term climate variations between a Little Ice Age cold peak and Present Day.\n",

Intended outcomes of these events include increased interest in and awareness of the mission and goals of NASA. Events range in size from relatively small family science nights at a local school to large-scale mission and celestial event celebrations involving thousands of members of the general public. To support community members in designing event evaluations, the Science Mission Directorate (SMD) Planetary Science Forum sponsored the creation of a Best Practices Guide. The guide was generated by reviewing published large-scale event evaluation reports; however, the best practices described within are pertinent for all event organizers and evaluators regardless of event size.\nEach source included in the guide identified numerous challenges to conducting their event evaluation. These included difficulty in identifying extant instruments or items, collecting representative data, and disaggregating data to inform different evaluation questions. Overall, the guide demonstrates that evaluations of the large-scale events are generally done at a very basic level, with the types of data collected limited to observable demographic information and participant reactions collected via online survey. In addition to these findings, this presentation will describe evaluation best practices that will help practitioners move beyond these basic indicators and examine how to make the evaluation process an integral—and valuable—element of event planning, ultimately informing event outcomes and impacts. It will provide detailed information on five recommendations presented in the guide: 1) consider evaluation methodology, including data analysis, in advance; 2) design data collection instruments well in advance of the event; 3) collect data at different times and from multiple sources; 4) use technology to make the job easier; and 5) be aware of how challenging it is to measure impact.",

The modeling portion of the LASSO workflow is presented by Gustafson et al., which will initially focus on shallow convection over the ARM megasite in Oklahoma, USA. This presentation describes how the LES output will be combined with observations to construct multi-dimensional and dynamically consistent “data cubes”, aimed at providing the best description of the atmospheric state for use in analyses by the community. The megasite observations are used to constrain large-eddy simulations that provide a complete spatial and temporal coverage of observables and, further, the simulations also provide information on processes that cannot be observed. Statistical comparisons of model output with their observables are used to assess the quality of a given simulated realization and its associated uncertainties. A data cube is a model-observation package that provides: (1) metrics of model-observation statistical summaries to assess the simulations and the ensemble spread; (2) statistical summaries of additional model property output that cannot be or are very difficult to observe; and (3) snapshots of the 4-D simulated fields from the integration period. Searchable metrics are provided that characterize the general atmospheric state to assist users in finding cases of interest, such as categorization of daily weather conditions and their specific attributes. The data cubes will be accompanied by tools designed for easy access to cube contents from within the ARM archive and externally, the ability to compare multiple data streams within an event as well as across events, and the ability to use common grids and time sampling, where appropriate.",

            "abstract": "Floodplain chute channel formation is a key process that can enable rivers to transition from single-thread to multi-thread planform geometries. Floodplain chute channels are usually incisional channels connecting topographic lows across point bars and in the floodplain. Surprisingly, it is still not clear what conditions promote chute channel formation and what governs their morphodynamic behavior. Towards this end we have initiated an empirical and theoretical study of floodplain chute channels in Indiana, USA. Using elevation models and satellite imagery we mapped 3064 km2 of floodplain in Indiana, and find that 37.3% of mapped floodplains in Indiana have extensive chute channel networks. These chute channel networks consist of two types of channel segments: meander cutoffs of the main channel and chute channels linking the cutoffs together. To understand how these chute channels link meander cutoffs together and eventually create floodplain channel networks we use Delft3D to explore floodplain morphodynamics. Our first modeling experiment starts from a generic floodplain prepopulated with meander cutoffs to test under what conditions chute channels form.We find that chute channel formation is optimized at an intermediate flood discharge. If the flood discharge is too large the meander cutoffs erosively diffuse, whereas if the floodwave is too small the cutoffs fill with sediment. A moderately sized floodwave reworks the sediment surrounding the topographic lows, enhancing the development of floodplain chute channels. Our second modeling experiments explore how floodplain chute channels evolve on the West Fork of the White River, Indiana, USA. We find that the floodplain chute channels are capable of conveying the entire 10 yr floodwave (Q=1330m3/s) leaving the inter-channel areas dry. Moreover, the chute channels can incise into the floodplain while the margins of channels are aggrading, creating levees. Our results suggest that under the right conditions, chute channel formation can be extensive enough to create channel networks across the floodplain.",

            "abstract": "Following the surge of great earthquakes from 2004-2014, revised synoptic models have been proposed, where 2D spatial heterogeneity in frictional properties of continental and subduction fault zones is invoked to explain earthquake behaviours. However, none of the proposed models accounts for the changes in frictional properties that past ruptures may have caused on the rupture zones of recent events.\nWe performed velocity step friction experiments at sub-seismic slip rates (10-100 mm/s) on dry, water- and brine-saturated granite and calcite rocks (continental crust) showing that velocity strengthening behaviour evolves to velocity-neutral/-weakening behaviour after critical displacements of a few tens to hundreds of mm. Dry, water- and brine-saturated gabbros (oceanic crust) show velocity-weakening behaviour and slip localization for any applied displacement and normal stress. Dry, water- and brine-saturated phyllosilicate-rich gouges (typical of subduction zones and continental sedimentary deposits) show velocity-strengthening behaviour for any applied displacements and normal loads. Cyclic slide-hold-slide experiments show that, after sliding at sub-seismic slip rates, static friction increases with time according to a logarithmic relationship (fault healing) for almost all tested materials under dry, water- and brine-saturated conditions. The only exceptions are organic-rich black shales, which show a decrease in static fault friction with time (negative fault healing). The positive and negative healing rates tend to increase under water- and brine-saturated conditions, respectively. After sliding at seismic velocities (1 m/s), granite, calcite and phyllosilicate-rich gouges show an evolution toward less velocity strengthening to velocity-weakening behaviour, as opposed to grabbros gouges showing an evolution towards velocity strengthening behaviour.\nOur experimental results suggest that patches of small and large seismic slip of past events are critical in controlling the frictional healing and frictional stability of both crustal and subduction fault zones. Hence, the distribution and amount of slip recorded by past events should be included in synoptic models describing the spatial heterogeneity of frictional properties along fault zones.",

Examples include processing of colloidal suspensions, reactive transport in which colloidal precipitates are formed, and flow and transport in groundwater aquifers. In each of these systems, fundamental understanding is hampered by the difficulty in measuring the structure, or morphology, of colloid aggregates and colloid deposits in situ. This presentation describes a novel apparatus that measures the fractal dimension, radius of gyration, and (flow cell averaged) permeability of colloid deposits using static light scattering (SLS) through refractive index matched (RIM) porous media. This apparatus allows real-time measurement of colloid aggregate and deposit morphology as a function of depth within the flow cell.

            "abstract": "Shale gas produced through hydrofracturing has changed the energy perspective in the United States. Shale gas extraction is complicated by the fast decline in wellbore production, to mitigate which re-stimulation and drilling new wells are required. Our goal is to conduct laboratory experiments that examine methane transport from low-permeability matrices to fracture networks induced by hydraulic fracturing. In particular, we address whether mineralogical alteration of shale by hydrofracturing fluids has an effect on matrix-to-fracture methane transport. We performed a set of laboratory experiments addressing the alteration of Mancos shale by synthetic hydrofracturing fluid at hydrothermal conditions (90 °C). Both powdered shale and shale chips were investigated. Solid characterization was done using bulk and micro-X-ray diffraction (XRD, μXRD), and micro-X-ray Fluorescence mapping (µXRF). Analysis of the aqueous samples was done using ion chromatography (IC) for major anions and cations and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) - for trace metals. Our results indicate that calcium, barium, strontium , magnesium, manganese, silica, sodium, chloride and sulfate were released from Mancos shale after reaction with hydrofracturing fluid. Altered zones on shale surface after 2 months of reaction are thin – likely, within a few microns. The XRD patterns normalized to the 100% peak for quartz indicate that the dolomite, calcite, biotite, and kaolinite peaks decrease in intensity relative to the quartz peaks with increased alteration time, indicative of the partial dissolution of these minerals. Understanding mineralogical composition of an altered layer of Mancos shale will provide insight whether methane transport through these zones will be affected compared to the unaltered material.

            "abstract": "Sea level rise (SLR) is an increasingly important topic for many low-lying coastal areas such as South Florida. The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) projects that sea level change in South Florida, over the next 50 years, will increase between 0.1 and 0.6 meters. Given the low elevation and its shallow slope, the Everglades region is highly susceptible to changes in sea level. Based on the USACE SLR projections it seems inevitable that previously unexposed freshwater areas of the southern Everglades will become increasingly exposed to saline water. The effects of such saline water intrusion into the current C dynamics of the Everglades (particularly in terms of biogenic gas production and emissions, i.e. CH4 and CO2) is however uncertain. As previously proposed by others, increases in salinity in peat soils will result in dilation of pore spaces and thus increases in hydraulic conductivity, while limiting methanogenesis. However, increases in temperature may induce the opposite effect, particularly in terms of methanogenic activity. Previous studies investigating the effects of increased salinity on freshwater peat soils in the Everglades are very limited, and to our knowledge none have intended to monitor the internal gas dynamics within the peat matrix using an array of geophysical and hydrological methods such as ground penetrating radar (GPR), time-lapse photography, gas chromatography, and constant head permeameter tests. Preliminary laboratory results showed (1) a progressive decrease in gas content within the peat matrix (i.e. production) and gas releases once fluid conductivity is increased; (2) a progressive increase in hydraulic conductivity once fluid conductivity is increased; and (3) maximum gas releases detected during early stages of pore dilation (after increasing salinity) followed by a progressive decrease in gas release as salinity increased. This study has implications for better understanding how C dynamics in the Everglades may be affected by SLR.",

            "abstract": "Even though lakes cover only 2 % of the world’s land surface, it has been estimated that lakes release about 10 % of the carbon fixed annually by the terrestrial ecosystems back to the atmosphere. A critical parameter in the gas exchange estimates is the gas transfer velocity (k), which is governed by turbulence.\nThe aim of our study was to assess the current global CO2 evasion estimates from lakes to the atmosphere by comparing parameterizations for kand the significance of wind and heat flux to the gas transfer in small lakes. To improve future predictions of gas evasion from lakes, we focused on the changes in water clarity and how they affect water column physics and processes in the air-water interface. We studied a small boreal lake and used the eddy covariance (EC) method for the high precision data needed, and therefore also aimed to improve the EC methodology on lakes.\nThe air-water gas transfer was related to both wind and heat loss during times of seasonal stratification, but only to wind during autumn overturn. When wind-induced thermocline tilting and resulting spatial variability in surface water CO2 concentrations was accounted for, average k derived from the measurements dropped from 6.0 cm h-1 to 5.2 cm h-1. This was still over twice the estimate (2.2 cm h-1) calculated with a widely used model for kin lakes suggesting that the global estimates of gas evasion from lakes might be underestimations.\nWater clarity was a significant parameter defining the thermal stratification of the lake: a change from clear to dark water would lead to shorter stratification period and lower water column temperatures in small lakes and therefore have significant impact on the lake-atmosphere exchange processes.\nFigure 1.

These methods have been developed by researchers since the late 1980s, and now see significant interest from the seismic exploration industry.\nAs researchers move towards implementing advanced numerical modelling (e.g., 3D, multi-component, anisotropic and visco-elastic physics), it is desirable to make use of a modular approach, minimizing the effort developing a new set of tools for each new numerical problem. SimPEG (http://simpeg.xyz) is an open source project aimed at constructing a general framework to enable geophysical inversion in various domains. In this abstract we describe Zephyr (https://github.com/bsmithyman/zephyr), which is a coupled research project focused on parallel FWI in the seismic context. The software is built on top of Python, Numpy and IPython, which enables very flexible testing and implementation of new features.\nZephyr is an open source project, and is released freely to enable reproducible research. We currently implement a parallel, distributed seismic forward modelling approach that solves the 2.5D (two-and-one-half dimensional) viscoacoustic Helmholtz equation at a range modelling frequencies, generating forward solutions for a given source behaviour, and gradient solutions for a given set of observed data. Solutions are computed in a distributed manner on a set of heterogeneous workers. The researcher’s frontend computer may be separated from the worker cluster by a network link to enable full support for computation on remote clusters from individual workstations or laptops.\nThe present codebase introduces a numerical discretization equivalent to that used by FULLWV, a well-known seismic FWI research codebase. This makes it straightforward to compare results from Zephyr directly with FULLWV. The flexibility introduced by the use of a Python programming environment makes extension of the codebase with new methods much more straightforward. This enables comparison and integration of new efforts with existing results.",

In this region, hydrothermal vents are located along the Mariana Arc and back-arc spreading center. In particular hydrothermal vents are located near the summit of NW Rota-1, an active submarine volcano on the Mariana Arc which was erupting between 2003 through 2010 and ceased as of 2014. In late 2009, NW Rota-1 experienced a massive landslide decimating the habitat on the southern side of the volcano. This presented an enormous natural disturbance to the community. This project looked at zooplankton tow samples taken from the water column above NW Rota-1 in 2010, searching specifically for larvae which have the potential to recolonize the sea floor after such a major disturbance. We focused on samples for which profiles with a MAPR sensor indicated hydrothermal plumes in the water column. Samples were sorted in entirety into coarse taxa, and then larvae were removed for DNA barcoding. Overall zooplankton composition was dominated by copepods, ostracods, and chaetognaths, the majority of which are pelagic organisms. Comparatively few larvae of benthic invertebrates were found, but shrimp, gastropod, barnacle, and polychaete larvae did appear in low numbers in the samples. Species-level identification obtained via genetic barcoding will allow for these larvae to be matched to species known to inhabit the benthic communities at NW Rota-1. Identified larvae will give insight into the organisms which can re-colonize the seafloor vent communities after a disturbance such as the 2009 landslide. Communities at hydrothermal vents at other submarine volcanoes in the Monument also can act as sources for these planktonic, recolonizing larvae. As the microinvertebrate biodiversity in the Monument has yet to be fully characterized, our project also provides an opportunity to better describe both the zooplankton and benthic community composition in this area of the Monument.",

It is clear that the next generation of researchers must overcome these disciplinary biases and engage in more open dialogue with other disciplines and the management community in order to be better positioned to collaborate, speak a common language, and understand each other’s needs.\nThe U.S. Department of the Interior’s South Central Climate Science Center recently conducted a professional development workshop for 28 early-career researchers involved in climate-related research across the South-Central U.S. The participants consisted of graduate students, postdocs, and junior faculty representing 17 different natural and social science disciplines and seven Universities/Institutions. The workshop provided the participants with guidance and instruction on how to overcome the identified challenges in conducting “actionable” research and how to better navigate multi-institutional and multi- or inter-disciplinary research.\nThe workshop was comprised of: (1) a series of instructional presentations organized into themed sessions; (2) two keynote addresses to provide a broader perspective; (3) a real-world case study activity; (4) individual and group projects/presentations; and (5) field trips. In addition, we purposely created informal opportunities for participants to network, which met the goal of facilitating interdisciplinary interactions. An overview of the workshop experience will be provided, including a focus on those aspects leading to its ultimate success and recommendations for how to develop and implement a similar early-career workshop for your own purposes.",

            "abstract": "The presence of fractures play an essential role in different disciplines, including hydrogeology, geothermal and hydrocarbon industries, as fractures introduce new pathways for flow and transport in the host rocks. Understanding the physical properties of these planar features would reduce the uncertainty of the numerical models and enhance the reliability of their results. Among the fracture properties, orientation and spacing are relatively easily estimated via borehole logs, core images, and outcrops, whereas the fracture geometry (i.e. length, width, and height) is more difficult to investigate. As the fracture geometry controls the hydraulic and thermal behavior of the fracture network through the strong dependency of the fracture conductivity with fracture aperture, it is possible to estimate these geometrical properties indirectly through hydraulic and thermal tomography investigations.\nTo reach this goal, an innovative approach is introduced for discrete fracture network (DFN) characterization of heterogeneous fractured media via active thermal tracer testing. A synthetic DFN model is constructed based on the geological properties of an arbitrary fracture medium such as fracture orientation, length, spacing and persistency. Different realization are then constructed by considering all the above mentioned fracture properties except the length of fracture segments. Pressure and temperature fields are estimated inside the fracture network by means of an implicit upwind finite difference method, which is used to compute heat tracer travel times between injection and observation points and record the full temperature breakthrough curves at the monitoring points. A trans-dimensional inversion is then adopted to update the lengths fracture segment (add or remove) of the DFN model by comparison between proposed and observed travel times (Figure 1). The resulting assemble of the models can be used as an input geometry for deterministic simulations of fracture medium in the above mentioned disciplines. Moreover, the obtained ensemble improves stochastic flow and transport simulations by constraining the uncertainties in DFN characterization.\nFigure 1.

African fires account for roughly 50% of global fire carbon (C) fluxes, largely emitted into the atmosphere as CO2 and CO. Major savanna and grassland fire events during the OCO-2 era provide ideal case studies for testing current understanding of African fire C emissions. We use MOPITT CO to characterize the role of fire CO2 enhancements in OCO-2 CO2 measurements during September-October 2014. We constrain the combustion efficiency of southern Africa fires by retrieving CO2:CO total dry-column CO2 concentrations from OCO-2 and MOPITT total dry-column CO. We also performed a benchmark OSSE, based on the CMS-Flux atmospheric transport and chemistry analysis of CO2 and CO. We find that OCO-2 MOPITT CO2:CO (1:30) are almost a factor of 2 higher than the OSSE true and retrieved CO2:CO values (1:18 and 1:16). Our findings indicate that southern Africa fire CO2:CO values are higher than previously assumed. We hypothesize that the higher-than-expected CO2:CO values are due to fire fuel dryness and composition. We anticipate that CO2:CO observations will provide an important global constraint on the estimation and attribution of continental-scale CO2 fluxes and on the processes controlling fire C emission variability.",

More than 60% of effective seals for geologic hydrocarbon bearing formations as natural hydraulic barriers constitute of shale rocks. Wellbore cements provide zonal isolation as an engineered hydraulic barrier to ensure controlled fluid flow from the reservoir to the production facilities. Shale caprocks were deposited and formed by squeezing excess formation water and mineralogical transformations at different temperatures and pressures. In a similar process, wellbore cements are subjected to compression during expandable tubular operations, which lead to a rapid pore water propagation and secondary mineral precipitation within the cement. The focus of this research was to investigate the effect of wellbore cement compression on its microstructure and mechanical properties, as well as a preliminary comparison of shale caprocks and hydrated cement. The purpose of comparative evaluation of engineered vs natural hydraulic barrier materials is to further improve wellbore cement durability when in contact with geofluids.\nThe micro-indentation was utilized to evaluate the change in cement mechanical properties caused by compression. Indentation experiments showed an overall increase in hardness and Young’s modulus of compressed cement. Furthermore, SEM imaging and Electron Probe Microanalysis showed mineralogical alterations and decrease in porosity. These can be correlated with the cement rehydration caused by microstructure changes as a result of compression. The mechanical properties were also quantitatively compared to shale caprock samples in order to investigate the similarities of hydraulic barrier features that could help to improve the subsurface application of cement in zonal isolation. The comparison results showed that the poro-mechanical characteristics of wellbore cement appear to be improved when inherent pore sizes are shifted to predominantly nano-scale range as characteristic of pore-size distribution typical for shale rocks. The effect of compression on cement appears to petrophysically alter cement towards the properties of shale caprocks, although the process is achieved much faster than in the case of shale diagenesis over geological times.",

            "abstract": "The southern New England continental slope between Hudson and Veatch canyons, here referred to as the Southern New England Landslide Zone (SNELZ), has undergone intense modification by submarine landslide and other mass transport processes. The SNELZ is a morphologically complex region developed through multiple phases of failure covering more than 32,000 km2 from the uppermost headwalls at water depths of 500 m to the toes of the coalesced mass transport deposits (MTDs) at depths of about 4500 m. Using a suite of existing and newly acquired geophysical, geological, and observational data, we investigated the style, timing, and controls on the most recent phase of landslide activity across the most intensely failed segment of the SNELZ - Block Canyon to Alvin Canyon (BCAC). Within the BCAC segment, crosscutting translational evacuation zones spanning a > 1000 m vertical section of the slope have removed several hundred meters of the seaward dipping Quaternary stratigraphy. This removed material appears to have largely disintegrated during failure. While the step-bench morphology of the region suggested retrogressive processes, it is not clear that these processes acted contemporaneously across the region. Small-scale debris lobes linked to scalloped scarp morphologies show that episodic retrogressive degradation of the scarps that bound these evacuations zones has continued into the Holocene. Within the SNELZ-BCAC MTD accumulation zone where seafloor gradients are on the order of 0.5o, rotational failure and earthflow-like transport have remobilized pre-existing surficial MTDs. Radiocarbon dating, an age-constrained Globorotalia menardii first-appearance biostratigraphic datum, and oxygen isotope records from hemipelagic units overlying incompletely evacuated or transported MTDs within the BCAC evacuation and accumulation zones reveal that large landslide and other mass transport processes occurred prior to 7.4 ka with several occurring between 20-14 ka.",

This talk presents results from the third Demonstration Mission that occurred during the intense California drought of spring 2015, a snow year far worse than the previously worst snow year on record of 2014, and an overview of the various analyses that are finally available due to the uniqueness of the ASO data.\nIn 2015, ASO provided complete basin coverage for the Tuolumne, Merced, Lakes, Rush Creek, and Middle+South Forks of Kings River Basins in the California Sierra Nevada and the Upper Rio Grande, Conejos, and Uncompahgre Basins in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. ASO performed its first wintertime acquisitions in the Tuolumne Basin in response to water managers’ needs to quantify SWE volume in what was already realized as dire conditions.\nAnalyses show that with ASO data, river flows and reservoir inflows from the ASO acquisition date to 1 July can be estimated with uncertainties of less than 2%. These results provide enormous value in management operational flexibility for the diversity of needs, and provide strong scientific constraints on the physical processes controlling snowmelt runoff. Snowmelt runoff models are markedly better constrained due to the now accurate knowledge of the distribution of snow water equivalent.\nWith the ASO high-resolution spectrometer and lidar data for a snow-free acquisition, we can determine surface classifications, vegetation heights, and river networks. These data allow runoff models to be accurately and rapidly developed with unprecedented accuracy. These data are now being used to constrain models of varying complexity.\nFinally, we discuss the path forward on expanding ASO to cover the entire Sierra Nevada and the Upper Colorado River Basin. Such a plan will facilitate vast improvements in water science, water management, forest management, and extension to atmospheric sciences, carbon and ecosystem science.",

Five years after the EMC event, a dense network of GPS stations in southern California and a sparse array of sites installed after the earthquake in northern Mexico measure ongoing surface deformation as coseismic stresses relax. We use 3D finite element models of seismically inferred crustal and mantle structure with earthquake slip constrained by GPS, InSAR range change and SAR and SPOT image sub-pixel offset measurements to infer the rheologic structure of the region. Model complexity, including 3D Moho structure and distinct geologic regions such as the Peninsular Ranges and Salton Trough, enable us to explore vertical and lateral heterogeneities of crustal and mantle rheology. We find that postseismic displacements can be explained by relaxation of a laterally varying, stratified rheologic structure controlled by temperature and crustal thickness. In the Salton Trough region, particularly large postseismic displacements require a relatively weak mantle column that weakens with depth, consistent with a strong but thin (22 km thick) crust and high regional temperatures. In contrast, beneath the neighboring Peninsular Ranges a strong, thick (up to 35 km) crust and cooler temperatures lead to a rheologically stronger mantle column. Thus, we find that the inferred rheologic structure corresponds with observed seismic structure and thermal variations. Significant afterslip is not required to explain postseismic displacements, but cannot be ruled out. Combined with isochemical phase diagrams, our results enable us to go beyond rheologic structure and infer some basic properties about the regional mantle, including composition, water content, and the degree of partial melting.",

            "abstract": "The tropical wetlands of East Africa represent hotspots of carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) exchange the dynamics of which vary across the site, landscape and regional scale. The wetlands of the Nile headwaters including Lake Victoria, the world’s largest tropical lake, are dominated by the emergent macrophyte sedge Cyperus papyrus L. (papyrus), which under favourable environmental conditions has been shown to exhibit high rates of photosynthetic carbon dioxide assimilation (≥40 µmol CO2 m-2 s-1); high rates of net primary productivity (≥50 g DM m-2 d-1); and the accumulation of significant peat deposits resulting in carbon stocks (≥640 t C ha-1) that exceed similar estimates from tropical rainforests, often considered to be the primary land based reserve of carbon. However, while these wetlands represent significant carbon pools, they are inherently “leaky” systems due to the lateral loss of particulate and dissolved carbon and this has implications for riverine carbon and GHG emissions which have been shown to increase with wetland extent and upland biomass. This paper utilises a range of empirical and published information to report on the eco-physiological controls on carbon, water and GHG exchange in papyrus dominated wetlands and considers the contribution of these highly productive wetlands to the GHG dynamics of the inland waters of East Africa, and in particular the Lake Victoria basin and the headwaters of the river Nile.",

            "abstract": "The Earth's permeable near-surface layer from bedrock to canopy is referred to as the Critical Zone (CZ). Integration of bio- and geoscience data is critical for understanding physical, biological and chemical interactions in the CZ. Genomic and meta-genomic scientists study organisms both in laboratory settings and in the environment, in order to understand the interactions of organisms with the environment. Geoscientists are using environmental data to describe and model dynamics of physical and chemical properties. Yet, there is no agreed upon method for integrating genomic and environmental data to address interactions of living and non-living components of the CZ. There are standards for data interchange being developed in the geosciences and genomics sciences, via standards organization such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), as well as by research communities in biogeochemistry, hydrology, climatology, and other fields. These are in parallel to, but typically not in coordination with the standards the Genomics Standards Consortium (GSC) is developing for genomics. In addition, efforts are being made to allow for intercompatability of these CZ data with data generated by NEON, Inc. The interoperability of these types of data is limited with current software and cyberinfrastructure. A group of CZ geoscientists, environmental genomic scientists and cyberinfrastructure scientists are coming together to develop a set of common data collection and integration methods and sets of common standards. The data generated by this effort across multiple CZ sites (including the US CZ Observatories, or CZOs) around the world, along with NEON facility data, will be used to test EarthCube (an NSF initiative to develop cyberinfrastructure for the geosciences) cyberinfrastructure, with the goal of bridging this gap in standards and interoperability. Potential solutions to these issues of interoperability will be presented, and a way forward will be described.",

The region between 30°-40° northern latitudes and 36°-48° eastern longitudes has been selected as a study area covering the Euphrates - Tigris basin. TWS maps were produced with (i) monthly temporal and 400 km spatial resolution, based on monthly mean global spherical harmonic gravity field models of GRACE satellite mission (L2), and with (ii) monthly and semi-monthly temporal and spatial resolution as fine as 200 km based on GRACE in-situ observations (L1B).\nDecreasing trend of water mass anomalies from the year 2003 to 2013 is proved by aforesaid approaches.

            "abstract": "The Miocene Torres del Paine intrusive complex (TPIC) in Patagonia is a transitional alkaline backarc intrusion1 emplaced on short timescales of 162 ± 11 ka2. It is subdivided into two units with distinct ages of ~12.6 Ma and ~12.45 Ma1. Smaller intrusive bodies in the area record a change in chemistry from calc-alkaline at ~16 Ma, to transitional alkaline at ~12.5 Ma.\nZircons from ~16 Ma intrusives and the 12.6 Ma part of the TPIC have remarkably consistent, slightly enriched Hf isotope compositions with εHf(i) of –1 to +2. An abrupt shift towards more juvenile Hf isotope compositions is observed in the ~12.45 Ma part of the TPIC, with εHf(i) of +3 to +6. Bulk rock Nd and Sr isotopes for the TPIC show the same shift towards more juvenile compositions at this time1. The long-term consistency of εHf(i) from 16 to 12.6 Ma is surprising, given that in the same period the bulk rock chemistry changes from calc-alkaline to transitional alkaline. Conversely, the major shift in εHf(i) is not correlated with any change in bulk rock chemistry, which remains transitional alkaline from 12.6 to 12.45 Ma.\nThe decoupling of major element chemical evolution and Hf isotope signatures suggests that the subsequent rapid influx of juvenile material recorded by our Hf isotope data must have occurred by renewed mantle melting. Subduction of the Chile ridge at ~12.5 Ma in this area caused arc magmatism to move westwards and back-arc extension to initiate. We propose that the first TPIC magmas (12.6 Ma) came from a mantle wedge with a residual subduction signature. Subsequent melting of more juvenile mantle, less contaminated by a subduction component, generated the 12.45 Ma TPIC magmas. These results demonstrate that magmatic complexes such as the TPIC may tap distinct mantle sources even on very short timescales, fingerprinting arc–backarc transition processes.\n1Leuthold et al., 2013, JPET, 54: 273–303\n2Leuthold et al., 2012, EPSL, 325: 85–92",

A new method was proposed in the study to combine the diameter distributions derived from the area-based approach (ABA) and the diameter distribution derived from the individual tree detection (ITD) in order to obtain more accurate forest stand attributes. Since dominant trees can be reliably detected and measured by the Lidar data via the ITD, the focus of the study is to retrieve the suppressed trees (trees that were missed by the ITD) from the ABA. Replacement and histogram matching were respectively employed at the plot level to retrieve the suppressed trees. Cut point was detected from the ITD-derived diameter distribution for each sample plot to distinguish dominant trees from the suppressed trees. The results showed that calibrated diameter distributions were more accurate in terms of error index and the entire growing stock estimates. Compared with the best performer between the ABA and the ITD, calibrated diameter distributions decreased the relative RMSE of the estimated entire growing stock, saw log and pulpwood fractions by 2.81%, 3.05% and 7.73% points respectively. Calibration improved the estimation of pulpwood fraction significantly, resulting in a negligible bias of the estimated entire growing stock.",

Reconstructions at the object or plot scale can be used to interpret or simulate satellite observations, particularly for lidar instruments such as those involved in the forthcoming GEDI and ICESat 2 missions.\nThe Compact Biomass Lidar (CBL) is a TLS optimized for portability and scanning speed, developed and operated by University of Massachusetts Boston. This 905nm wavelength scanner achieves an angular resolution of 0.25 degrees at a rate of 33 seconds per scan. The rapid scanning of the CBL and similar highly portable TLS improve acquisition of 3D surfaces such as canopy height models and digital elevation models derived from point clouds. This is due to the ability to capture additional scanning points within the window of temporal stability for the ecosystem, mitigating the rapid loss of information density associated with distance and occlusion. Utilizing terrestrial lidar in tandem with airborne lidar profiles vertically distributed structural components of ecosystems, such as the canopy of forests.\nWe will present 3D surfaces documenting the growth of vegetation species including the invasive Phragmites australis over the 2015 growing season at Plum Island Long Term Ecological Research sites, derived from CBL. Additionally we will show vertical structure profiles from voxelization analyses in tropical forest (La Selva, Costa Rica) and temperate forest (Harvard Forest, MA, USA). We will discuss and present results from emerging point cloud reconstruction methods, including the Quantitative Structure Model (QSM) for tree modeling, and their implications particularly for GEDI-related calibration and validation studies.",

            "abstract": "The hydroxyl (OH) radicals plays an important role in the chemistry of the atmosphere. OH radical reactions initiate the oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which can lead to the production of ozone and secondary organic aerosols in the atmosphere. In addition, reactions of OH radicals controls the lifetime of methane and other greenhouse gases that affect the radiative balance of the atmosphere. Previous measurements of total hydroxyl radical reactivity in forest environments have found discrepancies between measured values and those calculated from collocated measurements of biogenic VOC (BVOC) concentrations. Additional measurements of total OH reactivity together with measurements of BVOCs are needed to understand the source of this missing reactivity and to further constrain atmospheric chemistry models.\nTotal hydroxyl radical (OH) reactivity was measured using a turbulent flow reactor were made during summer 2015 as part of the Indiana Radical, Reactivity and Ozone Production Intercomparison (IRRONIC). This campaign took place in a forested area at the Indiana Research and Teaching Preserve (IURTP) near the Bloomington campus characterized by high mixing ratios of isoprene and low mixing ratios of NOx. Measurements of a suite of VOCs and oxygenated VOCs was also conducted at the site, allowing a comparison of the observed reactivity with the expected OH reactivity from these measurements.",

Observations from a suite of platforms (e.g., ship, mooring, glider) were used to document this anomalous warming. Positive heat content anomalies approaching 109 Joules occurred at a number of locations along the coast for much of the latter half of 2014. Spatially, the warming manifested itself strongly in the two leading modes of variability in the heat content in the extra-tropical eastern Pacific. One mode represents the coastal warming from late 2014 to early 2015, while the other mode resembles the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) peaking from late 2013 to early 2014. Lagged correlations between the mooring temperature in Monterey Bay and satellite sea surface height suggest that the coastal warming was associated with the warming over a much larger region in the northeast Pacific Ocean probably due to anomalous atmospheric heating. Impacts of this U.S. west coastal warming on the marine ecosystem and seabird will be described.",

            "abstract": "The outer solar system provides potential habitats for extra-terrestrial life. Previous spacecraft’s and telescopic observations support that the Jovian icy moons may harbor water oceans beneath the icy crusts. However evidence for oceans is not definitive and awaits confirmation measurements. Also their depth and composition remain unclear, as do their stability and variability with time.\nHere we focus on Ganymede, the primary target of the Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE). To investigate the lifetime of an ocean (thickness change through time), we perform numerical simulations for the internal thermal evolution using a one-dimensional spherically symmetric model for the convective and conductive heat transfer, with radial dependences of viscosity, heat source distribution, and other material properties. We assume an initially entirely liquid H2O layer which is an end-member case, and take into account the energy production due to decay of long-lived radioactive elements and also evaluate the effect of tidal heating. To see the temporal change of the boundary position between solid ice layers including ice shell and high-pressure ice mantle, we also evaluate the energy balance at the phase boundaries between the solid and liquid H2O layer, and the movements of the positions of these boundaries are calculated by evaluating the heat balance between incoming and outgoing flux at the boundaries considering with latent heat (classically known as a Stefan problem).\nIn addition, the existence of a subsurface ocean and internal rheological structure (essentially based on thermal structure) would determine Ganymede’s tidal response. JUICE mission,measurements of tidal deformation of Ganymede using laser altimetry will provide key information about its interior. We investigate the parameter dependence (e.g., elastic/rheological properties of ice and depth/thickness of the ocean, etc.) of Ganymede’s tidal response, adopting a depth-dependent viscosity prole assuming a conductive ice shell, and discuss the possibility for GALA measurements to distinguish such parameter differences in tidal amplitude.",

We provide maps of aerosol episodes using daily snapshots of PM2.5 and its changing features despite numerous difficulties inherent to sampling the region, with special focus on the DISCOVER-AQ period, Jan-Feb 2013, which had many supporting measurements. Both high pollution and retrieval difficulties tend to occur in many Mediterranean agricultural regions. One difficulty is the relatively bright surfaces with considerable exposed soil. NASA’s MAIAC and MODIS Deep Blue retrieval techniques are shown to have considerable skill even at low aerosol optical thickness (AOT) values, as evaluated by concurrent AERONET sunphotometer measurements. More significantly, these AOT values can correspond to high daytime PM2.5 since aerosol mixed layer depth is thin and variable, 200m – 600 m. The thin layers derive from typical subsidence of dry air between more stormy periods. This situation provides an advantage: water vapor column is also almost completely limited to a similar mixed layer depth, and can thus serve as a measure of aerosol dilution. The ratio of AOT to column-water-vapor from MODIS products provides two advantages: (1) it can provide a measure related to particle density, via a mixed-layer proxy, and (2) it can ratio out some errors that crop up in the retrieval of very low AOT, e.g. bidirectional reflectance and other angular dependences. These effects are combined, so we disentangle them using AERONET data. Data from the NASA Langley HSRL-2 lidar and in-situ measurements from DISCOVER-AQ are also helpful. At the time of abstract submission, sporadic errors in the column water estimates provide the greatest limitation.\nLooking to the near future, we suggest why the use of geostationary TEMPO data will allow multiple sampling opportunities per day, supplementary or alternative information for AOT, aerosol absorption, and even column water.",

Rapid evolution of severe weather events highlights the need for high-resolution mesoscale wind observations. Yet mesoscale observations of severe weather dynamics are quite rare, especially over the ocean where extratropical and tropical cyclones (ETCs and TCs) can undergo explosive development. Measuring wind velocity at the mesoscale from space remains a great challenge, but is critically needed to understand and improve prediction of severe weather and tropical cyclones. Based on compact, visible/IR imagers and a mature stereoscopic technique, C3Winds has the capability to measure high-resolution (~2 km) cloud motion vectors and cloud geometric heights accurately by tracking cloud features from two formation-flying CubeSats, separated by 5-15 minutes. Complementary to lidar wind measurements from space, C3Winds will provide high-resolution wind fields needed for detailed investigations of severe wind events in occluded ETCs, rotational structures inside TC eyewalls, and ozone injections associated with tropopause folding events. Built upon mature imaging technologies and long history of stereoscopic remote sensing, C3Winds provides an innovative, cost-effective solution to global wind observations with the potential for increased diurnal sampling via CubeSat constellation.",

            "abstract": "Barrier island and estuarine habitats act as natural buffers to wave energy and reduce erosion of mainland coasts; however, estuarine wetlands are under increasing threat from shoreline destabilization and erosion due to rising sea level and storms. Currently, the USGS National Assessment of Coastal Change Hazards estimates the vulnerability of shorelines to hurricane erosion hazards by combining physical parameters of dune, beach, and shoreline morphology with storm hydrodynamic predictions. These hazard assessments are limited to ocean-side sandy beaches. However, with the increasing availability of water-penetrating lidar and vegetation filtering algorithms, as well as estuarine wave and hydrodynamic modeling, extending physical process analyses and risk assessments to estuarine and back-barrier shorelines is possible. In this study, we investigate the relationship between shoreline type, sediment supply rate, long-term erosion rates, and shoreline geophysical features. We focus on long-term changes, such as those associated with barrier island landward migration, which is dominated by the processes of storm overwash and sea-level rise. This migration means that the long-term changes in estuarine and ocean-facing shorelines can be correlated. We focus on understanding these correlations with estuarine drivers of wetland shoreline erosion and accretion, such as waves, sediment supply, and shoreline features. Quantitatively assessing the variance of estuarine shoreline behavior relative to oceanic shorelines will improve knowledge of estuarine shoreline susceptibility to storm-induced erosion, help fine-tune estimates of future forecasts of coastal change, and provide an initial framework for estimating erosion hazards along sheltered coasts.",

There are chemicals that are emitted from surfaces or point sources inside the home which are harmful to humans; these chemicals come from various objects including furniture, cleaning supplies, building materials, gas stoves, and the surrounding environment. The use of proper ventilation to cycle cleaner outdoor air into the house can be crucial for maintaining healthy living conditions in the home. At the same time, there can also be outdoor pollutants which infiltrate the house and contribute to poor indoor air quality. In either case, it is important to determine infiltration rates as a function of outdoor weather conditions, the house structure properties and indoor heating and cooling systems.\nIn this work, the objective is to measure ventilation rates using periodic releases of a tracer gas and measuring how quickly the tracer concentration decays. CO2 will be used as the tracer gas because it is inert and harmless at low levels. An Arduino timer is connected to a release valve which controls the release of 9.00 SLPM of CO2 into the uptake vent within the test home. CO2 will be released until there is at least a 200 to 300 ppm increase above ambient indoor levels. Computers with CO2 sensors and temperature/pressure sensors attached will be used to record data from different locations within the home which will continuously record data up to a week. The results from these periodic ventilation measurements will be analyzed with respect to outdoor wind and temperature conditions and house structure properties. The data will be used to evaluate an established indoor air quality model.",

In addition to strategic deployment of GNSS-capable hardware, the Southwest region is currently developing an agreement with Caltrans to augment the network with GNSS systems at about a dozen stations. The upgrades will consist of a number of Caltrans-provided GLONASS-ready receivers and project is scheduled for completion by early 2016.\nThe Southwest Region has continued to upgrade and build new radio networks to improve dependability, monitoring, and data download rates (including transfers of high-rate data). Here, we highlight one such network near Hollister, CA, which eliminated several cellular modems and improved reliability.\nUNAVCO and Scripps have been working in collaboration to augment a subset of GPS stations with low-cost strong-motion sensors for use in Earthquake Early Warning systems.

In a 3D system, however, the stochastic magnetic field enables the energetic electrons to access volume-filling acceleration regions and therefore gain energy much more efficiently than in the 2D system. We also examine the relative roles of two important acceleration drivers: parallel electric fields and a Fermi mechanism associated with reflection of charged particles from contracting field lines. We find that parallel electric fields are most important for accelerating low energy particles, whereas Fermi reflection dominates energetic particle production. We also find that proton energization is reduced in the 3D system.",

Two kinds of vertical distribution functions were investigated in the AOD retrieval, which are exponential and Gaussian function, applied in MODIS AOD C6 algorithm and in our algorithm, respectively. The Gaussian function is with a mean height μ and the layer thickness σ with a fixed value of 0.5, where the mean height is extracted from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO).\nThe results show that the AOD retrieval is not sensitive to distribution functions (Gaussian and exponential function) used, but sensitive to the aerosol layer mean height. Small difference (< 1%) was found in the AOD retrieval when different distribution function (exponential or Gaussian function) used. The difference in the AOD retrieval caused by the aerosol layer mean height can be up to 13%, and this becomes more obvious under a relatively heavy aerosol loading (AOD > 1.0).\nIt suggests that a fixed function (specifically a fixed mean height) is not suitable for the AOD retrieval with MODIS data under > 1.0. The mean height of aerosol layer derived from CALIPSO is expected to be taken into account for MODIS AOD retrieval in the near future.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic Ocean interior is warming, and there is no indication that the rate of warming will decrease in the near future. The relative role of the interior ocean’s warmth in setting net energy flux to, and the mass balance of, Arctic sea ice, however, is still under debate. Thus, quantifying this flux and understanding mechanisms for redistributing heat in the ocean interior are of particular importance. Warm (>0°C) intermediate-depth (150–900m) water of Atlantic origin (the so-called Atlantic Water, AW) is the major source of heat for the ocean interior. Ice thickness along the continental slope east of Svalbard is much less than that expected of first-year ice, suggesting that AW has a direct impact on sea ice just after entering the Arctic. However, in the Canadian Basin, far away from Fram Strait, overlying fresher and colder stable layers effectively insulate the upper mixed layer and ice from impacts of the AW heat. Even though the eastern Eurasian Basin (EEB) is separated from Fram Strait by hundreds of kilometers, the AW heat finds its ways for reaching the ice base in this part of the Arctic Ocean. A distinct process, double diffusion convection, plays an important role in vertical redistribution of AW heat in this region. Double diffusion convection is typically identified as a vertical sequence of almost-homogeneous convective layers separated by high-gradient interfaces, forming a double diffusive \"staircase\". The staircase structure is a consequence of the differing molecular diffusivities of heat and salt; surprisingly, even though molecular properties drive the instability, resulting net fluxes can be very large, up to several W/m2. The interaction of shear and diffusive layering can significantly alter the heat (and momentum) flux through a staircase. The existing data set are limited and further detailed process studies in the EEB targeting the unique mechanisms of oceanic heat exchange in the interior of the EEB are required.",

The reciprocity analysis is conducted with the heterogeneous hydrogeological parameters distributions of the site. The mathematical theory of reciprocity implies that choose one as stimulation point and the other as observed response point in two known points at the same random field. Repeat the above action, the response behavior should have the reciprocity between the two points. However, the lack of literature with the in-situ experiment to prove that reciprocity principle. Therefore, this study is expected to investigate the reciprocity of drawdown with the sequential pumping test which will have heterogeneous hydrogeological parameters distributions obtained by inverse method. In general, there are two ways to investigate the reciprocity of pumping tests of two sequential wells. One way is to evaluate the drawdown reciprocity of two sequential wells. From the evaluation the reciprocity of the drawdown behavior during the sequential pumping wells, the reciprocity of the drawdown behavior is investigated. The other one is to estimate cross-correlation between the drawdown behavior of the sequential pumping wells and heterogeneous hydrogeological parameters distributions. The reciprocity of between the drawdown and the heterogeneous parameters distributions is therefore can be investigated. This study proved the reciprocity of drawdown with the sequential pumping test and heterogeneous hydrogeological parameters distributions obtained by inverse method.

The region is formed as the weak planetary magnetic field stands against the intense solar wind in the close proximity of the Sun. Various prediction had been given by noting the difference in the parameters from the well-studied terrestiral magnetosphere of a similar setting and scaling the well-knowns to the Hermean environment. MESSENGER results, however, show a wide varieity of phenomena that are out of the scope of what one could have reasonably argued. The micro-magnetosphere of Mercury is much more dynamic than one had predicted. BepiColombo MMO, the JAXA spacecraft of the BepiColombo Mercury exploration mission, is equipped to study the space environment of the planet Mercury. Being a spinning spacecraft, BepiColombo MMO has much less constraint for plasma observations and is expected to extract essential elements of space plasma physics that become visible in the Hermean environment. Here we review MESSENGER results and how MMO will contribute to deepen our understanding of space plasmas by addressing the puzzles raised by MESSEGNER.",

We began detailed field studies of channel geomorphic change using RTK-GPS in two 15 km2 watersheds following the 2012 High Park Fire; the watersheds were then subjected to a several-hundred year flood in September 2013. During this time a series of airborne LiDAR datasets were collected, and the objectives of this study were to: 1) determine and compare the spatial variability in channel and valley erosion and deposition over time from the LiDAR; and 2) determine if the observed changes can be predicted from channel and valley bottom characteristics. Data quality issues in the initial LiDAR required us to rotate and translate flight lines in order to co-register ground-classified point clouds between successive datasets; uncertainty was then estimated using our RTK-GPS field measurements. Topographic changes were calculated using the Multiscale Model to Model Cloud Comparison (M3C2) algorithm. Results indicate that the 2013 flood mobilized much more sediment than was mobilized due to the fire alone; unfortunately the uncertainty in differencing is still frequently greater than the observed changes, especially within transfer reaches. Valley expansion and constriction are major controls on spatial patterns of erosion and deposition, suggesting that topographic metrics such as longitudinal distributions of channel slope and valley confinement may provide quasi-physically based estimates of sediment deposition and delivery potential.",

Extensive sonic anemometer measurements from horizontal networks and vertical towers ranging from 12 to 20 m height were collected from three field programs in moderately sloped terrain with a varying degree of surface heterogeneity, namely the Shallow Cold Pool (SCP) and the Flow Over Snow Surfaces (FLOSS) II experiments in Colorado (USA), and the Advanced Canopy Resolution Experiment (ARCFLO) in Oregon (USA). The relationship of the friction velocity to the stratification and small non-stationary submeso motions is studied from several points of view and nominally quantified. The relationship of the turbulence to the stratification is less systematic than expected due to the important submeso-scale motions. Consequently, the roles of the wind speed and stratification are not adequately accommodated by a single non-dimensional combination, such as the bulk Richardson number. Howver, cause and effect relationships are difficult to isolate because the non-stationary momentum flux significantly modifies the profile of the non-stationary mean flow. The link between the turbulence and accelerations at the surface is examined in terms of the changing vertical structure of the wind profile and sudden increases of downward transport of momentum. The latter may be significant in explaining the small-scale weak turbulence during stable stratification and deviations from conventional flux-profile relationships.",

Using aircraft emissions inventories for 2008, we then calculate annual economic damages from lead as lifetime employment losses for a one-year cohort exposed to elevated atmospheric lead concentrations using a range of concentration response functions from literature. Mean and median estimates of annual damages attributable to lifetime lost earnings are $1.06 and $0.60 billion respectively. Economy-wide impacts of IQ-deficits on productivity and labor increase expected damages by 54%. Damages are sensitive to background lead concentrations; as emissions decrease from other sources, the damages attributable to aviation are expected to increase holding aviation emissions constant.

Near the stagnation point of the electron inflows, which is located in the magnetospheric side in the diffusion region, electron distribution functions show two populations: A crescent-shaped component in the vy-vz plane (y is the out-of-plane direction, and z is the inflow direction), and the magnetospheric component that has been accelerated in the direction parallel to the magnetic field. Particle tracing in a PIC simulation shows that a population of electrons from the magnetosheath travels along crescent-shaped orbits in the velocity space during meandering motion across the neutral line. Those electrons are mainly accelerated by the in-plane electric field Ez, which is strong only in the magnetospheric side and plays a more significant role to energize electrons than the reconnection electric field. We theoretically predict the shape of the distribution functions near the stagnation point. The crescent-shaped distribution is formed because only a part of electrons from the magnetosheath can access a particular location in the magnetospheric side of the X-line. The penetration length of magnetosheath electrons into the magnetosphere is analytically derived. Theoretical predictions on the distribution shape and the penetration length agree well with simulation results. The crescent-shaped electron distributions are expected to be observed in dayside magnetopause reconnection by satellites, such as the NASA Magnetospheric Multi-scale (MMS) mission.

We have demonstrated the ability to accurately measure key greenhouse and pollutant gasses with low cost solar observations using the breakthrough sensor technology called the “Pupil Imaging Gas Correlation”, PIGC™, which provides size and complexity reduction while providing exceptional resolution and coverage for various gas sensing applications. It is a practical implementation of the well-known Gas Filter Correlation Radiometry (GFCR) technique used for the HALOE and MOPITT satellite instruments that were flown on successful NASA missions in the early 2000s. This strong space heritage brings performance and reliability to the ground instrument design.\nA methane (CH4) abundance sensitivity of 0.5% or better of ambient column with uncooled microbolometers has been demonstrated with 1 second direct solar observations. These under $10 k sensors can be deployed in precisely balanced autonomous grids to monitor the flow of chosen gasses, and infer their source locations. Measureable gases include CH4, 13CO2, N2O, NO, NH3, CO, H2S, HCN, HCl, HF, HDO and others.\nA single instrument operates in a dual operation mode, at no additional cost, for continuous (real-time 24/7) local area perimeter monitoring for the detection of leaks for safety & security needs, looking at an artificial light source (for example a simple 60 W light bulb placed 100 m away), while simultaneously allowing solar observation for quasi-continuous wide area total atmospheric column scanning (3-D) for environmental monitoring (fixed and mobile configurations). The second mode of operation continuously quantifies the concentration and flux of specific gases over different ground locations, determined the amount of targeted gas being released from the area or getting into the area from outside locations, allowing better tracking of plumes and identification of sources.\nThis paper reviews the measurement technique, performance demonstration and grid deployment strategy.",

EMFISIS data show that plasmaspheric hiss waves can be observed at frequencies as low as 20 Hz and provide three-component magnetic field measurements that can be directly used for electron scattering calculations. Updated models of hiss wave intensity and spectral distribution based on statistical analysis of Van Allen Probes data were recently developed. We use these new models to compute and parameterize the lifetime of electrons as a function of kinetic energy, L-shell, Kp-index, and MLT. We perform and present detailed analysis of how the more accurate models of the wave intensity and frequency distribution change the resulting electron lifetimes. We also compare the obtained results with the previous lifetime model of Orlova et al. [GRL, 2014], which was based on single component electric field measurements from the sweep frequency receiver (SFR) onboard the CRRES satellite.",

            "abstract": "The classical Galloway diagram captures qualitatively the dramatic effect waves and tides have on reshaping river deltas. Here we investigate these controls in a series of laboratory experiments in which the relative energetics of river, wave, and tidal forcing could be controlled and systematically varied. The delta is fed from a single source of water and low-density, sand-size sediment in one corner of a 5m x 5m basin. Experimental tides are produced by transferring water back and forth between the main experimental basin and an auxiliary holding basin. The tidal period is 60 s and a typical tidal range is 30 mm. Waves are produced using a floating, oscillating paddle placed opposite the sediment feed location. They typically have a period of 1 s and an amplitude of 10 mm. The total energy flux associated with waves and tides is controlled by varying the temporal intermittency of each process, while river energy and sediment fluxes are held steady. The experiments show a variation in delta morphology as a function of wave and tidal forcing that parallels that observed in the field: increasing wave strength redistributes sediment and flattens the shoreline; increasing tidal strength creates well defined tidal channels as well as inlets through the wave-worked shoreline. Both waves and tides reduce the mobility of the main fluvial channel. Quantitative morphologic measures of these effects vary systematically as a function of dimensionless relative wave and tidal strength. The image below shows typical experimental delta morphology associated with mixed wave-tide forcing.",

Historical observations have linked bloom activity to anomalously warm conditions with weak and sporadic upwelling. In particular, blooms appear to be associated with El Niño conditions. Monterey, as with much of the US west coast, experienced unusual warm conditions in spring and summer 2014, leading to multiple ecosystem effects including massive algal blooms, concentration of apex predators nearshore, and unusually high levels of domoic acid. As the warm anomalies continued and strengthened into 2015, Monterey (and much of the west coast) has been experiencing the largest and most toxic algal bloom recorded in the last 15 years, as well as unprecedented coccolithophore blooms associated with warm, nutrient-depleted waters. With the strengthening El Niño conditions developing in summer 2015, it is possible that 2016 will result in a third consecutive year of unusually toxic algal blooms. Using a combination of historical observations, intensive field studies, and predictive models we explore the hypothesis that these warm anomalies lead to shifts in the typical upwelling-dominated food web leading to a collapse of the ecosystem towards the coast, unusual algal blooms, and enhanced trophic transfer of toxins, resulting in magnified negative impacts to wildlife and, potentially, humans.",

            "abstract": "Drought-induced agricultural loss is one of the leading weather-related harms to the U.S. economy, but little is known about the effects of extreme droughts or of consecutive multi-year drought events on agriculture. Three droughts in the early 1930s make the Dust Bowl era the driest and hottest for agriculture in modern U.S. history and a useful analog to study extreme weather and its impact on human society. Improvements in technology and farm management over the last eight decades have dramatically increased average crop yields in the U.S., but the elimination of most non-climatic crop stresses means rainfed yields are now more tightly linked to climate. To understand how a 1930s-type drought would affect agriculture in the modern U.S., we drive empirical and biophysical process-based crop models with 1930s weather -- with and without increases in mean temperature -- to estimate effects of successive droughts on current and near-future U.S. maize, soy and wheat production. Our results suggest that Dust-Bowl-type droughts today would have unprecedented consequences for agricultural productivity, with single-year losses up to ~50% larger than the central U.S. drought of 2012, one of the most severe for modern agriculture. Sensitivity tests imply that damages at these extremes are highly sensitive to temperature. If extreme drought conditions are even modestly warmer (1-4 oC), single-year losses jump to more than twice the 2012 drought. Assuming that repeated crop failure over a relatively short period is likely to induce changes to land-use and management, we find that a future Dust-Bowl-like drought, especially under higher temperature scenarios, could lead to significant long-term consequences for U.S. agriculture. Changes in climate may increase the severity and frequency of future droughts, so understanding the complex interactions of weather extremes and a changing agricultural system is critical to effective preparation and response if and when the next Dust Bowl strikes.",

We report on progress towards establishing a history of water column structure and air-sea interaction of this critical part of the global climate system. Sites proposed and now approved for future drilling by IODP Exp. 363 were surveyed with 2D high-resolution multi-channel seismic grids during cruise 1313 of the R/V Roger Revelle in September 2013. Here we describe observations at proposed site WP2 on the northern Eauripik Rise, near the northern limb of the WPWP. Approximately 400 m of buried sediment waves, with amplitudes of 10-20 m and wavelengths of 1-2 km, are prevalent throughout the ~ 10 x 15 km survey grid. Abyssal sediment waves provide direct evidence of circulation in the deep sea, and can be tied to indirect circulation indicators in sediment cores. Additionally, changes in circulation indicated by changes in bedform geometry can be associated with climatic oscillations. The sediment waves were mapped, characterized, and converted to depth using seismic stacking velocities. Biostratigraphy at DSDP Site 62, 450 km south of WP2 on Eauripik Rise provided age constraints on several horizons correlated between these locations. The oldest waves at WP2 (~ 15 Ma; 400 mbsf) migrate north and increase in amplitude upsection until a key horizon at roughly 280 mbsf is reached. At this level wave migration stops, though wave heights continue to decrease until at seafloor all seismic evidence of current-controlled deposition has disappeared. This morphologic shift, suggested from available data to occur ~10 Ma, indicates a change from strong, long-term current-controlled sedimentation to conditions with little to no bottom current flow. Drilling at WP2 will pinpoint the time of this change and will aid the understanding of the evolution of the WPWP since the middle Miocene, in particular the changes in deep Pacific circulation at the northern limb of the WPWP, with applications to global climate changes.",

Understanding this response is limited by our ability to measure and model across scales. Here, we apply fully-integrated models (that span the subsurface through the land surface) across a range of different landscape scales to study the impacts of land cover change on the hydrologic cycle in important Rocky Mountain headwater systems. These models also provide a controlled method to synthesize field observations of hydrochemical properties. Analysis of hillslope outflow partitioning from groundwater and precipitation sources indicates that topography and precipitation can drive mixed signatures in groundwater inputs over prolonged periods. Watershed-scale models confirm that competition between offsetting processes at the hillslope (such as increases in evaporation and decreases in transpiration with tree death) and heterogeneous watershed properties effectively mute changes in water yield. Both hillslope and watershed models identify the importance of subsurface flow and storage changes, indicating that soil and groundwater may play an important role in the propagation of the hydrologic response to land cover change. Accordingly, regional models are used to examine changes in longer subsurface flow paths. Alterations to water sources and pathways may explain observed changes in water quality that are not expected if only the minimal detectable change in discharge is considered. This work, and its usefulness in interpreting field observations, provides additional mechanistic insight into hydrologic response from spatially and temporally variable land-cover perturbations.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU Poster.pdf\nDiscrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS) are spatial reference systems that use a hierarchical tessellation of cells to partition and address the entire globe. DGGS are designed to portray real-world phenomena by providing a digital framework on a common discrete geospatial data structure and they are commonly used to create virtual globes. DGGS differ from conventional geographic coordinate reference systems in that they are designed to be an information grid not a navigation grid. Conventional coordinate reference systems address the globe using tuples of “real” numbered coordinates. DGGS, however, address the entire planet by partitioning it into a hierarchical tessellation of integer-based nested cells thereby providing a truly discrete, rather than continuous, reference frame for repeating the location of measured Earth observations, feature interpretations, and extrapolated predictions.\nFormal development of DGGS began in the 1980s with the promising value of global analysis coinciding with the increased use of geographic information systems and the availability of global mapping data and positioning systems. However, following the initial excitement about DGGS as a technology the lack of availability of suitable cloud and High Performance Computing (HPC) environments has limited the uptake and application of DGGS – until now! The maturation of accessible cloud and HPC infrastructures has enabled DGGS to emerge from the ‘trough of disillusionment’ and to provide a path to realizing the vision of the Digital Earth, and the future of CyberGIS. The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) is developing an international standard for DGGS that will formally define the essential properties of a DGGS and specify protocols that will facilitate interoperability between multiple DGGS and traditional data infrastructures. The OGC DGGS Standards Working Group is finalizing its work based on inputs and review from experts around the world with experinence using multiple DGGSs. By defining cell structure, geo-encoding, quantization strategy and associated mathematical functions, the OGC DGGS Standard will enable interoperable big data processing on discrete global grids.",

            "abstract": "Core formation is the major chemical fractionation that occurred on Earth. This event is widely believed to have happened at pressures of at least 40 GPa and temperatures exceeding 3000 K. It has left a significant imprint on the chemistry of the mantle by removing most of the siderophile (iron-loving) elements from it. Abundances of most siderophile elements in the bulk silicate Earth are significantly different than those predicted from experiments at low P-T. Among them, vanadium, chromium, cobalt and gallium are four siderophile elements which abundances in the mantle have been marked by core formation processes. Thus, understand their respective abundance in the mantle can help bringing constraints on the conditions of Earth’s differentiation.\nWe performed high-pressure high-temperature experiments using laser heating diamond anvil cell to investigate the metal-silicate partitioning of those four elements. Homogeneous glasses doped in vanadium, chromium, cobalt and gallium were synthesized using a levitation furnace and load inside the diamond anvil cell along with metallic powder. Samples were recovered using a Focused Ion Beam and chemically analyzed using an electron microprobe. We investigate the effect of pressure, temperature and metal composition on the metal-silicate partitioning of V, Cr, Co and Ga. Three previous studies focused on V, Cr and Co partitioning at those conditions of pressure and temperature, but none explore gallium partitioning at the relevant extreme conditions of core formation. We will present the first measurements of gallium metal-silicate partitioning performed at the appropriate conditions of pressure and temperature of Earth’s differentiation.",

            "abstract": "Two distinct Paleozoic terranes known as Cuyania and Chilenia occupy the southern central Andes of Argentina and Chile. Because the proposed terrane boundaries coincide with major structural elements of the modern Andean system at 30-36°S, it is important to understand their origins and potential role in guiding later Andean deformation. The Cuyania terrane of western Argentina encompasses the Precordillera (PC) and a thick-skinned thrust block of the western Sierras Pampeanas, persisting southward to the San Rafael Basin (SRB). Although recently challenged, Cuyania has been long considered a piece of southern Laurentia that rifted away during the early Cambrian and collided with the Argentine margin during the Ordovician. Chilenia is situated west of Cuyania and includes the Frontal Cordillera (FC) and Andean magmatic arc. This less-studied terrane was potentially accreted during an enigmatic Devonian orogenic event.\nWe present new detrital zircon U-Pb age data from siliciclastic sedimentary rocks that span the entire Paleozoic to Triassic from the FC, PC, and SRB. Cambrian rocks of the PC exhibit similar zircon age distributions with prominent ~1.4 and subordinate ~1.1 Ga populations, which are distinct from other Paleozoic strata. Plutonic rocks with these ages are common in southern Laurentia, whereas ~1.4 Ga zircons are uncommon in South American age distributions. This supports a Laurentian origin for Cuyania in isolation from Argentina during the Cambrian. Upper Paleozoic strata from the PC, FC, and SRB all yield similar age data suggesting shared provenance across the proposed Cuyania-Chilenia suture. Age distributions also notably lack Devonian-age grains. The regional paucity of Devonian plutonic rocks and detrital zircon casts doubt on a possible arc system between these terranes at this time, a key requisite for the mid-Paleozoic transfer and accretion of Chilenia to the Argentine margin. Collectively, these data question the precise boundaries of the Chilenia terrane.",

Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has greatly facilitated analog outcrop study progress by bridging the gap in image resolution between seismic and well data. A 3D GPR survey was conducted to visualize architectural elements of friction-dominated distributary mouth bars within proximal delta front deposits in Cretaceous Ferron Sandstone at the top of the Notom Delta in south-east Utah. Sensors and Software’s Noggin 250 MHz system was used over a 25 m x 15 m grid. We employed a spatial sampling of 0.5 m for the inline (dip direction) and 1.5 m for the crossline (strike direction). Standard processing flows including time-zero correction, dewow, gain, background subtraction and 2D migration were used to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Formation velocity estimates from the hyperbola matching yielded 0.131 m/ns which is comparable to the literature velocity of about 0.125 m/ns. The calculated average dielectric constant (directly related to volumetric water content) is 5.2 matches unsaturated sandstone. The depth of GPR penetration is limited to approximately 3 m - likely due to the compaction/carbonate cementation in the rock and interbedded layers of finer-grained material contributing to higher attenuation of the GPR signal. The vertical resolution is about 0.125 m, enabling the imaging of the dune-scale cross sets (15-20 cm thickness). Calculation of the medium porosity via an adapted Wyllie Time Average equation yields 7.8 % which is consistent with the average porosity (5-10%) obtained from the literature. Bedding diagrams from local cliff exposures in the previous studies show gently NE dipping accretion of single large foresets that were interpreted as small-scale unit bars, the amalgamation of which resulted in the progradation of large mouth bars. The GPR radargrams acquired in this study are not only capable to image the 3D architecture of these individual unit bars, but also capable to differentiate between various proximal mouth-bar facies: upper friction-dominated dune-scale cross beds and bar scale large foresets from lower inertia-dominated basal planar beds.",

            "abstract": "With the rapidly-increasing number of climate services providers, the landscape for putting climate into practice is getting both easier to access and more confusing. Each provider serves a different clientele, and in so doing draws more stakeholder organizations into the sphere of those using climate information in decision-making. The challenge has been in connecting these new stakeholders with expertise that may reside within a different provider organization.\nTo help close the gap, the Southern Climate Impacts Planning Program (SCIPP; http://www.southernclimate.org), a NOAA RISA Team, initiated a summer internship program, where students with expertise in meteorology or climatology would work for an organization more closely aligned with another climate services provider network. The format was patterned after the successful NSF-funded Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program at the National Weather Center, where students are selected from undergraduate programs across the nation to spend a summer conducting research under a scientific mentor. The SCIPP initiative flipped this model, instead sending students to organizations with operational needs for climate information to work under their mentorship in partnership with SCIPP scientists.\nOver the past two summers, SCIPP has recruited students to work at landscape-based (Gulf Coast Joint Venture and National Wetlands Research Center) and community-based (Tulsa Partners) organizations. Students worked alongside the organizations’ staff on a daily basis and were supported through periodic calls with the SCIPP team to help identify appropriate datasets and work through methodological issues. This presentation will discuss how these relationships were created, the expertise of each of the organizations involved, and outcomes from the projects.",

Previous work indicates typical annual discharge from Humbug Creek of > 500,000 kg of sediment and > 100 g of mercury. This study uses photogrammetry and repeat high-resolution topographic surveys to quantify erosion rates and geomorphic processes, and sediment “fingerprinting” to quantify contributions of fine-sediment sources. The headwaters of Humbug Creek are underlain by volcanic mudflows, whereas MDSHP’s denuded and dissected landscape is composed of weathered auriferous sediments susceptible to chronic rill and gully erosion with block failures and debris flows occurring in more cohesive terrain. Aerial LiDAR (November 2014) was used to create a 1-meter digital elevation model (DEM); photogrammetry will be used to create a pre-1997 DEM from historic aerial photographs. DEM differencing will provide an integrated estimate of long-term erosion averaged over ~20 years in unvegetated areas. Finer-resolution (1-cm) terrestrial LiDAR (T-LiDAR) scans were made in late 2014 at four pit locations and will be repeated in the fall of 2015 and 2016. The T-LiDAR time series will provide annual erosion rates under modern conditions, allowing assessment of relative contributions from shallow surface processes and deeper gravity-driven processes. In 2014‒15 we collected storm runoff and in-situ hillslope samples. Sediment fingerprints (mineralogy, major elements, trace elements, and particle size) for source sediments will be used to assess relative contributions from fine-sediment sources using a statistical mixing model. We will present our approach, preliminary results, and discuss how this study supports selection and implementation of management and remediation strategies to ameliorate the discharge of sediment and mercury and mitigate downstream water-quality impacts.",

The peatlands play a role as the sink of large amount of soil organic carbon and methane. However, the disturbance of the peatland negatively impacted the ecosystem and contributed to the climate change caused by the released greenhouse gas. Our SAR/InSAR methods observed the hydrologic changes in the peatlands, which is a key factor to conserve the wetland, through several methods. First, we compared averaged SAR intensity from C- and L-band SAR sensors with groundwater level changes, and deduced a linear relationship between the SAR backscattering intensity and the groundwater level change. Second, we extracted the inundated area during wet season from InSAR coherence. Third, we measured the relative water level changes in the inundated area using the interferometric phases. Finally, we estimated the groundwater level changes corresponding to the soil moisture changes from time-series InSAR method. Our results can provide the unique opportunity to understand the occurring hydrologic and vegetation changes in the Great Dismal Swamp.",

            "abstract": "Improved simulations of land-surface-atmosphere interaction are fundamental for improving weather forecast and climate models. This requires observations of 2D fields of surface fluxes and the 3D structure of the atmospheric boundary layer simultaneously. A novel strategy is introduced for studying land-surface exchange and entrainment processes in the convective boundary layer (CBL) over complex terrain by means of a new generation of remote sensing systems.\nThe sensor synergy consists of scanning Doppler lidar (DL), water-vapor differential absorption lidar (WVDIAL), and temperature rotational Raman lidar (TRRL) systems supported by surface in-situ measurements. The 2D measurements of surface fluxes are realized by the operation of a DL, a WVDIAL, and a TRRL along the same line-of-sight (LOS) in a range-height-indicator (RHI) mode whereas the other DL is performing a series of cross track RHI scans along this LOS. This new setup enables us to determine the friction velocity as well as surface sensible and latent heat fluxes by closing the complete set of Monin-Obukhov similarity relationships under a variety of surface layer stability conditions and different land cover and soil properties. As this closure is performed at all DL crossing points along the LOS, this is a strategy towards a 2D mapping of surface fluxes entirely based on remote sensing systems. Further details are presented at the conference.\nThe second configuration is the simultaneous vertical profiling of vertical wind, humidity and temperature by DL, WVDIAL and TRRL so that latent heat and sensible heat flux profiles as well as a variety of different turbulent moments can be measured in the CBL. Consequently, by alternating of RHI scanning and vertical pointing modes, entrainment fluxes and surface fluxes can be measured almost simultaneously.\nThis novel strategy has been realized for the first time during the Surface Atmospheric Boundary Layer Exchange (SABLE) campaign in the Kraichgau region, north of the Black Forest low mountain region, in Southern Germany in August 2014 (see https://klimawandel.uni-hohenheim.de/start?&L=1). A further refined design of this experiment is planned at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) site in summer 2016.",

The network moves eastward through station redeployments and is now located on the Atlantic coast. This dense network has provided unprecedented opportunities for research in seismology, infrasound and atmospheric science.\nWe have developed a novel technique to investigate gravity wave occurrence and propagation across the network and have applied it to atmospheric pressure data recorded from Jan 1, 2010 through 2014. We divided the stations in this time range into 3,600 non-overlapping triangular arrays (triads). Each triad is most sensitive to propagating gravity waves in the 1-6 hour period range. We report two lines of research with this new dataset. First, we study individual large events in which atmospheric gravity waves are observed to cross the TA. We also study the long-term occurrence statistics of gravity waves and compare them to satellite observations of convective clouds and gravity waves in the stratosphere.

A significant fraction of the aerosol burden is composed of secondary aerosols formed from gas-phase precursors such as SO2, NOx, NH3, and VOC’s. The formation and composition of secondary aerosols depends on precursor abundance, oxidant availability, and the thermodynamic properties of the semi-volatile species. The oxidation and thermodynamic processes are strongly dependent on the available sunlight, temperature, and humidity, and produce large seasonal shifts in the aerosol characteristics. While most previous aircraft campaigns have studied these processes during summer, the Wintertime INvestigation of Transport, Emissions, and Reactivity (WINTER) campaign focuses on the wintertime chemical processes over the northeastern United States. A comprehensive dataset of gas- and particle-phase species was collected during the campaign using the NSF/NCAR C-130 aircraft in February-March 2015. We interpret these observations using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model with a 1/4 degree latitude by 5/16 degree longitude nested-grid over North America. We present a comparison of the model results with the aircraft measurements, and examine the sources of secondary inorganic and organic aerosols observed during the campaign. We use the model results to investigate the consistency between the aircraft, surface and satellite observations of aerosol concentrations and optical depths. Furthermore, we use multi-year model simulations to understand the effect of the unusually cold weather in 2015 over the northeastern United States on the chemical environment observed during the campaign.",

This index is calculated at global scale using the 0.1 global LISFLOOD hydrological modelling system forced by WFDEI meteorological data for the timeframe 1979-2012. The global LISFLOOD model simulates the most important hydrological processes, as well as water abstraction and consumption from various sectors, and flood routing, at daily scale, with sub-timesteps for routing and subgrid parameterization related to elevation and landuse. The model contains also options for water allocation, to allow preferences of water use for particular sectors in water scarce periods. LISFLOOD is also used for the Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS), the European Flood Awareness System (EFAS), continental scale climate change impact studies on floods and droughts. The water dependency indicator is calculated on a monthly basis, and various annual and multiannual indicators are derived from it. In this study, the indicator will be compared against water security areas known from other studies. Other indicators calculated are the Water Exploitation Index (WEI+), which is a commonly use water security indicator in Europe, and freshwater resources per capita indicators at regional, national and river basin scale. Several climate scnearios are run to indicate future trends in water security.",

            "abstract": "In this contribution we emphasize the importance in some lakes of wind-related hydrodynamic processes (fair weather waves, storm waves, and longshore, cross-shore and bottom currents) as a first order forcing for clastics remobilization and basin infill. This alternative view contrasts with more classical depositional models for lakes where fluvial-driven sedimentation and settling dominates. Here we consider three large lakes/paleo-lakes that are located in different climatic and geodynamic settings: Megalake Chad (north-central Africa), Lake Saint-Jean (Québec, Canada), and Lake Turkana (Kenya, East African Rift System). All of these three lake systems exhibit well developed modern and ancient high-energy littoral morphosedimentary structures which directly derive from wind-related hydrodynamics. The extensive paleo-shorelines of Megalake Chad are composed of beach-foredune ridges, spits, wave-dominated deltas, barriers, and wave-ravinment surface. For Lake Saint-Jean the influence of wind is also identified below the wave-base at lake bottom from erosional surfaces, and sediment drifts. In the Lake Turkana Basin, littoral landforms and deposits are identified for three different time intervals (today, Holocene, Plio-Pleistocene) evidencing that wind-driven hydrodynamics can be preserved in the geological record. Moreover, a preliminary global survey suggests that numerous modern lakes (remote sensing) and paleo-lakes (bibliographic review) behave as such. We thus coin the term “Wind-driven Water Bodies” (WWB) to refer to those lake systems where sedimentation (erosion, transport, deposition) is dominated by wind-induced hydrodynamics at any depth, as it is the case in the marine realm for shallow seas. Integrating wind forcing in lake models has strong implications for basin analysis (paleoenvironments and paleoclimates restitutions, resources exploration), but also for coastal engineering, wildlife and reservoirs management, or leisure activities.",

            "abstract": "Alaska accounts for nearly 99% of the seismic moment release within the US. Much of this is associated with the Aleutian volcanic arc, the most tectonically active region in North America, and an ideal location for studying arc magmatism. Okmok is an active volcano located in the central Aleutian arc, defined by a pair of nested, 10 km diameter calderas. The subdued topography of Okmok, relative to other Aleutian volcanoes, improves access and permits dense sampling within the caldera closer to the underlying magmatic system. Okmok volcano was selected as the site of study for this project due to frequent volcanic activity and the presence of a crustal magma reservoir as inferred from previous coarse resolution seismic studies.\nIn June-July 2015, we carried out an amphibious geophysical field deployment at Okmok. Onshore work in and around the volcano included collection of an array of magnetotelluric (MT) stations and installation of a temporary, year-long seismic array. A ring of 3D offshore MT deployments made around the island augments the onshore array. An additional 2D tectonic-scale profile spans the trench, volcanic arc, and backarc. This new geophysical data will be used to gain a greater understanding of Aleutian arc melt generation, migration, and storage beneath an active caldera. We present results from the analysis of the newly collected amphibious 3D MT data. This data will be used to model the distribution and migration of melt within Okmok’s crustal magma reservoir. Initial processing of the data shows strong MT signal levels, in particular from a geomagnetic storm that occurred from June 21-23, 2015. A companion abstract discussing the 2D tectonic scale MT profile, which constrains the mantle and deep crust beneath Okmok volcano, is discussed by Zelenak et al.",

            "abstract": "There is considerable interest in retrieving aerosol effective radius, number concentration and refractive index from lidar measurements of extinction and backscatter at several wavelengths. The 3 backscatter + 2 extinction (3β+2α) combination is particularly important since the planned NASA Aerosol-Clouds-Ecosystem (ACE) mission recommends this combination of measurements. The 2nd-generation NASA Langley airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL-2) has been making 3β+2α measurements since 2012.\nHere we develop a deeper understanding of the information content and sensitivities of the 3β+2α system in terms of aerosol microphysical parameters of interest. We determine best case results using a retrieval-free methodology. We calculate information content and uncertainty metrics from Optimal Estimation techniques using only a simplified forward model look-up table, with no explicit inversion. Simplifications include spherical particles, mono-modal log-normal size distributions, and wavelength-independent refractive indices. Since we only use the forward model with no retrieval, our results are applicable as a best case for all existing retrievals. Retrieval-dependent errors due to mismatch between the assumptions and true atmospheric aerosols are not included.\nThe sensitivity metrics allow for identifying (1) information content of the measurements versus a priori information; (2) best-case error bars on the retrieved parameters; and (3) potential sources of cross-talk or “compensating” errors wherein different retrieval parameters are not independently captured by the measurements. These results suggest that even in the best case, this retrieval system is underdetermined. Recommendations are given for addressing cross-talk between effective radius and number concentration. A potential solution to the under-determination problem is a combined active (lidar) and passive (polarimeter) retrieval, which is the subject of a new funded NASA project by our team.",

            "abstract": "The Kalman filter technique combines the strengths of new physical models of the Earth’s radiation belts with long-term spacecraft observations of electron fluxes and therefore provide an extremely useful method for the analysis of the state and evolution of the electron radiation belts. However, to get the reliable data assimilation output, the Kalman filter application is confronted with a set of fundamental problems. E.g., satellite measurements are usually limited to a single location in space, which confines the reconstruction of the global evolution of the radiation environment. The uncertainties arise from the imperfect description of the process dynamics and the presence of observation errors, which may cause the failure of data assimilation solution. The development of adaptive Kalman filter that combines the Van Allen Probes data and 3-D VERB code, its accurate customizations in the reconstruction of model describing the phase space density (PSD) evolution, extension of the possibilities to use measurement information, and the model adjustment by developing the identification techniques of model and measurement errors allowed us to reveal hidden and implicit regularities of the PSD dynamics and obtain quantitative and qualitative estimates of radial, energy and pitch angle diffusion characteristics from satellite observations. In this study we propose an approach to estimate radial, energy and pitch angle diffusion rates, as well as the direction of their propagation.",

A consortium of 23 (and counting) private firms, state agencies, and universities provides near-real-time observations from over 7,000 fixed weather stations, and over 1,000 vehicle-mounted sensors, every 15 minutes or less, together with the detailed sensor and station metadata required for effective forecasts and decision-making.\nIn order to integrate these weather observations across the United States, and to provide full details about sensors, stations, and observations, the NMP has defined a set of conventions for observational data and sensor metadata. These conventions address the needs of users with limited bandwidth and computing resources, while also anticipating a growing variety of sensors and observations.\nFor disseminating weather observation data, the NMP currently employs a simple ASCII format derived from the Integrated Ocean Observing System. This simplifies data ingest into common desktop software, and parsing by simple scripts; and it directly supports basic readings of temperature, pressure, etc. By extending the format to vector-valued observations, it can also convey readings taken at different altitudes (e.g. windspeed) or depths (e.g., soil moisture). Extending beyond these observations to fit a greater variety of sensors (solar irradiation, sodar, radar, lidar) may require further extensions, or a move to more complex formats (e.g., based on XML or JSON). We will discuss the tradeoffs of various conventions for different users and use cases.\nTo convey sensor and station metadata, the NMP uses a convention known as Starfish Fungus Language (*FL), derived from the Open Geospatial Consortium’s SensorML standard. *FL separates static and dynamic elements of a sensor description, allowing for relatively compact expressions that reference a library of shared definitions (e.g., sensor manufacturer’s specifications) alongside time-varying and site-specific details (slope / aspect, calibration, etc.) We will discuss the tradeoffs of *FL, SensorML, and alternatives for conveying sensor details to various users and uses.",

            "abstract": "Indicators are observations or calculations that are used to track social and environmental conditions over time. For a large coupled system such as the economy and environment, the choice of indicators requires a structured process that involves co-production among facilitators, subject-matter experts, decision-makers, and the general public. This co-production is needed in part because such indicators serve a duel role of scientifically tracking change and of communicating to non-scientists important changes and information that may be useful in decision contexts.\nBecause the goal is to communicate and inform decisions it is critical that indicators be understood by non-scientific audiences, which may require different visualization techniques than for scientific audiences. Here we describe a process of rigorously evaluating visual communication efficacy by using a simplified taxonomy of visualization design problems and trade-offs to assess existing and redesigned indicator images.\nThe experimental design is three-part. It involves testing non-scientific audiences’ understandability of scientific images found in the literature along with similar information shaped by a partial co-production process that informed the U.S. Global Change Research Program prototype indicators system, released in Spring 2015. These recommendations for physical, natural, and societal indicators of changes and impacts involved input from over 200 subject-matter experts, organized into 13 technical teams. Using results from the first two parts, we then explore visualization design improvements that may increase understandability to non-scientific audiences. We anticipate that this work will highlight important trade-offs in visualization design when moving between audiences that will be of great use to scientists who wish to communicate their results broader audiences.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU2015poster.pdf\nBecause the mantle transition zone likely contains a large amount of water (Karato, 2011; Pearson et al., 2014), vertical material transport across the transition would cause partial melting that may produce seismic signals above and/or below the transition zone. Schmandt et al. (2014) observed a seismic low-velocity zone (LVZ) at the top of the lower mantle (~730 km) beneath the southwestern US, arguing for dehydration melting due to downward flow across the 670-km discontinuity (670) from the transition zone. These authors further proposed a correlation between seismic velocity reductions and the direction of water transport, in which LVZ at ~730 km indicates materials moving downward from the transition zone, while the lack of LVZ at this depth would suggest an upward flow of mantle materials. Other regions also need to be investigated to confirm the correlation between this seismic feature and mantle water transport. We test their model by detecting “730-km” discontinuity beneath the Japan subduction zone using frequency-dependent receiver functions. In addition, water transport above the 410-km discontinuity (410) also plays an important role in global water circulation (Bercovici and Karato, 2003). Seismological studies (e.g. Courtier and Revenaugh, 2007; Schaeffer and Bostock, 2010) have observed LVZs above the 410, which might be caused by dehydration melting due to the upwelling of hydrated materials across the 410-km discontinuity from the transition zone. In this study, we also detect potential LVZs above 410 to establish a correlation between seismic velocity drop and flow direction. Around the Japan subduction zone, our preliminary results show evidence of low velocity zones below 670 in regions where stagnant slab is present for a substantial amount of time but not in other regions suggesting a variety of vertical mass transport in this region.\nKey words: transition zone, water transport, subduction zone, melting, receiver functions",

            "abstract": "Deglacial chronologies from West Greenland enable investigation of the role of climate and topography in controlling ice stream dynamics. The Uummannaq ice stream system (UIS) in particular has a comprehensive deglacial chronology which, when coupled with geometry, provides a framework for exploring controls on ice stream dynamics under changing climatic conditions. Here, we use a 2D numerical model to simulate grounding line-retreat behaviour and surface thinning in order explore the principal drivers of linear and non-linear ice stream behaviour during the end of the last glacial cycle.\nDeglaciation of the UIS began on the outer shelf at ~14.8 ka with ice retreat eastward to Ubekendt Ejland by ~12.4 ka. This initial retreat coincided with increasing air temperature, increasing solar radiation and sea-level rise. Awide, mid-shelf, trough also facilitated rapid retreat. The UIS then withdrew eastward ~ 100 km by ~11.4 ka – 10.8 ka as the northern and southern feeder zones unzipped. This coincided with increasing insolation and peak sea-level, but bathymetric over-deepening and fjord widening were also influential. Staircases of lateral moraines throughout the region point to step-wise thinning as ice retreated between 14.8 - 11.0 ka. By 8.7 ka the southern arm of the UIS had reached Store Gletscher and thereafter it retreated beyond the present day grounding line. This coincided with increased air/ocean temperatures and peak summer insolation. In contrast, the northern arm of the UIS stabilised until ~6.5 ka and became unresponsive to both atmospheric and ocean forcing due to topographic pinning.\nNew research has adopted a 2D model approach to establish and quantify the relative importance of various mechanisms in governing UIS dynamics. These model results indicate that the non-linear retreat of the UIS is strongly influenced by vertical and lateral constrictions in the marine trough system which regulates grounding line stability. In turn, grounding line stability clearly controls upstream changes in ice surface elevation, and such changes can be linked to lateral moraine staircases which infer slow, incremental thinning along the margins of the UIS at different times. Our findings confirm that topography is a critical factor in modulating ice stream response to climate change over 100-1000 year timescales.",

We show that the systematic component is dominated by the seasonal variations with annual and semi-annual periodicities. Our results demonstrate that the systematic component biases the displacement time-series and velocity depending on the SAR acquisition times. We investigate the uncertainty due to the stochastic component of the delay before and after the stratified tropospheric delay correction using the atmospheric models.\nWe apply the approach to evaluate the systematic and stochastic components of the tropospheric wet delay using a 2002-2011 time-series of daily MODIS precipitable water vapor products across the western India plate boundary and stratified delay estimated based on the ERA-I global atmospheric model. Our results show a maximum displacement bias of ~23 cm due to the annual variation of the wet delay and a maximum relative velocity uncertainty of ~8 mm/yr due to the stochastic delay. The uncertainties for seven Envisat tracks obtained from the MODIS and ERA-I correlate with the uncertainties obtained from the scatter of the InSAR range-change time-series, indicating that the scatter of InSAR displacement time-series can be predicted with independent delay time-series from MODIS and ERA-I. Our results show that the stratified tropospheric delay correction using ERA-I, mitigates the systematic component of the delay and reduces the scatter due to the stochastic delay. Non-stratified wet delay and residuals of the stratified wet delay correction due to the inaccurate atmospheric model and low spatial and temporal resolution of the model dominate the uncertainty of the InSAR displacement time-series and velocity.",

This rise in wildfires introduces additional ash to ecosystems and can represent a serious and ongoing threat to water quality in streams and rivers from storm event runoff in burn areas. The effect of metals associated with wildfire ash (from wood collected from the Valles Caldera National Preserve, Jemez Mountains, New Mexico) on solution pH and dissolved oxygen was assessed through a series of laboratory experiments. Microscopy and spectroscopy analyses were conducted to characterize the elemental content and oxidation state of metals in unreacted and reacted ash. Certain metals (e.g., Ca, K, Al, Mg) were detected in ash from ponderosa pine, one of the dominant species in the Valles Caldera, with mean concentrations ranging from 400-1750 mg kg-1. Other metals (e.g., Na, Fe, Mn, V, Zn, Ni) were present at lower mean concentrations ranging from 12-210 mg kg-1. The initial pH after conducting batch experiments reacting ash with water started at 9.9 and the alkalinity of the water was 110 mg L-1 as CaCO3. Solution pH decreased to 8.0 after 48 hours of reaction, which is almost a delta of two pH units. Dissolved oxygen concentrations decreased by 2 mg L-1 over the course of 12 hours before the rate of reaeration surpassed the rate of consumption. This presentation will discuss how redox-active metals, such as Fe and Mn, could contribute to the increased dissolved oxygen demand and fluctuation of the oxidation/reduction potential in the system.",

            "abstract": "In this rapidly urbanizing world, unprecedented rate of population growth is not only mirrored by increasing demand for energy, food, water, and other natural resources, but has detrimental impacts on environmental and human security. Transportation simulations are frequently used for mobility assessment in urban planning, traffic operation, and emergency management. Previous research, involving purely analytical techniques to simulations capturing behavior, has investigated questions and scenarios regarding the relationships among energy, emissions, air quality, and transportation. Primary limitations of past attempts have been availability of input data, useful “energy and behavior focused” models, validation data, and adequate computational capability that allows adequate understanding of the interdependencies of our transportation system. With increasing availability and quality of traditional and crowdsourced data, we have utilized the OpenStreetMap roads network, and has integrated high resolution population data with traffic simulation to create a Toolbox for Urban Mobility Simulations (TUMS) at global scale. TUMS consists of three major components: data processing, traffic simulation models, and Internet-based visualizations. It integrates OpenStreetMap, LandScanTM population, and other open data (Census Transportation Planning Products, National household Travel Survey, etc.) to generate both normal traffic operation and emergency evacuation scenarios. TUMS integrates TRANSIMS and MITSIM as traffic simulation engines, which are open-source and widely-accepted for scalable traffic simulations. Consistent data and simulation platform allows quick adaption to various geographic areas that has been demonstrated for multiple cities across the world. We are combining the strengths of geospatial data sciences, high performance simulations, transportation planning, and emissions, vehicle and energy technology development to design and develop a simulation framework to assist decision makers at all levels – local, state, regional, and federal. Using Cleveland, Tennessee as an example, in this presentation, we illustrate how emerging cities could easily assess future land use scenario driven impacts on energy and environment utilizing such a capability.",

            "abstract": "Solar radiation and galactic cosmic radiation is believed to be major restriction factors influencing survival and evolution of life. On planet earth, geomagnetic field along with atmosphere protect living beings from the harmful radiation. During a geomagnetic reversal or excursion, however, the efflux of charged particles on earth surface would increase as the shielding effect of magnetic field decrease. The stratospheric ozone can also be partially stripped away by solar wind when the strength of the field is weak, leading to an increasing ultraviolet radiation penetration to the earth surface. However, studies on the mechanism of radiation induced stress and damage are focused only on bacteria that have no response to magnetic field. This study was motivated by the need to fill the gap upon knowledge of that on magnetic field sensitive microorganism. Magnetotactic bacteria (MTB) are a group of microbes that are able to synthesis intracellular nano-sized magnetic particles (named magnetosomes). These chain-arranged magnetosomes help MTB sense and swim along the magnetic field to find their optimal living environment efficiently. In this paper, in silico prediction of stress and damage repair genes in response to different radiation were carried out on the complete genome of four nonmagnetotactic and four magnetotactic spirilla. In silico analyses of the genomes of magnetic field sensitive and non-sensitive spirilla revealed: 1) all strains contain genes for regulate responses superoxide and peroxide stress, DNA pyrimidine dimer and string breaks; 2) non-magnetotactic spirilla have more genes dealing with oxidative stress, while magnetotactic spirilla may benefit from magnetotaxis by swimming into oxic-anoxic zone away from oxidative stress and direct radiation damage; yet, the lipid hydroperoxide peroxidase gene in MTB may be responsible for possible ROS generated by the membrane enveloped magnetite magnetosome; 3) magnetotactic spirilla possess SOS recA mediated umuCD genes and double copied ssb gene, these low fidelity DNA polymerase along with Ssb protein may endow MTB high adaptive mutation under stress condition; 4) also, magnetosome crystals (magnetite or greigite) can reduce radiation oxidative damage and protect MTB.",

            "abstract": "Seismic tremor is a feature shared by many silicic volcanoes and is a precursor of volcanic eruption. Many of the characteristics of tremors, including their frequency band from 0.5 Hz to 7 Hz, are common for volcanoes with very different geophysical and geochemical properties. The ubiquitous characteristics of tremor imply that it results from some generation mechanism that is common to all volcanoes, instead of being unique to each volcano.\nHere we present new analysis on the magma-wagging mechanism that has been proposed to generate tremor. The model is based on the suggestion given by previous work (Jellinek & Bercovici 2011; Bercovici et.al. 2013) that the magma column is surrounded by a compressible, bubble-rich foam annulus while rising inside the volcanic conduit, and that the lateral oscillation of the magma inside the annulus causes observable tremor. Unlike the previous two-dimensional wagging model where the displacement of the magma column is restricted to one vertical plane, the three-dimensional model we employ allows the magma column to bend in different directions and has angular motion as well.\nOur preliminary results show that, without damping from viscous deformation of the magma column, the system retains angular momentum and develops elliptical motion (i.e., the horizontal displacement traces an ellipse). In this ‘‘inviscid’’ limit, the magma column can also develop instabilities with higher frequencies than what is found in the original two-dimensional model. Lateral motion can also be out of phase for various depths in the magma column leading to a coiled wagging motion. For the viscous-magma model, we predict a similar damping rate for the uncoiled magma column as in the two-dimensional model, and faster damping for the coiled magma column. The higher damping thus requires the existence of a forcing mechanism to sustain the oscillation, for example the gas-driven Bernoulli effect proposed by Bercovici et al (2013). Finally, using our new 3-D model, the spectrum of displacement and unsynchronized cross-correlation between displacements measured from different locations can be calculated, and this can be compared to more detailed seismic measurements on well monitored volcanoes.",

            "abstract": "Sea ice plays important roles in the marine ecosystem and our environment, and a detailed understanding of all aspects of its microstructure is especially important in this time of changing climate. For many months of the year, the ice forms a permeable barrier between Polar oceans and the atmosphere, and as it freezes and melts, its microstructure evolves and changes in ways that affect other parts of that system. Sea ice also provides a microhabitat that is an important part of the marine ecosystem, but much remains to be learned about it on this scale. In material terms, sea ice is multiphase and very close to its melting point, and these properties make its microstructure particularly complex and dynamic, as well as challenging and interesting to study.\nWe use a combination of analytical methods to achieve a very detailed understanding of sea ice microstructure – specifically the morphology and distribution of ice crystals and brine channels. Overall porosity affects freeboard, emissivity, and optical and mechanical properties, but pore connectivity is critical to gas and fluid transport, salt flux to polar oceans, the transfer of halogens to the boundary layer troposphere, and the transport of nutrients and pollutants to microorganisms. When sea ice forms, salts are expelled from newly formed ice crystals and concentrated on grain boundaries and in brine pockets and channels. We use synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (SXRF) and scanning electron microscope-based energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to map the location in two dimensions of several important salt components in sea ice: SXRF for bromine, chlorine, potassium, calcium and iron, EDS for these as well as some lighter elements such as sodium, magnesium, and silicon. We use X-ray microcomputed tomography (microCT) to produce three-dimensional models of brine channels and to study changes in brine network topology due to warming and cooling. Both microCT and optical thin sections provide necessary structural reference points in the analysis of microchemical data from SXRF and EDS.",

            "abstract": "Accretionary sandbox experiments provide a rich environment for investigating the processes of fault development. These experiments engage students because 1) they enable direct observation of fault growth, which is impossible in the crust (type 1 physical model), 2) they are not only representational but can also be manipulated (type 2 physical model), 3) they can be used to test hypotheses (type 3 physical model) and 4) they resemble experiments performed by structural geology researchers around the world. The structural geology courses at UMass Amherst utilize a series of accretionary sandboxes experiments where students first watch a video of an experiment and then perform a group experiment. The experiments motivate discussions of what conditions they would change and what outcomes they would expect from these changes; hypothesis development. These discussions inevitably lead to calculations of the scaling relationships between model and crustal fault growth and provide insight into the crustal processes represented within the dry sand. Sketching of the experiments has been shown to be a very effective assessment method as the students reveal which features they are analyzing. Another approach used at UMass is to set up a forensic experiment. The experiment is set up with spatially varying basal friction before the meeting and students must figure out what the basal conditions are through the experiment. This experiment leads to discussions of equilibrium and force balance within the accretionary wedge. Displacement fields can be captured throughout the experiment using inexpensive digital image correlation techniques to foster quantitative analysis of the experiments.",

            "abstract": "The Taiwan orogeny in the framework of southeast Asian tectonics is of global importance, as subduction zone polarity reversals along the Eurasian margin occurred probably twice since in the Cenozoic. Additionally, due to oblique collision, and potential along strike variations of the passive margin its plate tectonic setting is exceptional, featuring transition of active subduction and ongoing collision at its southern termination and a more mature orogeny farther north. This allows for investigating the influence of the overriding plate on subduction dynamics, but also, vice versa, for understanding how subduction changed the overlying orogeny in three dimensions.\nWe present here a revised analysis of the plate tectonic framework of Southeast Asia since the Late Cretaceous, using global plate tectonic reconstructions focusing on the evolution of the Eurasian margin. In the Late Cretaceous, the morphology of the overriding Eurasian plate has been modified due to slab rollback of the Pacific Plate, which resulted in its thinning, back arc spreading, opening of the Proto South China Sea, and formation of extensional allochtons. When the young and buoyant Philippine Sea Plate reached the relatively older oceanic lithosphere of the Proto South China Sea, subduction polarity reversal along the Eurasian margin was triggered, which subsequently propagated northwards.\nPolarity reversal along the margin was followed by the Taiwan orogeny, which involved accretion of an extensional allochton into the mountain belt. This, in combination with subduction reversal controls present day mountain building in Taiwan. Despite providing general insights on subduction dynamics, our results challenge the general view for the Taiwan orogen that it is possible to replace space and time, due to its plate tectonic configuration.",

Considering that wildfire size and severity is likely to increase into the future with a drier climate, it is important that we understand wildfire effects and ecosystem recovery. To evaluate how ecosystems recover from wildfire we measured spatial patterns in regeneration and mapped tree refugia within mega-fire perimeters (Hayman, Jasper, Bobcat, and Grizzly Gulch) in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) dominated forest. On average, high severity fire effects accounted for > 15% of burned area and increased with fire size. Areas with high severity fire effects contained 1 - 15% tree refugia cover, compared to 37 - 70% observed in low severity areas . Large high severity patches with low coverage of tree refugia, were more frequent in larger fires and regeneration distances required to initiate forest recovery far exceeded 1.5 canopy height or 200 m, distances where the vast majority of regeneration is likely to arise. Using a recovery model driven by distance, we estimate recovery times between 300 to > 1000 years for these mega-fires. In Western dry conifer forests, large patches of stand replacing fire are likely to lead to uneven aged forest and very long recovery times.",

            "abstract": "The Secche di Lazzaro formation (7 Ka) is a phreatomagmatic deposit in the south-western part of the island of Stromboli (Aeolian Archipelago, Italy). The volcanic sequence is constituted by three main sub-units. In two of them abundant accretionary lapilli are present. We performed granulometric analysis to describe the spatial arrangement and the grain-size distribution of the lapilli inside the deposit. Lapilli were characterized by SEM investigations (BSE images). EMPA and LA-ICP-MS analyses of major and trace elements on glasses and minerals were performed. Although BSE images provide accurate morphological information, they do not allow the real 3D microstructure to be accessed. Therefore, non-invasive 3D imaging of the lapilli was performed by X-ray micro-tomography (X-mCT). The results of the X-mCT measurements provided a set of 2D cross-sectional slices stacked along the vertical axis, with a voxel size varying between 2.7 and 4.1 mm, depending on the size of the sample. The X-mCT images represent a mapping of X-ray attenuation, which in turn depends on the density of the phases distributed within the sample. This technique helped us to better constrain the particle and crystal distribution inside the accretionary lapilli. The recognized phases are: glass, clinopyroxene, plagioclase and Ti-Fe minerals. We discover also a high concentration of Na, Cl and SO3 in the ash matrix. This evidence is ubiquitous in all the accretionary lapilli. The work presented here could define a new route for future studies in the field of physical volcanology as X-ray micro-tomography could be a useful, non destructive technique to better characterize the internal structure of accretionary lapilli helping us to describe grain-size distribution of component particles and their spatial distribution within aggregates.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost plays an important role in the hydrology of the northern regions. To investigate the role of climate change on permafrost degradation and hydrology, extensive field work was conducted in a series of small watersheds located in the discontinuous permafrost zone of the lower Yenisei River near Igarka, and in the continuous permafrost zone of the Kolyma River near Cherskii. Climatic, hydrologic and permafrost characteristics were monitored at both locations over a three year period and extended using historical data. Stable isotope composition of rain, snow, water from lakes and rivers, and various types of ground ice was used to determine various inputs and runoff pathways to a river flow in several watersheds.\nThe study found that water flow of smaller creeks follows precipitation closely, while flow of larger rivers is affected by evaporation effects related to water storage in thermokarst lakes. Ground ice of the epigenetic permafrost near Igarka has a similar isotopic composition as that of Holocene permafrost and contemporary late summer precipitation. Ground ice of the syngenetic Pleistocene permafrost (Ice Complex) near Cherskii has a significantly lighter isotopic composition than pore water of the active and transient layers.\nIncreases in air temperature resulted in thickening of the active-layer and melting of ice that reach the transient layer in continuous permafrost. In areas where the transient layer severely reduced as a result of intense forest fires and other landscape disturbances, ground ice from permafrost is also involved in hydrological processes. Progressive decrease in the seasonal freezing layer thickness and a lower permafrost table promoted more groundwater storage and redistribution of summer precipitation towards winter baseflow in discontinuous permafrost region. The major contribution of permafrost at both locations is not through the melting of ground ice, but through changes in soil properties affecting the water flow.",

An analytical solution is developed for the SDR for a radial collector well in an unconfined aquifer with vertical flow and allows for stream bed permeability. The non-dimensional parameter χ = K′L/Kb relates the streambed thickness b and hydraulic conductivity K′ of the streambed with the aquifer hydraulic conductivity K and distance L between the stream and the well. As χ decreases, the time to reach steady state increases. While previous work on this problem suggests that the steady-state value of SDR decreases as K′/K decreases, our solution shows that the steady-state SDR is one as long as χ > 0—that is, the flow through the streambed induced by pumping is equal to the amount of water pumped from the aquifer. Also, the analytical solution results in a relatively simple equation to predict SDR in unsteady conditions.",

The TS07D model mitigated these limitations by replacing the equatorial current modules with basis-function expansions and by introducing a dynamical binning approach based on nearest neighbors. Here we further progress this avenue. Firstly, the number of basis functions is increased and new data from Van Allen Probes and THEMIS missions is added, allowing the model to resolve the spatial structure and evolution of the innermost eastward and banana currents. Then, an enhanced Birkeland current module that more accurately reconstructs the realistic morphology, including the Harang discontinuity and IMF By dependence, is discussed. Lastly, the performance of various nowcasting versions of the model with different sets of the binning parameters is examined for the first time using their direct validation by in-situ geomagnetic field observations, leading to an optimum nowcasting version of the model. Furthermore, the plasma pressure is reconstructed assuming force balance with the empirical magnetic field, and the role of pressure-driven currents is examined.",

            "abstract": "Anorogenic peralkaline igneous systems display extreme enrichment of REE and Zr with a hydrothermal overprint leading to post-magmatic metal mobilization. Strange Lake in Canada, for example, is a mid-Proterozoic peralkaline granitic intrusion and host to a world-class REE-Zr deposit with >50 Mt ore (>1.5 wt.% REE and >3 wt.% Zr). In contrast to porphyry systems, peralkaline systems are poorly understood and hydrothermal metal mobilization models are only in the early stage of their development. This is partly due to the paucity of thermodynamic data for REE-bearing minerals and aqueous species, and the complexity of the hydrothermal fluids (enrichment of F, P and Cl), which make it difficult to develop thermodynamic models of metal partitioning. This study aims to show the link between alteration stages and metal mobilization using Strange Lake as a natural laboratory and combine these observations with numerical modeling. Four types of alteration were recognized at Strange Lake: i) alkali (i.e. K and Na) metasomatism related to interaction with NaCl-bearing orthomagmatic fluids, ii) acidic alteration by HCl-HF-bearing fluids originating from the pegmatites followed by iii) aegirinization of the border of the pegmatites and surrounding granites and by iv) pervasive Ca-F-metasomatism. The acidic alteration accounts for most of the hydrothermal metal mobilization in and outward from the pegmatites, whereas the Ca-F-metasomatism led to metal deposition and resulted from interaction of an acidic F-rich fluid with a Ca-bearing fluid. Numerical simulations of fluid-rock reactions with saline HCl-HF-bearing fluids at 400 °C to 250 °C indicate that temperature, availability of F/Cl and pH limit the mobility of Zr and REE. Fluids with pH <2 led to the formation of quartz and fluorite in the core of the pegmatites and to an increase in the stability of REE chloride species favorable for REE mobilization. The mobilization of Zr was favored at low temperature with the formation of Zr hydroxyfluoride species depending on pH and competition with Al fluoride species requiring very low pH (<1) fluids for Zr transport. The key factor for hydrothermal metal mobilization in peralkaline granitic systems is the formation of a fluid-buffered subsystem providing the acids and ligands required for REE and Zr mobilization.",

Two Lower Miocene E-W-trending strike-slip corridors played a major role in the deformation pattern of the Alboran Domain, in which E-W dextral strike-slip faults, N60°-trending thrusts and N140°-trending normal faults developed simultaneously during dextral strike-slip simple shear. The inferred continuous westward translation of the Alboran Domain is accommodated by a major E-W-trending lateral ramp (strike-slip) and a N60°-trending frontal thrust. At lithosphere-scale, we interpret the observed deformation pattern as the upper-plate expression of a lateral slab tear and of its westward propagation since Lower Miocene. The crustal emplacement of the Ronda Peridotites occurred at the onset of this westward motion.The Miocene tectonics of the western Alboran is therefore marked by the inversion of a continental rift, triggered by shortening of the upper continental plate and accommodated by E-W dextral strike-slip corridors. During thrusting and westward displacement of the Alboran domain with respect to Iberia, the hot upper plate, which involved the previously exhumed sub-continental mantle, underwent fast cooling.",

We used historical maps from the U.S. Coast Survey and the Stevens Estuarine and Coastal Ocean Model (sECOM) to simulate how and where coastal flooding from storm surge affected the Jamaica Bay region of southeastern New York City at different points in time. This area, which houses approximately 1.2 million people today and the John F. Kennedy International Airport, was heavily impacted by coastal flooding during Hurricane Sandy. Historical analysis showed that the Rockaway Peninsula was an active barrier island system up until the early twentieth century, growing approximately 70 meters per year to the west between 1844 - 1891. Older historical maps made by American and European cartographers from 1524 - 1844 suggest that Jamaica Bay may have been a much more open system, with few or no interior marsh islands, at the time of European discovery. From these studies, we constructed digital terrain models and land cover maps for two historical periods: ca. 1870s and ca. 1609, and today. Storm simulations of hurricanes over the historical and present-day landscapes showed how a smaller inlet, shallower channel depths, and larger floodplains all can reduce the height of flooding inside the bay, and suggested a series of leverage experiments that test the efficacy of present-day green infrastructure interventions to lessen peak flood heights while maintaining tidal flushing. By combining history, modelling, and policy-relevant scenarios, we believe we have developed a reshreshing and accessible toolkit for policymakers thinking about resilience measures in coastal cities like New York.",

While numerous studies have shown that vegetation removal generally leads to increases in streamflow, few studies have examined the intersection between patterns of evapotranspiration and topographically driven patterns of throughflow generation and connectivity. We applied a parsimonious but spatially distributed watershed modeling framework (WECOH: Watershed ECOHydrology Model) to a snow dominated watershed in central Montana to elucidate how different vegetation scenarios and climate forcing can affect the temporal evolution of storage distributions and watershed connectivity. We derived spatially distributed snowmelt and rainfall input from two NRCS SNOTEL sites located in the experimental watershed and actual evapotranspiration from a co-located eddy-covariance tower. We generated different vegetation scenarios to simulate forest harvesting and compared streamflow response, spatial distribution of storage, and runoff source areas across scenarios. Our work aims at better understanding how the intersection of vegetation and topography mediates hydrologic response.",

            "abstract": "Constraining the distribution and abundance of water (H2O and/or OH) in the lunar interior is crucial for assessing the formation and evolution of the Moon. Deriving such information from returned lunar samples is the most direct approach, but only a few regions have been sampled. Reflectance spectra for the 3μm region, remotely sensed by the Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3), provide an alternative way to characterize lunar water at a global scale. Though such methods only probe the optical surface, hydration in some materials may result from internal processes instead of interaction with the solar wind. Constraining the volatile content of pyroclastic deposits and silicic rich domes, for example, can provide insight into volatile distribution and evolution related to magmatic processes. Thermally-corrected M3 data, constrained by Diviner temperatures and laboratory data, enable us to estimate the amount of water in these deposits. We find evidence for increased hydration signatures at nearly all large pyroclastic deposits relative to background values for surrounding terrains, suggestive of H2O-bearing magmas. Water contents for these deposits exhibit a linear correlation with the deposit range, largely consistent with lunar magma eruption models. In addition, the water content at inferred high-Ti deposits is higher than that of low-Ti pyroclastics for the same deposit range, which may reflect inherent differences in the water content or degassing history of the associated magmas. Our results also suggest that over half of the examined silicic-rich domes are very dry (no detectable water signature), which suggests either a volatile-poor source or a very different degassing history compared to pyroclastic deposits. Potential silicic-rich domes are inferred to have formed due to ascension of immiscible silicic melts in which volatiles may have been concentrated. Those silicic melts might cool slowly and allow extensive diffusion of water, whereas quenched glasses in pyroclastics may favor volatile retention. Current work is focused on the morphologic and compositional characteristics of these deposits as well as improved quantitative estimates of their water content. Latest results will be presented in the context of how these orbital observations may inform us of lunar interior processes.",

The experiment was conducted in the North Fork of the Elk Creek (NFEC) watershed within the Lubrecht Experimental Forest, located in western Montana. The NFEC is a managed watershed and was logged approximately 80 years ago; thus, this watershed offers a unique opportunity to examine topographic and biological controls on N dynamics within a relatively even aged forest. In 2014 and 2015, we examined changes in soil N dynamics in four sites that varied in aspect (north and south) and elevation (high and low). Within each site, we also examined micro-topographic controls by sampling soil from both the hollow and the side slope. From pre-snowmelt to the end of the growing season (March – October), we collected snow cores and soil cores within each site to characterize the heterogeneity of soil N. We also installed resin strips to measure the exchangeable N within the upper soils. Across the entire watershed, we found that seasonal NH4+ and NO3- concentrations were highest in April, as well as at the higher elevation sites. This pattern corresponded with higher snowpack and snow water equivalent values and was likely due to higher mineralization rates during the winter. We also found that across all four sites, hollow soils had higher NH4+ and NO3- concentrations relative to soils from the hillslope, and this was largely due to increased organic matter and high soil moisture content found in the hollows. We also found a significant interaction between time of year, site, and micro-topography, suggesting that during the early growing season, NH4+ and NO3- concentrations were largely modulated by snowpack depth, which in turn was controlled by topography. Soil NH4+ and NO3- concentrations for samples collected for the remainder of the growing season is currently being analyzed, but preliminary results suggest that topography plays a large role in regulated soil N dynamics via controls on soil water content and organic matter accumulation.",

A key component of determining mass balance is winter accumulation which is traditionally estimated by digging and measuring snow densities from within snow pits. However, this method represents a labor-intensive point measurement which may not fully capture spatial variability of accumulation. To more efficiently estimate spatial variability of winter accumulation across Taku Glacier and its main tributaries in southeastern Alaska in 2015, we used a 400 MHz Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) Common Offset (CO) surveys along centerline transects which were also collected during a 2012 study. We used common midpoint (CMP) surveys, migration, snow pits, and probing to improve depth estimates and provide ground truth of winter accumulation depth measurements from CO surveys. We determined that the winter accumulation was significantly lower in 2015 than in 2012. However, gradients in accumulation versus elevation were consistent from year to year along centerline transects. We suggest that this low accumulation may be influencing the recent two year stall of Taku Glacier which has exhibited an advancing terminus for nearly a century. We recommend that further studies be conducted to extend the reach of this dataset beyond 2 years. This data would be invaluable to future models and mass balance studies on the Icefield and may capture key components that suggest a tipping point from advance to retreat of Taku Glacier.",

Previous geochemical studies have revealed that the anomalously high PGE abundances resulted from a large chondritic impactor (3.3–7.8 km in diameter). Here we report evidence that the Late Triassic impact triggered the remarkable faunal turnover of siliceous plankton (radiolaria) in the Panthalassa Ocean. Radiolarian species data indicate that this faunal turnover records the largest extinction and origination rates within the 30 Myr interval in the Late Triassic to earliest Jurassic. Our high-resolution biostratigraphic, sedimentological and geochemical data revealed that there are two paleoenvironmental events in the initial phase of the radiolarian faunal turnover interval: (1) the post-impact shutdown of primary productivity within the timespan of 104 years, and (2) significant and sustained reduction in the sinking flux of radiolarian silica for 0.4–0.6 Myr after the impact. A sharp reduction in marine primary and secondary productivity, triggered by a large impact, may have also played an important role in the extinction of Norian marine faunas (ammonoids, monotid bivalves, and conodonts) in the Panthalassa Ocean.",

A novel method of determining calving location using seismic wave arrival times from two local seismic stations at Helheim Glacier is presented. The difference in wave arrival times is used to define a locus (hyperbola) of possible origins, which intersects uniquely with the calving front. Our method is motivated by difficulties with traditional seismic location methods that fail due to both the emergent nature of calving, which obscures the P and S-wave onsets, as well as the proximity of the seismometers, which combines body and surface waves into one arrival. This method is calibrated via known calving events at Helheim Glacier in August 2014, then applied to other calving events in both 2013-2014 and 2014-2015. Extending this method with an additional station allows for triangulation of the calving location, which removes the need for up-to-date imagery of the calving front. Additionally, this method can be extended to allow for three-dimensional localization. By getting more precise locations of glacial calving, we may improve our understanding of why and how glaciers calve.",

            "abstract": "Subsurface terrestrial-aquatic interfaces are hotspots of biogeochemical cycling of terrestrially derived organic matter and nutrients. However, pathways of nitrogen (N) loss within subsurface aquifers are poorly understood. Here we take an experimental and mechanistic modeling approach to gauge the contribution of different microbial functional groups to the transformation and loss of N in an unconfined aquifer at Rifle, Colorado. During 2014 we measured nitrate (NO3), ammonia, gaseous nitrous oxide (N2O) and the corresponding isotopic composition of NO3 and N2O. Coincident with an annual Spring/ Summer excursion in groundwater elevation, we observed a rapid decline in NO3 concentrations at three discrete depths (2, 2.5 and 3 m) within the aquifer. Isotopic measurements (i.e., δ18O and δ15N) of NO3 suggest an immediate onset of biological N loss at 2 m, but not at 3 m where the isotopic composition demonstrated dilution of NO3 concentration prior to the onset of biological N loss. This implies that the groundwater becomes increasingly anoxic as it rises within the capillary fringe. We observed the highest rates of N2O production concomitant with the largest enrichment of the δ18ONO3 and δ15NNO3 isotopes. A mechanistic microbial model representing the diverse physiology of nitrifiers, aerobic and anaerobic (denitrifying) heterotrophs and anammox bacteria indicates that the bulk of N2O production and N loss is attributable to denitrifying heterotrophs. However, this relationship is dependent on the coupling between aerobic and anaerobic microbial guilds at the oxic-anoxic interface. Modeling results suggest anammox plays a more prominent role in N loss under conditions where the organic matter input is low and rapidly drawn down by aerobic heterotrophs prior to the rise of the water table. We discuss our modeling results in light of recent molecular microbiology work at this site, but also with respect to implications for N loss across terrestrial-aquatic interfaces.",

This phase transition is called the Plasma Phase Transition (PPT). This problem challenges the most advanced simulations and theories resulting in a span of proposed conditions for the PPT from 1 to 5 Mbar, between 1000 and 2500 K. At higher temperature the metallization onset is thought to be continuous. \nWe will present recent experiments using a reverberation compression scheme on the National Ignition Facility to compress cryogenic deuterium up to several megabars (1Mbar=100 GPa) while keeping the temperature much lower than using single shock compression.",

We have developed automated quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) methods to detect and identify errors made while recording, manipulating, formatting, transmitting and archiving data, or due to the malfunctioning of sensors. The focus was on developing and implementing basic QA/QC for the DOE Legacy Management installed SOARS network that collects data from the water-level pressure transducers, vadose zone and groundwater thermistors, as well as the meteorological stations. We developed and implemented QA/QC procedures to identify and flag the sources of erroneous data and cleaned up the water-level time series data using outlier filtering methods. Based on the analysis of field water-level data, we provided recommendations on the reinstallation and calibration of pressure transducers installed in monitoring wells. Additionally, in support of the QC of the geochemical dataset, we developed an approach of flagging the samples based on the evaluation of ionic balance of water samples. We also advanced a visualization system to allow users to plot and download raw data and perform QA/QC of time series data masked by the quality flags.",

Analysis of the global pattern of hydrocarbons is therefore an important step to understand the regional and seasonal variation of air pollution and natural fire events. The Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) has monitored trace gases in the upper troposphere and stratosphere based on solar occultation measurements for more than ten years. In this study, we investigate the global pattern of seven hydrocarbon species (CO, C2H6, C2H2, HCN, H2CO, CH3OH, and HCOOH) and OCS using the ACE-FTS version 3.5 dataset from 2004 to 2013. All hydrocarbons show strong seasonal variation and regional differences, but the detailed pattern differs according to the speciation of the hydrocarbons. For example in the Northern Hemisphere, CO, C2H6, and C2H2 show the highest mixing ratios in winter, but high CH3OH and HCOOH appear in summer. In the Southern hemisphere, H2CO, HCN, and HCOOH show high mixing ratios in springtime. These patterns indicate the effect of different emission sources including fuel combustion, wildfire emission, and chemical production. Correlation with CO also reflects these seasonal and regional differences and can provide useful information to characterize each hydrocarbon emission. We also compared the ACE-FTS measurements with GEOS-Chem output to examine the model performance and spatiotemporal patterns.",

            "abstract": "The increased soft X-ray irradiance during solar flares generates increased electron densities in the lower ionosphere of Mars. The relative changes in electron density during a flare are greater for larger flares and also at lower altitudes and larger flares, due to the wavelength dependence of both the flux increase during the flare and the absorption of flux by the neutral atmosphere. These relationships have been explored [Bougher et al. 2001, Fox et al. 2004, Mendillo et al. 2006, Mahajan et al. 2011, Lollo et al. 2012] but not quantified, which has impeded the validation of simulations of the ionospheric effects of solar flares. Such simulations are necessary for developing accurate descriptions of the physical processes governing ionospheric behavior under extreme conditions.\nWe present a response function, a mathematical expression for the change in electron density during a solar flare as a function of the change in solar flux and an optical depth proxy. This response function is based on analysis of 20 Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) radio occultation electron density profiles measured during solar flares. Characterizing the response as a function of optical depth, rather than altitude, provides the best description of ionospheric variability during a flare; otherwise non-negligible solar zenith angle effects are present.\nWe demonstrate that the response function can be used to predict ionospheric electron densities during a specified solar flare by reproducing profiles known to be disturbed by a solar flare. We also demonstrate that the response function can be used to infer the strength of solar flares not visible at Earth by finding the flux enhancement required to reproduce an apparently flare affected profile given an undisturbed profile on the same date.",

Model of generation of EM emissions detected before earthquake is based on physical analogues of distributed and conservative systems and focal zones. According to the model the process of earthquake preparation from the moment of appearance of cracks in the system, including completion of series of foreshocks, earthquake and aftershocks, are entirely explained by oscillating systems.According to the authors of the work electromagnetic emissions in radio diapason is more universal and reliable than other anomalous variations of various geophysical phenomena in earthquake preparation period; Besides, VLF/LF electromagnetic emissions might be declared as the main precursor of earthquake because it might turn out very useful with the view of prediction of large (M5) inland earthquakes and to govern processes going on in lithosphere-atmosphere-ionosphere coupling (LAIC) system. Based on this model, in case of electromagnetic emissions spectrum monitoring in the period that precedes earthquake it is possible to determine, with certain accuracy, the time, location and magnitude of an incoming earthquake simultaneously.The present item considers possible physical mechanisms of the geophysical phenomena, which may accompany earthquake preparation process and expose themselves several months, weeks or days prior to earthquakes. Such as: Changing of intensity of electro-telluric current in focal area; Perturbations of geomagnetic field in forms of irregular pulsations or regular short-period pulsations; Perturbations of atmospheric electric field; Irregular changing of characteristic parameters of the lower ionosphere (plasma frequency, electron concentration, height of D layer, etc.); Irregular perturbations reaching the upper ionosphere, namely F2-layer, for 2-3 days before the earthquake; Increased intensity of electromagnetic emissions in upper ionosphere in several hours or tenths of minutes before earthquake; Lighting before earthquake; Infrared radiation; Total Electron Content (TEC) anomalies and etc.",

This study has explored the impacts of these biases on multi-model uncertainty in CMIP5 ensemble projections of 21st century change in Antarctic surface temperature, net precipitation and SIA. The analysis is based on time slice climatologies in the RCP8.5 future scenario (2070-2099) and historical (1970-1999) simulations across 37 different CMIP5 models. Projected changes in net precipitation, temperature and SIA are found to be strongly associated with simulated historical mean SIA (e.g. cross-model correlations of r = 0.77, 0.70 and -0.86, respectively). Furthermore, historical SIA bias is found to have a large impact on the simulated ratio between net precipitation response and temperature response. This ratio is smaller in models with smaller-than-observed historical SIA. These findings are particularly relevant to quantifying and reducing model uncertainty in projections of Antarctic surface mass balance and associated contributions to sea level change.",

In acquisition of crosshole radar surveys, in-well measurements along vertical ray paths are rarely considered. Radar logging, in which the transmitting and receiving antennas are moved in tandem within a single borehole, can be used to generate pseudo logs of slowness and attenuation. Given that crosshole radar tomographic resolution tends to be best towards the center of the interwell region and poorer at boreholes, in-well travel-time and amplitude data represent valuable additional sources of information to improve radar tomographic imaging. Here, we assess the information content of data collected along in-well vertical ray paths. We quantify information content using metrics based on the model resolution matrix and correlation loss. Substantial improvements in crosshole inversion results are possible with consideration of in-well radar measurement data.",

Our recent core-scale imbibition experiments show a prolonged depletion of residual scCO2 by dissolution, implying a non-equilibrium mechanism. In our 2D sandstone-analogue micromodel experimental study, pore-scale scCO2 dissolution was inferred from imaging (1) drainage using a pH-sensitive water dye and (2) imbibition using a scCO2 dye. The drainage experiment was conducted by injecting scCO2 into the dissolved-CO2 (dsCO2)-free water-filled pore network. The time-lapse images of non-uniform dye intensities indicating varying pH show that dsCO2 concentration varies from zero to solubility in individual pores and pore clusters and the average concentration gradually increases with time. The different rates of dissolution in different pores/clusters can be attributed to (1) fast scCO2 dissolution at scCO2-water interfaces, (2) rate-limited mass transfer due to limited interface areas, and (3) a transition from rate-limited to diffusion-limited mass transfer, revealed by detailed analysis on selected pores and pore clusters. The imbibition experiments conducted by injecting deionized water at different rates show (1) water flow in channels bypassing scCO2 at high residual saturations, (2) subsequent, slow scCO2 depletion by dissolution and mass transfer as effluent dsCO2 concentration varies from 0.06% to 4.44% of solubility, and (3) creation of new water flow paths by dissolution, enhancing scCO2 depletion by coupled displacement and dissolution. Both the drainage and imbibitions experiments indicate non-equilibrium scCO2 dissolution in the centimeter-scale pore network over 4.5 hours and up to 14 hours, respectively. The pore-scale imaging can help better understand the effects of pore-throat characteristics on scCO2 dissolution and mass transfer during drainage and imbibition and the interplay between displacement and dissolution.",

ECEP was formally launched at the AGU Fall Meeting in December 2014, and has gained rapid momentum in the subsequent year.\nIntegral to the ECEP approach to resilience is the concept of ‘Graceful Failure’. By acknowledging that all designs will fail at some level, and instead adopting flexible designs that combine engineering or network strengths with a plan for efficient, systematic failure and avoid delayed recovery. Such an approach enables optimal planning for both known and future scenarios, and their assessed uncertainty.\nThis presentation will use the Boulder and North Colorado floods of September 2013 as a case study of how Graceful Failure improves resilience to extreme weather.",

Eight field trips were made from Jan. 2014 to Jun. 2015, during which cave meteorological conditions (RH, temperature and cave air CO2 concentration) and drip rate were measured for 5 sites inside the cave. 63 cave drip and pool water samples were collected and analyzed for oxygen and hydrogen isotope compositions (δ18O and δD values). Cave air temperature varied throughout the study period, the temporal variations ranged at different sites from 2 to 8.4 °C (the greatest variation was observed at sites that are closer to the entrance or surface). These are significantly less than outside temperatures range of 24 °C, but more than observed in other monitored caves. Elevated cave-air CO2 concentration (3200 ppm) and slow drip rate during the summer indicated slowed or stalled growth of calcite. The overall range of δ18O values were -7.1‰ to -4.5‰. A δD vs δ18O diagram yields a slope of 6.1, which falls within the normal range of 6-8 for local Meteoric Water Line. The value is slightly above Global Meteoric Water Line, indicating lack of evaporative effect. Throughout the study period, the δ18O values varied from 0.6 ‰ at some sites to 1.9‰ at others. The largest changes were likely due to the close proximity of collection sites to the surface precipitation. Spatially, for samples collected at each cave trip, different sites displayed variations of δ18O values from 0‰ to 1.7‰. The difference could be attributed to different type of drip sites with varying types of flow paths rainwater takes to the drip sites. The significant seasonal shift of drip water δ18O values and growth conditions indicate importance of consideration of seasonality in interpreting speleothem δ18O record from this cave.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing results in large volumes of wastewater, called “produced water”. Treatment of produced water is challenged by its high salt, organic compound, and radionuclide concentrations. Current disposal approaches include deep well injection and physical-chemical treatment for surface disposal; however, deep well injection has been recently linked to induced seismicity and physical-chemical treatments suffer from fouling and high cost. The reuse of the produced water has emerged as a desirable management option; however, this requires pretreatment to generate a water of usable quality and limit microbial activity. Biological treatment is an underexplored area in produced water management and has the potential to remove organics and reduce overall costs for physiochemical treatment or reuse. Suspended growth biological treatment techniques are known to be limited by salinity motivating a more robust biofilm approach: ‘microbial mats’.\nIn this study, we used engineered microbial mats as a biofilm treatment for the produced water. Evaluation of the biodegradation performance of microbial mats in synthetic and real produced waters showed microbial activity at up to 100,000 mg/L TDS concentration (three times the salt concentration of the ocean). Organic removal rates reached to 1.45 mg COD/gramwet-day at 91,351 mg/L TDS in real produced water samples and initial evaluation demonstrated the potential for field-scale application. Metagenomic analyses of microbial mats demonstrated an adaptive shift in the microbial community treating different samples, suggesting the wide applicability of this treatment approach for produced waters with varying chemical composition. On-going studies focus on the evaluation of the removal of the organics and the contaminants of high concern in produced water using microbial mats as well as the effect of the biofilm growth conditions on the biodegradation in changing salt concentrations.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, the term ‘luminescence dating’ has expanded its meaning such that today it encompasses a range of luminescence dating methods and materials. Whilst the fundamental principles that underlie these different dating methods are essentially the same, namely that the event typically being recorded is the last exposure of the material to light or to heat, the various luminescence dating techniques do differ in their suitability in different situations. Today, in the field of luminescence dating of sediments, there are a number of minerals that can be used for dating (quartz and feldspar being the most commonly used), and for each mineral it is possible to obtain a number of different luminescence signals (some obtained using optical stimulation, and some obtained by heating). These different luminescence signals may build-up and deplete in the natural environment at different rates from each other, and can span quite different time ranges. Additionally, the scale of analysis used in luminescence dating can now be varied (ranging from single sand-sized grains to multiple grains), as can the size range of the materials used for dating (ranging from fine-silt, coarse-silt, and sand-sized grains, through to large clasts and rock surfaces). Having such flexibility in the range of minerals, luminescence signals, grain sizes, and the scales of analysis available for dating, means that it is now possible to optimise the materials and methods selected for dating in any particular study in response to the precise scientific question to be addressed, the time-range of interest, and the likely mechanisms of re-setting of the luminescence signal in the context that is to be dated.\nIn this paper, the flexibility offered by the growing family of luminescence techniques will be outlined by considering some of the different minerals, luminescence signals, and dramatically different timescales (tens of years to millions of years) potentially available for sediment dating, and with reference to comparisons with independent chronology wherever possible.",

However, the fact that number of private pumping wells is too huge makes obtaining precise pumping records of each wells become difficult. Because the most significant response of pumping is drawdown and the influence radius of pumping might over several hundred meters, a network of observation wells can be used to sense the regional pumping. Groundwater fluctuations are the synthetic effect of different physical mechanisms include pumping, recharge, tidal effect and others and an analysis of short-time Fourier transform is applied to identified the temporal effects of each mechanisms. Because pumping is a kind of human activity and the most significant frequency of human activity is daily, the temporal amplitude with daily frequency (TADF) is the response of regional pumping in the neighborhood of the observation well and TADF can be a linear indicator of regional groundwater pumping. The proposed method was applied in the Pingtung Plain and the horizontal of analysis period is from 2008 to 2011. The TADF of each observation well can reflect the temporal variation of regional groundwater pumping around the observation well. For the well in coast area, the shape of TADF looks like a sinusoid line with a half year cycle and the peaks of large pumping respectively are during January and July. The peaks of large pumping are mainly caused by fish farms.",

The aircraft campaign was conducted using the Alfred Wegener Institute's POLAR 6 aircraft (based in Resolute Bay, Canada) and the ship based campaign was conducted onboard the CCGS Amundsen (icebreaker and Arctic Ocean research vessel). Here, we use the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) to study meteorology and transport patterns that influence airmasses sampled during the aircraft campaign (5-21 July 2012) and research Legs 1a and 1b for Amundsen (1a: 8 – 24 July Quebec City to Resolute and 24 July – 14 August Resolute to Kugluktuk). The FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model driven by WRF meteorology (FLEXPART-WRF) run in backwards mode is used to study source regions that influenced enhanced concentrations in trace gases including DMS and NH3 as well as aerosols. Links between biomass burning in Northern Canada and measurements during the campaign are discussed. Finally FLEXPART-WRF run in forward mode is used to study links between shipping emissions from the Amundsen and enhanced pollution sampled by the POLAR 6 aircraft when both were operating in the same region of Lancaster Sound during the campaigns.",

            "abstract": "Among the major goals of geothermal geochemistry is to identify the source of the geothermal fluids and the processes influencing their chemical composition. Such can be difficult given that geothermal systems are characterized by many phases (vapor, liquid and solid) and components. Here we report data on volatile element stable isotope systematics (H2O, CO2, Cl, H2S and SO4) in volcanic geothermal fluids at Krafla, NE Iceland. Fluid temperatures ranged from 192 to 437°C. The sources and reactions of these volatile elements is commonly based on identifying the variable end-member components in the system and their respective mixing ratios, or alternatively, comparing temperature dependence of isotope fractionation of given reactions with the measured isotope systematics. Isotopes of a given element fractionates upon reactions with key reactions in geothermal systems being aqueous speciation, vapor-water partitioning and water-rock interactions, these depending on solution composition, temperature and pressure. In order to study the effects of various reactions and processes affecting isotope systematics of geothermal fluids and to reconstruct reservoir isotope systematics, isotope geochemical models were developed by combining aqueous speciation, gas-water partitioning and water-rock modelling together with isotope fractionation and isotope mass action equations. Based on these models and data collected at Krafla it is concluded that the key factors controlling, reactive volatile element isotope systematics (S and C) are two, the isotope composition of the source material and isotope fractionation associated with aqueous and vapor speciation and how these changes as a function of processes occurring in the system including boiling and fluid-rock interaction, whereas the non-reactive element isotope systematics (Cl) is controlled their various end-member components in the system and their respective mixing ratios. Based on these data and models, the reservoir C, S and Cl isotope systematics of volcanic geothermal fluids at Krafla were reconstructed, considered to be an analog to volatile element isotope signature of the Icelandic mantle plume and divergent plate boundary.",

In this presentation we describe these new models.

Prior to the New Horizons flyby the CCMC's focus had been on models of the inner heliosphere. To respond to the New Horizons opportunity, modelers of the outer heliosphere were invited to contribute. As a result, by the time of closest approach six different model forecasts were posted publically at the CCMC web site dedicated to this project.\nIn this presentation we will describe the community wide effort which the CCMC facilitated in response to this request, detailing the different models which participated and illustrating the results.",

The present study investigates the impacts of surface heterogeneity on water and heat transfer in the atmospheric boundary layer. The Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model is modified so that a more realistic urban representation is used with Large Eddy Simulations (LES). Numerical experiments are then conducted to investigate heat and water vapor transfer in urban areas under different large-scale synoptic conditions. Preliminary results have found that the urban-rural contrast results in an urban heat inland circulation, which enhances the kinetic energy and accelerates the heat and water vapor transfer in the horizontal direction. The urban-rural contrast in terms of surface temperature and momentum roughness length are shown to have significant but different effect on the urban boundary layer. Within urban areas, the small-scale heterogeneity effect is also studied. When the patch size that characterizes the urban heterogeneity scale is comparable to the size of urban area, the simulated results are strongly dependent on the heterogeneity conditions. As the patch size decreases, the simulated results become more similar to those over a homogeneous urban surface.",

In May 2013, during the spacecraft’s 91stflyby of Titan (T91), the instrument demonstrates its capabilities as a radar sounder, presenting a unique opportunity to constrain direct measurements of the depth and composition of Titan’s second largest sea, Ligeia Mare. Later, observations of Kraken Mare and Punga Mare were planned and executed in August 2014 (T104) and January 2015 (T108), respectively. While most of the seafloor was not detected at Kraken, suggesting the sea was either too deep or too absorptive in these areas to observe a return from the seafloor, shallow areas near Moray Sinus did return subsurface detections. At Punga Mare, a clear detection of the subsurface was observed with a maximum depth of 120 m along the interrogated track of the sea. We will present an analysis of all three altimetric observations of Titan’s mare, as well a re-analysis of altimetry data acquired over southern Ontario Lacus. Depths measurements and liquid composition are obtained using a novel technique which makes use of radar simulations and Monte Carlo based inversions. Finally, we will show that the estimates obtained from the direct measurements described above can be used along with the RADAR’s active (i.e. Synthetic Aperture Radar) and passive (Radiometry) modes to generate bathymetry maps of areas not observed by altimetry.",

ET in a 2000-m elevation mixed-conifer forest showed a 24% decrease in ET in water-year 2014, the third dry year, as compared to the wet year of 2011. This decrease reflected reduced transpiration for the July to September period. Over half of the annual ET in both wet and dry years came from below the 1-m depth mapped soil, and with come coming from below the 2.5 m depth of our soil-moisture measurements. The ability of trees to access water from these depths does provide a 2-3 year buffer for ET, which also depends on forest density and the balance between perennial overstory and annual understory vegetation. An equally dense lower-elevation pine-oak forest (1160 m) showed nearly a 50% decrease in ET during the third year of drought, with significant visible effects on vegetation. While this lower elevation forest may have as much or more subsurface storage as does that at 2000-m elevation, the combination of lower precipitation as one goes down in elevation and very high forest density provides only a one-year buffer for ET in dry years. Regaining resiliency in this forest will only occur with significant reductions in biomass and commensurate lowering of ET. In a 400-m elevation oak savannah ET responds to annual precipitation, with essentially no multi-year buffer provided by subsurface storage.",

Geologically rapid changes in lithospheric loading during ice-sheet growth and decay produce large changes in the effective stress state beneath and nearby. Oscillating loads will cause oscillating melt volume in deep rocks, and the nonlinear increase of melt migration velocity with melt fraction means that extended ice-age cycling will enhance upward melt migration. Our numerically efficient simulations of ice-sheet/lithosphere interactions produce crustal stresses similar to values estimated to allow dike emplacement and vug-wave migration. Maximum tensile and shear stresses shift both horizontally and vertically during ice sheet growth and decay, suggesting multi-step transport of melt upwards to or near the base of the ice sheet. We thus suggest that regions of high geothermal heat flux arose from cyclic ice-sheet loading, which enhanced melt extraction from a deep source (possibly linked to passage of the Iceland hot spot). We further suggest that similar processes may have been important elsewhere beneath or near present or former ice sheets, potentially enhancing volcanism as well as geothermal flux.",

            "abstract": "Optical depth measured in Gale crater has been shown to vary seasonally, and this variation is potentially linked to a change in dust size visible from the surface. The Mast Camera (Mastcam) on the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) has performed cross-sky brightness surveys similar to those obtained at the Phoenix Lander site. Since particle size can be constrained by observing airborne dust across multiple wavelengths and angles, surveys at 440 and 880 nm can be used to characterize atmospheric dust within and above the crater. In addition, Rover Environmental Monitoring Station (REMS) on MSL provides downward radiation flux from 250 nm (UVD) to 340 nm (UVA), which would further constrain aerosol properties. The dust, which is not spherical and likely contains irregular particles, can be modeled using randomly oriented triaxial ellipsoids with predetermined microphysical optical properties and fit to sky survey observations to retrieve an effective radius. This work provides a discussion on the constraints of particle size distribution using REMS measurements as well as shape of the particle in Gale crater in comparison to Mastcam at the specified wavelengths.",

Using the precipitation data (1960-2010) of 21 meteorological stations, the spatial and temporal characteristics of droughts were examined by using theory of runs and the Standardized Precipitation Index on 3-month, 6-month and 12-month time scales. The results showed that the main drought type was moderate drought, and drought occurred frequently on July and October. During the last 50 years, the drought intensity and frequency were the biggest in 1991-2000. According to the SPI-3, the risk of spring and fall drought increased gradually, which could impact on agriculture and water supply. The trend of SPI values over the time period was calculated and analyzed, showing of increasing dryness throughout the basin, and the north and northwest zones of WRB were most likely to suffer from drought. Also, compared with the east, the drought severity and drought duration in the northwest was more serious. It was also observed that there was strong relation between precipitation distribution and drought zones in the basin, and the drought conditions changed continuously with seasons depending upon precipitation amount and its spatial distribution.",

Three deep penetration and additional four shallow holes provided a spatial overview of the primarily turbiditic depositional system, comprising the Bengal deep sea fan. Sediments originate from Himalayan rivers, documenting terrestrial changes of the monsoon evolution and Himalayan erosion and weathering, and are transported through a delta and shelf canyon, supplying turbidity currents loaded with a full spectrum of grain sizes. Mostly following transport channels, sediments deposit on and between levees, while depocenters are laterally shifting over hundreds of kilometers on millennial time scales.\nExpedition 354 documented these deposits in space and time by identifying, coring and dating numerous stratigraphic marker horizons across the transect, allowing a detailed reconstruction of channel-levee migration, abandonment, reoccupation and overall uniform growth in the late Pleistocene. High resolution records of these growth patterns were acquired in several levee, interlevee and hemipelagic successions.\nMiocene through Pliocene fan development was studied at three deeper sites, which document and recovered sand rich facies throughout most of the cores acquired by the half-APC coring technology, intercalated by longer periods of hemipelagic deposition and absence of turbiditic input as the results of major depocenter shifts.\nRecovered sediments have Himalayan mineralogical and geochemical signatures suitable to reconstruct time series of erosion, weathering and changes in source regions as well as impacts on the global carbon cycle. Miocene shifts in terrestrial vegetation, in sediment budget and in style of sediment transport have been tracked. Expedition 354 has extended the record of early fan deposition by 10 Ma into the Late Oligocene.",

            "abstract": "In this research we linked spatial variability of invertebrate drift characteristics (e.g. flux, concentration, mean body size) in a mountain stream to channel morphology and hydraulic properties such as at-a-point and depth-averaged velocity and shear velocity. The study was conducted in East Creek, a small stream in British Columbia in which reach-scale morphology transitions from cobble-dominated plane-bed to gravel-bed pool-riffle. To achieve our goal, we collected vertical profiles of invertebrate drift and time-averaged velocity in various morphological units within the study reaches. The data were analyzed using linear mixed model. Our reach-scale results suggested that, generally, the study reaches had statistically similar drift characteristics despite their contrasting morphologies. At the within-reach scale, different drift characteristics displayed different trends in relation to morphological and hydraulic properties of the channel. Longitudinally, highest drift flux occurred in riffle-pool transitions. We attributed this finding primarily to higher flow velocity because there were no statistically significant differences in drift concentration between morphological units. In the vertical dimension, highest drift flux occurred near the surface owing to a combination of higher drift concentration and higher flow velocity. A different pattern was observed for mean body size of drifting invertebrates. On average, body size was smallest in riffle-pool transitions and largest near the bed. The combination of velocity, drift concentration, and drift body size structure resulted in similar biomass flux estimates in all morphological units. In the vertical dimension, biomass flux appeared to be highest near the water surface. Generally, hydraulic variables seemed to be relatively poor predictors of drift concentration and mean body size of drifting invertebrates. Our findings reveal a complex relationship between channel morphology and hydraulics and various characteristics of invertebrate drift in the study stream. We hypothesize that this may be representative of similar mountain channels.",

The redox potential drives the degradation of organic compounds. Its variation affects the water chemistry, gas release and responses of the geo-electrical signature. This study explores how non-invasive measurements sensitive to geo-electrical properties provides quantitative information about the in-situ redox situation. During this presentation, the preliminary results of a laboratory experiment to study the degradation of deicing chemicals with 3D resistivity and self-potential techniques, water samples will be shown.\nThe experiment consists of sand boxes (1.0x0.5x0.4 m) to which both sides of each box is contaminated with propylene glycol, an aircraft deicing fluid, commonly used in Norwegian airports. Each source is placed near the water table with static conditions. At one side a conductor is placed, linking the contamination zone at the water table and the unsaturated zone with a low water content, to improve the degradation by facilitating the electron exchange. At the other side, degradation occurs under natural conditions.\nEach box is equipped with 288 electrodes, distributed on six faces to perform 3D resistivity measurements. In addition to the resistivity, self-potential measurements are taken from the sand surface. Six water wells are installed above and below the water table to provide more information on the degradation processes. Moreover, measurements of carbon dioxide on the surface are performed as higher concentrations are expected where the pollutant is degraded.",

            "abstract": "Numerous glaciers in Greenland have sped up rapidly and unpredictably during the first part of the 21st Century. We started the Greenland Ice Mapping Project (GIMP) to produce time series of ice velocity for Greenland’s major outlet glaciers. We are also producing image time series to document the advance and retreat of glacier calving fronts and other changes in ice-sheet geometry (e.g., shrinking ice caps and ice shelves). When the project began, there was no digital elevation model (DEM) with sufficient accuracy and resolution to terrain-correct the SAR-derived products. Thus, we also produced the 30-m GIMP DEM, which, aside from improving our processing, is an important product in its own right.\nAlthough GIMP focuses on time series, complete spatial coverage for initializing ice sheet models also is important. There are insufficient data, however, to map the full ice sheet in any year. There is good RADARSAT coverage for many years in the north, but the C-band data decorrelate too quickly to measure velocity in the high accumulation regions of the southeast. For such regions, ALOS data usually correlate well, but speckle-tracking estimates at L-band are subject to large ionospheric artifacts. Interferometric phase data are far less sensitive to the effect of the ionosphere, but velocity estimates require results from crossing orbits. Thus, to produce a nearly complete mosaic we used data from multiple sensors, beginning with ERS-1/2 data from the mid 1990s. By using a primarily phase-only solution for much of the interior, we have reduced the velocity errors to ~1–3 m/yr. For the faster moving ice-sheet margin where phase data cannot be unwrapped, we used speckle-tracking data. In particular, we have relied on TerraSAR-X for many fast-moving glaciers because the ionosphere far less affects X-band data. This pan-Greenland velocity map as well as many of the time series would not have been possible without an extensive archive of data collected using six satellites from four different space agencies, much of which was distributed through the Alaska Satellite Facility (ASF). The record we are producing is being distributed to the wider community through the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NDISDC) and will serve as an important precursor data set for the NASA ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR), launching in 2020.",

Models are considered with and without mineral phase transitions. Our viscosity profiles are depth dependent with deep mantle viscosities increasing to values of 300 times the viscosity of the upper mantle and then decreasing dramatically on approaching the core-mantle boundary. Although phase transitions produce small secondary effects on the flow structure the main effect is that of the viscosity decrease near the core mantle boundary. Models with a high viscosity structure extending down to the core-mantle boundary are very sluggish with large aspect ratios, whereas models with a low viscosity just above the core mantle boundary overturn rapidly with aspect ratios close to unity. The latter models resemble uniformly low viscosity models despite the high viscosity region at mid-depths of the lower mantle.",

Recent new geothermometric approach based on the Raman Spectroscopy of Carbonaceous Materials (RSCM) has been developed. This approach allows successfully estimating peak temperatures of advanced diagenesis to high-grade metamorphic rocks.\nThe aim of this study is mainly to apply the RSCM geothermometry for 3D paleotemperatures cartography in the Guemessa area, a Hercynian massif located at 35 Km SW of Marrakech, Morocco. This area composed of the carboniferous metasediments, underwent tectonic, metamorphic and hydrothermal events that explain the presence of several base metal deposits like Zn-Pb-Cu Hajjar mine. Combining RSCM data and classical methods of thermometry like fluid inclusions and chlorite thermometry will allow a good understanding of thermal history of Hajjar deposits.\nThe samples used in this study were collected around the Hajjar mine and from different depths in the Hajjar body collected in the footwall and hangingwall of the massive ore.\nOur peak temperature estimates show values superior to 500°C. These temperatures differ from the ones obtained by other classical methods, which are not higher than 450°C. Nevertheless, fluid inclusion homogenization temperatures of 450°C represent minimum trapping temperature conditions, since the fluids were trapped above boiling conditions. Also, 450°C represents minimum thermic condition for the biotite isograd. Higher Raman temperatures obtained in this work confirm the hypothesis of a late heat flow related to a deep granitic intrusion. This intrusion could be closer to the Hajjar deposit which would explain the higher Raman temperature around the mineralization.\nIt is important to properly evaluate the consequences of this high late heat flux on the Hajjar mineralization, as it may have caused the recrystallization of the ore, with an increase of the particle size related. This thermal event could also have generated new mineralizing fluids.",

            "abstract": "Thermospheric neutral properties, such as wind, temperature, and neutral mass density, are driven by momentum and energy sources. Much work has focused on the response of the thermosphere when driven by energy sources from the magnetosphere, resulting in direct heating of the neutral gas. This leads to a dynamical response of the thermosphere described as a direct wind circulation. However, sources that change the momentum transfer to the neutral gas can also lead to thermal changes through a dynamical response that would be characterized as an indirect wind circulation. The ionosphere-thermosphere (I/T) system is tightly coupled by momentum and energy. The path for a direct energy source is to change the energy and then the momentum, while the route for an indirect energy source is to change the momentum and then the energy. For the indirect energy source, changes in the ion drag force cause a divergence in the neutral wind field, which results in thermal changes due to adiabatic heating or cooling via vertical winds. All of the important forces and processes exist for describing both the direct and indirect energy sources, but it is the time evolution of the processes that will define how the thermosphere responds. In this work, we present an indirect energy mechanism that can alter the thermospheric neutral mass density and temperature in the polar F-region. Similar to energy partitioning within the high-latitude I/T from an external energy source, energy can be transferred from kinetic to internal energy from a momentum source. We use the NCAR TIEGCM to analyze quantitatively how energy flows through the polar I/T system due to an internal momentum modification. These results illustrate how changes in the ion drag force can affect the thermal energy of the polar F-region I/T system, and create neutral mass density and temperature anomalies.",

            "abstract": "Arid and semi-arid ecosystems account for over 45% of global land cover. While mean annual carbon uptake in these ecosystems is relatively low, aridlands collectively store a significant amount of carbon. There is high inter- and intra-annual variability of plant growth in aridlands, depending largely on the timing and size of rainfall events. This variation is also of great significance, as the variation in annual semi-aridland carbon uptake accounts for ~39% of the inter-annual variability of the global terrestrial carbon sink, the largest percentage of any land cover type. Although arid and semi-arid ecosystems are of global importance, they are understudied. To better understand the drivers and variability of carbon uptake in these critical ecosystems, we utilize a six-year record of digital images (45,000+ images), carbon flux and meteorological data, soil water content, and associated ecological measurements from three eddy covariance tower sites in central New Mexico. These sites include a Chihuahuan Desert/short-grass Plains grassland site, and post-fire successional grassland site, and a creosote-encroached shrubland site, each of which have unique species compositions, carbon fluxes, and reactions to disturbance and resource addition. All images used are co-registered and corrected for radial lens distortions (when necessary) and greenness indices (2GRBi, gcc, and/or NDVI) are calculated for each scene’s overall “canopy” and for individual species and plant functional types therein. At all three sites, camera-derived greenness is correlated to measured carbon uptake with fine resolution (R2 up to 0.8), capturing temporal and spatial variation usually not seen in satellite-based imagery. At sites with lower LAI, species-specific ROI’s were more correlated to the site’s measured carbon flux across shorter time scales. Understanding the biota comprising each image and its contribution to changing scene greenness at different times of year can lead to more accurate carbon flux predictions in semi-arid systems, with species-specific biotic constraints (maximum growth rate, lifespan, and seasonality), growth parameters (light availability, VPD, soil water content, and temperature) as well as community-wide abiotic drivers considered.",

Understanding the hydrologic impacts of various climate scenarios and pathways is accomplished with a physics-based distributed hydrologic model with historic and future precipitation and evapotranspiration inputs. Vflo is a gridded hydrologic model setup for the 71,009 sq.-km. study area, the Canadian River, extending from arid areas in eastern New Mexico, across the Texas Panhandle to Lake Eufaula in sub-humid eastern Oklahoma. This model uses merged radar and rain gauge data to generate hydrographs at gauged and ungauged locations. Vflo is calibrated to observed stream gauge data minimizing Nash-Sutcliffe error function for volume and discharge. Streamflow characteristics at ungauged locations, for both historic and future scenarios, are used to develop ecological relationships between water quality, discharge, and fish species.\nTesting the change in hydrologic response from future potential evapotranspiration (PET) and future precipitation is accomplished using observed rainfall. Historical rainfall is perturbed to represent future climate scenarios. Model-based simulations are used to test various scenarios comprising: 1) warmer and drier, 2) warmer and status quo precipitation, and 3) status quo PET but drier. Bias corrected and spatially down-sampled CMIP3 datasets are used to create perturbations for the latter portion of the 21st Century, 2070-2099. The change in precipitation and PET between 1970-1999 and 2070-2099 is applied to radar data from the observed period, 1995-2010. Then GCM-predicted changes in precipitation under the perturbation of historic rainfall accomplishes an important feature, i.e. preserving realistic spatial, temporal, and convective patterns of rainfall typical of the southern plains, which adds confidence to the model-based simulation of future climate impacts. Simulation of the perturbed climate scenarios reveals the system to be precipitation limited, resulting in less sensitivity to warmer conditions and associated increases in PET, compared with more sensitivity to drier precipitation regimes as seen in the figure below showing runoff climatology.",

A total of nine traversals of Swarm over regions of pulsating aurora identified using THEMIS ASI were studied. We used a satellite-aligned keogram to identify when Swarm was within a patch of pulsating aurora. A downward current in the range of ~1-6 μA/m2 can be seen just poleward of the boundary. A weaker upward current of ~1-3 μA/m2 is observed throughout the interior of the patch. The existence of these currents has been reported before but their magnitudes have not been quantified. In this study we quantify the magnitudes, in some cases by using two satellites traversing the same pulsating regions. We also compared Swarm’s two-satellite FAC product to the single-satellite results and determine that the data product can be compromised in regions of pulsating aurora, a phenomenon that occurs over widespread regions and tends to persist for hours.

Their propagation processes strongly depend on the dispersion relationship of EMIC. In our previous study, we statistically studied ion cyclotron whistlers observed by the Akebono satellite around L=2–4. We found that various species of cold ions (e.g. H+, M/Q=2 ion, He+, M/Q=8 ion, O+, and heavier ion than O+) affect to the generation and propagation processes of ion cyclotron whistlers. We examined spatial distributions of such cold ions by analyzing observed ion cyclotron whistlers.\nIn this study, we examine a spatial occurrence distribution and characteristic frequency variation of ion cyclotron whistlers observed by the EMFISIS instrument onboard the Van Allen Probe A. The EMFISIS instrument measures waveforms of full components of electric and magnetic fields. We analyzed the waveform data obtained by the EMFISIS-WFR during 16 months, and detected over 3000 H+ band ion cyclotron whistlers at L inside 2. We found that the normalized crossover frequencies of observed ion cyclotron whistlers are relatively high near the Earth (ω/ΩH+≈0.8 around 600 km altitude) and they decrease with altitude. Under the simple cold plasma approximation, crossover frequency of H+ band EMIC strongly depends on the local heavy ion composition. This result seems to reflect realistic heavy ion density gradient around the Earth. Furthermore, above approximately 1500 km altitude, we found that the normalized frequencies of observed events were almost stable just above 0.5. We calculated relationship between the crossover frequency of H+ band EMIC waves and heavy ion composition, and confirmed that we can explain our observation results when we consider the existence of M/Q=2 ion band in a dispersion relationship of EMIC waves.",

            "abstract": "Ice growing from the vapor, at -5C and liquid water supersaturation, often sheds crystals when it grows along with a small amount of salt solution. The experiments are done with single crystals growing in a temperature-controlled chamber with 5 ml of water in the bottom to maintain and control supersaturation, and the new crystals are detected when they fall into and nucleate the water in the bottom. Crystal growth is initiated by inserting into the growth chamber a pipet tip that contained a few microliters of very dilute salt solution that had been supercooled to -5C and nucleated at the tip. Growth from the vapor ensues, with condensation directly onto ice and onto whatever salt solution is exposed. The results are not completely reproducible, no doubt because the starting details of the exposure of ice and solution is not controllable. However, the shedding of crystals often occurs with starting NaCl concentrations of the order of 0.01 wt. percent, and almost never occurs with “pure” water. The shedding events themselves have not been identified, and an attractive hypothesis for how the shedding of ice occurs has not been found at the time of writing this abstract. By the time of the AGU meeting it is hoped that enough experiments will have been performed in order to say whether this effect is found only near -5C. If it requires a temperature near -5C then it seems to be an attractive explanation of the Hallett-Mossop process. It also, of course, is hoped that an attractive hypothesis for the mechanism of the shedding will have been found.",

            "abstract": "There have been relatively few studies that have quantified the seasonal variability of aerosol chemical and optical properties, as well as cloud-aerosol interactions, over a large portion of the atmospheric column. The Two Column Aerosol Project (TCAP), a U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) supported study, was designed to address this shortcoming with a combination of both ground-based and airborne measurements. The TCAP measurement strategy focused on the aerosol and cloud properties in two columns, one over Cape Cod, Massachusetts and one several hundred kilometers to the east. TCAP included the year-long deployment of the DOE Atmospheric Measurement Program (ARM) Mobile Facility and two individual month-long deployments of the ARM Aerial Facility, in July 2012 and in February 2013. Our work highlights a number of important differences between the summer and winter study periods, including differences in atmospheric flow patterns, the mass loading and chemical composition of the aerosol. The median mass loading of organic aerosol measured at the surface was much larger during July (2.3 μg m-3) than February (0.88 μg m-3). These differences are likely the result of the small amount of biogenic emissions during the winter as well as the reduction in the amount of sunlight available for photochemistry. The amount of sulfate loading was approximately a factor of two larger during February, with a median value of 0.66 μg m-3 compared to only 0.30 μg m-3 measured during July. The median mass loading of nitrate and ammonium did not vary with season, but these two components make up a much larger fraction of the total aerosol mass loading in the winter. Interestingly, the difference in median refractory black carbon (rBC) measured at the surface did not change much between winter and summer (63 ng m-3 during February compared to 70 ng m-3 in July), but the 75th percentile of rBC mass loading is much larger, 127 ng m-3, during July compared to only 95 ng m-3 during February.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between magnetic reconnection and the Plasma Sheet Boundary Layer (PSBL) is still an open problem in magnetospheric physics. While one can understand observed PSBL velocity distributions on the basis of a simple steady state drift-kinetic model with prescribed electric and magnetic fields (e.g., Onsager et al. [1990,1991]), such models do not incorporate the kinetic scale dynamics at the reconnection site. For example, Shay et al. [2011] have argued that the out-of-plane quadrupole magnetic field pattern at the reconnection site can be viewed as an obliquely propagating kinetic Alfv\\'{e}n wave with very large parallel group velocity, the implication being that the field-aligned current structure should quickly become global, though still confined to field lines connected to the ion diffusion region at the reconnection site. This raises the very interesting question: How would such a global wave structure appear in the PSBL on the kinetic scale? Here, we present some first observations of the PSBL by NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission where Fast Plasma Investigation (FPI) Burst Data (30 ms and 150 ms resolution for 3D electron and ion velocity distributions, respectively) is available during intervals where lower resolution (4.5 s) Fast Survey distributions showed evidence of connection to a remote reconnection site. This allows us to test for the first time whether the quadrupole magnetic field structure near the reconnection site -- a local structure already observed by previous spacecraft -- does indeed support a global field-aligned current pattern around the magnetic separatrix. We will also probe for the first time the electron kinetic scale sub-structure of the PSBL and compare with electron-scale features observed near the magnetic separatrix at the dayside magnetopause.",

However, LSTs with high spatial resolution, e.g. tens of meters, are still lack. The purpose of LST downscaling is to generate LSTs with finer spatial resolutions than their native spatial resolutions. The statistical linear or nonlinear regression models are most frequently used for LST downscaling. The basic assumption of these models is the scale-invariant relationships between LST and its descriptors, which is questioned but rare researches have been reported. In addition, few researches can be found for downscaling satellite LST or TIR data to a high spatial resolution, i.e. better than 100 m or even finer. The lack of LST with high spatial resolution cannot satisfy the requirements of applications such as evapotranspiration mapping at the field scale.\nBy selecting a dynamically developing agricultural oasis as the study area, the aim of this study is to downscale the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) LSTs to 15 m, to satisfy the requirement of evapotranspiration mapping at the field scale. Twelve ASTER images from May to September in 2012, covering the entire growth stage of maize, were selected. Four statistical models were evaluated, including one global model, one piecewise model, and two local models. The influence from scale effect in downscaling LST was quantified. The downscaled LSTs are evaluated from accuracy and image quality.\nResults demonstrate that the influence from scale effect varies according to models and the maize growth stage. Significant influence about -4 K to 6 K existed at the early stage and weaker influence existed in the middle stage. When compared with the ground measured LSTs, the downscaled LSTs resulted from the global and local models yielded higher accuracies and better image qualities than the local models. In addition to the vegetation indices, the surface albedo is an important descriptor for downscaling LST through explaining its spatial variation induced by soil moisture.",

Despite the potentially significant implications for the distribution of microbial life on Earth and other water-bearing planetary bodies, our understanding of such environments remains elusive. In the present study we examined fossilized microbial communities and fluid mixing processes in the subseafloor of a Cretaceous ‘Lost City’-type hydrothermal system at the passive Iberia Margin (ODP Leg 149, Hole 897D). Brucite and calcite co-precipitated from mixed fluids ca. 65m below the Cretaceous palaeo-seafloor at temperatures of 32±4°C within steep chemical gradients (fO2, pH, CH4, SO4, ΣCO2, etc) between weathered, carbonate-rich serpentinite breccia and serpentinite. Mixing of oxidized seawater and strongly reducing hydrothermal fluid at moderate temperatures created conditions capable of supporting microbial activity within the oceanic basement. Dense microbial colonies are fossilized in brucite-calcite veins that are strongly enriched in organic carbon but depleted in 13C. We detected a combination of bacterial diether lipid biomarkers, archaeol and archaeal tetraethers analogous to those found in brucite-carbonate chimneys at the active Lost City hydrothermal field. The exposure of mantle rocks to seawater during the breakup of Pangaea fueled chemolithoautotrophic microbial communities at the Iberia Margin during the Cretaceous, possibly before the onset of seafloor spreading in the Atlantic. 'Lost City'-type serpentinization systems have been discovered at mid-ocean ridges, in forearc settings of subduction zones and at continental margins. It appears that, wherever they occur, they can support microbial life, even in deep subseafloor environments as demonstrated in the present study. Because equivalent systems have likely existed throughout most of Earth's history, fluid mixing may have provided the substrates and energy to support a unique subseafloor community of microorganisms over geological timescales.",

            "abstract": "The surfaces of the moons of the outer Solar System are usually considered too cold (30-100 K) for significant chemistry to occur without the input of energy from exogenic sources (such as charged particles or VUV irradiation). In particular, Titan’s thick atmosphere prevents significant amounts of high energy radiation from reaching the surface, limiting opportunities for surface chemical reactivity. Recently, we have identified carbamation, the reaction of carbon dioxide with primary amines to form carbamic acids, as a reaction that could occur thermally on Titan’s surface. Amines should be present on Titan’s surface, formed by photochemical reactions of N2 and CH4 in the upper atmosphere, and amine-containing molecules have been detected as a component of laboratory tholins made in terrestrial laboratories. There is some spectral evidence that CO2 is present on the surface, and CO2 has been definitively identified in the atmosphere. We use a combination of micro-Raman spectroscopy and UHV FTIR spectroscopy to examine the reaction products and kinetics of the carbamation reaction for a variety of primary amines. The reaction occurs readily at Titan surface temperatures (94 K), and leads to both carbamic acids and ammonium carbamate salts. Our kinetic data can be used to estimate the lifetime of CO2 on Titan’s surface, and thus constrain the age of possible CO2-bearing cryovolcanic deposits.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of salt held in surface seawater are becoming ever-more important for oceanographers and climatologists to gain a deeper understanding of ocean circulation and Earth’s water cycle. ESA’s SMOS mission is proving essential for this aim. Launched in 2009, SMOS has provided the longest continuous record (now ~6 years) of sea-surface salinity measurements from space. The salinity of surface seawater is controlled largely by the balance between evaporation and precipitation, but freshwater from rivers and the freezing and melting of ice also cause changes in concentrations. Along with temperature, salinity drives ocean circulation – the thermohaline circulation – which, in turn, plays a key role in the global climate. With a wealth of salinity data from SMOS now in hand complemented by measurements from the NASA–CONAE Aquarius satellite, which uses a different measuring technique. In this talk we shall provide an overview of how the SMOS mission – now celebrating 6 years in orbit – is providing detailed global measurements of SSS. An ensemble of key ocean processes for climate and biochemistry can now be determined and monitored for the first time from space : the detailed salinity structure of tropical instability waves along the equator and the salt exchanged across major oceanic current fronts, the occurrences of large-scale salinity anomalies in the Pacific and Indian oceans related to important climate indexes are also well-evidenced in the six year-long data. In addition, the dispersal of freshwater into the ocean from the major large tropical rivers (Amazon, Orinoco and Congo), their impact on tropical cyclone (TC) intensification and the oceanic imprints of the intense rainfall in the ITCZ and under TC can now be regularly monitored to better understand the variability of the oceanic part of the global water cycle. We will present how SMOS data, along with concurrent in situ Argo ocean-profile data, other satellite observations of sea-surface temperature, sea-surface height, surface-wind stress and ocean colour, are now providing new opportunities to investigate the surface and subsurface ocean mesoscale dynamics. The talk will tentatively illustrate how this type of data synergy is the key to unlock further scientific insight and increase our knowledge of the hydrologic cycle.",

Although biomass burning smoke advected from Mexico and Central America was the dominant source of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) for deep convective cloud formation, the 11 May, 20 May, and 23 May cases exhibited different convective characteristics. The convection in the 11 May and 23 May cases formed in smoke laden environments in the presence of convective available potential energy (CAPE) values exceeding 1000 m2 s-2 and 3000 m2 s-2 along with low-level (0-1 km) shear of 10.3 m s-1 and 5.1 m s-1, respectively. The 11 May case had linear convection while the 23 May case featured discrete supercells. The 20 May case featured elevated linear convection that formed in a more moist environment with cleaner aerosol conditions, weak CAPE (<50 m2 s-2), and stronger low-level shear (25.6 m s-1). Though the 20 May case had the highest precipitation amount and duration, the 23 May case had the highest ice water content (IWC) in the upper levels of the convection (>9 km) suggesting a warm rain suppression mechanism caused by a combination of strong aerosol loading, large CAPE, and weak low-level wind shear. The observed results for the 20 May and 23 May cases agree well with recent modeling studies that simulated the convection and precipitation in these cases. Furthermore, the modeling of the 11 May case is suggested since the abundant amount of smoke CCN did not greatly enhance the overall precipitation amount and could be a possible aerosol-induced precipitation suppression case.",

            "abstract": "The mechanical weakness of faults has long been a fundamental issue in faulting and earthquake mechanics studies. Studies of core and outcrop samples obtained from major faults, including the San Andreas Fault and subduction megathrusts, and laboratory friction experiments on natural and synthetic fault gouges all document that clay minerals are one likely explanation for fault weakness. While laboratory experiments have shown that clays are frictionally weak, with friction coefficients (μ) as low as 0.08-0.2 for smectite family minerals, and that μ varies systematically with clay content, the effects of microstructure, composition, and the evolution of friction throughout shearing of clay-rich gouges is not well understood. To investigate these processes, we conducted shearing experiments on two-phase synthetic gouges of varying proportions of quartz and Ca-montmorillonite. We then studied the resulting microstructures to test the hypothesis that as clay-rich gouges are sheared, clay minerals align and form discrete through-going surfaces that lead to reduced strength.\nExperiments were run in a double direct shear geometry at room temperature and normal stresses of 25 MPa. Samples were sheared at a constant velocity of 10μm/s. Sheared “wafers” were recovered for scanning electron microscope (SEM) analyses. Our preliminary results yield values of μ = 0.35-0.62 for mixtures ranging from 10%-90% clay, and document a decrease in μ with clay content, consistent with previous studies. Additionally, we observe a characteristic peak and then drop in shear strength at the beginning of shearing. The magnitude of this peak increases with clay content. Ongoing analysis of fabrics will systematically assess the relationship between microstructures, clay alignment, and the evolution of friction for our synthetic gouges as well as for a suite of natural clay-rich fault rocks from exhumed subduction thrusts. We expect that with clay content and shear strain increases, fabrics that form will control not only gouge weakness, but will also affect gouge permeability. ",

ERA-20CM is an ensemble of Atmospheric Model simulations forced by an ensemble of 10 different realizations of prescribed SSTs and by radiative forcing that follow CMIP5 protocol. ERA-20C is similarly forced, but, additionally, it assimilates surface pressure and marine winds. Therefore, this comparison allows to evidence the effect of the assimilation of surface observations on HC characteristics and trends. In fact differences are relevant. The HCs are weaker and the whole Northern Hemisphere HC is located more southward in ERA-20C than in ERA-20CM. Further, magnitude of trends is larger and more statistically significant in ERA-20C than in ERA-20CM and only ERA-20C supports centennial changes of the HC strength. In general, both datasets show the presence of large multi-decadal variability, which make uncertain the interpretation of all features of the recent behavior of the HC as the onset of sustained long term trends. However, the southward shift of the Southern Edge of the Southern Hemisphere HC and widening of the Southern Hemisphere HC appear as a robust feature in both datasets. In fact, though actual expansion rates remain uncertain, both ERA-20C and ERA-20CM support the impact of global warming on the widening of the HCs and show that it is larger for the Southern Hemisphere than for the northern Hemisphere HC.",

            "abstract": "Surface igneous rocks shed light onto the chemistry, tectonic, and thermal state of planetary interiors. For the purpose of comparative planetology, therefore, it is critical to fully utilize the compositional diversity of igneous rocks for different terrestrial planets. For Mars, igneous float rocks and conglomerate clasts at Gale Crater, as analyzed by ChemCam [1] using a new calibration [2], have a larger range in chemistry than have been analyzed at any other landing site or within the Martian meteorite collection [3, 4]. These rocks may reflect different conditions of melting within the Martian interior than any previously analyzed basalts. Here we present new formation conditions for basaltic and trachybasalt/dioritic rocks at Gale Crater from ChemCam analyses following previous procedures [5, 6]. We then compare these estimates of basalt formation with previous estimates for rocks from the Noachian (Gusev Crater, Meridiani Planum, and a clast in the NWA 7034 meteorite [5, 6]), Hesperian (surface volcanics [7]), and Amazonian (surface volcanics and shergottites [7-8]), to calculate an average mantle potential temperature for different Martian epochs and investigate how the interior of Mars has changed through time. Finally, we will compare Martian mantle potential temperatures with petrologic estimate of cooling for the Earth. Our calculated estimate for the mantle potential temperature (TP) of rocks at Gale Crater is 1450 ± 45 °C which is within error of previous estimates for Noachian aged rocks [5, 6]. The TP estimates for the Hesperian and Amazonian, based on orbital analyses of the crust [7], are lower in temperature than the estimates for the Noachian. Our results are consistent with simple convective cooling of the Martian interior.\n[1] Wiens R. et al. (2012) Space Sci Rev 170. 167-227. [2] Anderson R. et al. (2015) LPSC. Abstract #7031.

GEOS-TASO instrument is a prototype instrument of TEMPO (Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring of Pollution), which will be launched in 2022 to measure aerosols, O3, and other trace gases from a geostationary orbit over the N-America.\nThe theoretical framework of optimized inversion algorithm and the information content analysis such as degree of freedom for signal (DFS) will be discussed for hyperspectral remote sensing in visible bands, as well as the application to GEO-TASO, which has mounted on the NASA HU-25C aircraft and gathered several days’ of airborne hyperspectral data for our studies. Based on the optimization theory and different from the traditional lookup table (LUT) retrieval technique, our inversion method intends to retrieve the aerosol parameters and surface reflectance simultaneously, in which UNL-VRTM (UNified Linearized Radiative Transfer Model) is employed for forward model and Jacobians calculation, meanwhile, principal component analysis (PCA) is used to constrain the hyperspectral surface reflectance.\nThe information content analysis provides the theoretical analysis guidance about what kind of aerosol parameters could be retrieved from GeoTASO hyperspectral remote sensing to the practical inversion study. Besides, the inversion conducted iteratively until the modeled spectral radiance fits with GeoTASO measurements by a Quasi-Newton method called L-BFGS-B (Large scale BFGS Bound constrained). Finally, the retrieval results of aerosol optical depth and other aerosol parameters are compared against those retrieved by AEROENT and/or in situ measurements such as DISCOVER-AQ during the aircraft campaign.",

Less attention has focused on the englacial water system that connects surface meltwater sources to the basal drainage system. Observations of englacial drainage have revealed diametrically opposed behaviors, so that understanding the role of the englacial system is critical to developing knowledge of ice sheet responses. The englacial connections either enhance or limit subglacial processes, including sliding. Some observations show cases where water drainage is mainly through an englacial system of fractures so that water flow at the bed is stunted. Other observations show static englacial water systems that play little role in drainage with primary drainage routes being along the bed. Here, we use a thermomechanical model of englacial water flow to understand the interaction between ice and water along these connections. We assume that water flow is through a series of connected fractures analogous to crevassed Greenland outlet glaciers. The fractures are modified by ice flow, and freezing and melting of the water system. Simple mathematical analyses show trade offs between closure rates and melting rates that determine the englacial flowpaths. From numerical experiments, we show that the dominance of englacial flow follows the locations of both bed overdeepenings and areas where the basal water system is compressed dynamically. The preponderance of overdeependenings in Greenland suggests that englacial systems may be favored in critical areas of ice sheet flow. We conclude by relating the insights from the analytic and numerical results to the broad scale patterns of change of the Greenland Ice Sheet.",

However, to understand the impacts of agricultural practices at a larger scale, it is essential to consider the variability of landscape characteristics along with management treatments. This study compared N2O emissions from a fertilizer-based, conventionally managed farm and an organically managed farm that uses legume cover crops as a primary nutrient source. The objective of the study was to assess how management regimes and slope positions interact to impact N2O emissions and soil characteristics. The field experiment was conducted in two adjacent grain farms in upstate New York that both have been under consistent management for 20 years. In the organic farm, red clover was frost-seeded into a winter grain (spelt), and then incorporated in the spring as a nutrient source for the subsequent corn plants. In contrast, the conventionally managed farm used inorganic fertilizer as the nutrient source. Gas measurement was conducted at two landscape positions at both farms: 1) shoulder and 2) toeslope positions. Comparable N2O emissions were found in the clover-corn phase in the organic site and the bare fallow-corn phase in the conventional site. The spelt-corn phase in the organic farm had the lowest N2O emissions. Soil nitrate concentration was the best predictor for seasonal average N2O emissions. The impact of landscape position on N2O emissions was only found in the conventional site, which was driven by higher denitrfication at toeslopes. In the organic farm, such effect was confounded by higher clover biomass at shoulder slopes. Our study shows that the impact of landscape characteristics on N2O emissions could differ across sites based on the complex interplay between environmental conditions and management.",

The region provides a unique natural laboratory to study the dynamics of continental subduction. However, the configuration of plate boundaries in the system is poorly constrained, the number of plates involved is debated, and the distribution of convergence over the Anatolian subduction zones remains poorly constrained.\nThe thin-skinned Taurides fold-thrust belt in the South of Anatolia was formed by the accretion of a carbonate platform during continental subduction below oceanic lithosphere. The platform was part of a continental fragment that rifted and drifted from Gondwana’s northern margin in the Early Mesozoic.\nWe aim to use kinematic constraints to reconstruct the plate configuration through time. In this contribution, we present the first balanced cross section of the Taurides fold-thrust belt. We show more than 150 km of east-west shortening, at a high angle to overall Africa-Eurasia convergence, from the Late Cretaceous until at least the Pliocene. Three to four km of stratigraphy, ranging from Precambrian to Miocene age is incorporated in nappes.\nOur shortening estimate is the first step in reconstructing the initial configuration of the subduction zone geometrical evolution, and the paleogeography of the accreted carbonate platform. The rate of convergence can be determined, and convergence obliquity can be estimated.\nThis cross section will be complimented with further sections, a thermochronology study, and a palaeomagnetic study, to create a detailed 2.5D reconstruction of the orogenesis through time.",

Understanding the coupling of geochemical and geomechanical processes is critical for predicting and identifying leakage pathways for environmentally-relevant fluids in the subsurface. This study couples a two-dimensional reactive transport model with a mechanical deformation model to simulate reaction, flow and deformation in a fractured carbonate rock under subsurface confining pressures. The fracture is represented as a homogenous calcite material subjected to high-pressure reactive CO2-acidified brine, and the dissolution reaction is modeled to be kinetically-limited by carbonic acid. Initial conditions for the simulations were based on fractured Indiana Limestone geometries obtained from xCT data. Simulation of reactive flow results in the enlargement of apertures and reduction in contact area along preferential flow paths, while apertures outside these channelized flow paths remain relatively unchanged. At high confining pressures, contact area occurred mainly in regions where channelization did not occur, resulting in a two- to three-fold reduction in the fracture specific stiffness. Moreover, at high confining stresses, channelized regions were preserved, enabling permeability to remain relatively unchanged compared to non-channelized regions, which in contrast showed an order of magnitude decrease in permeability when stressed. These simulations suggest that differences in dissolution patterns can lead to significant variations in fracture permeability and stiffness when subject to subsurface confining stresses. This work has important applications for geologic carbon sequestration, natural gas storage, hydraulic fracturing, geothermal energy and deep well injection of hazardous waste.",

We shall investigate the thermal processes and timescales in a crystallizing, static magma column, with a heat flow model of Soufriere Hills Volcano (SHV), Montserrat. The latent heat of crystallization is initially computed with MELTS, as a function of pressure and temperature for an andesitic melt (SHV groundmass starting composition). Three fractional crystallization simulations are performed; two with initial pressures of 34MPa (runs 1 & 2) and one of 25MPa (run 3). Decompression rate was varied between 0.1MPa/°C (runs 1 & 3) and 0.2MPa/°C (run 2). Natural and experimental matrix glass compositions are accurately reproduced by all MELTS runs. The cumulative latent heat released for runs 1, 2 and 3 differs by less than 9% (8.69e5 J/kg*K, 9.32e5 J/kg*K, and 9.49e5 J/kg*K respectively). The 2D axisymmetric conductive cooling simulations consider a 30m-diameter conduit that extends from the surface to a depth of 1500m (34MPa). The temporal evolution of temperature is closely tracked at depths of 10m, 750m and 1400m in the center of the conduit, at the conduit walls, and 20m from the walls into the host rock. Following initial cooling by 7-15oC at 10m depth inside the conduit, the magma temperature rebounds through latent heat release by 32-35oC over 85-123 days to a maximum temperature of 1002-1005oC. At 10 m depth, it takes 4.1–9.2 years for the magma column to cool over 108-130oC and crystallize to 75wt%, at which point it cannot be easily remobilized. It takes 11-31.5 years to reach the same crystallinity at 750-1400m depth. We find a wide range in cooling timescales, particularly at depths of 750m or greater, attributed to the initial run pressure and dominant latent heat producing crystallizing phases (Quartz), where run 1 cools fastest and run 3 cools slowest. Surface cooling by comparison has the strongest influence on the upper tens of meters in all runs.",

These ecosystems are widely valued for providing forage for domestic livestock and a suite of important ecosystem goods and services including carbon (C) storage. Despite storing more than 30 % of soil C globally, the effect of both livestock grazing and the associated change in plant community structure in response to grazing on C and nutrient cycling remains uncertain. To gain a quantitative understanding of the direct and indirect effects of livestock grazing on C and nutrient cycling, we established study sites at 15 existing site localities with paired long-term grazing (ca. 30 y) and non-grazed treatments (totaling 30 unique plant communities). Our sites were distributed widely across Alberta in three distinct grassland bioclimatic zones allowing us to make comparisons across the broad range of climate variability typical of western Canadian grasslands. In each plant community we decomposed 5 common plant species that are known to increase or decrease in response to grazing pressure, a unique plant community sample, and a cellulose paper control. We measured mass loss, initial lignin, C and N concentrations at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months of field incubation. In addition we assayed hydrolytic and oxidative extracellular enzymes associated with for C (n= 5 hydrolytic; phenoloxidase and peroxidase) and nutrients (i.e. N and P; n=1 ea.) cycling from each litter sample at each collection. Our results suggest that by changing the plant community structure, grazing can affect rates of decomposition and associated biogeochemical cycling by changing plant species and associated litter inputs. Moreover, measures of microbial function are controlled by site-specific conditions (e.g. temperature and precipitation), litter chemistry over the course of our incubation.",

The sedimentary sequence consists of 17 lignite layers below 1.5 km bellow the seafloor. Microbiological and geochemical data consistently showed evidence for the existence of microbial communities associated with lignite coal beds in the coal-bearing sediments (Inagaki and Hinrichs et al., Science, 2015). Since lignite coals produce substantial dissolved organic compounds during the burial alternation process, volatile fatty acids may play important roles for microbial life and its activity in the deep sedimentary environment. To address this hypothesis, we measured methanogenic and acetate-oxidation activities by radiotracer incubation experiments using 14C-labelled substrate ([2-14C]-acetate) immediately after core recovery. Activity of aceticlastic methanogenesis was observed in the sediment above the coal-baring layers (>1990 mbsf), ranging from 0.2 to 1.2 pmol cm-3 d-1. The highest activity was observed in a coal-bed horizon at 1990 mbsf. However, aceticlastic methanogenesis was below the detection limit in sediment samples below the 2 km-coal layers. Activity of acetate oxidation to CO2 was measured by 14CO2 production rate from [2-14C]-acetate. Interestingly, the acetate-oxidation activity was observed in sediments above the coal beds, which values were generally higher than those of methanogenesis with the maximum value of 33 pmol cm-3 d-1 at 1800 mbsf. The rates gradually decreased with increasing depth from 1800 mbsf and reached below the detection limit (i.e., 0.05 pmol cm-3 d-1) in 2 km-deep coal-bed samples. The occurrence of relatively high acetate oxidation at ~1800 mbsf above the coal formation suggests that microbes respire acetate with available electron acceptors such as glauconitic iron oxides in the deep sedimentary environment.",

            "abstract": "Snow cover and its melt dominate regional climate and water resources in the world’s mountain regions, providing for critical agricultural and sustaining populations in otherwise dry regions. Snowmelt timing and magnitude in mountains tend to be controlled by absorption of solar radiation and snow water equivalent, respectively, and yet both of these are very poorly known even in the best-instrumented mountain regions of the globe.\nIn this talk, we discuss developments in the spaceborne and airborne remote sensing of snow properties, and the assimilation of these products into research water cycle modeling and operational forecasting. Our work with the NWS Colorado Basin River Forecast Center has shown marked improvements in runoff forecasting through inclusion of MODIS and VIIRS fractional snow covered area data. Moreover, the analyses have shown that the CBRFC forecasting errors are strongly sensitive to actual dust radiative forcing in snow with rising limb excursions as large as 40%. With MODIS retrievals of dust radiative forcing, the CBRFC will be implementing modifications to forecasts to reduce those errors to order < 10%.\nIn the last few years, the NASA Airborne Snow Observatory has emerged to provide the first spatially explicit distributions of snow water equivalent and coincident snow albedo products for mountain basins. ASO is an imaging spectrometer and imaging LiDAR system, to quantify snow water equivalent and snow albedo, provide unprecedented knowledge of snow properties, and provide complete, robust inputs to snowmelt runoff models, water management models, and systems of the future. ASO has been flying in the Western US for three snowmelt seasons. In 2015, ASO provided complete basin coverage for the Tuolumne, Merced, Lakes, Rush Creek, and Middle+South Forks of Kings River Basins in the California Sierra Nevada and the Upper Rio Grande, Conejos, and Uncompahgre Basins in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. Analyses show that with ASO data, river flows and reservoir inflows from the ASO acquisition date to 1 July can be estimated with uncertainties of less than 2%. The synergy of the ASO and the satellite retrievals will ultimately allow extension of quantitative knowledge to addressing the snowmelt water resources and availability for agricultural regions in sparsely instrumented regions of the globe.",

We simulate N2/CO2 binary gas mixture injection into marine and terrestrial methane hydrate bearing sediments. Different compositions of the injected gas can lead to four possible outcomes: 1) Injected gas flows downstream past methane hydrate and does not alter the methane hydrate, 2) Injected gas causes complete dissociation of methane hydrate, which creates a gas mixture of methane and injected gas that flows downstream, 3) Injected gas causes complete dissociation of methane hydrate with flow of methane gas downstream and all injected gas replaces methane in the hydrate cage, 4) Injected gas causes partial dissociation of methane hydrate with some replacement of methane in the hydrate cage and downstream flow of a methane and injected gas mixture. We focus on how composition of injected gas affects the outcome of the injection process, and then determine the optimal injection mixture of N2/CO2 for carbon dioxide storage and methane production. Our simulations combine dynamic flash calculations using the Gibbs energy minimization of Ballard and Sloan (2004) with 1-d reactive transport modeling. This work provides insight into the efficiency of the guest molecule exchange process in methane hydrate systems. Our results can be directly incorporated into simulations of more complex geometries and field settings such as the Ignik Sikumi Gas Hydrate Field Trial.\n",

The spatial variations in the magnitude of the Hurst exponent in the observed sea level tide gauge records seem to follow regular patterns that is potentially important for understanding sea level changes and for developing an adequate noise model required by an accurate sea level trend estimation. Here, we address the key question: Do the climate models reproduce the universal power law behavior observed in tide gauge sea level records? We compare the spatial distribution of the Hurst exponents derived from tide gauge observations with those predicted by 36 Atmosphere–Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs), contributing to the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), and discuss the possible links between the scaling and the main features of the global ocean-atmosphere circulation.",

SFLAI is expected to be a standard product from the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) on board the joint NOAA, NASA and US Air Force Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) mission, which was successfully launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on February 11, 2015. The DSCOVR EPIC sensor orbiting the Sun-Earth Lagrange L1 point provides multispectral measurements of the radiation reflected by Earth in retro-illumination directions. This poster discusses a methodology for estimating the SFLA using LAI-2000 Canopy Analyzer, which is expected to underlie the strategy for validation of the DSCOVR EPIC land surface products. LAI-2000 data collected over 18 coniferous and broadleaf sites in Hyytiälä, Central Finland, were used to estimate the SFLA. Field data on canopy geometry were used to simulate selected sites. Their SFLAI was calculated using a Monte Carlo (MC) technique. LAI-2000 estimates of SFLA showed a very good agreement with MC results, suggesting validity of the proposed approach.",

Understanding the mechanism and features of Rossby waves are crucial for millions of people, especially due to the extreme events caused by Rossby Waves such as the Russian Heat Wave and the flood in Pakistan, both occurring in 2010. In this study, we use an idealized, regional, quasi-geostrophic, coupled ocean-atmosphere model (The Quasi-Geostrophic Coupled Model, or QGCM) to create Rossby waves in the northern hemisphere. We analyze these waves using the emerging technique of climate networks - a useful statistical tool for a range of complex systems, which has proven to be extremely useful in giving new insight into the climate system’s behavior. Here, we create networks using different climatic variables, and investigate the properties of Rossby waves, including propagation speed and energy transport. We look at network measures, such as degree and link length, to determine the major features of Rossby waves. Finally, we compare our results to observed data, and show how our findings provide a better understanding of the different regimes of Rossby Waves, their features, and mechanisms of their propagation, which is crucial for forecasting on short and long-range time scales.",

Uncertainties are particularly high in areas where data for model calibration and evaluation are scarce or unavailable. This study presents recent developments in the hydrological modeling over the Tigris-Euphrates River basin. An intercomparison effort is performed in order to determine how models and meteorological forcings represent physical processes. In this sense, multiple experiments are performed using state-of-the-art capabilities implemented in the NASA Land Information System (LIS).\nThe NASA Modern Era Retrospective Reanalysis for Applications (MERRA) and Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS) meteorological datasets are used as main forcings. Additional experiments are performed replacing their precipitation with the Climate Hazards Group Infra-Red Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) dataset. Both Catchment and Noah land surface models coupled with the Hydrological Modeling and Analysis Platform (HyMAP) river routing scheme are considered to simulate the water budget and surface water dynamics. Due to the scarce ground-based data availability, satellite-based estimates of the terrestrial water storage, evapotranspiration, water level and floodplain extent are used as complimentary information to evaluate the hydrological behavior in the basin. In particular, the water shortage observed in 2015 in that region is analyzed based on model outputs. Finally, we discuss prospects and challenges in considering anthropogenic impacts (irrigation and dams) on the hydrological modeling of the basin.",

            "abstract": "Marine gravity, derived from satellite radar altimetry, is a powerful tool for mapping tectonic structures, especially in the deep ocean basins where the topography remains unmapped by ships or is buried by thick sediment. The ability to infer seafloor tectonics from space was first demonstrated in 1978 using Seasat altimeter data but the spatial coverage was incomplete because of the short three-month lifetime of the satellite. Most ocean altimeters have repeat ground tracks with spacings of hundreds of kilometers so they do not resolve tectonic structures. Adequate altimeter coverage became available in 1995 when the United States Navy declassified the Geosat radar altimeter data and the ERS-1 altimeter completed a 1-year mapping phase. These mid-1990’s altimeter-derived images of the ocean basins remained static for 15 years because there were no new non-repeat altimeter missions. This situation changed dramatically in 2010 when CryoSat-2, with its advanced radar altimeter, was launched into a non-repeat orbit and continues to collect data until perhaps 2020. In addition the Jason-1 altimeter was placed into a 14-month geodetic phase at the end of its lifetime. More recently the 1.5 times higher precision measurements from the AltiKa altimeter aboard the SARAL spacecraft began to drift away from its 35-day repeat trackline. The Chinese HY-2 altimeter is scheduled to begin a dense mapping phase in early 2016. Moreover in 2020 we may enjoy significantly higher resolution maps of the ocean basins from the planned SWOT altimeter mission with its advanced swath mapping ability.\nAll of this new data will provide a much sharper image of the tectonics of the deep ocean basins and continental margins. During this talk we will tour of the new tectonic structures revealed by CryoSat-2 and Jason-1 and speculate on the tectonic views of the ocean basins in 2020 and beyond.",

Hurricanes—though helping to maintain the elevation of coastal wetlands by depositing large amounts of sediments—pose one of the largest threats for coastal marshes in terms of eroding shorelines, scouring marsh surfaces, and resuspending sediments. Coastal marshes phenologies can be important for understanding broad response of marshes to stressors, like hurricanes. We investigated the phenological impacts of Katrina and Gustav (Category 3 and 2 hurricanes at landfall in southeast Louisiana on 29 August, 2005, and 1 September, 2008, respectively) on freshwater, intermediate, brackish, and saline marshes in southeastern Louisiana. Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index data were processed using ENVI 4.8. Phenological patterns of the marshes were modeled using a nonlinear mixed model using SAS 9.4. We created and compared marsh phenologies of 1994 and 2014, the reference years, to those of 2005 and 2008, the hurricane years. Preliminary results show that in normal years: (1) the NDVI of four marsh types peaked in July; (2) freshwater marshes had the highest peak NDVI, followed by intermediate, brackish, and saline marshes; and (3) the growth durations of the marshes are around three to six months. In 2005, the major phenological change was shortening of growth duration, which was most obvious for intermediate and brackish marshes. The peak NDVI values of the four marsh types were not affected because the hurricane occurred at the end of August, one month after the peak NDVI time. By comparison, there was no obvious phenological impact on the marshes by Gustav (2008) with respect to peak NDVI, peak NDVI day, and growth duration.",

In humans, consumption of CH3Hg contaminated marine fish is the major route of mercury exposure. However, our understanding of CH3Hg transformation pathways is still incomplete. To close this knowledge gap, we propose to explore the stable carbon isotopic composition (δ13C) of the methyl group of CH3Hg for a better understanding of its sources and transformation mechanisms. The method developed for the determination of the δ13C value of CH3Hg in biological samples involves (i) CH3Hg selective extraction, (ii) derivatization, and (iii) separation by gas chromatography (GC) prior to analysis by combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry (C-IRMS). We present the figures of merit of this novel method and the first δ13C signatures for certified materials (ERM-CE464, BCR414) and biological samples at different marine trophic levels (i.e., tuna fish, zooplankton). The implications of this new approach to trace the pathways associated with Hg methylation and the mechanisms involved will be discussed.",

Proc. 19, 20, pp. 4055–4068.) using the equation 1. : E T daily = ∑ i=1 24 ( Q max - Q i ) Δ t , where E T daily is the daily loss of water from the catchment through ET, Q max is the daily maximum flow rate in the river, Q i is the average flow rate for every hour of the day and Δ t is one hour.\nOur results show that land use conversion from grasslands to wattle has increased ET by 40.97mm which is to the order of 60% during the period of the study (table 1)\n. This has immediate relevance for dry season flows in the region. Nilgiris provide 40% of the total hydro-power generation for the state of Tamil Nadu and these streams sustain biodiversity and are tributaries of the Cauvery river, the largest the state. They also highlight the potential consequences of programmes such as the National Mission for Greening India which explicitly targets conversions of 10m ha of degraded forests, scrub and grasslands to tree cover and forest.\nGrassland\nWattle\nDifference\n1st Qu.\n1.14\n1.36\n-1.33\nMedian\n1.94\n2.04\n0.28\nMean\n2.06\n2.97\n0.91\n3rd Qu.\n2.66\n3.51\n2.43\nSum\n92.63\n133.60\n40.97\nTable 1:\nSummary statistics for daily dry season ET for catchment under grassland, wattle and the daily differences between the two in mm per day.",

Major occurrences are represented by hybrid products, enclaves and crystals in disequilibrium with the melt. According to present knowledge the complete mixing of magmas in crustal reservoirs (leading to the production of hybrids) requires a low viscosity contrast between the two end-members (0.5 log unit). On another hand, recent experimental and field works have shown that (1) crystal-free magmas with viscosity difference of 3 orders of magnitude produced mingling and mixing features at higher deformation conditions (strain and strain rate) and (2) these features are found in volcanic products out of the above mentioned rheological window. In this study, we performed magma mixing experiments, to test the effects of chaotic deformation of a two component system at volcanic conditions and strain rates comparable to natural magmatic systems (volcanic conduits and lava flows): in the ChaOtic Magma Mixing Apparatus (COMMA) installed at the University of Perugia, a synthetic haplotonalite and a natural basalt from Santorini volcano were juxtaposed and chaotically mixed for several hours at ~1140°C with a moderate strain rate of ~5.10-3. The textural and geochemical (electronic microprobe, laser ablation mass spectrometry) features developed during the experiments show the development of complex patterns with high inter-exchange between both magmas. Our results show how chaotic convection extends the mixing capacities at moderate strain rate.",

The ap(531) and ag(531) semi-analytically derived using SAA model are quite different from the retrievals procedures of QAA model that ap(531) and ag(531) are semi-analytically derived from the empirical retrievals results of a(531) and a(551). The two models are calibrated and evaluated against datasets taken from 19 independent cruises in West Florida Shelf in 1999-2003, provided by SeaBASS. The results indicate that the SAA model produces a superior performance to QAA model in absorption retrieval. Using of the SAA model in retrieving absorption coefficients of optically active constituents from West Florida Shelf decreases the random uncertainty of estimation by >23.05% from the QAA model. This study demonstrates the potential of the SAA model in absorption coefficients of optically active constituents estimating even in turbid coastal waters.\nKeywords: Remote sensing; Coastal Water; Absorption Coefficient; Semi-analytical Model",

Standard operating protocols have been developed to ensure the collection of uniform and high-quality monitoring data. However, recent published laboratory and field research has pointed to the underestimation of GOM using KCl-coated denuders in humid and/or ozone-rich environments. Under very dry conditions, contamination of the Tekran® regenerable particle filter used to collect PBM can lead to the conversion of GEM to PBM, and a subsequent overestimation of reactive mercury (RM) concentrations. In March 2015 we deployed a total mercury (TM)/GEM detector at NOAA’s Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO: Elevation 3397 m) on the island of Hawaii, to calculate reactive mercury (RM = GOM + PBM) as the difference of TM – GEM. We also installed a second Tekran® speciation system to accompany an identical system operating at MLO since 2011. We will present side-by-side comparisons of ambient data collected by the three instruments under a variety of conditions, as well as measured performance parameters assessed using a GOM calibration device. Initial results confirm the degradation of GOM measurement under even moderate levels of humidity, but also suggest that current AMNet sampling and data reduction protocols can exacerbate the problem.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing has been widely used for mapping and characterizing changes in forest cover, but the available remote sensing forest change products are not discriminating between deforestation (permanent transition from forest to non forest) and industrial forest management (logging followed by regrowth, with no land cover/ land use class change) (Hansen et al, 2010). Current estimates of carbon-equivalent emissions report the contribution of deforestation as 12% of total anthropogenic carbon emissions (van der Werf et al., 2009), but accurate monitoring of forest carbon balance should discriminate between land use change related to forest natural disturbances, and forest management. The total change in forest cover (Gross Forest Cover Loss, GFLC) needs to be characterized based on the cause (natural/human) and on the outcome of the change (regeneration to forest/transition to non/forest)(Kurtz et al, 2010). This paper presents the methodology used to classify the forest loss detected by the University of Maryland Global Forest Change product (Hansen, 2013) into deforestation, disturbances (fires, insect outbreaks) and industrial forest clearcuts. The industrial forest clearcuts were subsequently analysed by converting the pixel based detections into objects, and applying patch level metrics (e.g. size, compactness, straightness of boundaries) and contextual measures. The analysis is stratified by region and by dominant forest specie, to highlight changes in the rate of forest resource utilization in the 2003-2013 period covered by the Maryland Forest Cover Change Product.\n",

            "abstract": "How bottom-near hydrographic and sedimentary processes control the formation of bottom-current related confined deep-sea depocenters remains widely speculative. The geological approach of this study uses a transect of sediment cores and sediment echosounder profiles across a whole contourite system off NW Spain. This “mounded patch”-type contourite drift (18 km long, 20 km wide) with a 150-m deep moat has formed around an 800-m high structural obstacle. Past deposition was characterized by alternating calm and high-energy bottom-flow conditions. Calm conditions (Last Glacial period: 27–17 cal ka BP; late Holocene times: < 4 cal ka BP) led to slightly current-influenced deposition of fine-grained sediments (10 µm) over the entire basin. In contrast, waxing-and-waning high-energy conditions (D/O events during Marine Isotope Stage 3; the Deglacial/early Holocene time interval at 17–4 cal ka BP) resulted in coarse grained (70 µm) deposition.\nProcess-based numerical modelling demonstrates that pulse-like oceanic density fronts travelling within the transition zone of two water masses (Labrador Sea Water, Mediterranean Outflow Water) provide a powerful mechanism for contouritic deposition, rather than the core of a water mass itself. These gravity-driven density fronts lead to local re-suspension of sand from the moat and to subsequent upward transport over the crest. Here, the oceanic density fronts produce additional km-scale eddies. These migrating eddies provide an efficient mechanism for further widespread sediment re-distribution. In comparison with paleoceanographic reconstructions, a downward migration or expansion of the Mediterranean Outflow Water by about 300 m led most probably to such temporary contouritic sand deposition.\nWe finally propose a conceptual model to explain how seafloor obstacles redirect and perturbate bottom currents. This model proposes water mass transition zone as an important high-energy medium, for oceanic density fronts to travel. On the respective time scale, the moat itself seems to act as the main source for those sands, making a remote source and a long-distance sediment transport unnecessary.",

Although it was hit by a Mw 8.2 earthquake on April 1st 2014, which caused moderate damage, geophysical evidence still suggests that there is potential for a larger event, so a thorough risk assessment is key to understand the physical, social, and economic effects of such potential event, and devise appropriate mitigation plans. Hence, Iquique has been selected as a prime study case for the implementation of a risk assessment platform in Chile.\nOur study integrates research on three main elements of risk calculations: hazard evaluation, exposure model, and physical vulnerabilities. To characterize the hazard field, a set of synthetic seismic scenarios have been developed based on plate interlocking and the residual slip potential that results from subtracting the slip occurred during the April 1st 2014 rupture fault mechanism, obtained using InSAR+GPS inversion. Additional scenarios were developed based of the fault rupture model of the Maule 2010 Mw 8.8 earthquake and on the local plate locking models in northern Chile. These rupture models define a collection of possible realizations of earthquake geometries parameterized in terms of critical variables like slip magnitude, rise time, mean propagation velocity, directivity, and other, which are propagated to obtain a hazard map for Iquique (e.g. PGA, PGV, PDG).\nFurthermore, a large body of public and local data was used to construct a detailed exposure model for Iquique, including aggregated building count, demographics, essential facilities, and lifelines. This model together with the PGA maps for the April 1st 2014 earthquake are used to calibrate HAZUS outputs against observed damage, and adjust the fragility curves of physical systems according to more detailed analyses of typical Chilean building types and their structural properties, plus historical empirical building data. As a result, we were able to perform a deterministic seismic risk assessment for the collection of scenarios we have generated, and thus estimate their expected impact on the built environment and indirectly on the population. This enables us to evaluate the effect of different technical and social mitigation measures in the future.",

            "abstract": "Partly in anticipation of an imminent megathrust earthquake, a significant amount of seismic data has been collected over the past several years in northern Chile by local deployments of seismometers. In this study we generate elastic wavespeed images of the crust and upper mantle using a combination of body wave arrival times and surface wave dispersion curves. The body wave data set consists of 130000 P and 108000 S wave arrival times generated by 12000 earthquakes recorded locally over a period of 25 years by networks comprising about 360 stations. The surface wave data set consists of Rayleigh wave dispersion curves determined from ambient noise recorded by 60 broad band stations from three different networks over a period of three years. Transit time biases due to an uneven distribution of noise were estimated using a technique based on that of Yao and van der Hilst (2009) and found to be as high as 5% for some station pairs. We jointly invert the body and surface wave observations to both improve the overall resolution of the crustal images and reduce the trade-off between shallow and deep structures in the images of the subducted slab. Of particular interest in these images are three regions of anomalous Vp/Vs: (1) An extensive zone of low Vp/Vs (1.68) correlates with trench-parallel magmatic belts emplaced in the upper continental crust. In the region of the coast and continental slope, low Vp/Vs corresponds to batholithic structures in the Jurassic-Cretaceous magmatic arc. Between the central depression and Domeyko Cordillera, low Vp/Vs correlates with the distribution of magmatic arcs of Paleocene-Oligocene and Eocene-Oligocene age. Low Vp/Vs also correlates with the location of the Mejillones Peninsula. (2) A region of high Vp/Vs occurs in what is most likely the serpentinized wedge of the subduction zone. (3) An additional zone of low Vp/Vs is located in the middle of the double seismic zone at depths of 90-110 km. This region may exist all along the imaged part of the subduction zone, although it appears to be interrupted where the slab changes strike and the anomaly is more pronounced in the north than in the south. We suggest that the increased strength within a dehydrated region corresponding to this low Vp/Vs region could be responsible for the existence of the double seismic zone.",

            "abstract": "The Canadian prairies are cold and dry. Surface depressions are ubiquitous, and contain permanent or ephemeral ponds. The ponds are filled by snowmelt and precipitation on the ponds and lose a significant portion of their water to evaporation, but also, depending on their landscape position, may spill to other ponds or channels, recharge groundwater, or received groundwater discharge. Since precipitation and actual evaporation are closely balanced, the pond water balances are very sensitive to change in climate, and the prairies in general have been subject to damaging floods and droughts, in particular in the last decade or two. A 2.25 km2 field site at St Denis, central Saskatchewan, contains over 100 ponds, some permanent, some ephemeral, some saline, some fresh, some recharging groundwater, some receiving groundwater discharge. The site has been extensively studied for almost 50 years, with about one decade of continuous meteorological data, and three years of detailed pond level, soil moisture and temperature, and groundwater data. The objective of this study was to assess the performance of PARFLOW-CLM (a coupled land-atmosphere model) in simulating the pond-groundwater interactions at this site. Our conceptual model of the site includes soil properties that are progressively weathered with depth, and we implement this in a simplified dual permeability mathematical model of the soil hydraulic properties, whereby storage is dominated by the matrix and flow is dominated by macropores. The model performance was surprisingly good, doing quite a good job of capturing the observed groundwater and pond level dynamics. The soil freezing regime is also captured reasonably well, though the timing and pattern of the zero degree isotherm during soil thaw, which is critically important for runoff generation processes, was not captured as well. The model provides credible insights into the spatial patterns of evapotranspiration, and the seasonal dynamics of subsurface connectivity, as flow directions around the pond change throughout the year.",

            "abstract": "The Ediacaran Doushantuo Formation (635 – 551 Ma) of southern China is a phosphate-dolostone-black shale sequence following the Marinoan “Snowball Earth” episode that represents an important period in Earth history. It contains abundant phosphate-preserved microfossils, and extremely low carbon isotope values in the cap dolostone unit that have been interpreted to reflect formation in a methane seep environment [1]. Previous clumped isotope analysis of 13C-depleted carbonate veins from the basal Doushantuo samples have been interpreted to reflect hydrothermally-derived thermogenic methane oxidation [2], however recent work on modern and ancient cold seep samples suggests clumped isotope signatures in these environments are influenced by disequilibria effects [3] and are vulnerable to post-depositional diagenesis via internal reordering at temperatures exceeding ~ 100 – 120 ˚C [4]. Here we present initial data from the cap-carbonates overlying the Nantuo diamictite. Our analysis includes a variety of micro-facies from the cap-carbonate including pure calcite and micrite, with a range of carbonate carbon isotopic values. Data presented here will be used to attempt to determine if the samples exhibit disequilibria effects such as those observed in modern cold seep environments, as well as to evaluate the role of hydrothermal activity in the Doushantuo Formation.

A highlight of the mission has been an unprecedented collection of high-resolution auroral images of Saturn obtained in the visible by Cassini ISS, in the infrared by Cassini VIMS, and in the ultraviolet by Cassini UVIS. We will briefly discuss auroral observations of Jupiter by Cassini showing auroral storms and episodes of periodic pulsations, then highlights from the large database of Saturn auroral images and movies, and complementary fields and particles data. Complementary and sometimes simultaneous HST images will also be shown.\nSaturn's auroras exhibit a wide variety of changing forms. At times multiple narrow arcs are seen, at other times a single broader emission is seen. The polar cap inside the oval exhibits changing discrete forms, often near noon local time in the polar cusp region. Satellite footprints associated with Enceladus are very rarely seen. Bright auroral pulsations on the main oval sometimes occur, separated by about an hour. At times these seem associated with the moon Mimas, occurring at the sub-Mimas longitude and moving with the moon. We indicate a possible mechanism for this, involving Mimas control of the width of the Cassini Division, which forms a channel for plasma flow connecting Saturn's rings and/or flowing through Saturn's rings.",

            "abstract": "The chemolithoautotrophic microbial community of the rocky subseafloor potentially provides a large amount of organic carbon to the deep ocean, yet our understanding of the activity and metabolic complexity of subseafloor organisms remains poorly described. Past studies have shown that the taxonomic structure of subseafloor communities differs based on the geochemical signatures of individual vents. In this study, we expanded beyond phylogeny and used a combination of metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and RNA-based stable isotope probing (RNA-SIP) analyses to identify the metabolic potential, expression patterns, and the active autotrophic players and genomic pathways present in venting fluids from Axial Seamount, an active submarine volcano off the coast of Oregon, USA. Low-temperature diffuse vent fluids from three hydrothermal vents, Marker 113, Marker 33, and Anemone, were filtered and preserved on the seafloor for metagenome and metatranscriptome analyses. Fluid for RNA-SIP was also collected and incubated shipboard with 13C-labeled sodium bicarbonate at 30ºC, 55ºC, and 80ºC for each vent. Taxonomically, Epsilonproteobacteria comprised a significant proportion of the community at all three vents, but each vent also had distinct groups that were abundant including SUP05 at Anemone and Methanococcus at Marker 113. Functionally, vents shared many metabolic processes including genes for denitrification, sulfur reduction and sulfur, hydrogen, and ammonium oxidation, which were present and expressed in similar abundance across all three vents. One metabolic difference between vents was the presence and expression of genes for methanogenesis, which were highly abundant and expressed at Marker 113, in lower abundance and expression at Marker 33, and not present at Anemone. RNA-SIP analysis is ongoing but initial results from Marker 113 revealed that at mesophilic, thermophilic, or hyperthemophilic temperatures, different genera and autotrophic metabolisms dominated. In addition, RNA-SIP showed that at 80ºC a different hyperthermophilic group dominated at each vent. Overall, this study demonstrates the metabolic and taxonomic diversity of the subseafloor and better characterizes the subseafloor chemolithoautotrophs and their role in biogeochemical cycling.",

            "abstract": "The Earth's energy imbalance is a critical metric for understanding the current state of the Earth's climate system and its future evolution. Although much of the energy gained by the climate system over the last century has been stored in the oceans, the energy stored in the continental subsurface is important because climate feedback processes such as thawing permafrost and soil carbon stability depend on the energy stored in the ground. We use 32 General Circulation Models (GCMs) from the Fifth Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) to assess the ability of the current generation of GCMs to account for the energy storage in the continental subsurface. The estimated heat from the ground temperatures in each GCM indicates an underestimation of the simulated heat stored in the continental subsurface in comparison with estimations from borehole temperature pro files for the period 1950-2000. The CMIP5 GCMs present a broad spectrum of results with maximum values of 6×1021 J, while the borehole estimations range from 6×1021 J to 8×1021 J in the same spatial domain. Using a one-dimensional purely conductive model we asses the ef fect of the near-surface climate on the heat storage estimates of each GCM, as well\nas expand the depth of the models to 500 m depth. The analysis of all results shows that the main cause of the underestimation of the stored energy in the subsurface by the CMIP5 GCMs may be due to the shallow depth of the land surface models and the nature of the bottom boundary condition that they apply. These underestimates of continental energy storage have important implications for the modelling of climate\ndependent near-surface processes.",

The series began in 2006 with a joint NASA/NOAA airborne altimetry campaign over a 1300 km survey line northwest of the Canadian Archipelago extending into the northern Beaufort Sea. Operation IceBridge (OIB) took up this flight line again in 2009 and repeated it annually through 2012. Additional observations have been collected along a 1000+ km flight line, in the southern Canada Basin and eastern Beaufort Sea, between 2009 and 2015.\nHere we examine laser altimetry, snow radar data, and high-resolution visible imagery to better understand the frequency and distribution of leads and ice floes, the characteristics of first- and multi-year ice types in the survey region, and their impact on the derivation and accuracy of sea ice freeboard. We demonstrate a novel lead detection methodology that depends only upon laser altimeter measurements, and we quantify the impact of low lead frequencies on estimates of instantaneous sea surface height. The analysis reveals a variable springtime freeboard north of 78° N, significantly reduced after 2006, and a notable lead outbreak over the Canada Basin during 2010.",

A well-defined surface boundary condition is necessary due to the variability in the surface albedo and bidirectional reflectance distribution function. Polarization measurements can help constrain the surface model. Prior work features polarization measurements taken by Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Ground-based Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (GroundMSPI). This work has shown that an analytical model that assumes singly reflected light from a rough surface comprised of microfacets sufficiently represents the polarized reflectance of natural surfaces (such as grass), but is less successful for manmade objects. For the linear Stokes parameters (I, Q, U), a single reflection of unpolarized light will result in a null U Stokes parameter relative to the scattering plane. However, some GroundMSPI measurements exhibit a non-zero U Stokes parameter. We show that multiple reflections may be a cause for this discrepancy by using a polarization ray trace (PRT) routine to calculate the polarized Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (pBRDF) for a microfaceted surface. While the effect of multiple reflections, particularly for double reflections, is an order of magnitude smaller compared to single reflections, we show non-zero U Stokes parameters generated from multiple reflections. Furthermore, we have found that for illumination-view geometries with scattering angles less than ~45 degrees, Q and U parameters can have similar magnitude. We report on the magnitude of this effect and compare the PRT simulations to non-zero U measurements from GroundMSPI.",

But scientists want to improve and expand current efforts to conduct international Arctic research, despite politcal and legal barriers that can hamper it.\nA review of the past and present aspects of such research can inform that effort. As part of a six month fellowship at the Center for Science Diplomacy at the American Association for the Advancement of Science I studied the history and current status of international cooperation in the Arctic.\nI will report on my findings, which include the fact that some of the first substantial international environmental research and regulatory cooperation began in the far North. My session will identify the elements that make international research collaborations successful, for example more than a century of cooperative work by Russian and Norwegian fishery scientists to monitor and regulate the cod trade in the Barents Sea.\nAnd it will explore the challenges that can threaten such collaborations. These can include rules that stymie data collection, block the import of certain analytical equipment across national boundaries, and bar the export of soil or water samples. I will mention specific complications to recent international arctic research projects. These include the SWERUS cruise, a joint effort between Sweden, Russia and the US, an effort to study carbon fluxes over the East Siberian Arctic Shelf in 2014.\nThe session will also review progress towards a new international agreeement, first proposed by the US, on improving arctic research cooperation. That deal is focused on removing the bureacratic and legal barriers to scientists seeking to conduct arctic research on foreign waters and land.",

            "abstract": "Urbanization alters physical and biological processes that take place in natural environments. New impervious areas change the hydrological processes, reducing infiltration and evapotranspiration and increasing direct runoff volumes and flow discharges. To reduce these effects at local scale, sustainable urban drainage systems, low impact development and best management practices have been developed and implemented. These technologies, which typically consider some type of green infrastructure (GI), simulate natural processes of capture, retention and infiltration to control flow discharges from frequent events and preserve the hydrological cycle. Applying these techniques in semiarid regions requires accounting for aspects related to the maintenance of green areas, such as the irrigation needs and the selection of the vegetation. This study develops the Integrated Hydrological Model at Residential Scale, IHMORS, which is a continuous model that simulates the most relevant hydrological processes together with irrigation processes of green areas. In the model contributing areas and drainage control practices are modeled by combining and connecting differents subareas subjected to surface processes (i.e. interception, evapotranspiration, infiltration and surface runoff) and sub-surface processes (percolation, redistribution and subsurface runoff). The model simulates these processes and accounts for the dynamics of the water content in different soil layers. The different components of the model were first tested using laboratory and numerical experiments, and then an application to a case study was carried out. In this application we assess the long-term performance in terms of runoff control and irrigation needs of green gardens with different vegetation, under different climate and irrigation practices. The model identifies significant differences in the performance of the alternatives and provides a good insight for the maintenance needs of GI for runoff control.",

            "abstract": "We coupled the multi-fluid moment code Gkeyll[1,2] to the next-generation OpenGGCM[3], and studied the reconnection dynamics at the Ganymede. This work is part of our effort to tackle the grand challenge of integrating kinetic effects into global fluid models.\nThe multi-fluid moment model integrates kinetic effects in that it can capture crucial kinetic physics like pressure tensor effects by evolving moments of the Vlasov equations for each species. This approach has advantages over previous models: desired kinetic effects, together with other important effects like the Hall effect, are self-consistently embedded in the moment equations, and can be efficiently implemented, while not suffering from severe time-step restriction due to plasma oscillation nor artificial whistler modes. This model also handles multiple ion species naturally, which opens up opportunties in investigating the role of oxygen in magnetospheric reconnection and improved coupling to ionosphere models.\nIn this work, the multi-fluid moment solver in Gkeyll was wrapped as a time-stepping module for the high performance, highly flexible next-generation OpenGGCM. Gkeyll is only used to provide the local plasma solver, while computational aspects like parallelization and boundary conditions are handled entirely by OpenGGCM, including interfacing to other models like ionospheric boundary conditions provided by coupling with CTIM [3]. The coupled code is used to study the dynamics near Ganymede, and the results are compared with MHD and Hall MHD results by Dorelli et al. [4].\nHakim, A. (2008).

            "abstract": "Providing actionable data for situational awareness following an earthquake or other disaster is critical to decision makers in order to improve their ability to anticipate requirements and provide appropriate resources for response. E-DECIDER (Emergency Data Enhanced Cyber-Infrastructure for Disaster Evaluation and Response) is a decision support system producing remote sensing and geophysical modeling products that are relevant to the emergency preparedness and response communities and serves as a gateway to enable the delivery of actionable information to these communities. GeoGateway is a data product search and analysis gateway for scientific discovery, field use, and disaster response focused on NASA UAVSAR and GPS data that integrates with fault data, seismicity and models.\nKey information on the nature, magnitude and scope of damage, or Essential Elements of Information (EEI), necessary to achieve situational awareness are often generated from a wide array of organizations and disciplines, using any number of geospatial and non-geospatial technologies. We have worked in partnership with the California Earthquake Clearinghouse to develop actionable data products for use in their response efforts, particularly in regularly scheduled, statewide exercises like the recent May 2015 Capstone/SoCal NLE/Ardent Sentry Exercises and in the August 2014 South Napa earthquake activation. We also provided a number of products, services, and consultation to the NASA agency-wide response to the April 2015 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake.\nWe will present perspectives on developing tools for decision support and data discovery in partnership with the Clearinghouse and for the Nepal earthquake. Products delivered included map layers as part of the common operational data plan for the Clearinghouse, delivered through XchangeCore Web Service Data Orchestration, enabling users to create merged datasets from multiple providers. For the Nepal response effort, products included models, damage and loss estimates, and aftershock forecasts that were posted to a NASA information site and delivered directly to end-users such as USAID, OFDA, World Bank, and UNICEF.",

            "abstract": "Seismic data from earthquakes originating in the Fiji-Tonga region exhibits waveform complexity of a number of phases which may be attributed to various structures along ray paths to stations of USArray, including anomalous structures at the core-mantle boundary. The data shows variation in multipathing, that is, the presence of secondary arrivals following the S phase at diffracted distances (Sdiff) which suggests that the waveform complexity is due to structures at the eastern edge of the mid-Pacific Large Low Shear Velocity Province (LLSVP). This study examines data from earthquake events while the Transportable Array portion of USArray was situated in the midwest United States, reinforcing previous studies that indicate late arrivals occurring as long as 26 seconds after the primary arrivals (To et al., 2011). Using earth flattening transformations and finite difference methods, simulations of tapered wedge structures of low velocity material allow for wave energy trapping, producing the observed waveform complexity and delayed arrivals at large distances, with such structures having characteristic properties of, for example, a height of 70 km, in-plane extent more than 1000 km, and shear wave velocity drop of 3% at the top to 15% at the bottom relative to PREM. Differential arrival times for SH and SV components suggest anisotropy and possible wave propagation through downgoing slabs beneath the source region. The arrivals of the SPdKS phase further support the presence of an ultra-low velocity zone (ULVZ) within a two-humped LLSVP. Some systematic delays in arrival times of multiple phases for distances less than 102º are accounted for and attributed to the presence of a mantle slab underneath the continental United States. Comparisons to seismic data from earthquakes originating from other locations further constrain depths of the deep mantle structures. Possible explanations include iron-enrichment of deep mantle phases.",

            "abstract": "Due to excessive groundwater withdrawals, many water wells in Baton Rouge, Louisiana experience undesirable chloride concentration because of saltwater intrusion. The study goal is to develop a conjunctive management framework that takes advantage of the Baton Rouge multi-aquifer system to mitigate saltwater intrusion. The conjunctive management framework utilizes several hydraulic control techniques to mitigate saltwater encroachment. These hydraulic control approaches include pumping well relocation, freshwater injection, saltwater scavenging, and their combinations. Specific objectives of the study are: (1) constructing scientific geologic architectures of the “800-foot” sand, the “1,000-foot” sand, the “1,200-foot” sand, the “1,500-foot” sand, the “1,700-foot” sand, and the “2,000-foot” sand, (2) developing scientific saltwater intrusion models for these sands. (3) using connector wells to draw native groundwater from one sand and inject to another sand to create hydraulic barriers to halt saltwater intrusion, (4) using scavenger wells or well couples to impede saltwater intrusion progress and reduce chloride concentration in pumping wells, and (5) reducing cones of depression by relocating and dispersing pumping wells to different sands. The study utilizes optimization techniques and newest LSU high performance computing (HPC) facilities to derive solutions. The conjunctive management framework serves as a scientific tool to assist policy makers to solve the urgent saltwater encroachment issue in the Baton Rouge area. The research results will help water companies as well as industries in East Baton Rouge Parish and neighboring parishes by reducing their saltwater intrusion threats, which in turn would sustain Capital Area economic development.",

            "abstract": "Predicting the fate of the ecosystem carbon, C, stocks and their sensitivity to climate change relies heavily on our ability to accurately model the gross carbon fluxes, i.e. photosynthesis and respiration. However, there are large differences in the Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) simulated by different land surface models (LSMs), not only in terms of mean value, but also in terms of phase and amplitude when compared to independent data-based estimates. This strongly limits our ability to provide accurate predictions of carbon-climate feedbacks. One possible source of this uncertainty is from inaccurate parameter values resulting from incomplete model calibration.\nSolar Induced Fluorescence (SIF) has been shown to have a linear relationship with GPP at the typical spatio-temporal scales used in LSMs (Guanter et al., 2011). New satellite-derived SIF datasets have the potential to constrain LSM parameters related to C uptake at global scales due to their coverage. Here we use SIF data derived from the GOME2 instrument (Köhler et al., 2014) to optimize parameters related to photosynthesis and leaf phenology of the ORCHIDEE LSM, as well as the linear relationship between SIF and GPP. We use a multi-site approach that combines many model grid cells covering a wide spatial distribution within the same optimization (e.g. Kuppel et al., 2014). The parameters are constrained per Plant Functional type as the linear relationship described above varies depending on vegetation structural properties. The relative skill of the optimization is compared to a case where only satellite-derived vegetation index data are used to constrain the model, and to a case where both data streams are used.\nWe evaluate the results using an independent data-driven estimate derived from FLUXNET data (Jung et al., 2011) and with a new atmospheric tracer, Carbonyl sulphide (OCS) following the approach of Launois et al. (ACPD, in review). We show that the optimization reduces the strong positive bias of the ORCHIDEE model and increases the correlation compared to independent estimates. Differences in spatial patterns and gradients between simulated GPP and observed SIF remain largely unchanged however, suggesting that the underlying representation of vegetation type and/or structure and functioning in the model requires further investigation.",

Strong horizontal climate gradients are known to exist but especially in higher altitudes they are based on poor data coverage. We make use of the Machguth et al. (2015) data base that comprises of point mass balance observations all around Greenland, which reveals that typical horizontal coast-to-ice sheet mass balance gradients amount to -10 mm/km at around 66°N and are strongest in south Greenland with -18 mm/km at 61°N with a more negative mass balance further inland. In the Godthåbsfjord area (64°N, 50°W) several valley AWS exist that allow to describe the complexity of low-elevation climate gradients, which show strongest temperature gradients very close to the shore, while precipitation gradients are stronger further inland. Using AWS data from PROMICE (\nwww.promice.dk\n) and GEM (\nhttp://www.g-e-m.dk\n), we calculate high elevation coast-to-ice sheet climate gradients and compare them with the valley data. Most climate parameters show weaker gradients in high elevation compared to the valley sites. From detailed surface energy and mass balance calculations we conclude that the decisive factor for the significant mass balance gradients is winter accumulation, impacting the duration of the snow-free period. Finally, we discuss further steps necessary for upscaling to a Greenland scale.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic surveys are critical tools in mineral exploration and UAVs have the potential to carry magnetometers. UAV surveys can offer higher spatial resolution than traditional airborne surveys, and higher coverage than terrestrial surveys. However, the main advantage is their ability to sense the magnetic field in 3-D, while most airborne or terrestrial surveys are restricted to 2-D acquisition. This study compares UAV magnetic data from two different UAVs (JIB drone, DJI Phantom 2) and three different magnetometers (GEM GSPM35, Honeywell HMR2300, GEM GST-19). The first UAV survey was conducted using a JIB UAV with a GSPM35 flying at 10-15 m above ground. The survey’s goal was to detect intrusive Rhyolite bodies for primary mineral exploration. The survey resulted in a better understanding of the validity/resolution of UAV data and led to improved knowledge about the geological structures in the area. The results further drove the design of a following terrestrial survey. Comparing the UAV data with an available airborne survey (upward continued to 250 m) reveals that the UAV data has superior spatial resolution, but exhibits a higher noise level. The magnetic anomalies related to the Rhyolite intrusions is about 109 nT and translates into an estimated depth of approximately 110 meters. The second survey was conducted using an in-house developed UAV magnetometer system equipped with a DJI Phantom 2 and a Honeywell HMR2300 fluxgate magnetometer. By flying the sensor in different altitudes, the vertical and horizontal gradients can be derived leading to full 3-D magnetic data volumes which can provide improved constraints for source depth/geometry characterization. We demonstrate that a buried steam pipeline was detectable with the UAV magnetometer system and compare the resulting data with a terrestrial survey using a GEM GST-19 Proton Precession Magnetometer.",

            "abstract": "Energy release and particle acceleration on the Sun is a frequent occurrence associated with a number of different solar phenomenon including but not limited to solar flares, coronal mass ejections and nanoflares. The exact mechanism through which particles are accelerated and energy is released is still not well understood. This issue is related to the unsolved coronal heating problem, the mystery of the heating mechanism for the million degree solar corona. One prevalent theory posits the existence of a multitude of small flares, dubbed nanoflares. Recent observations of active region AR11890 by IRIS (Testa et al. 2014) are consistent with numerical simulations of heating by impulsive beams of nonthermal electrons, suggesting that nanoflares may be similar to large flares in that they accelerate particles. Furthermore, observations by the EUNIS sounding rocket (Brosius et al. 2014) of faint Fe XIX (592.2 Angstrom) emission in an active region is indicative of plasma at temperatures of at least 8.9 MK providing further evidence of nanoflare heating. One of the best ways to gain insight into accelerated particles on the Sun and the presence of hot plasma is by observing the Sun in hard X-rays (HXR). We present on observations taken during the second successful flight of the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI-2). FOXSI flew on December 11, 2014 with upgraded optics as well as new CdTe strip detectors. FOXSI-2 observed thermal emission (4-15 keV) from at least three active regions (AR#12234, AR#12233, AR#12235) and observed regions of the Sun without active regions. We present on using FOXSI observations to test the presence of hot temperatures in and outside of active regions.",

            "abstract": "Continental margin deposits provide the most complete record on Earth of paleo-landscapes, but these records are complex and difficult to interpret. To a seismic geomorphologist or stratigrapher, mapped surfaces often present a static diachronous record of these landscapes through time. We present data that capture the dynamics of experimental shelf-margin landscapes at high-temporal resolution and define internal hierarchies within stacked channelized and weakly channelized deposits from the shelf to the slope. Motivated by observations from acoustically–imaged continental margins offshore Brunei and in the Gulf of Mexico, we use physical experiments to quantify stratal patterns of sub-aqueous slope channels and lobes that are linked to delta-top channels. The data presented here are from an experiment that was run for 26 hours of experimental run time. Overhead photographs and topographic scans captured flow dynamics and surface aggradation/degradation every ten minutes. Currents rich in sediment built a delta that prograded to the shelf-edge. These currents were designed to plunge at the shoreline and travel as turbidity currents beyond the delta and onto the continental slope. Pseudo-subsidence was imposed by a slight base-level rise that generated accommodation space and promoted the construction of stratigraphy on the delta-top.\nCompensational stacking is a term that is frequently applied to deposits that tend to fill in topographic lows in channelized and weakly channelized systems. The compensation index, a metric used to quantify the strength of compensation, is used here to characterize deposits at different temporal scales on the experimental landscape. The compensation timescale is the characteristic time at which the accumulated deposits begins to match the shape of basin-wide subsidence rates (uniform for these experiments). We will use the compensation indices along strike transects across the delta, proximal slope and distal slope to evaluate the degree of compensation and the trends in the compensation time-scale, tied to a reduced degree of channelization in the down-slope direction.",

            "abstract": "The Arctic–Boreal zone is known be warming at an accelerated rate relative to other biomes. The taiga or boreal forest covers over 16 x106 km2 of Arctic North America, Scandinavia, and Eurasia. A large part of the northern Boreal forests are in Russia’s Siberia, as area with recent accelerated climate warming. During the last two decades we have been working on characterization of boreal forests in north-central Siberia using field and satellite measurements. We have published results of circumpolar biomass using field plots, airborne (PALS, ACTM) and spaceborne (GLAS) lidar data with ASTER DEM, LANDSAT and MODIS land cover classification, MODIS burned area and WWF’s ecoregion map. Researchers from ESA and Russia have also been working on biomass (or growing stock) mapping in Siberia. For example, they developed a pan-boreal growing stock volume map at 1-kilometer scale using hyper-temporal ENVISAT ASAR ScanSAR backscatter data. Using the annual PALSAR mosaics from 2007 to 2010 growing stock volume maps were retrieved based on a supervised random forest regression approach. This method is being used in the ESA/Russia ZAPAS project for Central Siberia Biomass mapping.\nSpatially specific biomass maps of this region at higher resolution are desired for carbon cycle and climate change studies. In this study, our work focused on improving resolution ( 50 m) of a biomass map based on PALSAR L-band data and Landsat Vegetation Canopy Fraction products. GLAS data were carefully processed and screened using land cover classification, local slope, and acquisition dates. The biomass at remaining footprints was estimated using a model developed from field measurements at GLAS footprints. The GLAS biomass samples were then aggregated into 1 Mg/ha bins of biomass and mean VCF and PALSAR backscatter and textures were calculated for each of these biomass bins. The resulted biomass/signature data was used to train a random forest model for biomass mapping of entire region from 50oN to 75oN, and 80oE to 145oE. The spatial patterns of the new biomass map is much better than the previous maps due to spatially specific mapping in high resolution. The uncertainties of field/GLAS and GLAS/imagery models were investigated using bootstrap procedure, and the final biomass map was compared with previous maps.",

At high northern latitudes, permafrost (and its current degradation across large scales) is presumed to exert a strong control on long-term ecosystem carbon uptake and storage. We integrate a variety of data from both Canada and Alaska, focusing on two years of observations across a permafrost gradient in a black spruce Alaskan watershed (the Caribou/Poker Creek Research Watershed ~50 km northeast of Fairbanks, AK, USA). Permafrost depth changes were strongly associated with changes in vegetation and leaf morphology, as well as soil greenhouse fluxes (0.1-2.0 µmol/m2/s, with strong spatial dependencies) and aboveground net primary production (60-550 gC/m2/yr). We use tree-ring data covering the last century to examine how tree response to climate variability changes with elevation and permafrost depth, both along small-scale transects and across the entire 104 km2 watershed. A weakness is that these results are from a single site and point in successional time; we quantify potential variability in this area using 16 years of observations from a Canadian boreal chronosequence. We emphasize that both short and long term observations and experiments, using multiple approaches, are necessary to constrain ecosystem carbon uptake and storage.",

            "abstract": "The Lusi eruption started the 29th of May 2006 in Eastern Java, Indonesia. Since its birth Lusi presented a pulsating behaviour with geyser-like activity. To date Lusi is still active and never stopped erupting enormous amounts of mud, clasts, water and gas with peaks of activity reaching 180.000 km3/day.\nThe erupting activity is characterized by[ML1] three main behaviours:\n1) regular activity, which consists in the constant emission of mud breccia (i.e. viscous mud containing clay, silt, sand and clasts up to 10 cm in diameter) associated with the expulsion of water both in a liquid and vapour state as well as other gasses (i.e. mostly CO2 and CH4). Occasional powerful bursts of mud may reach up ten meters in height.\n2) geysering activity consisting in more powerful eruptive events that do not seem to have a regular pattern. These typically lasts up to five minutes and comprise an initial phase marked by an elevated bubbling in the crater zone followed by an increasing amount of vapour released throughout the geysering phase.\n3) quasi-absence of degassing from the main crater(s). This phase follows the geysering activity and is generally short-lived\nIn order to investigate the mechanisms controlling Lusi pulsating behaviour, we deployed a network of five seismometers around the crater. The seismic records highlight that the seismic signal of Lusi is characterised by tremor and volcano-tectonic events. Tremor events occur in 1 Hz and 3 Hz frequency bands while volcano tectonic events are rich in high frequencies (i.e. 2-15 Hz). We also identify an emerging signal lasting from approximately one to ten minutes. This signal appears throughout the dataset and it is characterized by a frequency content between 5 Hz and 10 Hz. To verify whether such long-lasting signal could be associated to the geysering phase we coupled the seismic monitoring with a HD camera to record the crater activity. Results reveal that the onset of such signal precedes the visual evidence of geysering activity at the surface. This implies that the signal is not originated in the immediate subsurface. We argue that such signal is generated by the geysering activity and it is caused by the discrete collapse of gas pockets rising through a super-heated fluid column filled with hot mud.\n[ML1]\nComprises??",

Our record consists of an average of ~300 terminus observations per glacier; during the last 5 years, we average ~20 observations per year. We find that many glaciers in this region initiated retreat around 1998, coincident with retreat further south at Jakobshavn Isbræ, although the rate and duration of retreat varies from glacier-to-glacier. We explore variations in retreat rate and extent by examining individual fjord geometries, namely changes in fjord width and depth from available ship-based sounding observations. We also explore variations in retreat rate by examining spatial variations in surface melt-induced terminus ablation using a buoyant plume model coupled with field observations. Finally, we identify glaciers in the region that did not undergo significant retreat and examine the balance of forces that may be responsible for their stability.",

Soils were fully saturated during the initial sampling period and dried down over the course of the summer. Soils and gas were sampled from 5cm and 20cm at each site and also at 50cm at eight riparian sites. In total, 496 individual soil samples were collected. Soil moisture ranged from 3.7% to fully saturated; soil pH ranged from 3.60 to 6.68. Methane concentrations in soils ranged from 0.426 ppm to 218 ppm; Carbon dioxide concentrations ranged from 550 ppm to 42,990 ppm; Nitrous oxide concentrations ranged from 0.220 ppm to 2.111 ppm; Oxygen concentrations ranged from 10.2% to 21.5%. Soil microbial communities were characterized by DNA sequences covering the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. DNA sequences were generated (~30,000,000 sequences) from the 496 soil samples using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Operational Taxonomic Units were generated using USEARCH, and representative sequences were taxonomically classified according the Ribosomal Database Project’s taxonomy scheme. Analysis of similarity revealed that microbial communities found within a landscape type (high upland forest, low upland forest, riparian) were more similar than among landscape types (R = 0.600; p<0.001). Similarly, communities from unique site x depths were similar across the 7 collection periods (R = 0.646; p<0.001) despite changes in soil moisture. Euclidean distances of soil properties and gas concentrations were compared to Bray-Curtis community dissimilarity matrices using Mantel tests to determine how community structure co-varies with the soil environment and gas concentrations. All variables measured significantly co-varied with microbial community membership (pH: R = 0.712, p < 0.001; CO2: R = 0.578, p < 0.001; O2: R = 0.517, p < 0.001; Soil moisture: R = 0.408, p < 0.001; N2O: R = 0.218, p = 0.003; CH4: R = 0.195, p = 0.008).

            "abstract": "The goal of the full-waveform inversion (FWI) is to find an Earth’s model such that the synthetic waveforms computed using the model fit the observed ones. In practice, such a model is found in the context of the perturbation approach in an iterative fashion. Specifically, to find such a model, one starts from an initial global velocity model and perform model updating iteratively based on the Frechet derivative or single scattering by adjoint methods to minimize some cost function. However, this process often leads to local minima for the nonlinear cost function in the optimization and slow or no convergence when the starting model is far from the true model.\nTo solve for the initial-model dependence and the convergence issue, we show a new direct waveform inversion (DWI) idea to directly invert the waveform data recursively by explicitly enforcing the causality principle. The DWI offers the advantage of assuming no global initial model and no iteration is needed for the model updating. Starting from the source-receiver region, the DWI builds the model outward recursively by fitting the earliest part of the reflection waveforms and the DWI process is always convergent. The DWI combines seismic imaging and velocity model building into one single process and this is in contrast to many industrial applications where seismic imaging/migration and velocity modeling building are done alternatively. The DWI idea is applicable to one-, two-, and three-dimensional spaces. We show numerical examples to support our idea using full waveform data including both free-surface and inter-bed multiples. Using reflection seismic data, we show that the DWI can invert for both velocity and density, separately.",

Fields studies and geochemical investigations indicate that ophiolitic mafic-ultramafic complexes formed in a supra-subduction zone setting. Ophiolitic rocks in the southeast form a structurally disrupted Penrose-type ophiolite; however, northwestern ophiolitic rocks generally lack lower and middle crust in most sections, exhibit a direct contact between supracrustal and mantle sections and locally contain ophicalcites suggesting that supracrustal rocks were structurally emplaced over mantle along extensional detachment(s). Mantle peridotite in the footwall of the detachment is extensively intruded by vari-textured, fine-grained to pegmatitic gabbro sills, dykes and stocks. These gabbro intrusions are locally boudinaged within fresh peridotite suggesting that the host mantle was rapidly exhumed prior to emplacement of the gabbro. Intrusive relationships between gabbro and variably serpentinized mantle peridotite are observed throughout the northern Cache Creek terrane (>300 km) suggesting a presence of a regional-scale Middle Triassic ocean-core complex. Overall, these data indicate that parts of the northern Cache Creek terrane formed in a setting analogous to backarc ocean core complexes such as the Godzilla Megamullion in the Parece Vela backarc basin, western Pacific.",

            "abstract": "There is widespread interest in quantifying the growth and decay of topography. However, prominent methods for quantitative determinations of paleoelevation rely on assumptions that are often difficult to test. For example, stable isotope paleoaltimetry relies on the knowledge of past lapse rates and moisture sources. Here, we demonstrate how cosmogenic 10Be - 21Ne and/or 10Be - 26Al sample pairs can be applied to provide independent estimates of surface uplift rate using both published data and new data from the Atacama Desert. Our approach requires a priori knowledge of the maximum age of exposure of the sampled surface. Ignimbrite surfaces provide practical sampling targets. When erosion is very slow (roughly, ≤1 m/Ma), it is often possible to constrain paleo surface uplift rate with precision comparable to that of stable isotopic methods (approximately ±50%). The likelihood of a successful measurement is increased by taking n samples from a landscape surface and solving for one regional paleo surface uplift rate and n local erosion rates.\nIn northern Chile, we solve for surface uplift and erosion rates using three sample groups from the literature (Kober et al., 2007). In the two lower elevation groups, we calculate surface uplift rates of 110 (+60/-12) m/Myr and 160 (+120/-6) m/Myr and estimate uncertainties with a bootstrap approach. The rates agree with independent estimates derived from stream profile analyses nearby (Hoke et al., 2007). Our calculated uplift rates correspond to total uplift of 1200 and 850 m, respectively, when integrated over appropriate timescales. Erosion rates were too high to reliably calculate the uplift rate in the third, high elevation group. New cosmogenic nuclide analyses from the Atacama Desert are in progress, and preliminary results are encouraging. In particular, a replicate sample in the vicinity of the first Kober et al. (2007) group independently yields a surface uplift rate of 110 m/Myr. Compared to stable isotope proxies, cosmogenic nuclides potentially provide better constraints on surface uplift in places where assumptions about paleo-atmospheric conditions are hard to constrain and justify.\nF.

Our objectives were to: 1) investigate whether maize rhizosphere turns hydrophobic; 2) measure the contact angle of mucilage collected from plants growing in wet and dry soils; and 3) find a quantitative relation between rhizosphere rewetting, particle size, soil matric potential and mucilage concentration.\nMaize plants were grown in sandy soil for five weeks. The soil was then allowed to dry and it was irrigated. The soil water content during irrigation was imaged using neutron radiography. In a parallel experiment, mucilage was collected from brace roots. The contact angle was measured for varying mucilage concentration. Additionally, capillary rise experiments were performed in soils of different particle size and mucilage concentration. We then used a pore-network model in which mucilage was randomly distributed in a cubic lattice. The general idea was that the rewetting of a pore is impeded when the concentration of mucilage on the pore surface [g cm-2] is higher than a given threshold value. The threshold value depended on soil matric potential, pore radius and contact angle. Then, we randomly distributed mucilage in the pore network and we calculated the percolation of water across a cubic lattice for varying soil particle size, mucilage concentration and matric potential.\nOur results showed that: 1) the rhizosphere stayed temporarily dry after irrigation; 2) in both plants growing in wet and dry soils, mucilage became hydrophobic after drying. Mucilage contact angle increased with mucilage concentration. Interestingly, the contact angle of mucilage from plants growing in dry soil was higher than the one from plants growing in wet soils; 3) water could easily cross the rhizosphere when the mucilage concentration was below a given threshold. In contrast, above a critical mucilage concentration water could not flow through the rhizosphere. The critical mucilage concentration decreased with increasing particle size and decreasing matric potential.\nThese results show the importance of mucilage for water fluxes across the root-soil interface. Our percolation model predicts at what mucilage concentration the rhizosphere turns hydrophobic depending on soil texture and matric potential.",

            "abstract": "The Paleoproterozoic Era is thought to have experienced one of the most significant changes in earth’s environment during earth history. Early continents started to diverge and collide accompanied by first major oxidation of the atmosphere-oceanic system known as the Great Oxidation Environment (GOE). Due to their well-preserved oceanic sedimentary sequences, Paleoproterozoic belts are usually good targets for studies on the history of earth’s past environment. In addition, these belts provide great help to understand the nature of the Paleoproterozoic deeper oceanic environments. Birimian greenstone belt in southwestern Ghana is likely to have made up of subduction of oceanic basin to form a volcanic island arc. Birimian rocks are separated by nonconformity from the Tarkwaian Group which is a younger paleoplacer deposit (Perrouty et al., 2012). The Birimian is made up of island-arc volcanic rocks; foreland basin made up of shale, sandstone, quartzite and turbidities derived from 2.17 Ga granite intrusions during Birimian volcanism.\nIn this study, we focused on the coastal area around Cape Three Points at the southernmost part of the Ashanti (Axim-Konongo) belt in Ghana. In the eastern part of the area,  excellently preserved Paleoprotorozoic deeper oceanic sedimentary sequences extensively outcrop for over 4km stretch. This volcano-sedimentary sequence has been affected by greenschist facies metamorphism.\nStructurally, this region preserves S1 cleavage and asymmetrical synform with west vergence and S0 younging to the east. Provisional stratigraphy is very continuous up to more than 2000m thick and, in addition, suggests at least four different fining upward sequences in the area to the east and west of Atwepo, west of Kwetakora and Akodda. These sub-sequences are mainly composed of volcaniclasitc, sandstone, black shale and rare volcanics such as pillow basalt or massive volcanic lava. In other words, this continuous sequence suggests distal submarine volcaniclastic rocks in an oceanic island arc around the West African Craton. Preliminary δ13C analysis gave values of -23.7~ -36.5 ‰ for black shale occupying the middle to upper part of the whole section. The very light carbon isotope ratios suggest deposition of the black shale under highly euxinic conditions like today’s Black sea.",

Despite the recognition of >30 world-wide, the paucity of geological and geophysical data over these basins means their origin remains enigmatic. In order to address this problem, we have used a recently acquired 1400 km long seismic reflection profile recorded to 20 s TWTT, field observations and well logs, gravity and magnetic data acquired at 1 km intervals, and five wide-angle refection/refraction receiver gathers recorded at offsets up to 100 km, to constrain the origin of the Parnaíba basin, North-East Brazil. We find a depth to pre-Paleozoic basement and Moho of ~ 3.5 and ~ 40 – 42 km respectively beneath the basin center. A prominent mid-crustal reflection (MCR) can be tracked laterally for ~ 300 km at depths between 17 – 25 km and a low-fold wide-angle receiver gather stack shows that the crust below the MCR is characterized by a ~ 4 s TWTT package of anastomosing reflections. Gravity modelling suggests that the MCR represents the upper surface of a high density (+0.14 kg m-3) lower crustal body, which is probably of magmatic origin. Backstripping of biostratigraphic data from wells in the center of the basin show an exponentially decreasing subsidence. We show that although cooling of a thick (180 km) lithosphere following prolonged rifting (~ 65 Myr) can provide a good fit to the tectonic subsidence curves, process-oriented gravity and flexure modelling suggest that other processes must be important, as rifting does not account for the observed gravity anomaly and predicts too thin a crust (~ 34 km). The thicker than expected crust suggests warping due, for example, to far-field stresses or basal tractions. Another possibility, which is compatible with existing geophysical data, is a dense magmatic intrusion in the lower crust that has loaded and flexed the pre-existing Moho downwards to greater depths than beneath flanking Archaen and Proterozoic terranes.",

However, calibration of global land models with observations has been extremely challenging at least for two reasons. First we lack global data products from systematical measurements of land surface processes. Second, computational demand is insurmountable for estimation of model parameter due to complexity of global land models. In this project, we will use OCO-2 retrievals of dry air mole fraction XCO2 and solar induced fluorescence (SIF) to independently constrain estimation of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and gross primary production (GPP). The constrained NEE and GPP will be combined with data products of global standing biomass, soil organic carbon and soil respiration to improve the community land model version 4.5 (CLM4.5). Specifically, we will first develop a high fidelity emulator of CLM4.5 according to the matrix representation of the terrestrial carbon cycle. It has been shown that the emulator fully represents the original model and can be effectively used for data assimilation to constrain parameter estimation. We will focus on calibrating those key model parameters (e.g., maximum carboxylation rate, turnover time and transfer coefficients of soil carbon pools, and temperature sensitivity of respiration) for carbon cycle. The Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC) will be used to assimilate the global databases into the high fidelity emulator to constrain the model parameters, which will be incorporated back to the original CLM4.5. The calibrated CLM4.5 will be used to make scenario-based projections. In addition, we will conduct observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) to evaluate how the sampling frequency and length could affect the model constraining and prediction.",

A focus is given to quantifying the changing nature of related variability in a warming climate, the statistical robustness of which is enhanced by the numerous members of the LE (presently ~40). It is found that while the dynamical components of ENSO's teleconnections weaken considerably in a warming world, associated variability over land is in many cases sustained by changes in the background state, such as for rainfall due to the background rise in specific humidity. In some fields, particularly those associated with associated with thermal stress (e.g. drought and wildfire), ENSO-related variance increases dramatically. This, combined with the fact that ENSO variance itself increases in a warming climate in the LE, contributes to dramatic projected increases in ENSO-driven drought and wildfire risks in a warming world.",

Any observing system intending to observe volcanic eruptions has to be ready at any time. Due to transport time scales, emissions of large volcanic eruptions, in particular injections into the stratosphere, may be detected at locations far from the volcano within days to weeks after the eruption. These emissions may be observed using small balloon soundings at dedicated sites. Here we present observations of particles of the Icelandic Grimsvotn eruption at the Meteorological Observatory Lindenberg, Germany in the months following the eruption and observations of opportunity of other volcanic particle events. We also present observations of the emissions of SO2 from the Turrialba volcano at San Jose, Costa Rica. We argue that dedicated sites for routine observations of the clean and perturbed atmosphere using small sounding balloons are an important element in the detection and quantification of emissions from future volcanic eruptions.",

The time-variant TTD at the outlet captures the dynamic nature of the catchment-scale hydrological transport, originating from temporal variability of flow velocity. Transient three-dimensional surface-groundwater flow is first calculated as an integrated hydrologic system. The calibrated and validated flow rate simulations at the outlet show good accuracy relative to measured data, the Mean Error (ME) being approximately (0.2 m3/day). We interpret decadal daily hydro-chemical data, from the Kringlan sub-catchment by simulating chloride concentrations at the catchment outlet, with a view toward quantifying physical processes of dry and wet deposition of chloride. We show that the chloride transport load is mainly dominated by flow in terms of magnitude and temporal fluctuations. However, only 29% of the annually-averaged total amount of chloride originates from wet atmospheric deposition. The numerical simulation of flow and transport is performed with a three-dimensional model MIKE SHE. The numerical approach complements the recently advanced analytical formulation of transient TTD which requires input/output fluxes, storage volume of different water compartments in addition to relying on mixing assumption. Our results show that the fast response of the catchment to the climatic forcing in the event-scale of a year is reflected in the TTDs of water particles originating from topsoil (root zone), whereas decadal scale window show that water stored within saturated zone is older.",

            "abstract": "The Bayesian posterior density function (PDF) of earth models that fit full waveform seismic data convey information on the uncertainty with which the elastic model parameters are resolved. In this work, we apply the trans-dimensional reversible jump Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (RJ-MCMC) for the 1D inversion of noisy synthetic full-waveform seismic data in the frequency-wavenumber domain. While seismic full waveform inversion (FWI) is a powerful method for characterizing subsurface elastic parameters, the uncertainty in the inverted models has remained poorly known, if at all and is highly initial model dependent. The Bayesian method we use is trans-dimensional in that the number of model layers is not fixed, and flexible such that the layer boundaries are free to move around. The resulting parameterization does not require regularization to stabilize the inversion. Depth resolution is traded off with the number of layers, providing an estimate of uncertainty in elastic parameters (compressional and shear velocities Vp and Vs as well as density) with depth. We find that in the absence of additional constraints, Bayesian inversion can result in a wide range of posterior PDFs on Vp, Vs and density. These PDFs range from being clustered around the true model, to those that contain little resolution of any particular features other than those in the near surface, depending on the particular data and target geometry. We present results for a suite of different frequencies and offset ranges, examining the differences in the posterior model densities thus derived. Though these results are for a 1D earth, they are applicable to areas with simple, layered geology and provide valuable insight into the resolving capabilities of FWI, as well as highlight the challenges in solving a highly non-linear problem. The RJ-MCMC method also presents a tantalizing possibility for extension to 2D and 3D Bayesian inversion of full waveform seismic data in the future, as it objectively tackles the problem of model selection (i.e., the number of layers or cells for parameterization), which could ease the computational burden of evaluating forward models with many parameters.",

One of the challenges today is releasing the energy of glucose that nature has cleverly locked into lignocellulosic biomass. Potent and efficient enzyme preparations need to be developed for the enzymatic saccharification process to be more economical. Approaches like enzyme engineering, reconstitution of enzyme mixtures and bioprospecting for superior enzymes are gaining importance. The ocean is considered to be a great reservoir of biodiversity.\nBecause enzymes have unequalled advantages, many industries are keenly interested in adapting enzymatic methods for their processes. Microbial communities in marine environments are ecologically relevant as intermediaries of energy and play an important role in nutrient regeneration cycles as decomposers of dead and decaying organic matter. The exploitation of marine bacteria in the search for improved enzymes or strategies provides a means to upgrade feasibility for lignocellulosic biomass conversion, ultimately providing means to a 'greener' technology. Several industrial enzymes are derived from terrestrial sources, whereas, marine environment which encompasses about 71 percent of the earth’s surface and a vast resources for useful enzymes, remain unexplored. Marine microorganisms take active part in the mineralization of complex organic matter through degradative pathways of their metabolism. Bacteria from marine environments secrete different enzymes based on their habitat and their ecological functions. Therefore marine microbial enzymes have become the focal point of interest. Even though many of these enzymes are being isolated, the efficiency of hydrolysis is very poor. This could be overcome by altering the substrate specificity of lignocellulases. Protein engineering could prove to be useful to improve the catalytic function these enzymes.",

The distribution of several species, including the Galapagos Penguin, is intimately tied to upwelling of cold, nutrient–rich water along the western shores of the archipelago. Here we show, using reliable, high–resolution sea surface temperature observations, that the Galapagos cold pool has been intensifying and expanding northward since 1982. The linear cooling trend of 0.8°C per 33 years is likely the result of long–term changes in equatorial ocean circulation previously identified. Moreover, the northward expansion of the cold pool is dynamically consistent with a slackening of the cross–equatorial component of the regional trade winds—leading to an equatorward shift of the mean position of the Equatorial Undercurrent. The implied change in strength and distribution of upwelling has important implications for ongoing and future conservation measures in the Galapagos.",

MORP are exposed along fracture zones and detachment faults. Sampling via dredging and even drilling is relatively random. Conversely, most OPHP samples are taken by geologists (who oversample “peculiar” lithologies) with hammers, from outcrops exposed by erosion, often deep within intact massifs far from the paleo-seafloor.\nTectonic exhumation of MORP from (?) 10-20 km to the seafloor probably results in rapid cooling from 1000 to 0°C. OPHP probably cool more slowly in this interval, as reflected in systematic offset of spinels to lower Mg/(Mg+Fe) or Mg#, at a given Cr/(Cr+Al) or Cr# in OPHP compared to MORP (Hanghoj et al JPet 2010). Both suites record rapid cooling from 1350 to 1000°C (Dygert & Liang EPSL 2015), with cooling rate in Oman decreasing with increasing depth below the crust-mantle transition zone (Hanghøj et al. JPet 2010; Dygert et al. this meeting 59980 in Session V010). Rapid high-T cooling in the different MORP and OPHP settings suggests heat extraction via hydrothermal convection to depths of 7 km or more, rather than tectonic exhumation.\nMost OPHP massifs contain some high Cr# spinels, compared to max Cr# ca 65% in MORP, often attributed to high degrees of melting of OPHP, perhaps due to aqueous fluid-fluxing in a subducting setting. However, leaving aside ultra-depleted New Caledonia and Papuan ophiolites, this fails to account for overlapping spinel Cr#, olivine Mg#, and pyroxene content in MORP and OPHP. The wide range of Cr# and pyroxene content over short distances in both MORP and OPHP suites reflects open system processes and/or subsolidus re-equilibration with pyroxene and alteration phases. The high Cr# suite locally present in most OPHP probably results from late-stage reaction with magmas saturated in Cr-rich spinel, absent or rare in ridge settings but observed in western Pacific arcs (Arai & co-workers; Suhr G-cubed 2003). This, together with higher Ca/(Ca+Na) in plagioclase and early crystallization of Fe-Ti oxides leading to SiO2-enrichment in lava suites, suggests a subduction setting for most ophiolites. However, few ophiolites are overlain by ash layers from subaerial volcanoes, and most were emplaced soon after magmatism. Subduction = obduction?",

We present and discuss a general framework that allows us to deal with the situation in which the lack of scale separation requires the combined use of different descriptions at different scale (for instance, a pore-scale description at the micro-scale and a Darcy-like description at the macro-scale) [1,2].\nThe method is based on conservation principles and constructs the macro-scale problem by numerical averaging of micro-scale balance equations. By employing spatiotemporal adaptive strategies, this approach can efficiently solve large-scale problems [2,3]. In addition, being based on a numerical volume-averaging paradigm, it offers a tool to illuminate how macroscopic equations emerge from microscopic processes, to better understand the meaning of microscopic quantities, and to investigate the validity of the assumptions routinely used to construct the macro-scale problems.\n[1] Tomin, P., and I.

            "abstract": "The Northern Volcanic Zone (NVZ) of Iceland is a subaerial part of the divergent boundary between the North-American and Eurasian Plates. At this latitude, the full spreading between the plates is accommodated by the NVZ. We derived the plate boundary velocity field from GPS campaign and continuous measurements between 2008 and 2014, a time period free of any magma intrusion. Average velocities were estimated in the ITRF08 reference frame. The overall extension is consistent with 18 mm/yr in the 104°N direction spreading, in accordance with the MORVEL2010 plate motion model. We find that a 40km-wide band along the plate boundary accommodates about 75% of the full plate velocities. Within this zone, the average strain rate is approximately 0.35 μstrain/yr. The deformation field and the strain rate are, however, much affected by other sources of deformations in the NVZ. These include magmatic sources at the most active volcanic centers, glacial rebound near the ice-caps and geothermal power-plant water extraction. Magmatic sources include a shallow magma chamber deflation under Askja caldera, as well as under Þeistareykir and eventual deep magma inflation north of Krafla volcano. Vatnajökull ice cap melting causes large uplift and outward displacements in the southern part of the NVZ. The two geothermal power-plants near Krafla are inducing local deflations. Our GPS velocities show a 35° change in the direction of the plate boundary axis north of Askja volcano that we infer to be linked to the geometric arrangement of volcanic systems within the NVZ.\nWe use a simple arctangent model to describe the plate spreading to provide constraints on the location and the locking depth of the spreading axis. For that purpose we divided the area in short overlapping segments having the same amount of GPS points along the plate spreading direction and inverted for the location of the center of the spreading axis and locking depth. With this simple model we can account for most of the plate spreading related deformation in the NVZ. It appears that the locking depth is not uniform all along the length of the plate boundary, with a deeper locking depth in the low activity volcanic systems and a shallower locking depth in the more active volcanic systems of Krafla and Askja.",

            "abstract": "The 2003 jerk has an abrupt change in the geomagnetic secular variation (SV), and was recognized as a local phenomenon of internal origin from the satellite observations (Olsen and Mandea, 2007). Notable strength of the 2003 jerk is located near China. The temporal and spatial features at this area are important to resolve the Earth’s core fluid flow dynamics at local scale (e.g. Wardinski et al., 2008). We investigate the temporal-spatial development of the 2003 jerk in more detail near China with the ground-based observations and CHAOS-3 core field model.\nWe select the data in the international geomagnetic quiet days to calculate the monthly means. In order to reduce the influence of the external field, we adopt a function comprising the terms associated with the indices of the geomagnetic activity, and the terms of the periodic signals on the observatory monthly means data (Stewart and Whaler, 1992). We then use an empirical AR-2 model to represent the internal field signals in the observatory data. The extreme detection is applied to identify the jerk in the SV time series. The onset time and the strength of the 2003 jerk are obtained through the detection for geomagnetic field component, X, Y and Z. The maximum of the strength of the 2003 jerk is located under the Indian mainland. The onset time of this jerk propagates approximately southeastward. Two jerks in 2001 and 2003 for the Z component are further compared and they are confirmed as independent processes. We suggest the jerk in 2001 identical to the well known 1999 jerk in Europe (Mandea et al., 2000). Our results reveal the fine structures of the 2003 jerk that corroborate the conclusions in previous studies. The larger scale time-spatial structure given by the AR-2 model constructed from ground observatory data (monthly values) is consistent with the results from the CHAOS-3 model. This structure can be applied for further inversion of the local core surface fluid flow motions.",

            "abstract": "Response of Tribal nations and Tribal communities to current and emerging climate change challenges requires active participation of stakeholders who have effective access to relevant data, information and analytical tools. The Tribal Lands Collaboratory (TLC), currently under development, is a joint effort between the American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC), the Environmental Systems Research Institute (Esri), and the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). The vision of the TLC is to create an integrative platform that enables coordination between multiple stakeholders (e.g. Tribal resource managers, Tribal College faculty and students, farmers, ranchers, and other local community members) to collaborate on locally relevant climate change issues. The TLC is intended to facilitate the transformation of data into actionable information that can inform local climate response planning. The TLC will provide the technical mechanisms to access, collect and analyze data from both internal and external sources (e.g. NASA’s Giovanni climate data portal, Ameriflux or USA National Phenology Network) while also providing the social scaffolds to enable collaboration across Tribal communities and with members of the national climate change research community.\nThe prototype project focuses on phenology, a branch of science focused on relationships between climate and the seasonal timing of biological phenomena. Monitoring changes in the timing and duration of phenological stages in plant and animal co­­­­mmunities on Tribal lands can provide insight to the direct impacts of climate change on culturally and economically significant Tribal resources . The project will leverage existing phenological observation protocols created by the USA-National Phenology Network and NEON to direct data collection efforts and will be tailored to the specific needs and concerns of the community. Phenology observations will be captured and managed within the Collaboratory environment where these data may then be correlated with regional climate data to investigate interactions between large-scale environmental changes and local impacts. Esri’s Story Maps is a candidate mechanism for sharing of those findings among Tribal stakeholders.",

To simulate the Mach-wave, we use kinematic earthquake source descriptions that include fault-regions over which the rupture propagates at super-shear speed. The local slip rate is modeled with the regularized Yoffe function, assuming constant rise time. We generate various realizations of 3D random media by characterizing the heterogeneities of medium parameters using the Von Karman function. We adopt six different characterizations of the medium from combinations of three correlation lengths (0.5 km, 2 km, 5 km) and two standard deviations (5%, 10%). Simulations in a homogeneous medium serve as a reference case. The ground-motion simulations (maximum resolved frequency of 5 Hz) are conducted by solving the elasto-dynamic equations of motions using generalized finite-difference method. The seismic wavefield is sampled at numerous locations within RJB(Joyner-Boore distance) ranging between 10-40 km, with focus on the Mach-cone region, to study the properties and evolution of the Mach-waves in the scattering media.\nWe find that seismic scattering in random media significantly diminishes the coherence of the Mach-wave away from the source. Investigating peak ground velocities (PGV) to quantify the scattering effects, we observe that mean PGV in the medium with the largest correlation length and standard deviation is significantly smaller (by about a factor of 1.5 to 2.5 with increasing RJB distance) compared to the reference case. Correlation length, rather than standard deviation, appears to control the scattering of the Mach wave. Our analysis of Fourier amplitude spectra shows that the seismic energy is redistributed among the three ground-motion components, with an increase of high frequency content in the vertical component. Based on our simulations of Mach-wave properties in scattering media, we hypothesize that local super-shear ruptures may be more common in nature then reported, but are very difficult to detect due to the strong seismic scattering.",

            "abstract": "Among all elements, carbon plays one of the major roles for the sustainability of life on Earth. Past considerations of the carbon cycle have mainly focused on surface processes occurring at the atmosphere, oceans and shallow crustal environments. By contrast, little is known about the Deep Carbon cycle whereas both geochemical and biological processes may induce organic carbon production and/or consumption at depth. Indeed, the nowadays-recognized capability of geochemical processes such as serpentinization to generate abiotic organic compounds as well as the existence of a potentially important intraterrestrial life raises questions about the limit of biotic/abiotic carbon on Earth's deep interior and how it impacts global biogeochemical cycles. It is then mandatory to increase our knowledge on the nature and extent of carbon reservoirs along with their sources, sinks and fluxes in the subsurface.\nThis implies to be able to finely characterize organomineral associations within crustal rocks although it might be hampered by the scarceness and heterogeneous micrometric spatial distribution of organic molecules in natural rocks. We then developed an in situ analytical strategy based on the combination of high-resolution techniques to track organic molecules at the pore level in natural rocks and to determine their biological or abiotic origin. We associated classical high-resolution techniques and synchrotron-based imaging techniques in order to characterize their nature and localization (SEM/TEM, coupled CLSM/Raman spectroscopy, Tof-SIMS) along with their 3D-distribution relatively to mineral phases (S-FTIR, S-DeepUV, XANES, Biphoton microscopy).\nThe effectiveness of this approach to shed light on the speciation and nature of carbon in subsurface environments will be illustrated through the study of (i) subsurface ecosystems and abiotic organic carbon within ultramafic rocks of the oceanic lithosphere as putative analogs for the nature and functioning of primitive ecosystems on Earth and of (ii) ecosystems inhabiting Archean craton and potentially playing a role in punk-rock karstification processes and rocks weathering.",

Despite the uniqueness of these Hadean signatures, the NSB remains so far the only studied supracrustal belt in an otherwise largely unexplored terrane. This study investigates the 146,147Sm-142,143Nd record of newly discovered supracrustals located ca. 2 km northeast of Nuvvuagittuq. Petrologically, the Ukalik supracrustal belt (USB) comprises mafic and ultramafic rocks associated with chemical sediments (BIFs, chert). The metabasalts yield near-concordant 147Sm-143Nd and 146Sm-142Nd ages at 4.07±0.22 Ga and 4.22±0.04 Ga, respectively. The negative 142Nd effects, however, are restricted to Low-Ti (\"boninite-like\") metabasalts, whereas High-Ti (\"MORB-like\") metabasalts have μ142Nd=0. Neither group shows any internal relationship between Sm/Nd and μ142Nd. Furthermore, chemical sediments interleaved with the metabasalts display no resolvable 142Nd effect despite their very low Sm/Nd ratios. These observations suggest that Hadean 146,147Sm-142,143Nd signatures characterizing Ukalik mafic lithologies were generated, possibly in an Eoarchean supra-subduction zone environment, by addition of a metasomatic fluid with μ142Nd<-15 ppm to a normal mantle with μ142Nd=0.",

It is crucial to avoid sampling biases, in order to maintain a globally unbiased XCO2 record for inversion modeling to determine sources and sinks of carbon dioxide. This work presents analysis from the current operational B7 data set, which is identifying as clear approximately 20% of the order one million daily soundings. Of those soundings that are passed to the L2 retrieval algorithm, we find that almost 80% are yielding XCO2 estimates that converge.\nTwo primary preprocessor algorithms are used to cloud screen the OCO-2 soundings. The A-Band Preprocessor (ABP) uses measurements in the Oxygen-A band near 0.76 microns (mm) to determine scenes with large photon path length modifications due to scattering by aerosol and clouds. The Iterative Maximum A-Posteriori (IMAP) Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) algorithm (IDP) computes ratios of retrieved CO2 (and H2O) in the 1.6mm (weak CO2) and 2.0mm (strong CO2) spectral bands to determine scenes with spectral differences, indicating contamination by scattering materials. We demonstrate that applying these two algorithms in tandem provides robust cloud screening of the OCO-2 data set.\nWe compare the OCO-2 cloud screening results to collocated Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) cloud mask data and show that agreement between the two sensors is approximately 85-90%. A detailed statistical analysis is performed on a winter and spring 16-day repeat cycle for the nadir-land, glint-land and glint-water viewing geometries. No strong seasonal, spatial or footprint dependencies are found, although the agreement tends to be worse at high solar zenith angles and for snow and ice covered surfaces.",

The sand flume experiment results show that milder slope induces larger upper saline plume (USP) and seaward salt wedge interface (SWI) under tidal forcing. While, the steady state SWI keeps stagnant with different beach slopes. Consistent with the previous research, our numerical simulations also show a lager flux exchange across the milder beach induced by the tidal fluctuations.

Although two disasters, “921 earthquake” in 1999 and typhoon Toraji in 2001, heavily hit this area and cause a significant reduction in visitors from 1 to about 0.4 million per year, the tourists have returned after the reconstruction in 2003 and approached 1.5 million high since 2010. The high quantity of tourists obviously drives the development of tourism industry which, unfortunately, increases the local sources of heating. A preliminarily analysis showed the warming rate was 0.29 oC/decade for June 2005 to May 2013 while from the 1940s to the 1980s, it was only 0.1 oC/decade. The warming pattern in Xitou region is similar to the global warming situation that a more dramatic trend happened during the past 10 years. The change of land use, which derived from the pressure of tourism industry, might accelerate regional climate warming.\nFor the purpose of understanding cloud response to anthropogenic forcing, the long-term 1-km spatial resolution cloud top heights (cth) data sets (collection 6) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were assessed. The results showed the annual cloud event amounts of the Terra and Aqua changed insignificantly since 2003 disregard of the cth. However, the cloud fraction of the cth less than 2000m was 18% in 2003 and dropped dramatically to 7% since 2011. Correspondingly, the cth between 2000m to 4000m was increased from 35% in 2003 to 45% in 2014. Further analysis the nighttime events indicated similar pattern but only 6% different between 2003 and 2014. The Aqua daytime events showed a more dramatic fraction anomaly which was decreased 18% at the cth less than 2000m and increased 18% at the cth between 2000m to 4000m. This preliminary assessment represents the cloud is pushing higher which might be caused by the anthropogenic forcing during the last decade. However, this study also found that the cth data sets were sensitive to the upgrade of inversion model and satellite calibration in 2010 which might also be another important consideration. A total solution of integrating ceilometer, ground lidar, spaceborne lidar and UAV profile observations for monitoring/understanding the characteristics of Xitou microclimate change are still on-going.",

            "abstract": "Global river discharge is an important component of global hydrologic cycle, but is difficult to observe. Here, we provide remote sensing-based estimates of global river discharge using land and ocean mass balances using multiple precipitation, evaporation and reanalysis products as well as mass change estimates derived from GRACE and altimetry. Compared to estimates from in-situ observations and land surface models, the remote sensing-based estimates show significantly larger amplitude at annual as well as interannual scales. This suggests a range of uncertainty in current methods of discharge estimation. Global river discharge is expected to change as a part of the intensification of the hydrologic cycle due to climate change, and also due to increased anthropogenic management. To explore the influence of changes in river discharge on ocean and climate processes, we run simulations of ocean-sea ice model forced with varying amount of river discharge and analyze fields such as sea surface salinity, sea surface temperature, mixed layer depth, barrier layer thickness, upper ocean circulation, meridional overturning circulation, and sea ice thickness and extent. This analysis provides insights on the extent to which changes- likely anthropogenic- and uncertainties in continental freshwater forcing can affect ocean, and therefore climate, processes, and the regions where the effects are likely to be most pronounced.",

            "abstract": "The effects and related risks to potable aquifers due to pressure increases and brine leakage through abandoned wells is a poorly understood phenomena and a potentially significant contributor to the risk profile in Geologic Carbon Capture and Storage. Numerical models are used to investigate the evolution of brine leakage (during and post-injection) through wells located in the region where plugged and abandoned (P&A) wellbores leakage could occur. This area, termed tier 3, builds on a 3-tier methodology to define the Area of Review (AoR) proposed by Birkholzer et al. (2013). This work, in conjunction with a quantitative assessment of tier 1 AoR (an area encompassing the CO2 plume) and tier 2 AoR (an are encompassing the extent where open well-bore brine leakage could occur), will lead to a quantitative understanding of potential risks and a metric for the complete spatial extent of environmental risk in Carbon Capture and Storage. Here, we develop a probabilistic methodology to generate “risk maps” related to tier 3 AoR. The risk maps are based on the premise that the two greatest sources of uncertainty in P&A leakage are 1) the location of the unknown well with respect to the injection well and 2) the permeability of the leaky P&A (which can span over several orders of magnitude). The methodology utilizes numerical simulations and probability theory to generate spatial distributions of risk, defined with no-impact or MCL thresholds. Probabilistic risk maps can be used to provide risk-based descriptions of the AoR to inform site selection and monitoring during and post-injection.",

            "abstract": "Six 12 kilometer resolution WRF simulations are performed driven by three GCM outputs --- CCSM4, GFDL, and HadGEM --- in 10-yr or 15-yr historical period. The model fidelity is measured in terms of correlations, RMSEs, and probability distribution functions. The model evaluations are conducted over 20 subregions for North America. The 3D and surface variables considered in this study are precipitation, 2m-temperature, tmax/tmin, relative humidity, geopotential height, u-wind/v-wind, and sea-level pressure. We aim to find which downscaled GCM run showed the best skill over each subregion for all the variables. Depending on the variable and type of metric being examined, the output from each historical run will be primarily compared to North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) and Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) data for the statistical analysis. It is important to both evaluate which high resolution ensemble member captures the climatological mean of the variables as well as to determine which run does the best at observing the extremes values, such as maximum/minimum temperature and large precipitation events. High RMSE values frequently occur because of errors in either the seasonal mean, which could indicate a specific bias in the model, or a failure to capture the tails of the PDF correctly, which indicates the model had trouble capturing the seasonal variability. This will give us valuable information at which GCM is the most effective at simulating historical periods using dynamic downscaling over specific regions of the United States and give us added confidence of their ability to forecast future time periods based on model performance.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost peatlands are becoming increasingly vulnerable to thaw, as high latitude temperatures increase at a faster rate than the rest of the planet and as disturbances such as wildfires become more frequent and more intense. Peatlands account for nearly 30 percent of the soil organic carbon (C) within the northern permafrost region, storing roughly 275 Pg of organic C, equivalent to over one-third of the C currently in the atmosphere. Much uncertainty remains about how much peat C is lost, the controls on loss, and what the long-term C balance is following permafrost thaw. Here, we explore some of these questions using both a chronosequence and mass-balance modeling approach, as well as using paleoecological reconstructions to better understand the timing of peatland development and permafrost aggradation and degradation over the Holocene. Carbon from the formerly frozen permafrost plateau is released to the atmosphere upon permafrost thaw on the order of years to decades, and long-term accumulation of post-thaw bog peat leads to carbon uptake over centuries to millennia. We also show that understanding the depositional environment of the peat can help explain greater or lower carbon losses following thaw. In order to place these results into the context of permafrost peatlands across the northern high latitudes, we synthesized existing paleoecological reconstructions from peat cores and demonstrate that most peatlands that either currently contain permafrost or have experienced recent thaw (last few decades), formed permafrost epigenetically or quasi-epigenetically, with most permafrost aggradation occurring during Holocene neoglacial cooling and the Little Ice Age.",

            "abstract": "The problem of attributing atmospheric fossil fuel signatures to specific source contributors—i.e. sectors of the economy—from measured greenhouse gas concentrations is an important one to solve so that policy makers can best make educated regulatory decisions towards reducing any desired sector's carbon emissions. One approach for solving this attribution problem involves applying atmospheric inversions to flask measurements collected on communication towers. The precision of the inversions’ attributions can be augmented through the addition of prior knowledge of source locations. Further, by including multiple species’ concentrations in an analysis, unique signatures can be identified to help distinguish between nearby sources with similar characteristics. The analysis presented here expands upon this framework by incorporating a neural network classifier known as a self-organizing map to facilitate the identification of source signatures. Indianapolis is chosen as the urban domain. The Indianapolis Flux Experiment (INFLUX) flask collection towers serve as the measurement sites, and the source locations from Hestia—the high-resolution CO2 emission product—are used to spatially identify source areas of interest. The accuracy and sensitivity of the source attribution model is tested in the theoretical framework using Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs). Based on the OSSEs, the theoretical requirements are presented in terms of the characteristics of the gas species and the relative importance of their uniqueness related to individual sectors of economic activities. A first practical application of the method is presented for the INFLUX flask campaign, analyzing an unprecedented amount of flask samples at multiple site locations available over a single urban area.",

            "abstract": "The IRIS Data Management Center (DMC) has served waveform data to the seismology community for over 25 years. This presentation highlights a new, on-demand synthetic seismogram service that will complement the time series data we have traditionally distributed. The synthetics are accessible using a straightforward web service that returns synthetics according to specified source-receiver combinations, Earth model and signal band. This new service is designed to generate synthetic seismograms extremely fast, making it feasible to request large numbers of synthetics. This capability supports studying variations in source properties, Earth models or temporal changes in instrument responses. Our collaborators have computed a global-scale database of Green's functions from which users can request synthetic seismograms for arbitrary source and receiver parameters and Earth models. This multi-terabyte database of Green's functions is computed using the spectral-element method AxiSEM (www.axisem.info) for selected common spherically symmetric Earth models (PREM, IASP91, AK135f...) with anisotropy and attenuation. Fine-scale models have resolution from 1 to about 100 sec periods with durations of 30 minutes; lower resolution models extend to a few hours duration. Behind the scenes, the web service runs Instaseis (www.instaseis.net), a system that rapidly calculates broadband synthetic seismograms from the pre-calculated Green’s function. The service also provides post-processing methods, including convolution with a specified moment tensor (or GCMT id) and one of a few source-time functions with variable duration. The interface is designed to be callable by user-friendly scripts and to support automated processing workflows. The DMC will also provide a command line script to download selections of synthetics. This new dataset and related service provide a powerful tool in multiple research areas where synthetic seismograms are useful. In this presentation, we will also highlight other new IRIS DMC data products that have been recently released or are in development.\n<span\">",

In this study, variability and changes in ground surface and soil temperatures up to 3.20 m were investigated based on data and information obtained from hydrometeorological stations across Eurasian continent since the early 1950s. Ground surface and soil temperatures were measured daily by using the same standard method and by the trained professionals across Eurasian continent, which makes the dataset unique and comparable over a large study region. Using the daily soil temperature profiles, soil seasonal freeze depth was also obtained through linear interpolation. Preliminary results show that soil temperatures at various depths have increased dramatically, almost twice as much as air temperature increase over the same period. Regionally, soil temperature increase was more dramatically in high northern latitudes than mid/lower latitude regions. Air temperature changes alone may not be able to fully explain the magnitude of changes in soil temperatures. Further study indicates that snow cover establishment started later in autumn and snow cover disappearance occurred earlier in spring, while winter snow depth became thicker with a decreasing trend of snow density. Changes in snow cover conditions may play an important role in changes of soil temperatures over the Eurasian continent. ",

Another way to approach drought is from a “perception” perspective, where individuals whose livelihood is highly dependent on precipitation take adaptive actions. In this study we use two-years of data collected from twelve smallholder farms in southern St. Elizabeth, Jamaica to undertake an end-to-end analysis of drought. At each farm, 6-hour temperature and soil moisture, and tipping-bucket rainfall were recorded from June 2013 to June 2015, and twice-monthly farmers indicated whether they were experiencing drought and if they irrigated (hand-watering, drip irrigation, or pipe and sprinkler). In many cases half of the farmers considered themselves in a drought, while the others not, even though the largest separation among farms was about 20 km. This study will use analysis of variance to test the following hypotheses: Drought perception is related to a) absolute amounts of precipitation at the time, b) other environmental cues at the time (soil moisture, temperature), or c) relative amounts of precipitation as compared to the same time last year. Irrigation actions and water use following the perception of drought will also be examined.",

The elements of this grand challenge are by now well known. Analysis of agricultural sustainability is made more challenging by the fact that the local responses to these global drivers of change are extremely variable in space and time due to the biophysical and geopolitical heterogeneity across the United States, and the world. Utilizing research networks allows the scientific community to leverage existing knowledge, models and data to develop a framework for understanding the interplay between global change drivers, regional, and continental sustainability of US agriculture. For example, well-established instrumented and calibrated research networks will allow for the examination of the potential tradeoffs between: 1) crop production, 2) land use and carbon emissions and sequestration, 3) groundwater depletion, and 4) nitrogen dynamics. NEON represents a major investment in scientific infrastructure in support of ecological research at a continental scale and is intended to address multiple ecological grand challenges. NEON will collect data from automated sensors and sample organisms and ecological variables in 20 eco-climatic domains. We will provide examples of how NEON’s full potential can be realized when these data are combined with long term experimental results and other sensor networks [e.g., Ameriflux, Fluxnet, the Long-term Ecological Research Program (LTER), the Long-term Agroecosystem Research Network (LTAR)], Critical Zone Observatory (CZO).",

Our current understanding of exchange processes is primarily based on field observations collected during baseflow conditions, with few studies considering time-variable stream-aquifer interactions during storm events. We completed ten sets of four in-stream tracer slug injections during and after a large storm event in a headwater catchment at the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon. The injections were performed in three adjacent 50-meter study reaches, enabling comparison of spatial heterogeneity in transport processes. Reach-scale data demonstrate apparent trends with discharge in both transient storage and long-term storage (commonly “channel water balance”). Comparison of flowpath-scale observations from a network of monitoring wells to reach-scale observations showed that the advective timescale changed with discharge making it difficult to infer process from simple, reach-scale tracer studies. Overall, our results highlight the opportunities and challenges for interpretation of multi-scale solute tracer data along the stream-hyporheic-riparian-hillslope continuum.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic deformation is the surface expression of the internal dynamics of an inherently complex system resulting from the interaction of magma with the surrounding rocks. Geodetic techniques, as Global Positioning System (GPS) and/or Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR), are being extensively used to monitor such ground deformation. Nevertheless, it is impossible to directly observe the processes at depth that cause the observed ground deformation. The interpretation of geodetic data requires both, mathematical modeling to simulate the observed signals and inversion approaches to estimate the deformation source parameters. In this study we provide a numerical tool for interpreting geodetic data by solving in an efficient and accurate way the inverse problem to estimate the optimal parameters for magmatic sources (spherical magma chambers and tensile dislocations). In doing so, we propose a Finite Element Method (FEM) for the calculation of Green functions in an heterogeneous medium. The key aspect of the methodology lies in how to incorporate the source into the model and in applying the reciprocity relationship between the station and the source. In our approach, deformation sources are independent of the simulation mesh. The search for the best fit point source(s) is conducted for an array of 3-D locations extending below a predefined volume region. The total number of Green functions is reduced to the number of the observation points by using the reciprocity relationship. We apply this methodology to the recent inflation observed at Kilauea's Southwest Rift Zone in May 2015, observed with the new Sentinel-1 radar interferometry satellite mission, to report the magma transport along the zone.",

            "abstract": "Floods claim more lives and damage more property than any other category of natural disaster in the Continental U.S. A system that can demarcate local flood boundaries dynamically could help flood prone communities prepare for and even prevent from catastrophic flood events. Lateral distance from the centerline of the river to the right and left floodplains for the water levels coming out of the models at each grid location have not been properly integrated with the national hydrography dataset (NHDPlus). The NHDPlus dataset represents the stream network with feature classes such as rivers, tributaries, canals, lakes, ponds, dams, coastlines, and stream gages. The NHDPlus dataset consists of approximately 2.7 million river reaches defining how surface water drains to the ocean. These river reaches have upstream and downstream nodes and basic parameters such as flow direction, drainage area, reach slope etc. We modified an existing algorithm (Gangodagamage et al., 2007, 2011) to provide lateral distance from the centerline of the river to the right and left floodplains for the flows simulated by models. Previous work produced floodplain boundaries for static river stages (i.e. 3D metric: distance along the main stem, flow depth, lateral distance from river center line). Our new approach introduces the floodplain boundary for variable water levels with the fourth dimension, time. We use modeled flows from WRFHydro and demarcate the right and left lateral boundaries of inundation dynamically. This approach dynamically integrates with high resolution models (e.g., hourly and ~ 1 km spatial resolution) that are developed from recent advancements in high computational power with ground based measurements (e.g., Fluxnet), lateral inundation vectors (direction and spatial extent) derived from multi-temporal remote sensing data (e.g., LiDAR, WorldView 2, Landsat, ASTER, MODIS), and improved representations of the physical processes through multi-parameterizations. Our approach enhances the normalized (streams are at zero elevations) DEM derived upstream flow routing pathways for stream reaches for given water stages as more and more satellite data become available for various flood inundations. Validation of the inundation boundaries is performed using HEC-RAS hydrodynamic model results for selected streams.",

Studies of the rich fossil records, in combination with outcropping lacustrine sequences, led to major breakthroughs in our knowledge of driving factors in human evolution. However, study of continuous drill core from ancient lake basins provides a basis for to unravel East African climate dynamics in an unseen fashion.\n The Hominin Sites and Paleolakes Drilling Project (HSPDP), and the related Olorgesailie Drilling Project, recovered ~2 km of drill core since 2012. A major project goal is characterization of East African paleoclimate in order to evaluate its impact on hominin evolution. XRF core scanning data provide a means of evaluating records of past environmental conditions continuously and at high resolution. However, the HSPDP records contain complex lithologies reflecting repeated episodes of inundation and desiccation of the lake basins. Nevertheless, careful data evaluation based on detailed lithostratigraphy, which includes smear-slide microscopic analyses and X-radiographic images, allows disentanglement of complex signals and robust identification of continuous sequences for any cyclostratigraphic and statistical analysis.\n At the HSPDP Turkana Basin site a 175.6 m-long core the covers the Early Pleistocene time window during which hominids first expanded out of Africa and marine records document reorganization of tropical climate and the development of the strong Walker circulation. This drill site carries particular interest as it is located in only 2.5 km from the location of one of the most complete hominin skeletons ever recovered (Turkana Boy).\n Here we present a methodological approach to address the highly variable lithostratigraphy of the East African records to establish comprehensive and environmentally meaningful paleoclimate timeseries. In addition, the XRF record of the changing hydroclimate of the West Turkana Basin from 1.3 to 1.9 kyrs will be explored in relation to regional reconstructions and marine stratigraphies.",

            "abstract": "The boom in shale natural gas (NG) production, brought about by advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, has yielded both economic benefits and concerns about environmental and climate impacts. In particular, leakages of methane from the NG supply chain could substantially increase the carbon footprint of NG, diminishing its potential role as a transition fuel between carbon intensive fossil fuels and renewable energy systems. Recent research has demonstrated significant variability in measured methane emission rates from NG production facilities within a given shale gas basin. This variability often reflect facility-specific differences in NG production capacity, facility age, utilization of emissions capture and control, and/or the level of facility inspection and maintenance. Across NG production basins, these differences in facility-level methane emission rates are likely amplified, especially if significant variability in NG composition and state emissions regulations are present. In this study, we measured methane emission rates from the NG production sector in the Marcellus Shale Basin (Pennsylvania and West Virginia), currently the largest NG production basin in the U.S., and contrast these results with those of the Denver-Julesburg (Colorado) and Uintah (Utah) shale basins. Facility-level methane emission rates were measured at 106 NG production facilities using the dual tracer flux (nitrous oxide and acetylene), Gaussian dispersion simulations, and the OTM 33A techniques. The distribution of facility-level average methane emission rate for each NG basin will be discussed, with emphasis on how variability in NG composition (i.e., ethane-to-methane ratios) and state emissions regulations impact measured methane leak rates. While the focus of this presentation will be on the comparison of methane leak rates among NG basins, the use of three complimentary top-down methane measurement techniques provides a unique opportunity to explore the effectiveness of each approach, which will also be discussed.",

The gamma-ray spectrum, time-intensity profile, and luminosity at the putative source altitude are consistent with those of a Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flash (TGF). The fluence of >100 keV gamma rays at ground level in the ~200 μs flash was in excess of 10 photons / cm2, an order of magnitude brighter than typical TGFs observed from low-Earth orbit.

The Wildlife Conservation Society currently works with local communities in running a Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) project in Makira. High cloud cover in humid forests and seasonal variations in vegetation make temporally consistent classifications difficult, affecting the estimates of deforestation needed for REDD+. Carnegie Landsat Analysis System lite, or CLASlite, is a free software tool designed to pre-process and analyze remotely sensed data, creating forest and deforestation maps, between other outputs. This study was performed in collaboration with WCS using fifteen Landsat 5, 7, and 8 images to determine the performance of CLASlite in comparison to previous mapping work using a conventional mapping approach.\nA combination of CLASlite and expert interpretation created four forest vs. non-forest maps from 1994, 2001, 2010, and 2014 with 92% overall accuracy in the 26,956 km² study area. Over the twenty year period, 7.9% of the 11, 464 km² of original forest was lost. Visual comparisons with the previous mapping work revealed that CLASlite was better at detecting small patches of forest as well as connectivity in riparian areas. Various cloud masking settings within CLASlite allowed for adjustments specific to cloud and sensor types. Cloud contaminations were minimized by utilizing Landsat tiles from the dry season. CLASlite is well designed for conservation practitioners and performed well in this forest type.",

Terrace sequences are composed of alternating slope segments with steep rubble-covered risers and gently sloping treads, culminating in extensive summit flats. Entire Beringian upland landscapes are dominated by these features. Cryoplanation terraces are cut into bedrock and thought to evolve through locally intensified periglacial weathering and mass-movement processes in the vicinity of late-lying snowpatches. Geospatial analysis demonstrates that terrace elevation rises from 100-300 m.a.s.l. on Bering Sea islands to median values greater than 1200 m in the Yukon-Tanana Upland, near the Alaska-Canada border. The regional trends of cryoplanation terrace elevation are similar to those of cirques and reconstructed ELAs across interior and western Alaska, with gradients ranging from 0.74 to 1.2 m km-1. The similarity of these trends indicates close genetic links between glacial cirques and cryoplanation terraces, involving topographic position, continentality gradients, and the mass balance of localized snow accumulation. Cryoplanation terraces can be considered as the periglacial analogs of glacial cirques, and have greater potential as sources of paleoclimatic information than smaller periglacial features more sensitive to short-term climate variations. Process-oriented studies, age determinations, and high-resolution mapping are needed before their paleoenvironmental potential of these landforms can be fully realized.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, surface wave dispersion has been used to image lithospheric structure jointly with receiver function, or Rayleigh wave ellipticity (Julia et al., 2000; Lin et al., 2012). Because surface wave dispersion is the total propagation effect of the travel path, the joint inversion relies on dense seismic arrays or high seismicity to obtain local velocity structure. However, both receiver function and Rayleigh wave ellipticity are single station measurements with localized sensitivities and could be combined for joint inversion naturally. In this study we explored the feasibility of the joint inversion of Rayleigh wave ellipticity and receiver function. We performed sensitivity tests with forward modeling, and found that the receiver function is sensitive to sharp velocity interfaces but shows weak sensitivity to long wavelength structure, almost complementary to Rayleigh wave ellipticity. Therefore, joint inversion with two single-station measurements provides tighter constraints on the velocity structure beneath the seismic station. A joint inversion algorithm based on the Fast Simulated Annealing method is developed to invert Rayleigh wave ellipticity and receiver function for the lithospheric structure. Application of the algorithm to the Indian Craton and the Williston Basin in the United States demonstrates its effectiveness in reducing the non-uniqueness of the inversion. However, the joint inversion is not sensitive to average crustal velocity, suggesting the need to combine surface wave dispersion, receiver function and Rayleigh wave ellipticity to more accurately resolve the velocity structure.\n",

It is connected to the North Atlantic Ocean via the loop current, which transports salt and heat from the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico poleward via the Gulf Stream. As such, variations in Gulf of Mexico sea surface temperature (SST) and salinity (SSS) are linked to changes in North Atlantic Ocean circulation and North American hydroclimate. Although SST and SSS variability in the Gulf of Mexico are well understood on inter-annual and glacial-interglacial timescales, little is known about centennial scale variability in these sea surface parameters through the Holocene. We present here the first continuous multi-decadal resolution time series of SST and SSS spanning the entire Holocene from the Gulf of Mexico. This proxy reconstruction is based on paired measurements of Mg/Ca and δ18O in the planktic foraminifer, Globigerinoides ruber (white variety) in the Garrison Basin. Using these data, in combination with additional Gulf of Mexico SST and SSS records from the late Holocene, we explore linkages between North American precipitation patterns and ocean circulation on centennial timescales.",

            "abstract": "Diel variations of solute concentrations in aquatic ecosystems reflect coupled influences of abiotic and biotic processes. Driven by solar radiation and temperature, processes such as autotrophic production, heterotrophic consumption and photodegradation will exhibit diel, or 24 hour, cycles. Stream size and moisture conditions will also influence these processes. Hydrologic flow paths will influence solute concentrations. While much research has focused on diel patterns of dissolved oxygen (DO), little is known about the response of nutrients and dissolved organic matter (DOM) to these processes. Understanding diel cycles of DOM and nutrients will help scientists better predict how disturbances in the terrestrial environment and watershed processes could modify solute concentrations and thus effect water quality and ecosystem function. This research sought to ascertain: What are the coupling patterns among the diel cycles of DOC, nitrate-N, and other solutes and what are the mechanisms controlling that coupling (hydrology, biology, spatial scale)? What insights do high-frequency sensors provide on diel patterns?\nWe studied diel patterns across stream orders in a forested watershed in the Piedmont region of Maryland. Sensors were installed and grab samples were collected from three stream locations within a 79 ha catchment to capture the spatial effect on the diel patterns. UV and fluorescence sensors were used to capture the daily cycles of DOC, nitrate-N, turbidity, temperature, DO, specific conductance, and fluorescent DOM. Groundwater elevation was measured every 30 minutes and stream discharge was measured every 20 minutes. Hourly grab samples were collected over three days for lab measurements of the diel periodicity in fluorescence excitation-emission matrix—an indicator of DOM composition—and major cations and anions. Preliminary results suggest diel patterns of DOC and nitrate-N were more evident during a long dry period in the forested watershed.",

            "abstract": "Due to recent advances in extraction technology, oil and natural gas extraction and processing in the Denver-Julesburg basin has increased substantially in the past decade. Northeastern Colorado is also home to over 250 concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), capable of hosting over 2 million head of ruminant livestock (cattle and sheep). Because of methane’s high Global Warming Potential, quantification and attribution of methane emissions from oil and gas development and agricultural activity are important for guiding greenhouse gas emission policy. However, due to the co-location of these different sources, top-down measurements of methane are often unable to attribute emissions to a specific source or sector. In this work, we evaluate the ammonia:methane emission ratio directly downwind of CAFOs using a mobile laboratory. Several CAFOs were chosen for periodic study over a 12-month period to identify diurnal and seasonal variation in the emission ratio as well as differences due to livestock type. Using this knowledge of the agricultural ammonia:methane emission ratio, aircraft measurements of ammonia and methane over oil and gas basins in the western US during the Shale Oil and Natural Gas Nexus (SONGNEX) field campaign in March and April 2015 can be used for source attribution of methane emissions.",

            "abstract": "Sunspot penumbra consists of spines (more vertical field) and penumbral filaments (interspines). Spines are outward extension of umbra. Penumbral filaments are recently found, both in observations and magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, to be magnetized stretched granule-like convective cells, with strong upflows near the head that continues along the central axis with weakening strength of the flow. Strong downflows are found at the tails of filaments and weak downflows along the sides of it. These lateral downflows often contain opposite polarity magnetic field to that of spines; most strongly near the heads of filaments. In spite of this advancement in understanding of small-scale structure of sunspot penumbra, how the filaments and spines evolve and interact remains uncertain. Penumbral jets, bright, transient features, seen in the chromosphere, are one of several dynamic events in sunspot penumbra. It has been proposed that these penumbral microjets result from component (acute angle) reconnection of the magnetic field in spines with that in interspines and could contribute to transition-region and coronal heating above sunspots. In a recent investigation, it was proposed that the jets form as a result of reconnection between the opposite polarity field at edges of filaments with spine field, and it was found that these jets do not significantly directly heat the corona above sunspots. We discuss how the proposed formation of penumbral jets is integral to the formation mechanism of penumbral filaments and spines, and may explain why penumbral jets are few and far between. We also point out that the generation of the penumbral jets could indirectly drive coronal heating via generation of MHD waves or braiding of the magnetic field.",

Both experimental and modeling efforts have shown that these receivers can detect changes in reflected GNSS signals that are indicative of changes in sea state. Numerous studies using GNSS receivers flown on aircraft have also shown that the reflected signals are sensitive to changes in soil moisture and vegetation cover. However, the only analysis of the detection of GNSS reflected signals over land using spaceborne receivers has been limited to the small amount of data recorded nearly 10 years ago by the UK-DMC satellite.\nLast year’s launch of the TechDemoSat (TDS) satellite, carrying an instrument similar to that planned for NASA’s CYGNSS mission, represents an enormous opportunity to investigate the potential of using spaceborne GNSS receivers to sense changes in the land surface, including soil moisture and flood-inundated areas. With a revisit time of only a few hours, the observations from the CYGNSS constellation could provide data with a temporal resolution that would be unmatched by traditional remote sensing satellites.\nHere, we present data collected over land by the receiver onboard TDS and report its sensitivity to changes in surface roughness, vegetation parameters, and open water (lakes and rivers), as well as standing water beneath vegetation (marshes and wetlands). In particular, we investigate how the normalized peak power of the delay-Doppler maps that are recorded by the receiver is affected by changes in the land surface. Preliminary results indicate that the signal is strongly affected by changes in topography. However, once this effect is removed using digital elevation models, the influence of rivers, lakes, and wetlands on the signal is clearly seen. Examples of large signal changes coming from areas of likely-saturated ground lend credence to the idea that these data could also be sensitive to changes in surface soil moisture.",

We investigate the long-term relationships between fire, climate, human-impact and the history of biodiversity based on four Holocene macro- and micro- charcoal records and a synthesis on previously published pollen data and geochemistry data. Three hypotheses based on global charcoal records and former studies on palaeofire carried out in China need to be test by this study: 1) during early-mid Holocene period, fire frequency in the study area is relative low and best explained by the changes of regional climate; 2) during the late Holocene, fire activities in the study area increased might due to impacts of the human activities over the climate changes, and human activities is responsible for the temporal and spatial variations in fire regime; 3) the difference of fire histories can be explained by the difference of vegetation composition at site.",

A set of 13 spectral bands is available ranging from the visible and NIR to SWIR, featuring four bands at 10 m, six bands at 20 m and three bands at 60 m spatial resolution. Depending on the presence of clouds, satellite data will be available every 10-15 days.\nIn comparison to the last sensors, Sentinel-2 incorporates three new spectral bands in the red-edge region which are particularly important for the retrieval and monitoring of biophysical parameter characteristics of dynamic ecosystems such as crops and grasslands.\nUnder the umbrella of the COST Action ES0903, a hyperspectral flight campaign was organised at Viote del Monte Bondone (Trento, Italy) and five EC towers were installed on subalpine grasslands characterised by extreme variability of ecosystem structural parameters. The aim of the campaign was to compare the performance of different vegetation indices (simulating Sentinel-2 bands) in estimating NEE of these grassland ecosystems and to explore the structural and radiation controls on CO2 fluxes. The predictive capacity of partial least squares regression (PLSR) models using the full range of spectral data from different sites and from different airborne acquisitions was also assessed, and the appropriateness of the Sentinel-2 spatial resolution for ground-based flux upscaling was tested.\nThe high structural heterogeneity of the investigated canopies resulted in high NEE fluxes spatial variability within the 5 investigated towers, indicating that, within the same grassland vegetation type, there is an evident control of structural traits on photosynthesis. Including PAR into the model resulted in a general increase in the performance of the linear regression. Also, the high predictive capacity of PLSR models confirmed the potential of using the full spectrum in the models.\nOur findings have major implications for upscaling terrestrial CO2 fluxes to larger regions and call for more cross-site synthesis studies linking satellite observations, ground-based observations and ecosystem-scale CO2 fluxes.",

A total of 1,271 fish from five species collected at 103 sites during 1980–2012 were used for the modeling effort: 210 brown trout, 710 rainbow trout, 79 Sacramento pikeminnow, 93 Sacramento sucker, and 179 smallmouth bass. Sediment data were used from 73 sites, including 106 analyses of THg and 77 analyses of MeHg. The dataset included 391 fish (mostly rainbow trout) and 28 sediment samples collected explicitly for this study during 2011–12. Spatial data on historical mining included the USGS Mineral Resources Data System and publicly available maps and satellite photos showing the areas of hydraulic mine pits and other placer mines. Modeling was done using multivariate linear regression and multi-model inference using Akaike Information Criteria. Results indicate that fish THg, accounting for species and length, can be predicted using geospatial data on mining history together with other landscape characteristics including land use/land cover. A model requiring only geospatial data, with an R2 value of 0.61, predicted fish THg correctly with respect to over-or-under 0.2 µg/g wet weight (a California regulatory threshold) for 108 of 121 (89 %) size-species combinations tested. Data for THg in streambed sediment did not improve the geospatial-only model. However, data for sediment MeHg, loss on ignition (organic content), and percent of sediment less than 0.063 mm resulted in a slightly improved model, with an R2 value of 0.63. It is anticipated that these models will be useful to the State of California and others to predict areas where mercury concentrations in fish are likely to exceed regulatory criteria.",

Herein we present key aspects of the synchrotron beamline and ancillary equipment, including source considerations, rapid (de)compression apparatus, high frequency imaging detectors, and software suitable for processing large volumes of data.

            "abstract": "The Colorado River and its tributaries support 40 million municipal water users and 5.5 million acres of agriculture in the south western United States (U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, 2012). Recent estimates by Rumsey et al. (2015) suggest that a significant portion (about 50 percent) of surface water flow in the Upper Colorado River Basin (UCRB) is sustained by groundwater discharge to streams. Predicted climate variation (Cook et al., 2015) and increased water demand (U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, 2012) within the UCRB suggest future decreases in groundwater discharge, however transient groundwater responses are not well understood. In this study we calculate groundwater mean transit time (MTT) and transit time distribution (TTD) as predictors of the pattern and timing of groundwater response to hydraulic stress. Samples from nineteen large springs within the UCRB were analyzed for environmental tracers to determine MTT and TTD. The predictive value of the MTT is examined by a statistical analysis of MTT, historical spring discharge records, and the Palmer Hydrological Drought Index. MTTs of the 19 springs range from 10 to 15,000 years with a flow-weighted average of 1,650 years. The composite TTD of the 19 springs suggest that flowpaths representing 45 percent of their combined discharge have transit times greater than 100 years. However, spring discharge records indicate that flow responds to drought on much shorter (0.5 - 6 year) time scales, indicative of a hydraulic pressure response. Springs with shorter MTTs (< 100) generally correlated with larger discharge variations and faster responses to drought indicating MTT can be used for estimating the relative magnitude and timing of groundwater response. Previous study (e.g., Manga, 1999) has shown groundwater responds on shorter time scales than the MTT, but of interest the results presented here indicate that relatively stable and old springs with long MTTs (> 100) also show a hydraulic pressure response. While not fully representative of the UCRB, results from the 19 springs indicate that groundwater discharge responds to climate variation and water-demand imbalances over a relatively short time period of years.",

Hydrogen production from low-temperature alteration of ultramafic and basaltic rocks has been proposed to support early microbial life in Earth’s earliest subsurface environments [1]. Similarly, evidence for microbial sulphate reduction has been reported from early Archean metabasaltic pillow lavas [2]. As such, Archean terrestrial rock environments preserved in greenstone belts may play an important role in understanding early Martian subsurface environments, which in turn may have led to preservation of early traces of life. In this context, the rock sequences of the Paleoarchean Barberton greenstone belt of South Africa provide unique Martian analogues as these rocks are exceptionally well preserved and record early Earth (and perhaps Martian-type) subsurface processes. In-situ exploration by rovers, remote sensing studies, and meteorite evidence has indicated the presence of altered gabbros, olivine-/pyroxene-bearing basalts and possible felsic porphyries on Mars. In this study we present a range of relevant 3.5 billion year old Archean greenstone belt analogue samples that include altered tholeiitic basalts, basaltic komatiites, serpentinized ultramafic komatiites and a felsic tonalite. The petrography and mineralogy of the samples are presented in terms of relic igneous phases and clay mineral alteration. We are acquiring visible/near-infrared reflectance and mid-IR emission spectra on these early Archean samples with the aim of using the hyperspectral data for ground truthing remote sensing data and mineral identification/environments on Mars.\n[1].

            "abstract": "Techniques in the assessment and mitigation of the landslide hazard can be strengthened with application of structure from motion (SfM)-- an inexpensive photogrammetric method. We investigate a landslide north of Black Canyon City, Arizona. The ~0.6 km2 landslide is easily identified through remotely-sensed imagery and in the field. The landslide displaces series of Early and Middle Miocene volcanic and sedimentary rocks. We use SfM to generate a 0.2 m resolution digital elevation model and rectified ortho-mosaic from UAV- and balloon-based images. Derivative maps (hillshade, slope, contour) and the ortho-mosaic were used as base map for our detailed surface geomorphology and geology mapping. The main head scarp is ~600 m long and oriented NE-SW; minor scarps oriented NW-SE are also identified. Numerous open fractures (mm to m lengths) were identified throughout the landslide body (mostly with longitudinal orientation). The occurrence of a distinctive layer of reddish dark colored basalt lava presents a key displaced marker to estimate the landslide movement. Using this marker, the total displacement is estimated to be ~70 m vertically with maximum translation of ~95 m to the SE by both translation and horizontal axis rotation. The landslide geometry, fracture distribution and orientation, all indicate that the landslide is a rotational landslide with its surface movement is largely controlled by local topography. We estimate the rate of the slide motion by measuring the amount of fracture displacement and speculative ages of the disturbed vegetation located along the fractures. The analysis indicates a slow average landslide velocity of about 16 mm/year.",

            "abstract": "Numerous studies show that core – mantle differentiation should have fractionated the highly siderophile elements (HSE) into Earth’s core during its formation, leaving them almost entirely depleted in the mantle. It is widely held that later addition of chondritic material (a.k.a. the “late veneer”) can account for the disparity between modelled and observed HSE concentrations in the upper mantle. Recent experimental data (Médard et al., 2015) indicate that addition of ~0.6 % of the mass of the Earth could re-enrich the mantle HSE budget sufficiently to satisfy these observations. However, debate remains strong regarding the absolute timing, duration and nature of the re-enrichment. Chondrite-normalised HSE patterns (Coggon et al., 2015) of massive chromitites from the >3.811 Ga Ujaragssuit nunât layered ultramafic body, Greenland, are strikingly similar in both shape and abundance to the patterns of Phanerozoic chromitites from ultramafic layered intrusions. These data suggest that late veneer re-enrichment had already occurred prior to 3.811 Ga (Bennett et al., 2002; Coggon et al., 2013). Furthermore, Pt-Os model ages for these samples indicate that a late veneer component may have been present in Earth’s mantle as early as 4.1 – 4.3 Ga (Coggon et al., 2013). HSE inter-element ratios demonstrate distinct differences between this chromitite sample suite and younger chromitites from analogous tectonic settings. It remains unclear whether late veneer addition was already complete at 3.82 Ga and how long it took for this material to be accreted and homogenised within the upper mantle. We will address these issues using HSE and Os isotope data from Ujaragssuit nunât, Greenland, and the Singhbum Craton, India.",

            "abstract": "Large, explosive volcanic eruptions that inject material into the stratosphere have a significant impact on atmospheric composition and climate. Understanding and generalizing these effects is crucial to the development of climate models. Previously, volcanic forcing was crudely parameterized in all climate models which may be a source of large error in past-climate simulations. Here we investigate how water vapor, in addition to sulfur dioxide, from volcanic eruptions affect atmospheric chemistry and climate using NASA’s atmospheric general circulation model GISS Model-E2. Three simulations were considered: a control run with no eruption, a run with a summertime dry eruption of 18 Tg of SO2, and a run with a summertime eruption containing 150 MT of water vapor in addition to 18 Tg of SO2.These amounts roughly approximate the mass of water and SO2 injected during the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption. They were also injected at the same geographic location, directly into 10-layers of the lower to mid stratosphere. Each simulation was set in a pre-industrial atmosphere and monthly averages from the control were subtracted from the data in order to avoid signals from anthropogenic and meteorological effects, respectively. Comparing the dry and wet eruptions, there is a quicker forming but shorter lived sulfate aerosol population from the eruption containing water vapor. It was also observed that the aerosols spread more evenly between the Northern and Southern hemispheres when water was added to the eruption, compared to the dry eruption which was mostly contained in the Northern hemisphere. These differences more rapidly increase sulfate aerosol optical depth and cause a climatic effect of a quicker, shorter-lived decrease in surface temperatures and increase in stratospheric temperatures. The quicker signal from the wet eruption matches observations more closely than that of the dry eruption. This understanding will help in generalizing the climatic effects of volcanoes and reduce the error introduced in historical climate model simulations‒leading to a better understanding of our changing climate system.",

This study investigated stable isotope characteristics of precipitation in the Qinghai Lake Basin, analyzed moisture sources using data sets from NCEP-NCAR, and calculated vapor contributions from lake evaporation to the precipitation in the basin using a two-component mixing model. Results showed that the Local Meteoric Water Line (LMWL) was defined as δ2H = 7.86 δ18O + 15.01, with a slope of less than 8, indicating that some non-equilibrium evaporation processes occurred when the drops fell below the cloud base. Temperature effects controlled δ18O and δ2H in precipitation in the basin, with high values in summer season and low values in winter season. Moisture in the basin was derived predominantly from the Southeast Asian Monsoon (SEAM) from June to August and the Westerly Circulation (WC) from September through May. Meanwhile, the transition in atmospheric circulation took place in June and September. The SEAM strengthened gradually, while the WC weakened gradually in June, and inversely in September. However, the Southwest Asian Monsoon (SWAM) did not reach the Qinghai Lake Basin due to the barrier posed by Tanggula Mountain. High d-excess (＞10‰) and significant altitude and lake effects of δ18O in precipitation suggested that the vapor evaporated from Qinghai Lake, strongly influenced annual precipitation, and affected the regional water cycle in the basin distinctly. The monthly contribution of lake evaporation to basin precipitation ranged from 3.03% to 37.93%, with an annual contribution of 23.42% or 90.54 mm, the majority of which occurred in the summer season. The findings demonstrate that the contribution of evaporation from lakes to atmospheric vapor is fundamental to water cycling on the TP.",

            "abstract": "In this paper we focus on determining a local magnitude formula for northern Oklahoma that is unbiased with distance by empirically constraining the attenuation properties within the region of interest based on the amplitude of observed seismograms. For regional networks detecting events over several hundred kilometres, distance correction terms play an important role in determining the magnitude of an event. Standard distance correction terms such as Hutton and Boore (1987) may have a significant bias with distance if applied in a region with different attenuation properties, resulting in an incorrect magnitude. We have presented data from a regional network of broadband seismometers installed in bedrock in northern Oklahoma. The events with magnitude in the range of 2.0 and 4.5, distributed evenly across this network are considered. We find that existing models show a bias with respect to hypocentral distance. Observed amplitude measurements demonstrate that there is a significant Moho bounce effect that mandates the use of a trilinear attenuation model in order to avoid bias in the distance correction terms. We present two different approaches of local magnitude calibration. The first maintains the classic definition of local magnitude as proposed by Richter. The second method calibrates local magnitude so that it agrees with moment magnitude where a regional moment tensor can be computed. To this end, regional moment tensor solutions and moment magnitudes are computed for events with magnitude larger than 3.5 to allow calibration of local magnitude to moment magnitude. For both methods the new formula results in magnitudes systematically lower than previous values computed with Eaton’s (1992) model. We compare the resulting magnitudes and discuss the benefits and drawbacks of each method. Our results highlight the importance of correct calibration of the distance correction terms for accurate local magnitude assessment in regional networks.",

            "abstract": "A plasma impedance probe is used to obtain plasma parameters in the ionosphere by measuring the magnitude, shape and location of resonances in the frequency spectrum when a probe structure is driven with RF excitation. The measured magnitude and phase response with respect to frequency can be analyzed via analytical and simulational means. We have designed and developed a new Time Domain Impedance Probe capable of making measurements of absolute electron density and electron neutral collision frequency at temporal and spatial resolutions not previously attained. A single measurement can be made in a time as short as 50 microseconds, which yields a spatial resolution of 0.35 meters for a satellite orbital velocity of 7 km/s. The method essentially consists of applying a small amplitude time limited voltage signal into a probe and measuring the resulting current response. The frequency bandwidth of the voltage signal is selected in order that the electron plasma resonances are observable. A prototype of the instrument will be flown in October 2015 on a NASA Undergraduate Student Instrument Progam (USIP) sounding rocket launched out of Wallops Flight Facility. To analyze the measurements, we use a Particle In Cell (PIC) kinetic simulation to calculate the impedance of a dipole antenna immersed in a plasma. The electromagnetic solver utilizes the Finite Difference Time Domain method, while the particle to grid and grid to particle interpolation schemes are standard. The plasma sheath formation electron flux into the dipole surface is not included. The bulk velocity of the plasma around the dipole is assumed to be zero. For completeness, the hot plasma and nonlinear effects of probe plasma interaction are explored, including the appearance of cyclotron harmonics. In this work the electron neutral collisions are simulated via a Poisson process approximation. Our results are compared to sounding rocket data from the NASA Tropical Storms mission in 2007, as well as the NASA USIP launch. In the first case the simulation results are compared to the impedance magnitude and phase obtained through a frequency sweeping technique. In the second case the simulation results are compared to impedance magnitude and phase obtained through the new time domain technique.",

Fifteen stations are located in Malawi and 40 stations in Tanzania. Data from teleseismic earthquakes with magnitude 5.5 or greater in the 30 to 90 degrees distance range have been used to calculate P-wave receiver functions. Estimates of Moho depth and Vp/Vs ratios have been obtained by using the H-k stacking method and by jointly inverting the receiver functions with Rayleigh wave phase velocities.

A pixel dynamics model utilizing Stokes I spectral profiles was previously-used to quantify changes in the Doppler shift, width, asymmetry, and tail flatness of Fe I lines at 6301.5 and 6302.5 Å and used pixel-by-pixel line profile fluctuations to characterize quiet and active regions on the Sun.

            "abstract": "Observations of TWS anomalies are critical for understanding the terrestrial water cycle, specifically its role within the Earth System, and how it responds to natural and anthropogenic forcing. Existing tools for monitoring TWS anomalies are not optimal for all hydrologic applications. Recently, GPS observations of land surface vertical displacement have been used in novel ways to quantify the spatial and temporal variations of TWS anomalies associated with groundwater mining, seasonal snowpack, and drought. These results suggest that GPS-based records of displacement could greatly expand monitoring of the terrestrial water cycle, complementing and augmenting the information currently provided by in situ observations and GRACE-based estimates. However, none of the studies to date have quantified the errors in TWS anomalies estimated from GPS observations. We are using a forward model for the elastic response to loading driven by realistic TWS anomalies from National Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) output to gauge the resolution and accuracy of GPS-based TWS anomalies. In addition to quantifying the total error associated with estimating TWS anomalies from GPS displacements, the artificial simulation framework provides information on how errors are related to interactions between hydrologic process, the solid earth response, and the monitoring network at the continental scale. This research is a necessary first step towards applying these data to a range of hydrologic problems.",

            "abstract": "New techniques of hydraulic fracturing – “fracking” – have changed the United States over the last 10 years into a leading producer of natural gas extraction from shale. The first such gas well in Pennsylvania was drilled and completed using high-volume hydraulic fracturing in 2004. By late 2014, more than 8500 of these gas wells had been drilled in the Marcellus Shale gas field in Pennsylvania alone. Almost 1000 public complaints about groundwater quality were logged by the PA Department of Environmental Protection (PA DEP) between 2008 and 2012. Only a fraction of these were attributed to unconventional gas development. The most common problem was gas migration into drinking water, but contamination incidents also included spills, seepage, or leaks of fracking fluids, brine salts, or very occasionally, radioactive species. Many problems of gas migration were from a few counties in the northeastern part of the state. However, sometimes one gas well contaminated multiple water wells. For example, one gas well was reported by the state regulator to have contaminated 18 water wells with methane near Dimock PA. It can be argued that such problems at a relatively small fraction of gas wells initiated pockets of pushback against fracking worldwide. This resistance to fracking has grown even though fracking has been in use in the U.S.A. since the 1940s. We have worked as part of an NSF-funded project (the Shale Network) to share water quality data and publish it online using the CUAHSI Hydrologic Information System. Sharing data has led to collaborative investigation of specific contamination incidents to understand how problems can occur, and to efforts to quantify the frequency of impacts. The Shale Network efforts have also highlighted the need for more transparency with water quality data in the arena related to the energy-water nexus. As more data are released, new techniques of data analysis will allow better understanding of how to tune best practices to be environmentally protective.",

            "abstract": "Over the past several years, the seismicity rate has increased markedly in multiple areas of the central U.S. Studies have tied the majority of this increased activity to wastewater injection in deep wells and hydrocarbon production. These earthquakes are induced by human activities that change rapidly based on economic and policy decisions, making them difficult to forecast. Our 2014 USGS National Seismic Hazard Model and previous models are intended to provide the long-term hazard (2% probability of exceedance in 50 years) and are based on seismicity rates and patterns observed mostly from tectonic earthquakes. However, potentially induced earthquakes were identified in 14 regions that were not included in the earthquake catalog used for constructing the 2014 model. We recognized the importance of considering these induced earthquakes in a separate hazard analysis, and as a result in April 2015 we released preliminary models that explored the impact of this induced seismicity on the hazard. Several factors are important in determining the hazard from induced seismicity: period of the catalog that optimally forecasts the next year’s activity, earthquake magnitude-rate distribution, earthquake location statistics, maximum magnitude, ground motion models, and industrial drivers such as injection rates. The industrial drivers are not currently available in a form that we can implement in a 1-year model. Hazard model inputs have been evaluated by a broad group of scientists and engineers to assess the range of acceptable models. Results indicate that next year’s hazard is significantly higher by more than a factor of three in Oklahoma, Texas, and Colorado compared to the long-term 2014 hazard model. These results have raised concern about the impacts of induced earthquakes on the built environment and have led to many engineering and policy discussions about how to mitigate these effects for the more than 7 million people that live near areas of induced seismicity.",

In an analysis of Fabry-Perot Interferometer (FPI) and Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) data, Burnside [1987] suggested a modification factor (1.7) to the traditional value of O+-O collision frequency. Determining more accurately the Burnside Factor has been the subject for many prior studies with different techniques. This study revisits the Burnside Factor by using an extended FPI and ISR dataset from Millstone Hill. The FPI data used are from an updated high-resolution instrument, which began operation in 2009. The study included data from 95 nights between 2010 and 2015 when the FPI and ISR (with both zenith and steerable antennas) were all operating. Nights with high Ap were excluded, leaving 1235 data points in total. The same frequentist approach applied previously in Buonsanto et al. [1997] (using 21 experiments) yields similar right-skewed Burnside Factor distribution on this data. In this study we will discuss results derived using different statistical approaches, including median, mean, and the Bayes theorem.

            "abstract": "(U-Th-Sm)/He thermochronology is widely used to determine the thermal histories of mountain ranges and sedimentary basins. Apatite crystals retain helium at low temperatures, thus giving an insight into upper crustal evolution (e.g. exhumation, subsidence, erosion). Advanced models predict He production and diffusion rates in apatite crystals, thereby allowing determination of helium dates by integration over time/temperature paths (e.g. Gautheron et al., 2009). However, scattered dates and discordance between predicted and measured dates suggest that other parameters than time or temperature may also influence helium contents in apatite.\nThe present study determines the variables that affect He diffusion in apatite over long timescales. We report the (U-Th-Sm)/He date distribution within a slowly cooled intrusion, along with AFT data, as well as extensive petrological and chemical characterization. The Ploumanac’h site (Brittany, France) was chosen because it includes small-scale spatial variations in petrology and chemistry (<km). The Hercynian Ploumanac’h complex is composed of four different lithologies that underwent the same thermal history. A first cooling event occurred 250 Myrs ago, followed by a long stay in the He partial retention zone, and a final Late Cretaceous exhumation.\nResults evidence scattered (U-Th-Sm)/He dates, ranging from 80±8 to 250±25 Myrs, whereas AFT ages range from 120 to 160 ±10 Myrs.

            "abstract": "The goal of the Source Physics Experiment (SPE) is to bring empirical and theoretical advances to the problem of detection and identification of underground nuclear explosions. This paper presents effort to improve knowledge of the processes that affect seismic wave propagation from the hydrodynamic/plastic source region to the elastic/anelastic far field thanks to numerical modeling. The challenge is to couple the prompt processes that take place in the near source region to the ones taking place later in time due to wave propagation in complex 3D geologic environments. In this paper, we report on results of first-principles simulations coupling hydrodynamic simulation codes (Abaqus and CASH), with a 3D full waveform propagation code, SPECFEM3D. Abaqus and CASH model the shocked, hydrodynamic region via equations of state for the explosive, borehole stemming and jointed/weathered granite. LANL has been recently employing a Coupled Euler-Lagrange (CEL) modeling capability. This has allowed the testing of a new phenomenological model for modeling stored shear energy in jointed material. This unique modeling capability has enabled highfidelity modeling of the explosive, the weak grout-filled borehole, as well as the surrounding jointed rock. SPECFEM3D is based on the Spectral Element Method, a direct numerical method for full waveform modeling with mathematical accuracy (e.g. Komatitsch, 1998, 2002) thanks to its use of the weak formulation of the wave equation and of high-order polynomial functions. The coupling interface is a series of grid points of the SEM mesh situated at the edge of the hydrodynamic code domain. Displacement time series at these points are computed from output of CASH or Abaqus (by interpolation if needed) and fed into the time marching scheme of SPECFEM3D. We will present validation tests and waveforms modeled for several SPE tests conducted so far, with a special focus on effect of the local topography.",

To investigate crustal structure of northern margin of SCS, a wide-angle onshore-offshore seismic experiment and a coincident multi-channel seismic (MCS) profile were carried out in the northern margin of SCS, 2010. A total of 14 stations consisted of ocean bottom seismometers, portable and permanent land stations were deployed during the survey. The two-dimensional precise crustal structure model of Pearl River Estuary (PRE) region was constructed from onshore to offshore. The model reveals that South mainland of China is a typical continental crust with a 30-32 km Moho depth, and a localized high-velocity anomaly in middle-lower crust under land area near Hong Kong was imaged, which may reflect magma underplating caused by subduction of paleo-Pacific plate in late Mesozoic. The Littoral Fault Zone (LFZ) lies 12 km south of Dangan Island with a width of 18-20 km low-velocity fracture zone from surface to Moho discontinuity. The shelf zone south of LFZ was consisted of a differential thinning upper and lower continental crust, which indicate stretch thinning of passive continent margin during the Cenozoic spreading of the SCS. All these results appear to further confirm that the northern margin of SCS experienced a transition from active margin to passive one from late Mesozoic to Cenozoic.",

            "abstract": "Adequate hydrogeophysical monitoring of CO2 geological storage remains a challenge as different parameters might be modified during storage. That implies to compare real-time measurements to an adequate baseline. At the Maguelone shallow experimental site a representative baseline for electrical resistivity was built from a large number of downhole geophysical measurements recorded over time. At this coastal site this issue is particularly important due to the production of biogenic gas at shallow depth (< 200 m) from the subsurface sediments.\nFor this, a modified petrophysical model based on the Waxman-Smits model is proposed to estimate gas saturation found to vary up to 7% within shallow sand layers, indicating that natural gas production within the sedimentary pile from biological activity cannot be neglected during gas injection experiments. In the two main reservoirs located at shallow depth (R1 and R2), a variable gas content of 7% and 4% was obtained over short periods of time in the TLL6 and DSO1 boreholes, respectively. The difference might be due to the gentle stratigraphic slope identified from cross hole log and core analyses, TLL6 being located upslope from DSO1. This study also revealed a rapid dynamic mechanism resulting in transfer of biogenic gas from the bottom reservoir (R1) to the top one (R2), possibly due to gas leaking along some of the monitoring boreholes. These sand-rich layers constitute buffer reservoirs for biogenic gases before being released to the atmosphere. Future studies at Maguelone will first focus on biogenic gas sampling from a downhole multi-packer completion in order to identify and quantify the different gas phases produced over time by the sedimentary pile.",

The High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) is providing unprecedented images of the Martian surface at scales of 25 to 32 cm per pixel. The analysis of this high-resolution imaging reveals the presence of three differentiated geomorphologies throughout the northern lowlands of Mars and the Hellas basin, which are informative of the presence of icebergs floating in ancient oceans and/or seas. These morphologies are: (i) scattered scour marks, including curvilinear furrows several km long and some meters deep; (ii) boulders ranging in size from 0.5 m to ~2 m in diameter, distributed forming clusters with sizes from several hundred meters to 1-2 km; and (iii) flat-topped and conical circular fractured mounds. The association of plough marks, clusters of boulders and mounds on the northern plains of Mars can be related to the dual processes of ice keel scouring and ice rafting of both glacial and non-glacial detritus by a floating ice canopy and icebergs. These processes are well documented on Earth and result in distinct morphologies on the ocean floor, which are analogous to features observed in the Martian basins. Importantly, the features are located in elevated areas of the northern plains and Hellas, near the dichotomy boundary and on local topographic highs. Such distribution is expected, as these relatively shoal areas are where the iceberg–related features should occur on Mars: these areas had shallow water depths, less than the iceberg's keel depth, and therefore keels reached through the full depth of the water column to impinge on the sediments below. The presence of icebergs floating in cold oceans early in Mars’ history imply the occurrence of continental glaciers forming in the highlands and streaming northward towards the lowlands, and towards the Hellas and Argyre Basins. Glacier activity, usually defined as polythermal, is well recognized and documented to have occurred in the mid-latitude regions of Mars at least since the Late Noachian/Early Hesperian.",

On the other hand, many parts of the country witnessed significant changes in mean and extreme climate related to precipitation and temperature. Here we analysed urban residence using the remotely sensed data considering the susceptibility of Indian cities to droughts and heat waves. We selected recently announced 100 urban areas that are planned to be developed as smart cities in future. Gridded precipitation data were used to compute SPEI values for frequency and ascertain the extent of droughts in the cities. The heat wave analysis was done in two phases. First phase included analysis using Heat Wave Magnitude Index (HWMI) to determine the intensity of such extreme events. In the second phase, Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect across different ecological configuration was studied for the cities. Land Surface Temperature (LST), urban extent map from MODIS and land-cover maps were used to study the UHI effect. For this, the urban extents were divided into urban core and sub-urban zones based on built up regions in the cities. The urban to rural temperature difference is analysed considering the ecological configuration in the region. The selected cities were categorised based on the biome features surrounding them. The results suggest aggravated condition in the urban space in India with reference to extreme events. For instance, extreme heat waves have substantially increased in India during the last few decades. In many urban areas, the UHI effect contributed a significant warming due to increased urbanization. We estimated projected changes in droughts and heat waves in the selected urban areas using the dynamically downscaled data from the region climate models. Our results suggest that a majority of urban areas are projected to face an elevated risk of temperature related extremes and issues of water sustainability in the coming decades.",

As these clouds have significantly higher albedo than the background sea surface and have warmer cloud top temperatures, they have a net cooling effect on the sea surface and the atmosphere. Hence, these clouds have a huge impact on the Earth’s radiation budget and need to be accurately represented in Global Climate Models (GCM) aimed at predicting the future climate and energy needs. The entrainment occurring near the stratocumulus cloud top is one of the key factors influencing the stratocumulus cloud cover and lifetime. In this study, we have used the observations made during the Stratocumulus Entrainment and Precipitation Studies (SEPS) field campaign to quantify and characterize the entrainment in stratocumulus clouds. The data collected by the Compact Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (CFMCW) W-band Doppler radar, and the in-situ aerosol, cloud, and precipitation size distribution measuring instruments onboard the Center for Interdisciplinary Remotely Piloted Aircraft Studies (CIRPAS)’s Twin Otter research aircraft formed the basis of this study. We have also used the data collected by the ground-based scanning X-band phased array radar (abbreviated as MWR-05XP) in this study. Finely cut radar chaff fibers corresponding to half the wavelength of the two radars were introduced ~300 m above a uniform stratocumulus cloud layer in a three-line formation on four separate days. The spatial and temporal evolution of the chaff as it dispersed in the free troposphere was tracked for more than two hours by the MWR-05XP that made sector scans every 20 seconds at a 75 m range resolution. The fine-scale evolution of the chaff needles and that of the cloud layer was observed and characterized by the CFMCW radar operating at a 5 m and 3 Hz resolution and by the other instruments onboard the aircraft. The relative dispersion rate of the chaff needles in the free troposphere and in the cloud layer together with the cloud top entrainment rates will be retrieved using these observations. We will present our results of entrainment rate retrievals in the context of atmospheric conditions for the four days and also discuss the merits and shortcomings of the technique.",

The perihelion and aphelion distances, which are the closest and the farthest points from the Sun lie on the ecliptic plane. The distance between the Earth and Sun is not same throughout the year, i.e. the orbit of Earth deviates a bit from the circle. However, the difference between perihelion and aphelion distance is very small. The goal of our research was to see if changing the shapes or inclination of the earth’s orbital plane makes any difference in the; axial tilt of Earth and Sun, the time period taken for the Sun to move from vernal equinox to autumnal equinox, and then back to the vernal equinox. For this, we constructed a 3-D numerical model of the Earth-Sun geometry. Our model defines Earth’s orbit as an inclined plane of the spherically symmetric system. We calculated the degree of the tilt of earth orbit to the ecliptic plane by converting from ecliptic frame of reference to the orbital frame of reference and then we made all the measurements. Initial inputs for our model are aphelion and perihelion parameters. It is interesting to examine that our results obtained from the Earth inclined orbit is same that observed value from Earth's circular orbit. In other words, values of the axial tilt of Earth and Sun, the time taken for the Sun to move from vernal equinox to autumnal equinox, and then back to the vernal equinox does not change. Moreover, we were also able to derive mathematical relations for finding the length of the apparent solar days throughout the year. Our mathematical relation provides new insight for the calculation of the time for the revolution of Sun around the Galactic center.",

This dataset is both free of the effects of the inner core and largely independent of upper mantle heterogeneity, allowing us to concentrate on the core mantle boundary / lowermost mantle region. We employ a hybrid hierarchical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) / Gibbs sampler, to our knowledge thus far unused in global seismology, to generate the posterior parameter distributions arising from Bayesian analysis, using Monte Carlo simulation. The full hierarchical Bayesian approach, using the HMC/Gibbs allows the highly correlated and noise dependent probability surface of the model space to be efficiently traversed. After confirming the efficacy of our sampler on a synthetic dataset, we invert for the lowermost mantle and core mantle boundary. After including corrections to the differential travel time data to account for upper mantle structure, we find a root mean square P-wave velocity perturbation in the lowermost mantle of 1.26% and a root mean square topographic perturbation of the core mantle boundary of 6.04 km.",

However, the GRACE mission might cease functioning before the August 2017 launch of its successor mission GRACE Follow-On. To mitigate against this potential lack of data, we reconstruct a single set of monthly, global gravity fields using conventional tracking data that would be uninterrupted over the potential gap. These fields would therefore provide continuous coverage of the polar ice sheet mass changes.\nWe combined the conventional tracking data (SLR/DORIS) and GRACE fields via an Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis, whereby the conventional tracking data temporal modes are obtained by fitting the SLR/DORIS Stokes coefficients to the GRACE spatial modes via linear least-squares. Combining those temporal modes with GRACE spatial modes yields the reconstructed global gravity fields.\nThe validity of these reconstructed fields is characterized via Monte-Carlo simulations. In these simulations, randomly generated data gaps replace some of the GRACE fields. The mass change curve associated with each simulation is then compared to the original reconstruction (the “truth”). We see that the differences between the truth and the simulations are within the noise of the signal, except for the simulations with the longest gaps. For those, there are non-negligible differences in the trend. However, major short-term mass changes in Greenland are still captured. For example, even without data over the 2013 year (during the hiatus in Greenland ice sheet melt), the reconstructed mass change still captured this specific event. Similarly, the 2009 snowfall anomaly in East Antarctica is also detected in a reconstructed field, despite using simulated GRACE fields with a gap over that 2009 time frame.",

            "abstract": "Defining the late glacial and Holocene fluctuations of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) margin, particularly during periods that were as warm or warmer than present, provides a longer-term perspective on present ice margin fluctuations and informs how the GrIS may respond to future climate conditions. We focus on mapping and dating past GrIS extents in the Nunatarssuaq region of northwestern Greenland. During the summer of 2014, we conducted geomorphic mapping and collected rock samples for 10Be surface exposure dating as well as subfossil plant samples for 14C dating. We also obtained sediment cores from an ice-proximal lake. Preliminary 10Be ages of boulders deposited during deglaciation of the GrIS subsequent to the Last Glacial Maximum range from ~30-15 ka. The apparently older ages of some samples indicate the presence of 10Be inherited from prior periods of exposure. These ages suggest deglaciation occurred by ~15 ka however further data are needed to test this hypothesis. Subfossil plants exposed at the GrIS margin on shear planes date to ~ 4.6-4.8 cal. ka BP and indicate less extensive ice during middle Holocene time. Additional radiocarbon ages from in situ subfossil plants on a nunatak date to ~3.1 cal. ka BP. Geomorphic mapping of glacial landforms near Nordsø, a large proglacial lake, including grounding lines, moraines, paleo-shorelines, and deltas, indicate the existence of a higher lake level that resulted from a more extensive GrIS margin likely during Holocene time. A fresh drift limit, characterized by unweathered, lichen-free clasts approximately 30-50 m distal to the modern GrIS margin, is estimated to be late Holocene in age. 10Be dating of samples from these geomorphic features is in progress. Radiocarbon ages of subfossil plants exposed by recent retreat of the GrIS margin suggest that the GrIS was at or behind its present location at AD ~1650-1800 and ~1816-1889. Results thus far indicate that the GrIS margin in northwestern Greenland responded sensitively to Holocene climate changes. Ongoing research will improve the chronological constraints on these fluctuations.",

We used long-term data (12 to > 50y) of aboveground net primary production (ANPP) and rainfall from eight sites in the central grasslands region of the U.S. to test three alternative hypotheses. We hypothesized that ANPP in wet (or drought) periods can be best explained by: (1) long-term relationships between ANPP and precipitation, (2) relationships between ANPP and precipitation in individual wet or dry years, or (3) relationships between ANPP and precipitation in wet or dry periods of years. We compared regression slopes and r2 values among equations at each site to determine the relationship with the best fit. For most sites, the equation developed using ANPP and precipitation during drought periods was a better predictor of ANPP during drought compared with the long-term equation, and the drought period equation had a steeper slope than the long-term equation. In wet periods at the southern sites, the number of wet years in a row was a better predictor of ANPP than the amount of precipitation during the wet period. Cumulative processes, including plant-soil water feedbacks, sequential plant population processes, and plant or soil legacies may be operating to influence these temporal dynamics. These equations based on long-term data relating ANPP to precipitation during multi-year drought or number of wet years can be used to improve future predictions of agroecosystem dynamics under directional changes in climate. Synthesizing similar data from multiple sites and networks (LTAR, LTER) was necessary to capture the temporal variability and spatial heterogeneity across this large region.",

Despite physiochemical processes are well understood at the pore level, in most practical applications it is satisfactory to know the macroscopic (averaged in space and/or time) values of the state variables. Predictions of subsurface transport behavior under time dependent boundary conditions over ultra-long times require the formulation of continuum scale models for time-averages. In the current study, we employ homogenization method to perform spatio-temporal upscaling of a pore-scale advection-diffusion equation in a periodic porous medium with nonlinear heterogeneous reaction on the solid-liquid interface to (i) obtain macro-time continuum-scale equations and (ii) identify their applicability regimes in terms of relevant dimensionless groups. In addition, the applicability conditions obtained by homogenization are verified by numerical simulations of transport in a planar fracture with reacting walls and time-varying boundary conditions at the inlet. Our analysis shows a good match between numerical simulations and theoretical predictions. ",

            "abstract": "Capillary strength and multiphase flow are key for modeling CO2 injection for CO2 storage. Past observations of multiphase flow in this system have raised important questions about the impact of reservoir conditions on flow through effects on wettability, interfacial tension and fluid-fluid mass transfer. In this work we report the results of an investigation aimed at resolving many of these outstanding questions for flow in sandstone rocks.\nThe drainage capillary pressure, drainage and imbibition relative permeability, and residual trapping [1] characteristic curves have been characterized in Bentheimer and Berea sandstone rocks across a pressure range 5 – 20 MPa, temperatures 25 – 90 C and brine salinities 0-5M NaCl. Over 30 reservoir condition core flood tests were performed using techniques including the steady state relative permeability test, the semi-dynamic capillary pressure test, and a new test for the construction of the residual trapping initial-residual curve. Test conditions were designed to isolate effects of interfacial tension, viscosity ratio, density ratio, and salinity.\nThe results of the tests show that, in the absence of rock heterogeneity, reservoir conditions have little impact on flow properties, consistent with continuum scale multiphase flow theory for water wet systems. The invariance of the properties is observed, including transitions of the CO2 from a gas to a liquid to a supercritical fluid, and in comparison with N2-brine systems. Variations in capillary pressure curves are well explained by corresponding changes in IFT although some variation may reflect small changes in wetting properties. The low viscosity of CO2at certain conditions results in sensitivity to rock heterogeneity. We show that (1) heterogeneity is the likely source of uncertainty around past relative permeability observations and (2) that appropriate scaling of the flow potential by a quantification of capillary heterogeneity allows for the selection of core flood parameters that eliminate this effect. This scaling can also be used to approximate the effect of heterogeneity on flow for real reservoir systems.\n[1] Niu, B. Al-Menhali, A., Krevor, S.

These data reveal a normal continental crust ~27-29km thick in the Pearl River Mouth Basin (PRMB) and the thickness decreased moderately seaward. However, the crust thickened rapidly under the Dongsha rise accompanying the increasing of Moho depth and the thinning of sediment layer. In the Tainan Basin, which was highly stretched, the crust sharply thinned from 15 km to 8 km and the Moho depth shallows dramatically forming a convex in the distal model. A high velocity layer (HVL) (~7.0-7.6 km/s), with ~5-7 km thick in the low crust, was imaged under Dongsha uplift. What’s significant about the spatial position of the high velocity body is that the northeast of SCS high magnetic belt coincides with it, which perhaps is associated with a Mesozoic volcanic arc caused by the subduction of paleo-Pacific plate. Moreover, another HVL, with ~3-5 km thick, was found in the Tainan basin. We take this to be magmatic underplating, which caused by the lithosphere extension during postrift seafloor spreading.\nKey words: high velocity layer (HVL), northeastern South China Sea, subduction of paleo-Pacific plate, Mesozoic volcanic arc, magmatic underplating",

            "abstract": "Fracture properties of shales is vital for applications such as shale and tight gas development, and seal performance of carbon storage reservoirs. We analyze the fracture behavior from samples of Marcellus, Woodford, and Mancos shales using double-torsion (DT) load relaxation fracture tests. The DT test allows the determination of mode-I fracture toughness (KIC), subcritical crack growth index (SCI), and the stress-intensity factor vs crack velocity (K-V) curves. Samples are tested at ambient air and aqueous conditions with variable ionic concentrations of NaCl and CaCl2, and temperatures up to 70 to determine the effects of chemical/environmental conditions on fracture.\nUnder ambient air condition, KIC determined from DT tests is 1.51±0.32, 0.85±0.25, 1.08±0.17 MPam1/2 for Marcellus, Woodford, and Mancos shales, respectively. Tests under water showed considerable change of KIC compared to ambient condition, with 10.6% increase for Marcellus, 36.5% decrease for Woodford, and 6.7% decrease for Mancos shales. SCI under ambient air condition is between 56 and 80 for the shales tested. The presence of water results in a significant reduction of the SCI from 70% to 85% compared to air condition. Tests under chemically reactive solutions are currently being performed with temperature control.\nK-V curves under ambient air conditions are linear with stable SCI throughout the load-relaxation period. However, tests conducted under water result in an initial cracking period with SCI values comparable to ambient air tests, which then gradually transition into stable but significantly lower SCI values of 10-20. The non-linear K-V curves reveal that crack propagation in shales is initially limited by the transport of chemical agents due to their low permeability. Only after the initial cracking do interactions at the crack tip lead to cracking controlled by faster stress corrosion reactions. The decrease of SCI in water indicates higher crack propagation velocity due to faster stress corrosion rate in water than in ambient air.\nThe experimental results are applicable for the prediction of fracture initiation based on KIC, modeling fracture pattern based on SCI, and the estimation of dynamic fracture propagation such as crack growth velocity and crack re-initiation.",

            "abstract": "Ecosystem functioning is monitored worldwide over several decades. However, a comparative in-depth characterization of the temporal variability of essential ecosystem processes, such as for example carbon assimilation and respiration is still lacking. The intra-annual (sub-diurnal, diurnal, and seasonal) variability of these processes can be well described by basic mechanisms such as the plant response to light. In contrast, the inter-annual variability and its origins and magnitude, remain highly uncertain. To date, there have only been a few attempts to investigate these issues across sites, ecosystems variables, and time scales, yet a general and comprehensive overview is outstanding. Here, we present a synthesis of a wide range of observations over Europe, namely: (i) eddy covariance measurements of carbon, energy, and water fluxes, (ii) satellite data of leaf area index and photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by plants, (iii) tree-ring widths, and (iv) dendrometer measurements of tree stem radius changes, and we analyze their variability from the half-hourly to the decadal time scale. Our analysis shows that all ecosystems can be characterized by three distinct regimes of variability (sub-daily, daily-seasonal, and seasonal-annual) confined within the ranges of the available resources, i.e., water (precipitation) and energy (radiation and temperature). We find a convergence of the range of variability of hydrometeorological drivers. Surprisingly, such convergence is not reflected in the variability of the ecosystem responses across sites. Although the magnitude of variability of ecosystem functioning varies across sites, the temporal dependences present the same characteristics over time scales spanning five orders of magnitude. We show that this behaviour can be well simulated by combining simple stochastic models with deterministic harmonics (diurnal and annual cycles). This allows us to statistically characterize the short- and long-term variability of ecosystem functioning and to disentangle the relative contribution of major climatic drivers across time scales, offering a parsimonious representation of ecosystem dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The traditional classification approaches use labeled training data to select the best classification model from a family of models. Since collecting labeled samples is often tedious and sometimes even infeasible, recent research in machine learning has focused on developing algorithms to train classification models in scarcity of labeled training samples. In contrast, the focus of our research is to address problem settings where acquiring even a small number of expert-annotated labeled samples for supervision is infeasible. I will present RAPT, a new predictive modeling framework for identifying rare classes when there is a complete absence of labeled data. The RAPT framework is designed to use imperfectly annotated training data to learn classification models in the absence of expert-annotated training samples. Our results show that, under some reasonable assumptions, the classifiers trained from imperfectly labeled training data using the RAPT approach have performance comparable to the classification models trained using expert-annotated training data. This capability of learning from imperfect supervision is advantageous in a wide range of applications where the target class of interest is relatively rare and obtaining a precise labeling of even a small number of training samples is infeasible. I will also present the application of the RAPT framework for creating historical maps of forest fires from satellite data for the tropical forests. This new forest fire product identifies approximately 1 million sq. km. of burned areas in the tropical forests in South America and South-east Asia during years 2001-2014, which is more than three times the total burned area reported by the state-of-art NASA products. We show validation of these results using burn-scars visible in satellite images, including high resolution Landsat images, to confirm the veracity of the previously unreported forest fires.",

            "abstract": "Soil biogeochemistry is largely driven by the decomposition of plant-derived organic matter by soil microorganisms. In addition to its effects on water quality and soil fertility, the decomposition of organic matter couples soil processes to climate, via the production and emission of greenhouse gases. In this presentation, I will review a number of key factors controlling the rate of decomposition of soil organic matter. In particular, I will discuss the importance of the spatial and temporal variations in redox conditions as drivers of soil respiration. The discussion will highlight the limitations of current soil respiration models based on partitioning soil organic matter in a finite number of pools of different degradability. In order to predict the sensitivity of soil respiration to anthropogenic pressures - including climate warming - it is crucial to relate the apparent degradability of soil organic matter to the geochemical and hydrological dynamics of the soil environment. Overall, there remains much scope for geochemists to help develop more robust, process-based, representations of soil respiration in global carbon models and climate predictions.",

Deposits of some ancient Martian rivers have been topographically inverted resulting in sinuous ridges visible from orbit. However, it is unclear what aspects of the fluvial deposits these ridges represent, so reconstructing paleo-hydraulics from ridge geometry is complicated. Most workers have assumed that ridges represent casts of paleo-river channels, such that ridge widths and slopes, for example, can be proxies for river widths and slopes at some instant in time. Alternatively, ridges might reflect differential erosion of extensive channel bodies, and therefore preserve a rich record of channel conditions and paleoenvironment over time. To explore these hypotheses, we examined well exposed inverted river deposits in the Jurassic Morrison and Early Cretaceous Cedar Mountain Formations across the San Rafael Swell of central Utah. We mapped features on foot and by UAV, measured stratigraphic sections and sedimentary structures to constrain deposit architecture and river paleo-hydraulics, and used field observations and drainage network analyses to constrain recent erosion. Our work partly confirms earlier work in that the local trend of the ridge axis generally parallels paleo-flow indicators. However, ridge relief is much greater than reconstructed channel depths, and ridge widths vary from zero to several times the reconstructed channel width. Ridges instead appear to record a rich history of channel lateral migration, floodplain deposition, and soil development over significant time. The ridge network is disjointed owing to active modern fluvial incision and scarp retreat. Our results suggest that ridge geometry alone contains limited quantitative information about paleo-rivers, and that stratigraphic sections and observations of sedimentary structures within ridge-forming deposits are necessary to constrain ancient river systems on Mars.",

Normal operations at Mars began in mid-November, 2014 and continue to the present. In November, 2014 the sub-Mars point on the Sun was approximately on the east limb of the solar disk as seen from Earth. Through the mission so far, the MAVEN EUVM has been measuring the EUV irradiance from a solar disk that has been decreasingly less observable from Earth. In June 2015, Mars and MAVEN were in conjunction from Earth, observing irradiance from a solar disk completely unviewable from Earth. The EUVM observations during this period show variability from active regions rotating and from flares. At many other times through the MAVEN mission, the EUVM has observed flares not visible from Earth. The MAVEN solar observations provide a unique opportunity to study the solar variability from multiple vantage points at both daily and sub-daily time scales. MAVEN EUVM observations of far side solar activity will be compared with predictions based on interpolation from Earth and from various far side imaging techniques such as helioseismic and H Ly-alpha backscatter imaging.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Poster_v1.pdf\nEnceladus’ surface exhibits numerous tectonic features interpreted to form by lithospheric shortening, including long-wavelength folds, smaller-scale folds and ridges, branching ridges with 1 km of relief (dorsa), and curvilinear ridge belts [1]. The morphology of many of these features suggests that thrust faulting plays a dominant role in their formation [2,3]. In contrast, Europa, where lithospheric shortening must have occurred [4], exhibits just a few putative contractional features: subtle long-wavelength folds [5], and regions of missing surface area that may have been subsumed into the interior [6]. Here we utilize numerical models of lithospheric shortening on icy satellites to elucidate the processes and conditions that lead to faulting and folding. These simulations indicate that cold surface temperatures (~70 K), a thin lithosphere (rapid viscosity decrease with depth due to a high heat flux and/or low thermal conductivity), and low surface gravity promote localization of strain into fault-like deformation bands. Warmer surface temperatures (~100-120 K), thicker lithospheres, and weaker rheological transitions promote folding or uniform thickening. With its generally colder surface and potentially high heat flow of >100 mW m-2 [7,8,9,10], our models predict that faulting should occur more readily on Enceladus than Europa, which is consistent with observations. In particular, localizing contractional strain into fault-like zones on Europa is challenging due to its warmer surface temperature, and may require very high heat flows. The difficulty in forming large-scale thrust faults presents a challenge to the hypothesis that regions of the Europa’s surface have been subsumed into the interior. We continue to evaluate the role of ice shell thickness on lithospheric shortening. [1] Crow-Willard and Pappalardo, 2015. JGR 120, doi:10.1002/2015JE004818. [2] Pappalardo et al. 2014. LPSC #2143.

It is located at a non-transform discontinuity (NTD) of the MAR at the AMAR-AMAR minor segment intersection [German et al., 1996]. Rainbow, in contrast to other ultramafic-hosted systems such as Lost City, is a high-temperature site with fluids up to 365 °C [Douville et al., 2002]. A magmatic heat source must be present to account for the long-lived, high-temperature, heat flux of 1-5 GW [Thurnherr and Richards, 2001], but the nearest, known neovolcanic activity is 15-20 km away on the AMAR segment [German and Parson, 1998]. In 2013, a long-term, ocean bottom seismometer (OBS) microearthquake network of 13 instruments was deployed as part of the MARINER geophysical experiment [Dunn et al., 2013]. Over 40,000 events were detected and located within ~16 km of the active hydrothermal field during the ~200 day deployment. We present hypocenters estimated using P- and S-wave arrival times and a crustal velocity model derived from the active-source tomography component of the MARINER experiment. Moment/magnitude estimates from spectral methods indicate that the majority of events have local magnitudes (ML) of 0-1, with the largest events approaching ML ~2. First arrival polarity data demonstrate that many of the events have non-double couple source mechanisms, and we explore the use of P/S-wave amplitude ratios to constrain these focal mechanisms. The detection of predominantly non-double events indicates processes other than simple fault slip (e.g., serpentinization) are contributing to the observed seismicity and deformation. We use the spatial distribution, magnitudes, rate, and source mechanisms of the seismic events to constrain the coupled processes of hydrothermal circulation and deformation at the Rainbow massif.",

The impact diel variations have are particularly evident in streamflow during low flows. Understanding the controls on streamflow diel signals and the interaction they have within the riparian zone has been a focus of multiple studies to better understand the riparian zones as a system. The focus of the study was to monitor streamflow diel signals at five gauging stations within the same watershed to calculate riparian zone evapotranspiration (ET) and to understand diel signal variability throughout the watershed. Amplitude and timing of diel signals were analyzed at each site and used in determining controls on the diel signal. Meteorological and sap flux measurements were also monitored on both hillslope and riparian areas for comparison of fluxes. A spatially distributed hypsometric method was used to calculate ET for each gauging station sub-watershed for comparison with riparian ET estimates. The study found that, with the use of diel signals and a fixed riparian area, the estimated riparian zone ET ranged from a fraction to several times the calculated meteorological ET depending on the season. Although the riparian zone ET calculation was highly variable, it was constrained using diel signal timing and amplitude. Observations of differences in hillslope and riparian zone meteorological and sap flux variables also supported diel signal calculations. The study concludes that riparian zone ET is a substantial contributor to watershed scale ET during the summer months and that streamflow diel signal plays a large role in understanding watershed scale interactions and the riparian zone’s influence on a semi-arid watershed.",

Physical mechanisms are proposed to interpret the sampling errors in the west pacific warm pool, tropical instability wave region, and stratocumulus deck regions. Dependency are tested to study the capability of predicting such sampling errors. Our results show that sampling errors in infrared SST fields are intrinsic and form geophysical patterns most likely resulted from SST-cloud interactions.

With this in mind, the National Science Foundation, United States Geological Survey, United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and Department of Energy supported the creation of the Central and Eastern United States Seismic Network (CEUSN). These agencies, along with the IRIS Consortium who operates the network, recognized the unique opportunity to retain EarthScope Transportable Array (TA) seismic stations in this region beyond the standard deployment duration of two years per site.\nThe CEUSN project supports 159 broadband TA stations, more than 30 with strong motion sensors added, that are scheduled to operate through 2017. Stations were prioritized in regions of elevated seismic hazard that have not been traditionally heavily monitored, such as the Charlevoix and Central Virginia Seismic Zones, and in regions proximal to nuclear power plants and other critical facilities. The stations (network code N4) transmit data in real time, with broadband and strong motion sensors sampling at 100 samples per second. More broadly the CEUSN concept also recognizes the existing backbone coverage of permanently operating seismometers in the CEUS, and forms a network of over 300 broadband stations.\nThis multi-agency collaboration is motivated by the opportunity to use one facility to address multiple missions and needs in a way that is rarely possible, and to produce data that enables both researchers and federal agencies to better understand seismic hazard potential and associated seismic risks. In June 2015, the CEUSN Working Group (www.usarray.org/ceusn_working_group) was formed to review and provide advice to IRIS Management on the performance of the CEUSN as it relates to the target scientific goals and objectives.\nMap shows the 159 CEUSN stations (yellow) that will be operated and maintained by the IRIS Consortium through 2017. The CEUSN stations were selected for proximity to nuclear power plants (black squares) and other critical infrastructure as well as to more evenly distribute seismic stations across the central and eastern United States.",

These changes have potentially large consequences for the solute concentrations and functioning of streams. In the Brazilian Amazon, crop agriculture expanded greatly during the last 20 years. More recently, farmers have intensified production on existing cropland by double cropping of soy and maize during the same year. Maize, a novel crop for the region, requires much higher applications of nitrogen (N) fertilizer than soybeans. To determine whether this novel land use and associated N addition influenced N concentrations in groundwater and stream water, we measured N concentrations in groundwater wells and streams from small headwater watersheds across three land uses (soy-maize, soy, and tropical forest) in the Upper Xingu Basin, a region of rapid cropland intensification in the southern Amazon. Each watershed contained six groundwater wells arranged in a transect reaching cropland field edge on either side of the stream. Total inorganic N concentrations were higher in wells adjacent to fields where double cropping occurred, while stream concentrations did not differ overall among land uses. This suggests the riparian zones are critical in the removal of N, but as the intensification of agriculture continues the ability of the riparian zone to prevent N from traveling to streams is unknown. Their protection is critical to the functioning of tropical watersheds.",

Dust is primarily emitted by the high-energy impact of larger, less cohesive particles on the soil surface, a process called saltation. Usually, the horizontal saltation flux is modeled as a function of the wind friction velocity, and the dust vertical emission flux is assumed to be a fraction of the saltation flux. In this study, field data collected over sand dunes and a reduced complexity numerical model of turbulence are combined to investigate the interaction between atmospheric turbulence and the process of dust emission. Simultaneous measurements of turbulence from six levels (from 0.5 to 9 meters above ground), dust concentration from four levels (from 0.75 to 6.5 meters) and sand saltation particle counters from nine levels (from 7 to 47 centimeters) are used. A one-dimensional stochastic turbulence model that simulates the time evolution of the atmospheric boundary layer column is used to evaluate different parameterizations of the saltation process as a function of the wind shear on the vertical profiles of dust concentration. The diurnal evolution of dust concentration profiles is then compared with field measurements. The saltation flux data is also used to evaluate the models and to estimate the dust flux directly. Effects of particle size, atmospheric stability and threshold wind speed on dust concentration are also investigated.",

            "abstract": "The concurrent appearance of seismicity with the expansion of oil and gas activities in southern Kansas since September 2012 suggests that industrial operations are inducing earthquakes. These earthquakes occur in a portion of the Mississippian Lime Play, an oil and gas field stretching from central Oklahoma to northwestern Kansas. As has been seen in other areas of high-rate wastewater injection, the seismicity appears to be driven by the disposal of produced water by injection into deep sedimentary formations. We focus on an 1800 km^2 region in Harper and Sumner counties where a temporary, 14-station seismic network deployed by the USGS monitors ongoing seismicity. Regional and national networks supplement the temporary network. Earthquake locations and magnitudes are reported on a daily basis and M≥1.5 earthquakes are included in the USGS Comprehensive Catalog (ComCat) with a magnitude of completeness of ~M2.0. The clusters of earthquakes are principally in the crystalline basement, some forming lineations extending up to 10 km. Focal mechanisms indicate normal faulting, consistent with the local tectonic stress field. While some of the clusters of seismicity are located close to high-rate injection wells, others are at least 10km from large injection wells. Additionally, high-rate wells do not always appear to be associated with seismicity. In response to the increased seismicity, on March 29, 2015 the Kansas Corporation Commission placed new limits on the rate of wastewater disposal in 5 areas in southern Kansas. Since this regulation has been in place, earthquake activity has decreased by 40-50%. In the 87 days between January 1, 2015 and March 29, when the order was enacted, there were on average three M≥2 earthquakes and 0.3 M≥3 earthquakes per day in the study area. The earthquake rate in the 87 days following the change in regulations dropped to 1.8 M≥2 and 0.2 M≥3 earthquakes per day in the same region over the same amount of time. The two largest earthquakes (M4.1 and M4.0), however, occurred after the new regulation was put in place.",

In this study, we developed a mechanistic model of leaf utilization of nitrogen for assimilation (LUNA V1.0) to predict the photosynthetic capacity at the global scale under different environmental conditions, based on the optimization of nitrogen allocated among light capture, electron transport, carboxylation, and respiration. The LUNA model was able to reasonably well capture the observed patterns of photosynthetic capacity in view that it explained approximately 55% of the variation in observed Vc,max25 and 65% of the variation in observed Jmax25 across the globe. Our model simulations under current and future climate conditions indicated that Vc,max25 could be most affected in high-latitude regions under a warming climate and that ESMs using a fixed Vc,max25 or Jmax25 by plant functional types were likely to substantially overestimate future global photosynthesis.",

            "abstract": "The warming climate resulted in the current outbreak of mountain pine beetles (MPB) in western and northwestern US. and Western Canada. Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota, Nebraska, and British Columbia are also currently experiencing widespread mountain pine beetle infestations. Forest disturbance due to MPB can have a large impact on hydrological processes specifically snow accumulation and snowmelt. In those regions, spring snowmelt is a major water resource and MPB infestations can have a big impact on water resource management.\nMPB infestations cause forest canopies to gradually diminish over the course of several years, they therefore impact snow interception and radiation balance at snow surface, thus snowmelt. Past studies on this topic have achieved contradicting results. This study focuses on understanding how the impacts of MPB infestations on snow surface radiation balance and snowmelt rates vary with vegetation structure and geographical locations.\nWe selected four sites in northern Colorado and four sites in the Cascade Mountains in Oregon with varying intensities of MPB. Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) data from SNOTEL sites and MPB-caused forest disturbance data extracted from Landsat time series disturbance maps were used for our analysis. Our results show that MPB sites show larger snow accumulation for sites in Colorado and Cascade Mountains. However snowmelt rate varies differently. For sites in Colorado, snow melts faster in the MPB sites than in the healthy forest sites. In contrary, in the Cascade Mountains, snow stays longer in MPB sites than in healthy and undisturbed sites.\nOur modeling study shows that shortwave radiation is a dominant factor for radiation balance in the mid-latitude region (Colorado). There, MPB infestations lead to increased shortwave radiation and faster snowmelt. However, long wave radiation plays an important role for radiation balance in high latitude areas. MPB infestations decrease longwave radiation and result in snow staying longer in the infested region than the non-infested regions in high latitudes (Cascade Mountains). Current and future work includes characterizing the impact of MPB on snow accumulation and snowmelt as functions of vegetation structure and geographical locations.",

            "abstract": "Species diversity has been found to decrease the temporal variance of productivity of a plant community, and diversity in species responses to environmental factors seems to make a plant community more stable in changing conditions. Boreal bogs are nutrient poor peatland ecosystems where the number of plant species is low but the species differ greatly in their growth form. In here we aim to assess the role of the variation in photosynthesis between species for the temporal variation in ecosystem carbon sink function.\nTo quantify the photosynthetic properties and their seasonal variation for different bog plant species we measured photosynthetic parameters and stress-inducing chlorophyll fluorescence of vascular plant and Sphagnum moss species in a boreal bog over a growing season. We estimated monthly gross photosynthesis (PG) of the whole study site based on species level light response curves and leaf area development. The estimated PG was further compared with a gross primary production (GPP) estimate measured by eddy covariance (EC) technique.\nThe sum of upscaled PG estimates agreed well with the GPP estimate measured by the EC technique. The contributions of the species and species groups to the ecosystem level PG changed over the growing season. The sharp mid-summer peak in sedge PG was balanced by more stable PG of evergreen shrubs and Sphagna. Species abundance rather than differences in photosynthetic properties between species and growth forms determined the most productive plants on the ecosystem scale. Sphagna had lower photosynthesis and clorophyll fluorescence than vascular plants but were more productive on the ecosystem scale throughout the growing season due to their high areal coverage.\nThese results show that the diversity of growth forms stabilizes the seasonal variation of the ecosystem level PG in an ombrotrophic bog ecosystem. This may increase the resilience of the ecosystem to changing environmental conditions.",

            "abstract": "The solar coronal magnetic field forms an important link between the underlying source in the solar photosphere and the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF). The coronal field has traditionally been calculated from the photospheric observations using various magnetic field models between the photosphere and the corona, in particular the potential field source surface (PFSS) model. Despite its simplicity, the predictions of the PFSS model generally agree quite well with the heliospheric observations and match very well with the predictions of more elaborate models.\nWe make here a detailed comparison between the predictions of the PFSS model with the HMF field observed at 1 AU. We use the photospheric field measured at the Wilcox Solar Observatory, SDO/HMI, SOHO/MDI and SOLIS, and the heliospheric magnetic field measurements at 1 AU collected within the OMNI 2 dataset. This database covers the solar cycles 21-24. We use different source surface distances and different numbers of harmonic components for the PFSS model. We find an optimum polarity match between the coronal field and the HMF for source surface distance of 3.5 Rs. Increasing the number of harmonic components beyond the quadrupole does not essentially improve polarity agreement, indicating that the large scale structure of the HMF at 1 AU is responsible for the agreement while the small scale structure is greatly modified between corona and 1 AU. We also discuss the solar cycle evolution of polarity match and find that the PFSS model prediction is most reliable during the declining phase of the solar cycle. We also find large differences in match percentage between northern and southern hemispheres during the times of systematic southward shift of the heliospheric current sheet (the Bashful ballerina).",

            "abstract": "Recent studies indicate that Cu is released from wetlands following storm events. Assymetrical field flow field fractionation (AF4) analyses as well as total and dissolved metal concentration measurements suggest iron oxide-organic matter complexes control Cu retention and release. Coprecipitation products of Fe oxide and organic matter were prepared under conditions similar to the wetland to assess Cu partitioning to and availability from solid phases that settle from solution as well as phases remaining suspended. Cu coprecipitation and sorption to organomineral precipitation solids formed at different Fe:organic carbon (OC) ratios were compared for net Cu removal and extractability. As more humic acid was present during precipitation of Fe, TEM images indicated smaller Fe oxide particles formed within an organic matrix as expected. In coprecipitation reactions, as the ratio of Fe:OC decreased, more Cu was removed from solution at pH 5.5 and below. However, in sorption reactions, there was an inhibition of Cu removal at low OC concentrations. As the pH increased from 5.5 to 7 and as solution phase OC concentration increased, more Cu remained dissolved in both coprecipitation and sorption reactions. The addition of Ca2+, glycine, histidine and citric acid or lowering the pH resulted in more extractable Cu from the coprecipitation compared with the sorption reactions. The variations in Cu extraction were likely due to a combination of a more amorphous structure in CPT products, and the relative abundance of available Fe oxide or OC binding sites. Suspended Fe oxide-organic matter coprecipitates were assessed using AF4 coupled to online TOC analysis and ICP-MS. In laboratory prepared samples, Cu was observed in a mixture of small 1-5 nm colloids of Fe oxide-organic matter precipitates, but the majority was observed in larger organic matter colloids and were not UV absorbing, suggesting more aliphatic carbon materials. In field samples, up to 60% of the dissolved Cu was associated with 1-5 nm colloids of mixed Fe oxide-organic matter precipitates. This research has implications for the assumption of additivity in binding phases and for researchers conducting binding or exposure experiments where metal speciation and lability control bioavailability and toxicity.",

SMAP provides high-resolution, frequent revisit global mapping of soil moisture and freeze/thaw state based on coincident L-band radiometer and L-band radar measurements. The primary science goal of SMAP is to provide new perspectives on how the three fundamental cycles of the Earth system, the water, energy and carbon cycles, are linked together over land. Soil moisture is the key variable that links the three cycles and makes their co-variations synchronous in time. Soil moisture products with varying resolution and coverage are produced from the radiometer alone, radar alone, radiometer-radar combination and data assimilation. In this session the status of the SMAP observatory and early results based on the science data products will be included. The science data acquisition began in May 2015 following several weeks of observatory and instrument commissioning. An intense calibration and validation period followed. Preliminary science products on instrument measurements, soil moisture, landscape frozen or thawed status, and net ecosystem exchange are available at publicly-accessible data archives. The presentation will include early and summary results on the validation of these products. The instrument measurements can also be used to map sea-ice coverage, ocean surface winds and sea surface salinity. Examples of these global retrievals are also presented.",

            "abstract": "Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is one of the largest active carbon pools on Earth with a carbon inventory similar to that of the atmosphere. The sources and cycling of DOC in the ocean is not well-constrained. However, knowledge of the cycling and annual flux of carbon through DOC is critical to understanding the global carbon cycle and feedback mechanisms in the global climate system. Natural-abundance radiocarbon and stable carbon isotopic values can be used to infer the sources and cycling of DOC in the oceans. Past measurements for the most part have been made on bulk DOC, which represents an average of all DOC components. There is, however, good evidence that the actual range of values within the average is quite large, and recent serial oxidation measurements of the surface and deep ocean total DOC [1, 2, 3] reveal isotopic heterogeneity in the DOC pool with a radiocarbon-enriched modern component and a radiocarbon-depleted older component co-cycling in the surface ocean. Also, modeled data from the serial oxidation of the total DOC suggest the presence of a significant amount of modern DOC in the deep ocean [3]. In this study, we used a detailed size and chemical fractionation approach to examine the isotopic distribution within different size and molecular constituents of DOC. We also used a novel thermal serial oxidation approach to link the isotopic diversity of DOC to its concurrent major structural composition in order to build upon and refine the insights from the total DOC isotopic work. Our data show that, in the deep ocean, a major component of the heteropolysaccharide (HPS)-rich DOC isolated by ultrafiltration has radiocarbon value similar to co-occurring DIC indicating either a chemosynthetic source or conservative transport. In contrast, the fraction of DOC rich in the carboxylic –rich compounds isolated by solid phase extraction was much older than the DIC and also exhibit remarkable isotopic diversity in its constituent organic compounds. Our data improves our understanding of the cycling of oceanic DOC and allows for a more constrained modeling of the DOC cycle.\nCited work\n1. Beaupre et al. 2007.

            "abstract": "Earth Observation imaging sensors with spatial resolutions in the 10-30 m range allow for separation of the area and crop status contributions to the radiometric signatures, typically at parcel level for a wide range of arable crop production systems. These sensors complement current monitoring efforts that deploy low (100-1000 m) resolution VSNIR/SWIR sensors like MODIS, METOP or PROBA-V, which provide denser time series, but with aggregated and mixed radiometric information for cropped areas.\n“Free and Open” access to US Landsat imagery has recently been complemented by the European Union’s Copernicus program with access to Sentinel-1A C-band SAR and Sentinel-2A visual, near and short-ware infrared (VSNIR/SWIR) sensor data in the 10-20 m resolution range. Sentinel-1A has already proven that consistent time series can be generated at its 12 day revisit frequency. The density of Sentinel-2 time series will greatly expand the availability of [partially cloud covered] VSNIR/SWIR imagery. The release of this large new data flow coincides with wider availability of “big data” processing capacity, the public release of ever more detailed ancillary data sets that support extraction of georeferenced and robust indicators on crop production and their spatial and temporal statistics and developments in crowd-sourced mobile data collection for data validation purposes.\nWe will illustrate the use of hybrid SAR and VSNIR/SWIR data sets from Sentinel-1 and Landsat-8 (and initially released Sentinel-2 imagery) for a number of selected examples. These include crop area delineation and classification in the Netherlands with the support of detailed parcel delineation sets for validation, detection of winter cereal cultivation in Ukraine, impact of the Syrian civil war on irrigated summer crop cultivation and recent examples in support to crop anomaly detection in food insecure areas (North Korea, Sub-Saharan Africa). We discuss method implementation, operational issues and outline the needs for further research in support to our crop “knowledge inference” framework. Most of our work is based on the use of Google Earth Engine (GEE) and the first batch of 12,000 geocoded Sentinel-1A images that was recently included.",

            "abstract": "The underlying source of all solar activity, from the largest explosive solar eruptive event to the quasi-steady radiation from quiet regions is the transport of free magnetic energy into the chromosphere and corona through the photosphere. There are two mechanisms for this transport, the emergence of magnetic field and accompanying electric currents, and the stressing of pre-emerged chromosphere and coronal field by photospheric flows. Consequently, if we are ever to understand solar activity it is essential that the flow of energy be measured accurately. In principle, this can be estimated from the high spatial and temporal resolution vector magnetograms obtained by HMI on SDO. However, due to the artifacts introduced by the orbital motions of SDO convolved with the finite-sampling of the relevant polarizations, the data cannot be used for measuring the energy flux or helicity flux accurately. We present recent work on the first successful attempt to remove the orbital artifacts. We describe the procedure, which consists of correcting each pixel separately for its bias and gain. We show results for before and after our artifact removal procedures. The method is being prepared for community use through the SDO pipeline. We discuss the application of our methods to analyzing active regions both with and without major eruptions. This work was supported by the NASA LWS and R&A Programs.",

            "abstract": "The continental energy storage for the second half of the\n20\nth\ncentury has been estimated from geothermal data to be about\n7±1×\n10\n21\nJ\nunder the assumption that there exists a long-term coupling between the lower atmosphere and the continental subsurface. For General Circulation Models (GCMs) to simulate the continental energy storage of the Earth's energy budget, however, it is crucial that they correctly capture the processes that partition energy across the land-atmosphere boundary. We evaluate herein the characteristics of these processes as simulated by models in the third phase of the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project and the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (PMIP\n3\n/CMIP\n5\n). We examine the seasonal differences between air and ground temperatures within PMIP3 last-millennium simulations concatenated with historical simulations from the CMIP5 archive. We find a strong air-ground coupling during the summer from\n850\nto\n2000\nCE. During the winter, the insulating effect of snow and latent heat exchanges produce a decoupling between air and ground temperatures in the northern high latitudes. These seasonal differences decrease with depth, supporting the central assumption of climate reconstructions from borehole temperature profiles. Additionally, we use the simulated temperature trends as an upper boundary condition to force a one-dimensional conductive model to derive synthetic temperature-depth profiles for each PMIP3/CMIP5 simulation. The inversions of these subsurface profiles yield temperature trends that retain the surface temperature variations of the last millennium for all the PMIP3/CMIP5 simulations. These results support the use of underground temperatures to reconstruct past changes in ground surface temperature and to estimate the continental energy storage. Results also provide guidance for improving the land-surface components of GCMs.",

            "abstract": "Marine-terminating outlet glaciers discharge most of the Greenland Ice Sheet’s mass loss through iceberg calving, submarine melting, and melt runoff. While calving can be quantified by in situ and remote sensing observations, meltwater runoff, submarine melting, and the subglacial transport of meltwater are not well constrained due to inherent difficulties observing the subglacial and proglacial environments. Previous studies have used sediment plumes and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) as a proxy for glacier meltwater runoff at land terminating glaciers. However, the relationship between satellite reflectance and SSC, established predominantly from land terminating glacier data, does not hold for tidewater glaciers. The number of variables present at a ‘simple’ Greenland tidewater glacier makes it difficult to accurately constrain or identify sediment plume-meltwater discharge relationships, we therefore use tidewater in Svalbard, where systems are simpler and logistics are more straightforward, to establish this association. We use remote sensing and in situ data from two Svalbard tidewater glaciers, Kronebreen and Tunabreen, and establish a well-constrained relationship between satellite band reflectance and SSC in a tidewater glacier setting. We also use sub-glacial pressure gauges, supraglacial GPS units, and measurements of fjord salinity, temperature and turbidity to investigate the relationship between surface melt, sub-glacial water travel, glacier surface velocity and meltwater discharge. Results from the 2015 field season will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Both The Iraqi (Mesopotamian) Marshes, an extensive wetlands system in Iraq, and the Sudd Marshlands, located in Sudan have been heavily impacted by both human and climate forces over the past decades. The Sudd wetlands are highly variable in size, averaging roughly 30,000 km2, but extending to as large as ~130,000 km2 during the wet seasons, while the Iraqi marshes are smaller, at ~15,000 km2, without the same extent of intra-annual variability. A combination of MODIS and GRACE images from 2003-2015 for the study areas were used to determine the time dependent change in surface water area (SWA) in the marshes, marshland extent and variability in total water storage. Combined open water area and vegetation abundance and cover, as determined by MODIS (NDVI and MNDWI), is highly correlated with total mass variability observed by GRACE (RL05 Tellus land grid). Annual variability in the Iraqi marshes correlates well with combined SWA and vegetation extent. Variability of vegetation in the Sudd marshes is seen to correlate well on an annual basis with water storage variation, and with a 2 month lag (water mass increases and decreases lead vegetation increases and decreases) when examined on a monthly basis. As a result, in both systems, the overall wetlands extent and health is observed to be water limited. Predictions for precipitation variability and human diversions of water through either dam storage or navigation modifications are predicted to lower water availability and lower variability in these systems. These two regional wetlands systems will shrink, with resulting loss in habitat and other ecosystem services.",

The installation of marine hydrokinetic (MHK) devices in these regions will require new approaches to understand physical and environmental processes that are relevant for the installation of turbine arrays, which are also specific of each site. The coastal morphology of the Chacao channel in southern Chile, which separates the Chiloé island from the main continent (41º47'S, 73º31'W) stands out as an important energy resource that can potentially contribute a significant power capacity. This coastal area not only sustains delicate ecosystems with limited anthropic intervention, but it is characterized by a complex bathymetry that can have important effects on the performance of MHK devices and their local impacts.\nTo understand the interactions of the local bathymetry and ambient turbulence with turbine arrays, we carry out a series of numerical simulations with a coherent-structure resolving turbulence model using the actuator disk parameterization. The main objective of this study is to further our understanding on the physical processes associated with the installation of the turbine arrays. We perform simulations with different geometries and inlet boundary conditions, from simple cases in a rectangular channel, to more complex cases that include the high-resolution bathymetry of an extensive area of the Chacao channel. The results show how the interactions between the MHK devices, the local flow, and the bed can affect the energy flux and potential generation in specific sites. The results also provide new insights of local impacts of MHK devices and they can also help to optimize turbine arrays in natural environments.\nThis work has been supported by Fondecyt project 1130940, and the Marine Energy Research & Innovation Center (MERIC) financed by Corfo and based in Santiago, Chile.",

Conversion to shallower rooted soy and corn, combined with the fallow period prior to the growing season, reduces evapotranspiration and allows some water to percolate through the root zone and recharge the groundwater system. When this groundwater recharge occurs, it creates groundwater mounding and a hydraulic gradient that drives flow to adjacent landcover patches where recharge does not occur. As the watertable rises, groundwater becomes available to the deep-rooted, dry forest vegetation. We develop a soil and groundwater flow model to simulate infiltration, percolation, evaporation, rootwater uptake, groundwater recharge and the lateral transfer of water between adjacent landcover patches to quantify this groundwater subsidy from converted agricultural lands to remnant patches of dry forest.",

From a Bayesian perspective, changes from the prior to the posterior may, in many problems, be confined to a relatively low-dimensional subspace of the parameter space. We present a dimension reduction approach that defines and identifies such a subspace, called the \"likelihood- informed subspace\" (LIS), by characterizing the relative influences of the prior and the likelihood over the support of the posterior distribution. This identification enables new and more efficient computational methods for Bayesian inference with nonlinear forward models and Gaussian priors. In particular, we approximate the posterior distribution as the product of a lower-dimensional posterior defined on the LIS and the prior distribution marginalized onto the complementary subspace. Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling can then proceed in lower dimensions, with significant gains in computational efficiency. We also introduce a Rao-Blackwellization strategy that de-randomizes Monte Carlo estimates of posterior expectations for additional variance reduction. The efficacy of our method has been demonstrated on a wide range of applications, including atmospherical remote sensing, X-Ray imaging and groundwater inversion.",

In 2007, NOAA initiated multi-year stakeholder engagement process to develop a regional-scale, inter-disciplinary research project that resulted in a novel approach to accelerate the application of research results into management. This process culminated in a 2009 federal funding opportunity and resultant 6-year Ecological Effects of Sea Level Rise-Northern Gulf of Mexico (EESLR-NGOM) project focused on the dynamic integration of biological models (wetlands and oysters) with inundation and storm surge models at three National Estuarine Research Reserves in Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi. The project implemented a co-management approach between a traditional principle investigator (PI) and newly created applications co-PI that led a management advisory committee. Our goal was to provide the dedicated funding and infrastructure necessary to ensure the initial relevancy of the proposed project results, to guide ongoing research efforts, and to aid the efficient incorporation of key scientific results and tools into direct management application. As the project nears completion in 2016 and modeling applications reach maturity, this presentation will discuss the programmatic approach that resulted in EESLR-NGOM as well as an evaluation of nearly 6-years of collaborative science. This evaluation will focus on the funding agency perspective, with an emphasis on assessing the pros and cons of project implementation to establish lessons-learned for related collaborative science efforts. In addition, with increased attention in the Gulf of Mexico on projected sea level rise impacts to coastal ecosystem restoration and management, a core benchmark for this evaluation will be the use of project models and tools by coastal managers and planners at local, state, and/or federal agencies.",

            "abstract": "Soil arsenic (As) contamination is a global problem, resulting in part from anthropogenic activities, including the use of arsenical pesticides and treated wood, mining, and irrigated agriculture. Phytoextraction using the hyperaccumulating fern Pteris vittata is a promising new technology to remediate soils with shallow arsenic contamination with minimal site disturbance. However, many challenges still lie ahead for a global application of phytoremediation. For example, remediation times using P. vittata are on the order of decades. In addition, most research on As phytoextraction with P. vittata has examined As removal from sandy soils, where As is more available, with little research focusing on As removal from clayey soils, where As is less available.\nThe objective of this study is to determine the effects of soil texture and soil fertilization on As extraction by P. vittata, to optimize remediation efficiency and decrease remediation time under complex field conditions. A field study was established 2.5 years ago in an abandoned railroad grade contaminated with As (average 85.5 mg kg-1) with texture varying from sandy loam to silty clay loam. Organic N, inorganic N, organic P, inorganic P, and compost were applied to separate sub-plots; control ferns were grown in untreated soil. In a parallel greenhouse experiment, ferns were grown in sandy loam soil extracted from the field (180 mg As kg-1), with similar treatments as those used at the field site, plus a high phosphate treatment and treatments with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. In the field study, fern mortality was 24% higher in clayey soil than in sandy soil due to waterlogging, while As was primarily associated with sandy soil. Results from the sandy loam soil indicate that soil treatments did not significantly increase As phytoextraction, which was lower in phosphate-treated ferns than in control ferns, both in the field and greenhouse study. Under greenhouse conditions, ferns treated with organic N were largest and accumulated the most total As, while under field conditions, control and compost-treated ferns accumulated the most total As. Under greenhouse conditions, leaching appeared to account for most As removed from sandy loam soil. Results from a similar greenhouse study now underway in clayey soil will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU-2015-bgo.pdf\nOn August 16, 2014 an intense seismic swarm started below the eastern part of Bárðarbunga caldera in the north-western corner of Vatnajökull ice-cap, Iceland. This marked the onset of the first rifting event in Iceland since the Krafla fires (1975-1982). The migration of the seismicity was corroborated by ground deformation suggesting lateral injection of magma, from the Bárðarbunga system, into a dyke. The seismicity migrated out of the caldera forming a dyke with roughly three segments, changing direction each time until August 28 when the migration stopped around 10 km south of Askja Volcano, eventually leading to a short lived eruption in Holuhraun north of Dyngjujökull.  On the morning of August 31 a fissure eruption started in Holuhraun which lasted for roughly 6 months until February 27.  Prior to the onset of the activity on August 16, at least since May 2014, subtle signs of inflation where observed on continuous GPS sites around the volcano indicating a volume increase in the roots of the Bárðarbunga volcanic system. When the activity started on August 16, the deformation pattern indicated a deflation centered within the caldera simultaneously with the lateral growth of the dyke also reflected in the migration of seismicity, along segments of variable strike. A maximum widening of 1.3 m occurred between stations on the opposite site of the dyke spaced 25 km apart. Displacements indicated the fastest rate of widening at any time in the most distal segment of the dyke throughout its evolution. After the dyke stopped propagating, the inflation continued decaying gradually. On September 4, five days into the second fissure eruption, the movements associated with the dyke where no longer detectable. As the fissure eruption continued the slowly decaying contraction was observed around the Bárðarbunga central volcano both in the piston like subsidence of the caldera floor, observed with  a GPS instrument located on the ice surface within the caldera, as well as in the region around the caldera outside and within the ice cap, with no detectable deformation associated with the formed dyke or the eruptive fissure. The post eruptive deformation is mostly characterised by complicated pattern of signals most likely related to superposition of post rifting and relaxation of the central volcano.",

In reality, geophysical wavefields that are monitored for explosion signatures include waveforms produced by non-target sources that are partially correlated with the waveform template. Such signals can falsely trigger correlation detectors, particularly at low thresholds required to monitor for smaller target explosions. This challenge is particularly formidable when monitoring known test sites for seismic disturbances, since uncatalogued natural seismicity is (generally) more prevalent at lower magnitudes, and could be mistaken for small explosions. To address these challenges, we identify real examples in which correlation detectors targeting explosions falsely trigger on both site-proximal earthquakes (Figure 1, below) and microseismic \"noise\". Motivated by these examples, we quantify performance loss when applying these detectors, and re-evaluate the correlation-detector's hypothesis test. We thereby derive new detectors from more general hypotheses that admit unknown background seismicity, and apply these to real data. From our treatment, we derive \"rules of thumb'' for proper template and threshold selection in heavily cluttered signal environments. Last, we answer the question \"what is the probability of falsely detecting an earthquake collocated at a test site?\", using correlation detectors that include explosion-triggered templates.\nFigure Top: An eight-channel data stream (black) recorded from an earthquake near a mine. Red markers indicate a detection. Middle: The correlation statistic computed by scanning the template against the data stream at top. The red line indicates the threshold for event declaration, determined by a false-alarm on noise probability constraint, as computed from the signal-absent distribution using the Neyman Pearson criteria.

            "abstract": "Recent geological and geophysical data suggest that a one-kilometer thick ice shelf extend over the glacial Arctic Ocean and was partly grounded on the subsurface Lomonosov Ridge. The Amerasian Basin was then an immense ice cavity, which communication with the exterior ocean was restricted to a few sub-ice passages over the deepest parts of the Lomonosov Ridge. Using a one-dimensional ice shelf model, we find that back pressure from the re-grounding on the Lomonosov Ridge is essential for allowing a thick ice shelf at the upstream grounding line. Further, the back pressure serves to keep the shelf thickness uniform over Amerasian Basin. A simple model is developed to examine the ocean-ice shelf interactions in the ice cavity. It is found that the water exchange across the Lomonosov Ridge and the oceanic basal melting in the cavity are controlled chiefly by the turbulent mixing within the cavity. Rough estimates of the mixing yield basal melting rates in the range between 0.1 to 0.5 m year. This suggest that the ice shelf over Amerasian Basin could be maintained by surface accumulation and ice flow from the continents once it was formed.",

One unintended consequence, however, is increase in CH4 emissions which contribute to global warming. In Nanjing, the capital city of Jiangsu Province in the Yangtze River Delta, China, almost all taxis and about 30 percent buses are now powered by natural gas, and an increasing number of trucks are switching to natural gas as energy source. However, CH4 emissions from road vehicles have so far been ignored by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) inventory method. In this study, we determined the CH4:CO2 emissions ratio for taxi and other vehicles, using the atmospheric CH4 and CO2 concentrations measured on three main streets in the city of Nanjing. The CH4:CO2 emissions ratio for all vehicles was 0.0088 mol mol-1 on average, a little higher than the ratio measured at the city scale (0.0079 mol mol-1). But the ratio for taxi was much high, with a mean and a median value of 0.014 and 0.0094 mol mol-1, respectively, and a maximum of 0.070 mol mol-1. This atmospheric estimate of the CH4:CO2 emissions ratio for vehicles is in broad agreement with measurement on board of vehicles observing directly tailpipe emission found in the literature. Omission of on road vehicle emission is likely one reason for the 67.3% underestimation Nanjing’s methane emissions using the IPCC method (Shen et al. 2014. Advances in Atmospheric Sciences, 31: 1343-1352).",

Such measurements are well suited to understanding physical processes within the boundary layer and validating wind forecast models. However, interpreting the differences between measurements and model outputs is challenging without a proper understanding of the spatial representativeness of the measurements.\nThis paper presents analysis of measurements from several lidars obtained during the Lidar Uncertainty Measurement Experiment (LUMEX) at Boulder Atmospheric Observatory site from June 23—July 14, 2014.Data collected by two scanning Doppler lidars and 2 wind profiling lidars over moderately complex in Northern Colorado (about 25 km East of the Rocky Mountains) near the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory are used to determine the representativeness of wind profile measurements as a function of spatial footprint (defined by retrieval technique used) and spatial separation.\nIn addition to the analysis of the representativeness of measured wind profiles, the paper discusses the sensitivity and accuracy of a commercial lidar (Leosphere 200S) data comparing to the NOAA High Resolution Doppler Lidar (HRDL). Examples of wind profiles will be presented along with a discussion of the methodology(s) used to evaluate the accuracy and representativeness of the measured winds.",

            "abstract": "The aged, subsurface petroleum spill in Bemidji, Minnesota, has been surveyed with magnetic susceptibility (MS) measurements. High MS values were found in the free-product phase around the fluctuating water table. Although we had hypothesized that high MS values are related to the occurrence of the mineral magnetite resulting from the activity of iron-reducing bacteria, our microbial analysis pointed to the presence of a methanogenic microbial community at the locations and depths of the highest MS values. Here, we report on a more detailed microbial analysis based on high-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of sediment samples from four consecutive years. In addition, we provide geochemical data (FeII/FeIII concentrations) to refine our conceptual model of methanogenic hydrocarbon degradation at aged petroleum spills and demonstrate that the microbial induced changes of sediment properties can be monitored with MS. The methanogenic microbial community at the Bemidji site consisted mainly of the syntrophic, hydrocarbon-degrading Smithella and the hydrogenotrophic, methane-generating Methanoregula. There is growing evidence in the literature that not only Bacteria, but also some methanogenic Archaea are able to reduce iron. In fact, a recent study reported that the methanogen Methanosarcina thermophila produced magnetite during the reduction of ferrihydrite in a laboratory experiment when hydrogen was present. Therefore, our finding of high MS values and the presence of magnetite in the methanogenic zone of an aged, subsurface petroleum spill could very well be the first field evidence for magnetite formation during methanogenic hydrocarbon degradation.",

            "abstract": "Marine sediments produce tens to hundreds of teragrams of methane annually, which is released from the seabed at thousands of cold seeps distributed globally along continental margins. Around 80-90% of this methane is consumed in shallower sediment layers before reaching the hydrosphere, in a microbially-mediated process known as anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) However, cold seeps appear to exhibit temporal variation in gas flux intensity, and AOM filter efficiency at cold seeps generally decreases with fluid flow rate. To our knowledge, the degree to which temporal heterogeneity in subsurface methane flux stimulates AOM community growth and adaptation to increased methane concentrations has not been investigated. Static high-pressure bioreactors were used to incubate sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ) and methanogenic zone sediments underlying a Mediterranean mud volcano gas flare under in situ temperature and pressure at 8 MPa methane. Sulfide production rates of 0.4 µmol/cm3/day in both sediment regimes after 4 months of incubation suggested the resilience of the marine subsurface methane filter may extend well below the SMTZ (40 cm). Similar incubations of SMTZ samples from below a gas flare off Svalbard at saturating (3.8 MPa) and 0.2 MPa methane are being sampled after 1 week, 4 weeks, and 4 months; sulfide production rates of 8-18 nmol/cm3/day were first observed after 4 weeks of incubation. Sediment samples at all specified time points for both sets of incubations were collected for nucleic acid extraction and cell fixation. Anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are expected dominant taxa in enriched and non-enriched communities. 16S rDNA community analysis is expected to reveal additional microbial players involved in the short-term adaptation to higher methane partial pressures in the marine subsurface. Increased AOM community activity (RNA/DNA ratio) and copy numbers of methane cycling transcripts (mcrA, dsrAB) are anticipated at longer enrichments and higher methane concentrations. A more thorough understanding of AOM community dynamics in response to changes in methane concentrations is expected to yield more accurate carbon cycling models pertaining to the world’s largest reduced carbon reservoir.",

Later on, Cassini RPWS observation of SKR revealed that the two hemispheres of Saturn are rotating at two different rotational periods, and it was proposed that the two periods are subject to seasonal change. The topic we would like to focus on resolving is whether the north and south rotational periods actually crossed after equinox. The almost continuous observation of SKR, Saturn narrowband emission, and auroral hiss by RPWS provide a good method of tracking the radio rotation periods of the planet. SKR power from the northern and southern hemispheres can be separated by the polarization of the radiation. Based on the evolution of SKR phase in the northern and southern hemispheres, we show that the rotation rate of the northern SKR is slower than that of the southern SKR starting from late 2014. Auroral hiss provides another unambiguous method of isolating the rotation signals from one hemisphere because the whistler mode plasma wave cannot cross the equator. Rotational modulation rates of auroral hiss are shown to agree with those of SKR during Cassini’s high inclination orbits. Hemispherical origins of the narrowband emission are not distinguishable due to its unique generation mechanism. However, Lomb-Scargle periodogram of the 5 kHz narrowband emissions indicates that the two separate radio rotation periods of Saturn’s magnetosphere reappeared after a long break since equinox.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic imaging techniques have provided a wealth of detailed information typically at two disparate spatial scales including the regional (e.g. satellite, airborne, and marine) and grain scales (e.g. Bitter colloid and magnetic force microscopy). However, there is a general lack of imaging techniques at the hand sample scale. We present a new instrument, procedure, and processing routine that automatically maps the magnetic flux density vector field above a slab of rock at a sub-millimeter resolution, which bridges the gap between the traditional magnetic mapping scales. This low-cost instrument consists of two linear axes that position and raster a stylus across the surface of a sample. Attached to the stylus is a MAG3110 triple axis magnetometer, which has an optimal spatial resolution of approximately 1 mm2. This technique has been particularly informative for metamorphic studies concerning the equilibria of ferrimagnetic minerals such as magnetite. For example, magnetic images have revealed complex anomalies within mafic granulites that indicate the heterogeneous production and removal of magnetite. Some mafic dikes display magnetic anomalies that are associated with partial retrograde metamorphism and hydration. Magnetic images of a sample of banded iron formation have documented sedimentary layering, as well as positive anomalies associated with the occurrence of leucosome. This association may provide key implications for anatectic redox reactions. Specimens extracted from various locations on slabs characterized by heterogeneous magnetic anomalies can be used to document disparate magnetic properties such as magnetic susceptibility, NRM, hysteresis, and coercivity distributions. As such, this technique may provide a context for targeted rock magnetic studies. The instrument provides a direct link for petrologic studies to magnetism that may be used as a small scale analog for regional and planetary magnetic anomalies.",

            "abstract": "Reconstructions of the late-Holocene climate rely heavily upon proxies that are assumed to be accurately dated by layer counting. All of these proxies, such as measurements of tree rings, ice cores, and varved lake sediments do carry some inherent dating uncertainty that is not always fully accounted for. Considerable advances could be achieved if time uncertainties were recognized and correctly modeled, also for proxies commonly treated as free of age model errors.\nCurrent approaches for accounting for time uncertainty are generally limited to repeating the reconstruction using each one of an ensemble of age models, thereby inflating the final estimated uncertainty – in effect, each possible age model is given equal weighting. Uncertainties can be reduced by exploiting the inferred space–time covariance structure of the climate to re-weight the possible age models. Werner and Tingley (2015) demonstrated how Bayesian hierarchical climate reconstruction models can be augmented to account for time-uncertain proxies. In their method, probabilities associated with the age models are formally updated within the Bayesian framework, thereby reducing uncertainties. Numerical experiments (Werner and Tingley 2015) show that updating the age model probabilities decreases uncertainty in the resulting reconstructions, as compared with the current de facto standard of sampling over all age models, provided there is sufficient information from other data sources in the spatial region of the time-uncertain proxy.\nWe show how this novel method can be applied to high resolution, sub-annually sampled lacustrine sediment records to constrain their respective age depth models. The results help to quantify the signal content and extract the regionally representative signal. The single time series can then be used as the basis for a reconstruction of glacial activity.\nvan der Bilt et al. in prep.\nWerner, J.P. and Tingley, M.P. Clim. Past (2015)",

            "abstract": "Persistently active explosive volcanoes are characterized by short explosive bursts, which often occur at periodic intervals numerous times per day, spanning years to decades. Many of these systems present relatively evolved compositions (andesite to rhyolite), and their cyclic activity has been the subject of extensive work (e.g., Soufriere Hills Volcano, Montserrat). However, the same periodic behavior can also be observed at open systems of more mafic compositions, such as Semeru in Indonesia or Karymsky in Kamchatka for example. In this work, we use DOMEFLOW, a 1D transient numerical model of magma ascent, to identify the conditions that lead to and control periodic eruptions in basaltic andesite systems, where the viscosity of the liquid phase can be drastically lower. Periodic behavior occurs for a very narrow range of conditions, for which the mass balance between magma flux and open-system gas escape repeatedly generates a viscous plug, pressurizes the magma beneath the plug, and then explosively disrupts it. The characteristic timescale and magnitude of the eruptive cycles are controlled by the overall viscosity of the magmatic mixture, with higher viscosities leading to longer cycles and lower flow rates at the top of the conduit. Cyclic eruptions in basaltic andesite systems are observed for higher crystal contents, smaller conduit radii, and over a wider range of chamber pressures than the andesitic system, all of which are the direct consequence of a decrease in viscosity of the melt phase, and in turn in the intensity of the viscous forces generated by the system. Results suggest that periodicity can exist in more mafic systems with relatively lower chamber pressures than andesite and rhyolite systems, and may explain why more mafic magmas sometimes remain active for decades.",

The closest separation (< 10 km) was achieved between Cluster 3 and Cluster 4. The separation of two other spacecraft from this pair was in the range 100-1000 km. The data from this Cluster campaign have been used to study the fine structure of the magnetic ramp. It is shown that the magnetic field perturbations observed within the ramp along the shock normal possess spatial scales a few times shorter than the ramp region itself, and are accompanied by variations in the electric field with magnitudes of a few tens mV/m. Using dual spacecraft measurements enables us to show that in the plane of the shock front the characteristic width of these structures corresponds to electron scales. Comparison of the magnetic field profile obtained from Cluster 3 and 4 indicates possibility that the initial stage of the front reformation is observed.

            "abstract": "ePoster - agu_poster.pdf\nThe impact of local site conditions on the amplification of ground motions and associated damage to infrastructure has long been known. Modeling site effects is a fundamental step in the development of a site-specific seismic hazard curve and soil surface spectra in the seismic design of nuclear facilities. Five accelerometers have been installed near facilities at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) since 2013. A large number of ground motions from regional earthquakes (magnitudes 3.0 to 5.0) have been recorded, including the January 3, 2015, M5.0 Challis, ID, earthquake, providing a valuable dataset for studying site response at INL, especially wave propagation in a unique profile consisting of basalt that is fractured and interbedded with unconsolidated sediments. Previous site-response analyses conducted at INL have been based on one-dimensional (1D) equivalent-linear analysis using statistically generated soil profiles with shallow depths (up to 65 ft) (e.g., Payne and Costantino, 2003). While these analyses followed appropriate codes and standards for developing soil design spectra, they did not consider 1) representativeness of statistically generated soil velocity profiles, 2) the influence of strong velocity reversal below the elastic half-space boundary, and 3) two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) scattering effects due to sedimentary interbeds. The objective of this study is to investigate the significance of these issues using recent ground motion observations, with the ultimate goal of informing future site response and seismic hazard analyses. In this study, we first evaluate the effectiveness of the soil amplification function currently employed in seismic hazard analysis at INL by comparing it to the amplification observed from recorded ground motions. We then predict site response from alternative 1D models using measured shear wave velocity profiles with and without consideration of basalt-sediment sequence. Finally, we investigate scattering effects by using a numerical model which incorporates 3D heterogeneity of basalt and sedimentary interbeds. We observe that sedimentary interbeds can significantly reduce the amplification between 5 and 20 Hz, and the amplification function currently employed results in great conservatism.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - SEDDPosterV.pdf\nA number of barriers to entry remain for UAS use in science. One in particular is that of implementing an experiment and UAS specific software stack. Currently this stack is most often developed in-house and customised for a particular UAS-sensor pairing - limiting its reuse. Alternatively, when adaptable a suitable commercial package may be used, but such systems are both costly and usually suboptimal.\n\nIn order to address this challenge the Standardised Embedded Data framework for Drones [SEDD] is being developed in μpython. SEDD provides an open source, reusable, and scientist-accessible drop in solution for drone data capture and triage. Targeted at embedded hardware, and offering easy access to standard I/O interfaces, SEDD provides an easy solution for simply capturing data from a sensor. However, the intention is rather to enable more complex systems of multiple sensors, computer hardware, and feedback loops, via 3 primary components.\n\nA data asset manager ensures data assets are associated with appropriate metadata as they are captured. Thereafter, the asset is easily archived or otherwise redirected, possibly to - onboard storage, onboard compute resource for processing, an interface for transmission, another sensor control system, remote storage and processing (such as EarthCube's CHORDS), or to any combination of the above.\n\nA service workflow managerenables easy implementation of complex onboard systems via dedicated control of multiple continuous and periodic services. Such services will include the housekeeping chores of operating a UAS and multiple sensors, but will also permit a scientist to drop in an initial scientific data processing code utilising on-board compute resources beyond the autopilot. Having such capabilities firstly enables easy creation of real-time feedback, to the human- or auto- pilot, or other sensors, on data quality or needed flight path changes. Secondly, compute hardware provides the opportunity to carry out real-time data triage, for the purposes of conserving on-board storage space or transmission bandwidth in inherently poor connectivity environments.\n\nA compute manager is finally included. Depending on system complexity, and given the need for power efficient parallelism, it can quickly become necessary to provide a scheduling service for multiple workflows.",

            "abstract": "When forecasting winds at a wind plant for energy production, the turbulence parameterizations are crucial for understanding wind plant performance. Recent research shows that the turbulence (eddy) dissipation rate in planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterization schemes introduces significant uncertainty in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Thus, developing the capability to measure dissipation rates in the PBL will allow for identification of weaknesses in, and improvements to the parameterizations.\nWe use data from a 915-MHz wind profiling radar at the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory, collected during the XPIA campaign in spring 2015, to identify the critical parameters for measuring eddy dissipation rates using the spectral width method. Radar set-up parameters (e.g., spectral resolution), post-processing techniques (e.g., filtering for non-atmospheric signals), and spectral averaging, are optimized to capture the most accurate power spectrum for measuring spectral widths for use in the computation of the eddy dissipation rates. These estimates are compared to six heights of turbulence-measuring sonic anemometers from 50 – 300 m on a co-located 300 m tower as verification, showing encouraging results. These methods are then applied to the wind profiling radar data being collected in the Wind Forecasting Improvement Project 2 (WFIP2), a DOE funded campaign that aims to improve the ability to forecast hub-height winds from WRF-based models. This campaign uses of a suite of field observations, including many wind profiling radars, in the Columbia River Gorge, a location with complex terrain where turbulence parameterizations are critical for wind energy prediction.",

One example is passive seismic monitoring using ambient noise to identify shallow changes and potential hazards in a producing hydrocarbon field. Another example is the use of seismic reflection data from within the water column to determine layering caused by temperature and salinity differences in depth.

Close agreement between various TWS data sources have been reported across different parts of the world. Also, GRACE TWS data were also utilized to infer certain unmeasured terrestrial water storage components like groundwater by using auxiliary data often from hydrological modeling. However, the consistency among various sources of TWS data has seldom been evaluated in previous studies. Here, we address several significant advanced issues regarding the consistency of the comparison between GRACE and other observed or modeled TWS data, including (1) the mismatch in temporal aggregation, (2) the mismatch in spatial aggregation, (3) the representativeness of TWS components simulated by hydrologic models, and (4) the application of scaling factors and forward modeling in basin-scale applications, by using several case studies in global regions. The results of this study can be served as an indication of the uncertainty involved in the application and validation of GRACE data in large-scale hydrology, as well as a guidance for future utilization of GRACE data in constraining hydrologic model behaviors and helping model parametrization development.",

Our modelling framework provides options for necessary future actions either from conservation or from production forestry perspectives, and to ensure sustainable forest management in an area. In addition to that our threat assessment and mapping tool are useful in indentifying vulnerable zone of forests to specific anthropogenic, natural or other threats, and to take precautionary actions against each identified threats.

Separate mascon spatial constraint regions have been defined for the largest inland and marginal seas: Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, Caspian Sea, Red Sea, and Hudson Bay. The mascon estimation approach, when applied with well-designed constraints, minimizes signal leakage across regional boundaries and eliminates the need for post-processing strategies. These post-processing techniques (e.g. smoothed averaging kernels) are necessary for computing regional mass change from the unconstrained spherical harmonics provided by the GRACE project to reduce the effect of noisy high degree and order terms, but introduce signal leakage into and out of the considered region. These mass signals are also difficult to obtain from altimetry measurements due to the comparatively sparse temperature and salinity data in these regions, which is needed to compute and remove the steric component of sea level variations. We provide new GSFC mascon measurements of these inland and marginal seas and compare to results obtained from kernel-averaged spherical harmonic solutions and steric-corrected altimetry measurements. The relative accuracy of the various solutions is determined by incorporating their output into the set of forward models applied in our processing of the GRACE Level-1B data and analyzing the effect on the inter-satellite range-rate residuals, where a reduction in residuals is a direct validation of improved solution quality.",

Results from the power spectrum analysis of the maximum 10-m wind speeds (MWS) show that this oscillation is significant in all of the simulated TCs, with the range of the periods in the South China Sea (SCS) is smaller than the open oceans in the western north Pacific (WNP). Sensitivity experiment shows that smaller terrain effects in the open ocean may enlarge the range of the periods. Sequences of the high-frequency oscillations are figured out by the high resolution simulation of Typhoon Hagupit (200814). In a typical cycle, the drop of density in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) is followed by an increase of convergence in PBL, which causes an increase of density, then the weakening of the convergence. The increase in convergence in the PBL causes an increase of updraft, followed by high vertical velocity (w) at high altitudes of 8-10 km, and then an increase of the MWS, and vice versa. The first three modes of the extended empirical orthogonal function (EEOF) analysis of w within the TC updraft show that the evolution of the eyewall in the high-frequency oscillations is a composite of a process similar to the classical “eyewall replacement cycles”, which fluctuate the TC intensity, and a standing wave. The comparison to the vortex Rossby waves (VRWs) and inertial gravity waves (IGWs) shows that they are different from the high-frequency oscillations in details.",

As part of GOAmazon, the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Mobile Facility (AMF) has been collecting a unique set of observations near Manacapuru, Brazil, a site known to experience both the pristine condition of its locale, as well as the effects of the Manaus, Brazil, mega city pollution plume. The AMF is equipped to capture a complete and continuous record of cloud and precipitation column/profile properties, capitalizing on collocated UHF ARM zenith radar (UAZR), a vertically pointing W-Band (95 GHz) ARM Cloud Radar (WACR), and surface disdrometer rainfall observations. Together, these radars and ground sensors allow multiple methods to retrieve properties of the cloud and precipitation field, including explorations into the possible controls of larger-scale synoptic, precipitation regimes (wet/dry seasons), and/or aerosol contributions. These retrievals include capture of rainfall accumulation, drop size distributions, dynamical and microphysical properties (e.g., vertical air motion, latent heat retrievals), and associated uncertainties. Here, we present merged data from the UAZR and WACR (WACR-ARSCL VAP) radars, along with ARM Sounding observations and optical Parsivel measurement constraints, to provide a first look at select convective and stratiform events, precipitation properties and statistical profile characterization during GoAmazon14/15.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_A11A-0002_ePoster.pdf\nThe Greenhouse gas Laser Imaging Tomography Experiment (GreenLITE) system is a new measurement approach originally developed under a cooperative agreement with the Department of Energy (DOE) National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL), Atmospheric Environmental Sciences (AER) and Exelis Inc. (now part of Harris Corp.). The original system design provides 24/7 monitoring of Ground Carbon Storage (GCS) sites, in order to help ensure worker safety and verify 99% containment. The first generation was designed to cover up to 1km2 area, and employs the Exelis Continuous Wave (CW) Intensity Modulated (IM) approach to measure differential transmission. A pair of scanning transceivers was built and combined with a series of retro reflectors, and a local weather station to provide the information required for producing estimates of the atmospheric CO2 concentration over a number of overlapping lines-of-site. The information from the transceivers, and weather station, are sent remotely to a web-based processing and storage tool, which in-turn uses the data to generate estimates of the 2D spatial distribution over the area of coverage and disseminate that information near real-time via a secure web interface. Recently, in 2015, Exelis and AER have invested in the expansion of the GreenLITE transceiver system to 5 km range, enabling areas up to 25 km2 to be evaluated with this technology, and opening new possibilities for applications such as urban scale monitoring. The 5 km system is being tested in conjunction with the National Institute of Standards and Technology at the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory in August of this year. This talk will review the initial GreenLITE system, testing and deployment of that system, and the more recent development, expansion and testing of the 5 km system.",

The new service provides site position time series solutions at 1 Hz, based on GNSS tracking data. Recognizing the tradeoff between latency and accuracy, the solutions are provided at multiple latencies, ranging from one second to one hour. Individual site solution accuracy strongly depends on the local tracking data. The median site position accuracies ranges from ~one cm 1DRMs for the to most latent solution to ~five cm 1DRMS for the one-second solutions.\nWe discuss the tradeoff between accuracy and latency and explain the choice of product latencies in terms of this trade and in terms of the benefits to agencies responsible for issuing alarms and managing natural disasters. We describe and demonstrate a simple user algorithm to seamlessly merge the disparate latent solutions into a single, optimal record of site motion.\nThe positioning service is integrated with automated earthquake notices from the USGS to support calculations of co-seismic displacements.\nFinally we describe the current scope of the pilot project, its innovative user-interface, and our ultimate plans to serve all real-time GNSS sites.",

            "abstract": "Tectonic tremor (TT) in Mexico has a complicated behavior due to the shape of the subducted plate. In the flat section the slab dives from the trench to a depth of 40 km at 150 km from the trench where it turns to be flat. It remains at 40 km depth till about 290 – 300 km from the trench where it continues to steeply dive into the mantle. All TT activity is within the flat slab section. An LFE catalog and the vertically averaged shear wave anisotropy observed from receiver functions at the slab interface are used to divide the region into 4 zones. (1) The Transient Zone located at the corner of the slab when it first arrives at 40 km depth (~130 km – 165 km from the trench) where the majority of LFE’s are seen in small bursts that produce TT. (2) The Buffer Zone has almost no LFE and is located ~165 km – 190 km from the trench. (3) The sub-Sweet Spot is located ~190 – 204 km from the trench and seems to share many characteristics of the Sweet Spot, but has less than half the LFE activity observed in the Sweet Spot in addition to different anisotropy. (4) The Sweet Spot has the overwhelming majority of LFE and is located ~204 km – 245 km from the trench. No LFE is found from 245 km to 300 km from the trench despite the plate still being at 40 km depth. The anisotropy percentage in the continental crust drops significantly above the Transient Zone and Sweet Spot suggesting the crust acts as a seal in those two zones permitting trapped fluids to generate TT/LFE activity there as has been observed in other zones. The Buffer Zone coincides with a region of high fluid flow in the crust (Jodicke et al., 2005) suggesting that there is no seal in this zone allowing fluids to escape thereby limiting TT/LFE generation. The convergence of the zone would imply that the anisotropy preferred orientation at the plate interface should be perpendicular to the trench as much of it is. However, the fast azimuth direction rotates to be trench parallel in the region of the large SSE’s. The anisotropy preferred orientation in the Buffer Zone is also trench parallel where small SSE’s that have a recurrence interval of 90 days have been observed through stacking GPS signals. Finally, the sub-Sweet Spot has high anisotropy percentage that is trench perpendicular, while the Sweet Spot is the opposite. This suggests that the sub-Sweet Spot is a gradual transition from the Buffer Zone to the Sweet Spot.",

            "abstract": "Summer surface climate of the Persian Gulf region is characterized by hot and humid conditions. Despite such conditions – which in other regions tends to trigger moist convection – typically this region experiences clear sky conditions and very little rainfall in the summer. In this study, we customize the MIT Regional Climate Model specifically for the Southwest Asia region and apply it at a 25-km grid spacing using reanalysis boundary conditions for present-day climate (1975-2005). Specific customizations include accurate representations of surface albedo and emissivity as well as mineral dust processes, all of which improve model bias. To assess the role of the Persian Gulf in shaping the region’s climate, a 30-year experiment is performed without the Persian Gulf characterized. Results suggest that observed conditions over the Persian Gulf are due to a combination of physical processes involving adiabatic and diabatic descent. First, virtually clear sky conditions, due to subsidence during summer associated with the rising air motion over the monsoon region to the east, suppress upward motion and deep convection and increase incoming solar radiation. Second, the low surface albedo of the Persian Gulf results in enhanced absorption of solar radiation and total heat flux. Third, high evaporation rates increase water vapor, and therefore trap heat at the surface via the greenhouse effect for water vapor. Fourth, the relatively shallow boundary layer over the Persian Gulf concentrates water vapor and heat close to the surface. These combined factors maximize the total flux of heat in the boundary layer and hence moist static energy over the Persian Gulf.",

            "abstract": "African tropical forests cover ~630 million ha, store up to 66 Pg of carbon and represent a significant carbon sink (0.34Pg C yr-1 ). As such African tropical forests provide an important negative feedback to the global carbon cycle. Unlike temperate forests, tropical forests lack sharp temperature and photoperiod cues to constrain phenology and growth. Therefore, events such as seasonal leaf abscission and reproductive life cycles are often driven by changes in water availability. With future climate predictions expecting a warmer, and especially drier tropical Africa, it is likely we will see concomitant changes in tree growth and phenology.\nAs tropical trees show a high degree of phenological plasticity depending on the severity of the dry season, intermittent water stress or the location of an individual in the canopy structure. As such, frequent and long term observations are key to characterize tropical tree phenology. Here I use two long term historical phenology records of weekly observations, some digitized within the context of a citizen science project (http://junglerhythms.org/), to explore differences in tree phenology between two sites (Luki and Yangambi, DR Congo) with contrasting climate regimes within the Congo basin. I describe variation in leaf, flower and fruit phenology across similar species at both locations in relation to complementary historical climatological observations. I further discuss the potential implications of changing phenology under future climate conditions as phenological changes could alter both ecosystem demography and growing season length providing important feedbacks to the climate system.",

            "abstract": "The Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) has been operating for more than six-and-a-half years since January 2009. In 2014, GOSAT went through some technical difficulties in the functioning of its solar paddle and sensor pointing mechanism. These problems were overcome later, and the GOSAT observation is still continued without major flaws. GOSAT TANSO-FTS SWIR Level 2 data products, the column-averaged concentrations of carbon dioxide (XCO2) and methane (XCH4) calculated over the past measurement period, have been validated and disseminated to registered researchers and the general public by the NIES GOSAT Project. Also, monthly regional fluxes of CO2 and CH4 (Level 4A data products) over a few year period have been estimated from the FTS SWIR Level 2 data and ground-based GHG monitoring data.\nAlthough the above-mentioned technical problems caused a data discontinuity, we accumulated FTS SWIR Level 2 data for more than six years. It is expected that more data will be collected for a few more years while the satellite remains operational. Anomalies in the time series of regional-mean column-averaged concentrations and fluxes are being investigated. In this presentation, we will show the results of the investigation, particularly the ones for some tropical and sub-tropical regions where only few retrievals were obtained due to the influence of frequent cloudiness. Also, we will touch changes in the number of retrievals found over these regions after modifying the satellite’s observational pattern.\nThe GOSAT Research Announcement (RA) activities by selected researchers are still continued. In analyzing long-term GOSAT data, events of concentration anomalies (e.g. in 2010 in Europe and in the US, and similar ones in 2013) were found by some of the RA studies. We will summarize the characteristics of GOSAT data products generated over the past several years, and some of the important research outcomes brought by the GOSAT RA researchers.",

            "abstract": "In steep chaparral ecosystems with Mediterranean climate, dry ravel is a natural process resulting from wildfire disturbance that supplies sediment to fluvial systems. When dense chaparral vegetation burns, sediment accumulated on steep hillslopes is released for dry-season transport (dry ravel) down steep hillslopes during or soon after the wildfire. Results of a field study in southern California’s Transverse Ranges illustrate the effect of wildfire on fluvial sediment regime in an unregulated chaparral system. Big Sycamore Canyon in the steep Santa Monica Mountains burned during the May 2013 Springs Fire and experienced one small sediment-transporting stormflow during the following winter. We conducted pre- and post-storm field campaigns during the fall and winter following the fire to quantify the effect of wildfire on the fluvial sediment regime. We utilized a sediment mass balance approach in which: 1) sediment supply, consisting primarily of dry ravel-derived deposits composed of relatively fine grained-sediment, was measured in the upstream basin and in the hillslope-channel margin adjacent to the study reach; 2) changes in storage in the study reach were quantified by analyzing the difference between pre- and post-storm channel topography derived from Terrestrial LiDAR Scanning (TLS) and field surveys; and 3) transport from the study reach was estimated as the difference between supply and change in storage where uncertainty is estimated using calculated sediment transport as a comparison. Results demonstrate channel deposition caused by changes in the short-term post-wildfire sediment regime. The increased sediment supply and storage are associated with significant changes in morphology, channel bed-material characteristics, and ecology. These results suggest that dry-ravel processes are an important factor to consider in post-wildfire sediment management.",

The primary focus of this study is two-fold: (1) the air quality forecasting model performance for O3, PM10/2.5 and their precursors over the Yellow Sea to measure the model’s ability to account for the transport process and (2) the utilization of modeled source-receptor relationship to understand the root of systematic model under-prediction for PM10 and PM2.5 forecasts. MAPS–Seoul, conducted in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) in the summer of 2015, was an integrated research program covering ground monitoring and aloft measurement with aircrafts. To support this field campaign, air quality forecasting was performed with Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) - Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) - CAMx modeling framework. WRF model simulations initialized with National Centers for Environmental Prediction Global Forecasting System (NOAA/NCEP-GFS) were prepared for daily meteorological forecasts. Emission inventories used in this study are Model Inter-Comparison Study-Asia (MICS-Asia) 2010 for Asia and Clean Air Policy Support System (CAPSS) 2010 for South Korea. Simulated PM10 concentrations were evaluated with observed PM10 concentrations at ground monitoring sites of the AirKorea network in SMA. During the campaign period, average simulated PM10 concentrations showed significant underprediction, over 30% (~35 ㎍/㎥) lower than those observed at sites. To examine source-receptor relationship as a way to identify the cause of underprediction, we ran CAMx with Particulate matter Source Apportionment Technology (PSAT).

            "abstract": "Deep-sea cup corals are a promising archive for paleoceanographic reconstructions as they are globally distributed with some fossil specimens living throughout the Holocene and into the Last Glacial period. Here we explore the utility of using laser ablation (LA)- ICP-MS to measure the trace elements and δ11B in solitary scleractinian, cup corals, Desmophyllum dianthus collected in Norfolk and Baltimore Canyons from the Mid-Atlantic Ocean. Twelve modern and twenty-six sub-fossil D. dianthus, were collected between a depth range of 400m – 1400m with ambient seawater pH range of 7.89 - 8.00. Modern seawater column chemistry including radiocarbon, nutrients, total alkalinity and particulate trace elements were measured to calibrate geochemical proxies in the live specimens. Radiocarbon measurements indicate sub-fossil specimens lived as long ago as 800 years. A suite of trace elements including P/Ca, Ba/Ca, and U/Ca were analyzed to reconstruct nutrient changes and carbonate ion concentrations. Using previously published calibration equations, modern coral P/Ca ratios yield dissolved inorganic P values of 0.24 - 1.70 μmol/L in line with measured values of 0.1-2.5 μmol/L in the water column. In addition, Ba/Ca (nutrients) yield dissolved Ba values of 25-137 ±16 nmol/kg and U/Ca results yield carbonate ion concentrations of 40-129 ±29 μmol/kg, which are both consistent with previously published work. This study represents the first ever LA-ICP-MS measurements of δ11B using modern and sub-fossil D. dianthus where the modern corals averaged δ11B=18.15±0.01‰. These results are similar to previously published solution ICP-MS results, but using published pH-δ11B calibration equation yields higher pH values than in-situ pH values suggesting future modern calibration work is necessary. Overall, these results show promise for using sub-fossil D. dianthus to reconstruct biogeochemical processes at intermediate and deep waters in Norfolk and Baltimore Canyons.",

In particular in High Mountain Asia such an inventory was missing for several heavily glacierized regions with reportedly strongly changing glaciers. As a contribution to GLIMS and the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) we have mapped all glaciers in the Karakoram and Pamir region within the framework of ESAs Glaciers_cci project. Glacier mapping was performed using the band ratio method (TM3/TM5) and manual editing of Landsat TM/ETM+ imagery acquired around the year 2000. The mapping was challenged by frequent seasonal snow at high elevations, debris-covered glacier tongues, and several surging glaciers. We addressed the snow issue by utilizing multi-temporal imagery and improved manual mapping of debris-covered glacier tongues with ALOS PALSAR coherence images. Slow disintegration of glacier tongues after a surge (leaving still-connected dead ice) results in a difficult identification of the terminus and assignment of entities. Drainage divides were derived from the ASTER GDEM II and manually corrected to calculate topographic parameters. All glaciers larger 0.02 km2 cover an area of about 21,700 km2 in the Karakoram and about 11,800 km² in the Pamir region. Most glaciers are in the 0.1-0.5 km2 size class for Pamir, whereas for the Karakoram they are in the class <0.1 km2. Glaciers between 1 and 5 km2 contribute more than 30% to the total area in Pamir, whereas for the Karakoram region it is only 17%. The mean glacier elevation in the Karakoram (Pamir) region is 5426 (4874) m. A comparison with other recently published inventories reveals differences in the interpretation of glacier extents (mainly in the accumulation region) that would lead to large area changes if unconsidered for change assessment across different inventories.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU Poster Halperin Final.pdf\nAs the science of extreme event attribution grows, there is an increasing need to understand how the public responds to this type of climate change communication. Extreme event attribution has the unprecedented potential to locate the effects of climate change in the here and now, but there is little information about how different facets of the public might respond to these local framings of climate change. Drawing on theories of place attachment and psychological distance, this paper explores how people with different beliefs and values shift their willingness to mitigate and adapt to climate change in response to local or global communication of climate change impacts.\nResults will be presented from a recent survey of over 600 Californians who were each presented with one of three experimental conditions: 1) a local framing of the role of climate change in the California drought 2) a global framing of climate change and droughts worldwide, or 3) a control condition of no text. Participants were categorized into groups based on their prior beliefs about climate change according to the Six Americas classification scheme (Leiserowitz et al., 2011). The results from the survey in conjunction with qualitative results from follow-up interviews shed insight into the importance of place in communicating climate change for people in each of the Six Americas. Additional results examine the role of gender and political affiliation in mediating responses to climate change communication.\nDespite research that advocates unequivocally for local framing of climate change, this study offers a more nuanced perspective of under which circumstances extreme event attribution might be an effective tool for changing behaviors. These results could be useful for scientists who wish to gain a better understanding of how their event attribution research is perceived or for educators who want to target their message to audiences where it could have the most impact.",

            "abstract": "Many studies investigate rift evolution with geodynamic models, giving insight into the architecture and morphology of extensional basins. Recent advances in modeling allow better temporal and spatial resolution in surface processes when coupled with geodynamic processes, allowing modeling the interactions between sediment erosion and deposition with rift development. Here we use a combination of dynamic forward modeling and landscape evolution models to determine feedback and interaction of sediment erosion and deposition with rift development and fault localization. The Gulf of Corinth is an ideal basin to study the effect of surface processes on rifting because it can be considered a closed system for sediment erosion and deposition. It is a young rift, not affected by subsequent overprinting and there is a large amount of data from offshore seismic surveys and onshore fieldwork to constrain its evolution.\nWe reconstruct paleo topography of the catchment area by removing the effects of fault activity and sediment erosion. The reconstructed topography is used to model different scenarios for landscape evolution and the results determine the relative importance of regional and fault related uplift and subsidence on the drainage evolution in the Gulf of Corinth. The landscape models are also used to constrain source area and total amount of sediment eroded from the catchment area. The eroded onshore volume and the amount of sediment deposited offshore are compared in order to reconstruct the source-to-sink balance for the Gulf of Corinth. Our results constrain the evolution of the catchment area and timings of drainage reversals that occurred in the fluvial systems of the Gulf of Corinth.\nCoupled forward tectonic-surface process modeling is used to investigate feedback between rift formation and the surface processes and to determine its role in developing asymmetry and fault migration in an extensional setting. In this study we investigate the effect of a mature sediment routing system on rift development. Our models show that migrating fault activity may be triggered by migration of sediment deposition filling the accommodation space provided by the associated half grabens. The asymmetric development of the rift can be explained by the preferred erosion and deposition of the southern flank of the Gulf of Corinth.",

Fluvial and fluviokarst systems drain the edges of this landscape either from low limestone uplands or igneous and metamorphic complexes. Thus far most fluvial research has focused around archaeology projects, and here we review the extant research conducted across the region and new research on the transboundary Rio Bravo watershed of Belize and Guatemala. The Rio Bravo drains a largely old growth tropical forest today, but was partly deforested around ancient Maya cities and farms from 3,000 to 1000 BP. Several studies estimate that 30 to 40 percent of forest survived through the Maya period. Work here has focused on soils and sediment movement along slope catenas, in floodplain sites, and on contributions from groundwater with high dissolved loads of sulfate and calcium. We review radiocarbon dates and present new dates and soil stratigraphy from these sequences to date slope and floodplain movement, and we estimate ancient land use from carbon isotopic and pollen evidence. Aggradation in this watershed occurred by flooding, gypsum precipitation, upland erosion, and ancient Maya canal building and filling for wetland farming. Soil erosion and aggradation started at least by 3,000 BP and continued through the ancient Maya period, though reduced locally by soil conservation, post urban construction, and source reduction, especially in Maya Classic period from 1700 to 1000 BP.",

The technology uses environmentally safe materials to reflect energy in carefully selected, limited areas from summertime polar sun. The technology is now being adapted to help with California’s drought.\nWe have tested the albedo modification technique on a small scale over seven Winter/Spring seasons at sites including California’s Sierra Nevada Mountains, a Canadian lake, and a small artificial pond in Minnesota about 100 ft in diameter and 6 ft deep at the center, using various materials and an evolving array of instrumentation. On the pond in Minnesota, this year’s test results for ice preservation, using hollow glass spheres deployed over our largest test areas yet, showed that glass bubbles can provide an effective material for increasing albedo, significantly reducing the melting rate of ice. This year Ice911 also undertook its first small Arctic field test in Barrow, Alaska on a lake in Barrow’s BEO area, and results are still coming in.\nThe technology that Ice911 has been developing for ice preservation has also been shown to keep small test areas of water cooler, in various small-scale tests spanning years. We believe that with some adaptations of the technology, the materials can be applied to reservoirs and lakes to help stretch these precious resources further in California’s ongoing drought.\nThere are several distinct advantages for this method over alternatives such as large reverse osmosis projects or building new reservoirs, which could possibly allow a drought-stricken state to build fewer of these more-costly alternatives. First, applying an ecologically benign surface treatment of Ice911’s materials can be accomplished within a season, at a lower cost, with far less secondary environmental impact, than such capital-and-time-intensive infrastructure projects. Second, keeping bodies of water cooler using these floating materials could help avoid scenarios like the overheated lakes and streams that led to millions of fish killed this summer in Washington State. Third, Ice911’s materials can later be removed if no longer needed, and could be repurposed to another area in need.",

They have a beneficial effect on the spread and mean state of medium- and extended-range forecasts (Buizza et al. 1999, Palmer et al. 2009). There is also increasing evidence that stochastic parameterization of unresolved processes could be beneficial for the climate of an atmospheric model through noise enhanced variability, noise-induced drift (Berner et al. 2008), and by enabling the climate simulator to explore other flow regimes (Christensen et al. 2015; Dawson and Palmer 2015).\nWe present results showing the impact of including the Stochastically Perturbed Parameterization Tendencies scheme (SPPT) in coupled runs of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Atmosphere Model, version 4 (CAM4) with historical forcing. The SPPT scheme accounts for uncertainty in the CAM physical parameterization schemes, including the convection scheme, by perturbing the parametrised temperature, moisture and wind tendencies with a multiplicative noise term. SPPT results in a large improvement in the variability of the CAM4 modeled climate. In particular, SPPT results in a significant improvement to the representation of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation in CAM4, improving the power spectrum, as well as both the inter- and intra-annual variability of tropical pacific sea surface temperatures.\n",

            "abstract": "We address the state-of-the-art in areas important to monitoring, current challenges, specific efforts that illustrate approaches addressing shortcomings in capabilities, and additional approaches that might be helpful.\nThe exponential increase in the number of events that must be screened as magnitude thresholds decrease presents one of the greatest challenges. Ongoing efforts to exploit repeat seismic events using waveform correlation, subspace methods, and empirical matched field processing holds as much \"game-changing\" promise as anything being done, and further efforts to develop and apply such methods efficiently are critical.\nGreater accuracy of travel time, signal loss, and full waveform predictions are still needed to better locate and discriminate seismic events. Important developments include methods to model velocities using multiple types of data; to model attenuation with better separation of source, path, and site effects; and to model focusing and defocusing of surface waves. Current efforts to model higher frequency full waveforms are likely to improve source characterization while more effective estimation of attenuation from ambient noise holds promise for filling in gaps. Censoring in attenuation modeling is a critical problem to address.\nQuantifying uncertainty of discriminants is key to their operational use. Efforts to do so for moment tensor (MT) inversion are particularly important, and fundamental progress on the statistics of MT distributions is the most important advance needed in the near term in this area.\nSource physics is seeing great progress through theoretical, experimental, and simulation studies. The biggest need is to accurately predict the effects of source conditions on seismic generation. Uniqueness is the challenge here. Progress will depend on studies that probe what distinguishes mechanisms, rather than whether one of many possible mechanisms is consistent with some set of observations.",

We used position-specific labeling, a tool of isotope applications novel to soil sciences, to compare the transformation mechanisms of sorbed and non-sorbed alanine in soil. Alanine as an amino acid links C- and N-cycles in soil and therefore is a model substance for the pool of LMWOS.\nTo assess transformations of sorbed alanine, we added position-specific and uniformly 13C and 14C labeled alanine tracer to soil that had previously been sterilized by γ-radiation. The labeled soil was added to non-sterilized soil from the same site and incubated. Soil labeled with the same tracers without previous sorption was prepared and incubated as well. We captured the respired CO2 and determined its 14C-activity at increasing time intervals. The incorporation of 14C into microbial biomass was determined by chloroform fumigation extraction (CFE), and utilization of individual C positions by distinct microbial groups was evaluated by 13C-phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA).\nA dual peak in the respired CO2 revealed two sorption mechanisms. To compare the fate of individual C atoms independent of their concentration and pool size in soil, we applied the divergence index (DI). The DI reveals the convergent or divergent behavior of C from individual molecule positions during microbial utilization. Alanine C-1 position was mainly oxidized to CO2, while its C-2 and C-3 were preferentially incorporated in microbial biomass and PLFA. This indicates that sorption by the COOH group does not protect this group from preferential oxidation. Microbial metabolism was determinative for the preferential oxidation of individual molecule positions.\nThe use of position-specific labeling revealed mechanisms and kinetics of microbial utilization of sorbed and non-sorbed alanine, as well as interactions between microbial groups, soils and LMWOS. None of these findings could have been achieved without the use of position-specific tracers, therefore this method will improve our understanding of stabilization processes and soil C fluxes.",

            "abstract": "The structure of a pathway pertains to the arrangement of the system components that determine the flow of water; this structure can vary in space and in time. This presentation demonstrates a method that is: (1) capable of describing a varying arrangement for different separation distances, and (2) based on measurements. The focus lies on saturated hydraulic conductivity (K), but the method is easily extensible to parameters describing variably saturated flow or karst networks.\nThe key advantage of the method presented is its capability to describe non-linear spatial dependence. Such asymmetric spatial dependence is encountered ubiquitously in nature and originates in the generating processes (examples based on hydraulic conductivity and regional groundwater quality data-sets are shown). The kind of dependence varies for different separation distances and even the type of dependence as measured by symmetry might change for different separation distances. Different degrees of dependence can be described and modeled for different measurement values (quantiles). We present metrics to quantify the type and degree of dependence based on data, as well as parameter estimation techniques for the simulation methods. This approach does not require the common, but limiting, assumption of multivariate normal spatial dependence, and hence neither the assumption of a (log-) normal distribution of the marginal values.\nThe effects of the spatial dependence structure of K on dependent physical / chemical properties such as solute transport behavior are demonstrated and relevant metrics such as connectivity and capacity are quantified. These properties deviate systematically from expected Gaussian behavior as the multivariate dependence deviates from Gaussian dependence, despite identical correlation. This can have significant implications for water resources management (e.g. peak breakthrough concentration, earliest arrival).",

            "abstract": "Two proteins (HgcA and HgcB) have been determined to be essential for mercury (Hg)-methylation and either one alone is not sufficient for this process. Detection and quantification of these genes to determine at risk environments is critical. Universal degenerate polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers spanning hgcAB were developed to ascertain organismal diversity and validate that both genes were present as an established prerequisite for Hg-methylation. To confirm this approach, an extensive set of pure cultures with published genomes (including methylators and non-methylators: 13 Deltaproteobacteria, 9 Firmicutes, and 10 methanogenic Archaea) were assayed with the newly designed universal hgcAB primer set. A single band within an agarose gel was observed for the majority of the cultures with known hgcAB and confirmed via Sanger sequencing. For environmental applications, once the potential for Hg-methylation is established from PCR amplification with the universal hgcAB primer set, quantification of clade-specific hgcAB gene abundance is desirable. We developed quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) degenerate primers targeting hgcA from each of the three dominate clades (Deltaproteobacteria, Firmicutes and methanogenic Archaea) known to be associated with anaerobic Hg-methylation. The qPCR primers amplify virtually all hgcA positive cultures overall and are specific for their designed clade. Finally, to ensure the procedure is robust and sensitive in complex environmental matrices, cells from all clades were mixed in different combinations and ratios to assess qPCR primer specificity. The development and validation of these high fidelity quantitative molecular tools now allows for rapid and accurate risk management assessment in any environment.",

            "abstract": "In order to examine how the diversity in the earthquake fault-rupture scenario alters the ground motion and tsunami generation, we have conducted an integrated simulation of earthquake, and resulting seismic ground motion and tsunami generation. The result of earthquake simulation is used as an input for ground motion and tsunami simulation. Here, we examined how the frictional property used in the earthquake simulation affects the fault rupture propagation process and the resulting ground motion and tsunami generation.\nIn this study, a large fault rupture area with different frictional properties was used for representing the diversity of large earthquake (~ Mw 8.5-8.8) scenarios. The rupture area is commonly spread from Shikoku Island to Suruga Bay along the Nankai Trough. A crack propagation model based on the quasi-dynamic approach, where the frictional property of the fault in a plate boundary in a fully-dynamic approach can be expressed by energy dissipation in each small fault unit, is used. The target volume for ground motion simulation is 1,200 km (EW) x 1,000 km (NS) x 250 km (depth). The equations of motion for viscoelastic body were solved by means of finite-difference method with discretization of 0.5 km and 0.25 km in horizontal and vertical direction, respectively.\nAs a result, energy dissipation mainly affects the fault rupture propagation speed resulting in several types of seismic ground motions and tsunamis. As energy dissipation decreases, the rupture propagation speed becomes lower and seismic ground motion dramatically becomes weak, characterized by decay in amplitude and shift in frequency. Unlike ground motion, tsunami does not dramatically attenuate, sometimes leading to tsunami earthquake, which is apparent from the difference between the maximum velocity range of ~ 6 – 0.5 m/s and tsunami height range of ~ 6.5 – 3 m. The relation between the generation of earthquake, and that of seismic ground motion and tsunami was clarified in this simulation.",

            "abstract": "We consider two settings – in addition to “delamination” of arc lower crust – in which dense, mafic eclogites founder into the convecting mantle while buoyant, felsic lithologies accumulate at the base of evolving continental crust.\nArc processes play a central role in generating continental crust, but it remains uncertain how basaltic arc crust is transformed to andesitic continental crust. Dense, SiO2-poor products of fractionation may founder from the base of arc crust by “delamination”, but lower arc crust after delamination has significantly different trace elements compared to lower continental crust (LCC). In an alternative model, buoyant magmatic rocks generated at arcs are first subducted, mainly via subduction erosion. Upon heating, these buoyant lithologies ascend through the mantle wedge or along a subduction channel, and are “relaminated” at the base of overlying crust (e.g., Hacker et al EPSL 11, AREPS 15). Average buoyant lavas and plutons for the Aleutians, Izu-Bonin-Marianas, Kohistan and Talkeetna arcs fall within the range of estimated LCC major and trace elements. Relamination is more efficient in generating continental crust than delamination.\nHimalayan cross-sections show Indian crust thrust beneath Tibetan crust, with no intervening mantle. There is a horizontal Moho at ca 80 km depth, extending from thickened Indian crust, across the region where Tibetan crust overlies Indian crust, into thickened Tibetan crust. About half the subducted Indian crust is present, whereas the other half is missing. Data (Vp/Vs; Miocene lavas formed by interaction of continental crust with mantle; xenolith thermometry) indicate 1000°C or more from ca 50 km depth to the Moho since the Miocene. We build on earlier studies (LePichon et al Tectonics 92, T’phys 97; Schulte-Pelkum et al Nature 05; Monsalve et al JGR 08) to advance the hypothesis that rapid growth of garnet occurs at 70-80 km and 1000°C within subducting Indian crust. Dense eclogites founder, while buoyant lithologies accumulate in thickening crust. Mantle return flow and radioactive heating in thick, felsic crust maintains high T. The crustal volume in this region grows at 760 m3/yr/m of strike length. Moho-depth earthquakes may be due to localized deformation and thermal runaway in weak layers and diapir margins.",

            "abstract": "Snow cover plays an important role in the energy balance of the ground surface, especially in frozen ground areas. It acts as an insulator, slowing the transfer of heat between the air and the land. Therefore, the ability to quantify snow depth is important for investigating its impact on the degradation of frozen lands due to climate change and other factors. Eurasia contains a significant amount of frozen ground, but point measurements of snow depth are sparsely distributed across the continent, making a comprehensive study of its effect difficult. Reanalysis products provide data between these point measurements with a continuous grid of best-guess quantities of snow depth. However, the quality of reanalysis snow depth products is uncertain. This project quantifies the ability of two reanalysis products, MERRA and ERA-Interim, to capture snow depth variability at 1,259 stations across Eurasia on a monthly scale between 1979 and 2009. Various statistics, including root mean square error, mean absolute error, correlations, and trends are computed to quantify each reanalysis product’s performance. Statistics show that reanalysis performs reasonably well, as noted by median correlation coefficients at 0.6 or higher for most months. Correlations are lower in the transitional months of May, September, and October. The range in monthly snow depth trends is larger in the observational data, but reanalysis trends match fairly well throughout the year outside of February and March, when observed trends are positive, while reanalysis indicates negative trends. Relative errors between the observational and reanalysis datasets range between ~15-30% during months with significant snowfall, while the transitional month of October is again an outlier. Results suggest that reanalysis snow depth can be a viable substitute for observations in the data sparse regions of high-latitude Eurasia.",

            "abstract": "Functional connectivity of reserves and other suitable habitat patches is crucial for persistence of spatially structured populations, and therefore for resilience. To maintain or increase connectivity at spatial scales larger than individual patches, conservation actions may focus on creating and maintaining reserves or influencing management actions taken on non-reserves. We assess functional connectivity of isolated wetlands within an intensively managed agricultural matrix. Using a graph-theoretic approach, we assessed the functional connectivity and spatial distribution of wetlands in the Rainwater Basins, Nebraska, U.S.A. at four assumed anuran dispersal distances. We compare the contemporary wetlands landscape to the historical landscape and putative future landscapes and evaluate the importance of individual and aggregated reserve and non-reserve wetlands for maintaining connectivity. Connectivity was greatest in the historical landscape, where wetlands were also the most densely distributed. The construction of irrigation reuse pits for water storage has substantially increased connectivity in the current landscape, but because their distribution is more uniform than historical wetlands, larger and longer-dispersing species may be favored over smaller, shorter-dispersing species. Because of their relatively low number, wetland reserves did not affect connectivity as greatly as non-reserve wetlands or irrigation reuse pits; however, they provide the highest-quality anuran habitat. Future levels of connectivity in the region will be directly impacted by the planned removal of irrigation reuse pits, and on non-reserve wetlands. Multi-scale spatial and temporal assessments of the effects of landuse change and conservation actions on landscape connectivity may be used to direct and prioritize conservation actions, and should also be useful for reserve network and landscape resilience assessments.",

The main goal of this work is to evaluate rainfall forecast from a one year-long, cloud resolving weather forecasting simulations using a very dense network of raingauges, and remote sensing products from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission. The forecasts are based on the Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) model at 4 km grid size and driven with the Global Forecasting Systems (0.5) forecast data for 72 hours and initialized daily for the 00 and 12 UTC cycles. The model day-ahead forecasting performance, and systematic biases are evaluated as a function of phase and amplitude of the westerly and easterly flow synotic disturbances. The model’s ability to produce episodic and month-long rainfall topoclima patterns shed light on the levels and sources of synoptic predictability in the region, with easterly wind anomalies related to the Tropical Easterly Waves troughs dominating predictablity of synoptic wet/dry spells in the region. Additionally, we further show that a 4 km, subdaily, and unbiased monitoring rainfall system based on a hybrid between day-ahead rainfall forecasts, raingauges, near real-time/coarser-scale rainfall satellite estimates outperforms other rainfall analysis products.",

Surface ozone in spring elevated after mature-phase El Niño winters.\nKey words: surface ozone, seasonal variability, Korea, East Asia\n Acknowledgements\nThis work was supported by Korea Ministry of Environment as “Climate Change Correspondence Program.”",

            "abstract": "The NCAR Water System program strives to improve the full representation of the water cycle in both regional and global models. Our previous high-resolution simulations using the WRF model over the Rocky Mountains revealed that proper spatial and temporal depiction of snowfall adequate for water resource and climate change purposes can be achieved with the appropriate choice of model grid spacing (< 6 km horizontal) and parameterizations. The climate sensitivity experiment consistent with expected climate change showed an altered hydrological cycle with increased fraction of rain versus snow, increased snowfall at high altitudes, earlier melting of snowpack, and decreased total runoff. In order to investigate regional differences between the Rockies and other major mountain barriers and to study climate change impacts over other regions of the contiguous U.S. (CONUS), we have expanded our prior CO Headwaters modeling study to encompass most of North America at a horizontal grid spacing of 4 km. A domain expansion provides the opportunity to assess changes in orographic precipitation across different mountain ranges in the western USA, as well as the very dominant role of convection in the eastern half of the USA. The high resolution WRF-downscaled climate change data will also become a valuable community resource for many university groups who are interested in studying regional climate changes and impacts but unable to perform such long-duration and high-resolution WRF-based downscaling simulations of their own. The scientific goals and details of the model dataset will be presented including some preliminary results.",

            "abstract": "Past studies have identified several systematic and persistent biases in the representation of the global water cycle in climate models. These biases reduce our confidence in the model to accurately predict how the water cycle will respond to changes in future forcings and feedbacks. One of the primary goals of the US Department of Energy’s Accelerated Climate Model for Energy (ACME) project is to create an accurate representation of the global water cycle now and in the future. In this study we introduce a set of metrics to diagnose the global water cycle’s mean, spatial distribution, and rain rate distribution characteristics. These metrics are applied to 30-year simulations of an early version of the model run at 1° and 1/4° horizontal resolutions. The metrics identify previously known features, such as an overestimation of the mean precipitation rate, an overestimation of the frequency of drizzle, and an overly rapid cycling of water, which leads to a shortened lifetime of water over the oceans. We analyze cloud and transport features of the model to determine the source of the biases. The impact of observational uncertainty on model evaluation is also explored.

            "abstract": "The depths at which magmas are stored, their pre-eruptive volatile contents, and the rates at which they ascend to the Earth’s surface are important controls on the dynamics of volcanic eruptions. Basaltic magmas are likely to be vapor undersaturated as they begin their ascent from the mantle through the crust. Once vapor saturation is achieved and the magma begins to degas, its pre-eruptive volatile content is determined largely by the depth at which it resides within the crust. Olivine-hosted melt inclusions are believed to retain their pre-eruptive volatiles because the strength of the host crystal insulates them from the decompression experienced by the host magma. This suggests that the concentrations of H2O and CO2 in vapor-saturated olivine-hosted melt inclusions can be used as an indicator of entrapment depth [1-3]. The common occurrence of vapor bubbles in melt inclusions adds significant uncertainty to such depth estimates, however, because they contain a significant proportion of the total CO2. We have examined the distribution of volatiles in olivine-hosted melt inclusions from basaltic pillow lavas of two late Pleistocene subglacial eruptions in south Iceland: Miðfell and Skuggafjöll. We reconstructed the H2O and CO2 contents at the time of inclusion entrapment using two different techniques. In the first, a Vernadsky heating stage was used to homogenize the inclusions prior to analysis by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). In the second, we combined X-ray tomography, Raman spectroscopy and SIMS. First, X-ray microtomography is used to quantify the volumes of melt inclusion and vapor bubble. Next, the density of CO2 in each vapor bubble is determined by confocal Raman spectroscopy. Finally, the concentrations of H2O and CO2in the included glass are determined by secondary ion mass spectrometry. We conclude that reconstructing H2O and CO2 concentrations has a significant advantage over the heating stage because the former approach retains information in the adjacent olivine on post-entrapment processes – such as cooling and crystallization – that is largely erased by the homogenization process.\n",

For any scientific endeavor to achieve full impact and reach diverse audiences requires not only excellent science and a mastery of analytical approaches, but also creative messaging, visual appeal, and charismatic communication strategies using innovative media. Such qualities and challenges are encountered routinely by artists. As such, science has a lot to gain from learning, leveraging, and collaborating with the artistic community. In this paper, we detail the collaborative relationship that has developed between two visual artists and a research lab that is focused on ecosystem science, technological development, and education and outreach. We describe how our relationship was developed, the successes and challenges we have experienced, the lessons learned, and our future directions. We also present several guiding principles in the hope that other researchers may utilize to forge other successful collaborations between the science communities and creative industries.",

            "abstract": "An aqueous phase, known as “produced water,” usually accompanies the hydrocarbon fluid phases that are extracted from Earth’s crust during oil and natural gas extraction. Produced water contains dissolved and suspended organics and other contaminants and hence cannot be discharged directly into the hydrosphere. One common disposal method is to discharge produced water into open-pit evaporation ponds. Spent hydraulic fracturing fluids are also often discharged into the same ponds. It is obvious to anyone with a healthy olfactory system that such ponds emit volatile organics to the atmosphere, but very little work has been done to characterize such emissions. Because oil, gas, and water phases are often in contact in geologic formations, we can expect that more highly soluble compounds (e.g., salts, alcohols, carbonyls, carboxyls, BTEX, etc.) partition preferentially into produced water. However, as the water in the ponds age, many physical, chemical, and biological processes alter the composition of the water, and therefore the composition and strength of volatile organic emissions. For example, some ponds are aerated to hasten evaporation, which also promotes oxidation of organics dissolved in the water. Some ponds are treated with microbes to promote bio-oxidation. In other words, emissions from ponds are expected to be a complex function of the composition of the water as it first enters the pond, and also of the age of the water and of its treatment history.\nWe have conducted many measurements of emissions from produced water ponds in the Uintah Basin of eastern Utah, both by flux chamber and by evacuated canister sampling with inverse modeling. These measurements include fluxes of CO2, CH4, methanol, and many other volatile organic gases. We have also measured chemical compositions and microbial content of water in the ponds. Results of these measurements will be reported.",

            "abstract": "Alternating bars influence hydraulics by changing the force balance of channels as part of a morphodynamic feedback loop that dictates channel geometry. Pioneer woody riparian trees recruit on river bars and may steer flow, alter cross-stream and downstream force balances, and ultimately change channel morphology. Quantifying the influence of vegetation on stream hydraulics is difficult, and researchers increasingly rely on two-dimensional hydraulic models. In many cases, channel characteristics (channel drag and lateral eddy viscosity) and vegetation characteristics (density, frontal area, and drag coefficient) are uncertain. This study uses a beta version of FaSTMECH that models vegetation explicitly as a drag force to test the sensitivity of channel-bend hydraulics to riparian vegetation. We use a simplified, scale model of a meandering river with bars and conduct a global sensitivity analysis that ranks the influence of specified channel characteristics (channel drag and lateral eddy viscosity) against vegetation characteristics (density, frontal area, and drag coefficient) on cross-stream hydraulics. The primary influence on cross-stream velocity and shear stress is channel drag (i.e., bed roughness), followed by the near-equal influence of all vegetation parameters and lateral eddy viscosity. To test the implication of the sensitivity indices on bend hydraulics, we hold calibrated channel characteristics constant for a wandering gravel-bed river with bars (Bitterroot River, MT), and vary vegetation parameters on a bar. For a dense vegetation scenario, we find flow to be steered away from the bar, and velocity and shear stress to be reduced within the thalweg. This provides insight into how the morphodynamic evolution of vegetated bars differs from unvegetated bars.",

            "abstract": "Plant respiration (R) is generally well-coupled with temperature and in the absence of thermal acclimation, respiration is expected to increase as climate change brings higher temperatures. Increased drought is also predicted for future climate, which could drive respiration higher if the carbon (C) cost to maintain tissues (Rm) or grow increases, or lower if substrate or other factors become limiting. We examined the effects of temperature and drought on R as well as photosynthesis, growth, and carbohydrate storage of mature individuals of two co-dominant tree species. Three mature, in-situ piñon (Pinus edulis) and juniper (Juniperus monosperma) trees were assigned to each of the following treatments: +4.8 °C; 45% reduced precipitation; a combination of both (heat + drought); along with ambient control and treatment controls. Rm measured prior to foliar and twig growth was far more sensitive to drought in piñon, and heat in juniper. Total respiration (Rt, R not partitioned) acclimated to temperature in piñon such that elevated temperature had minimal impacts on Rt; however, juniper exhibited higher Rt with elevated temperature, thus juniper did not display any thermal acclimation. Rt in both species was weakly associated with temperature, but strongly correlated with pre-dawn water potential, photosynthetic assimilation (A) rates, and in piñon, foliar carbohydrates. For both species, heat caused far more days where A-R was negative than did drought. The consequences of drought alone and heat alone in piñon included higher Rt per unit growth, indicating that each abiotic stress forces a greater allocation of Rt to maintenance costs, and both drought + heat in combination results in far fewer days that foliar carbohydrates could sustain R in both species. Notably, the much higher A and R of juniper than piñon is consistent with predicted superior carbon budget regulation of juniper than piñon during drought; however, juniper’s lack of temperature acclimation in contrast to piñon suggests climate warming may have a greater deleterious impact on juniper carbon balance than piñon.",

            "abstract": "Cold pools are increasingly being recognized as important players in the evolution of both shallow and deep convection; hence, the incorporation of cold pool processes into a number of recently developed convective parameterizations. Unfortunately, observations serving to inform cold pool parameterization development are limited to select field programs and limited radar domains. However, a number of recent studies have noted that cold pools are often associated with arcs/lines of shallow clouds traversing 10 – 100 km in visible satellite imagery. Boundary layer thermodynamic perturbations are plausible at such scales, coincident with such mesoscale features.\nAtmospheric signatures of features at these spatial scales are potentially observable from satellites. In this presentation, we discuss recent work that uses multi-sensor, high-resolution satellite products for observing mesoscale wind vector fluctuations and boundary layer temperature depressions attributed to cold pools produced by antecedent convection. The relationship to subsequent convection as well as convective system longevity is discussed.\nAs improvements in satellite technology occur and efforts to reduce noise in high-resolution orbital products progress, satellite pixel level (~10 km) thermodynamic and dynamic (e.g. mesoscale convergence) parameters can increasingly serve as useful benchmarks for constraining convective parameterization development, including for regimes where organized convection contributes substantially to the cloud and rainfall climatology.",

The analysis with the data comprising 4,728 samples of 85 TCs reveals a clear relationship between warm core heights and intensities for relatively strong TCs. It is also found that warm core heights tend to ascend as TCs intensify after TCs reach sufficient intensities, and the warm core heights tend to descend as TCs decay.\nIn addition, a diagnosis using the thermal wind balance equation clarified what aspects of vortex structures are significant for warm core structures. The result shows that warm core structures can be well captured from only within the inner core tangential wind field and the ambient temperature profile. This suggests that the warm core heights, the heights of large baroclinicity, can be inferred from shapes of angular momentum surfaces. Comparison between warm core heights and slope of eyewall inner edge reveals warm core height increases as the slope decreases for sufficiently strong TCs.",

            "abstract": "As part of the HyspIRI preparatory airborne campaign, high spectral resolution data of the Mono-Inyo craters had been collected. The Mono-Inyo Craters are a chain of geologically young craters that have been erupted over the past 40,000 years. We show a spectral variation in the 2.21μm absorption band depth (commonly associated with the Si-OH stretch) between craters of different ages. To explain this we propose the devitrification of the surface of the volcanic materials creating a weathering rind that thickens with age. A definite linear correlation between age and band depth is shown for craters less than 5,000 years old and potential logarithmic correlation for older craters. To help test this, hand samples from the craters were collected from several of the volcanic craters and the weathering rind thickness measured using a scanning electron microprobe. This correlation combined with a HyspIRI like dataset could be used to define volcanic hazards in large or remote regions, such as the Aleutian Island Arc or Kamchatka Peninsula.",

            "abstract": "Drought detection, analysis, and mitigation has become a key challenge for a diverse set of decision makers, including but not limited to operational weather forecasters, climatologists, agricultural interests, and water resource management. One tool that is heavily used is the United States Drought Monitor (USDM), which is derived from a complex blend of objective data and subjective analysis on a state-by-state basis using a variety of modeled and observed precipitation, soil moisture, hydrologic, and vegetation and crop health data.\nThe NASA Short-term Prediction Research and Transition (SPoRT) Center currently runs a real-time configuration of the Noah land surface model (LSM) within the NASA Land Information System (LIS) framework. The LIS-Noah is run at 3-km resolution for local numerical weather prediction (NWP) and situational awareness applications at select NOAA/National Weather Service (NWS) forecast offices over the Continental U.S. (CONUS). To enhance the practicality of the LIS-Noah output for drought monitoring and assessing flood potential, a 30+-year soil moisture climatology has been developed in an attempt to place near real-time soil moisture values in historical context at county- and/or watershed-scale resolutions. This LIS-Noah soil moisture climatology and accompanying anomalies is intended to complement the current suite of operational products, such as the North American Land Data Assimilation System phase 2 (NLDAS-2), which are generated on a coarser-resolution grid that may not capture localized, yet important soil moisture features. Daily soil moisture histograms are used to identify the real-time soil moisture percentiles at each grid point according to the county or watershed in which the grid point resides. Spatial plots are then produced that map the percentiles as proxies to the different USDM categories.\nThis presentation will highlight recent developments of this gridded, objective soil moisture index, comparison to subjective analyses, and application examples.",

As a case study, Hamun Lake which is a pluvial Lake, also known as shallow Lake, located on the south-east of Iran and adjacent to Afghanistan, and Pakistan borders is investigated. The Lake is the main source of resources (agriculture, fishing and hunting) for the people around it and politically important in the region since it is shared among three different countries. The purpose of the research is to find the Lake’s area from 1972 to 2015 and to see if any drought or water resources management has affected the lake. Analyzing satellites imagery from Landsat shows that the area of the Lake changes seasonally and intra-annually. Significant seasonal effects are found in 1975,1977, 1987, 1993, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2009 and 2011, as well as, substantial amount of shallow water is found throughout the years. The precipitation records as well as drought historical records are studied for the lake’s basin. Meteorological studies suggest that the drought, decrease of rainfalls in the province and the improper management of the Lake have caused environmental, economic and geographical consequences. The results reveal that lake has experienced at least two prolong dryings since 1972 which drought cannot solely be blamed as main forcing factor.Proper lakes function can ease the impact of floods and drought especially in arid and semi-arid regions.

            "abstract": "Asymmetries in plasma density and the presence of a guide field significantly alter the structure of the ion diffusion region (IDR) in symmetric, collisionless reconnection. These features have been shown by numerical simulations under moderate density asymmetries (~10), and theoretical analyses. However, very few studies have addressed these issues with in-situ observations. We have compiled a collection of Cluster and Polar crossings of the high-latitude magnetopause poleward of the cusp under northward interplanetary magnetic field in the years 1998-2008 when signatures of reconnection inside the IDR are observed. They encompass a wide range of density asymmetries (~10 to 1000), magnetic field asymmetries (~0.2 to 0.9), and guide fields (~10 to ~60 %). In this dedicated observational study, we target the following topics: (1) The alteration of the structure of the IDR -- i.e., its width, the non-colocation of stagnation and X-lines, jet outflow speed, and biasing of the reconnection outflow jet toward the magnetosphere -- as a function of increasing density asymmetry, and (2) the diamagnetic drift of the X-line. Further, focusing on IDR crossings during plasma flow reversals and/or near-simultaneous crossings on either side of the X-line by two spacecraft under steady ambient conditions, we report on the contrast in the Hall fields and the plasma behavior on the sunward versus the tailward sides of the X-line in its dependence on the strength of the guide field.",

Recent warming and freshening of Southern Ocean has affected hydrological cycle in terms of increasing tendency of precipitation as liquid water instead of snow. Limited data is available on the extent of fresh water flux by precipitation and sea ice melting to the surface ocean. The spatial extent of sea ice formation is documented based on remote sensing observation. We investigate here spatial variability in freshwater inputs to the Indian sector of Southern Ocean region using combined observation of oxygen isotopes ratios and salinity of surface water during the summer of 2011, 2012 and 2013. Together with this, the measured isotopic ratios of meteoric water and sea ice melt were used in the mass balance equation for deriving the contribution of both of these components in the surface water of southern ocean. The three component mixing equations (Meredith et al., 2013) allowed estimation of fractional contribution of rain over the years. The δ18O of meteoric water followed the pattern nearly similar to the observation documented in the continental stations (Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation, GNIP) located in the southern hemisphere. However, a slight but consistent heavier composition was documented in rainwater as compared to the GNIP stations. Our observation suggests that the meteoric water is the dominant freshwater source over the ocean, accounting for up to 10-15% of the water present in the surface ocean during the austral summer whereas Sea-ice melt accounts for a much smaller percentage (maximum around 1%). Our observation is consistent with previous studies where similar magnitude of fresh water input was proposed based on observation from coastal region (Meredith et al., 2013).",

            "abstract": "In the northern and southern Appalachians, rocks that formed Paleozoic orogenic middle crust mostly are exposed within or directly inboard of terranes that originated near Gondwana. Most outcrops of the Paleozoic orogenic middle crust of the eastern edge of Laurentia occur adjacent to these exotic terranes. However, a narrow belt of Paleozoic orogenic middle crust is exposed in the Piedmont of the central Appalachians despite the absence of recognized exotic terranes. The presence of these deformed, amphibolite facies rocks raises the questions: “Did central Appalachian orogeny occur in the absence of accreted exotic terranes?” and, more generally, “Is exotic terrane collision required for exhumation of Appalachian former middle crust?”\nPrevious U/Pb isotopic dating of spots in detrital zircon revealed the presence of Gondwanan terranes in three locations in the central Appalachians: central Virginia, central Maryland, and southeastern Pennsylvania. Two new samples collected near the discovery locations in Virginia and Maryland yielded prominent peaks in zircon U/Pb age distributions at ca. 630-610 Ma, confirming the Gondwanan affinity of these rocks. Hf isotopic compositions of spots in these upper Neoproterozoic zircon grains range to both more and less depleted than spots in zircon from the few possible Laurentian granitic sources, consistent with derivation of the zircon from Gondwana. Abundant 1700-1000 Ma detrital zircon rules out the West Africa Craton as a potential source; Amazonia is the most likely ultimate source of the zircon.\nThe extent of the exotic terrane(s) in the central Appalachian Piedmont remains enigmatic due to uncertain connections between isolated exposures of the terrane(s). Nevertheless, the discovery of one or more exotic terranes in the central Appalachian Piedmont underscores the relationship between exotic terranes and exposed former middle crust in the Appalachians. This relationship may be a feature of several other major Phanerozoic orogens.",

SUDA will make a vital contribution to NASA's mission to Europa and provide key answers to its main scientific questions about the surface composition, habitability, the icy crust, and exchange processes with the deeper interior of the Jovian icy moon Europa.\nSUDA is a time-of- flight, reflectron-type impact mass spectrometer, optimised for a high mass resolution which only weakly depends on the impact location. The small size, low mass and large sensitive area meet the challenging demands of mission to Europa. A full-size prototype SUDA instrument was built in order to demonstrate its performance through calibration experiments at the dust accelerator at NASA's IMPACT institute at Boulder, CO, with a variety of cosmo-chemically relevant dust analogues.

            "abstract": "Changes in ocean circulation are thought to have increased CO2 sequestration in the deep ocean during glacial periods, resulting in lower atmospheric CO2. The return of this CO2 to the atmosphere was likely driven by invigorated ventilation of the ocean, but the relative influence of possible mechanisms that drove past circulation changes during the deglaciation are still debated. High-resolution benthic foraminiferal δ13C from Cibicidoides (primarily wuellerstorfi) and tephra-tied Δ14C on mixed benthics from an eight-core depth transect (663-3836 m water depth) in the Southwest Pacific Ocean provide compelling evidence for shallow glacial stratification in the Southern Ocean. The glacial δ13C difference between ~660 and ~1600 m was ~1.7‰, more than double the Holocene difference of ~0.7‰. At the same time, Δ14C of waters below ~1600 m were 3-5 times more depleted than modern, confirming increased isolation of deep water from the atmosphere. During the last glacial termination better-ventilated intermediate waters appeared in a pulse beginning ~16.5 ka, indicated by rapid δ13C enrichment to 1100 m and confirmed by Δ14C values with vertical structure similar to modern. Intermediate ventilation in the high resolution δ13C was followed by slower, progressive ventilation of increasingly deeper layers between 14.5 and 10 ka, again confirmed by lower resolution Δ14C of mid-depth water. The close coincidence of rapid atmospheric CO2 increases, shallow ventilation and documented wind-driven upwelling in the Southern Ocean suggests the influence of wind-driven ocean ventilation. In addition, gradual atmospheric CO2 increases coincident with the onset of deep ventilation and reinitiation of vigorous North Atlantic Deep Water formation suggest that shifts in deep water density and circulation also contributed to deglacial ocean ventilation in this region. In combination, these data indicate both processes played a role in deglacial CO2 rise.",

            "abstract": "We have previously published results from the AMPS DSMC (Adaptive Mesh Particle Simulator Direct Simulation Monte Carlo) model and its characterization of the neutral coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko through detailed comparison with data collected by the ROSINA/COPS (Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis/COmet Pressure Sensor) instrument aboard the Rosetta spacecraft [Bieler, 2015]. Results from these DSMC models have been used to create an empirical model of the near comet coma (<200 km) of comet 67P. The empirical model characterizes the neutral coma in a comet centered, sun fixed reference frame as a function of heliocentric distance, radial distance from the comet, local time and declination. The model is a significant improvement over more simple empirical models, such as the Haser model. While the DSMC results are a more accurate representation of the coma at any given time, the advantage of a mean state, empirical model is the ease and speed of use. One use of such an empirical model is in the calculation of a total cometary coma production rate from the ROSINA/COPS data. The COPS data are in situ measurements of gas density and velocity along the ROSETTA spacecraft track. Converting the measured neutral density into a production rate requires knowledge of the neutral gas distribution in the coma. Our empirical model provides this information and therefore allows us to correct for the spacecraft location to calculate a production rate as a function of heliocentric distance. We will present the full empirical model as well as the calculated neutral production rate for the period of August 2014 – August 2015 (perihelion).",

            "abstract": "SiO2 is the most major component in silicate melts, and the diffusion of SiO2 plays a controlling role in growth or dissolution of quartz from or into silicate melts. The diffusivity of SiO2 is small and highly dependent on melt compositions (Lesher and Walker, 1986; Koyaguchi, 1989), making it difficult to extract high-quality Si diffusivity data.\nWe conducted quartz dissolution experiments in rhyolitic melt (0.1wt% H2O, 73 wt% SiO2) at 1300-1600 °C. We also have preliminary data on quartz dissolution in basaltic melt at 1300 °C , one quartz dissolution experiment (Zhang et al., 1989) in andesitic melt at 1300 °C , and five cassiterite dissolution experiments (Yang et al, in review) in various hydrous rhyolitic melts (containing 0.1-5.9 wt% H2O, and 74-77 wt% SiO2) at 900-1100 °C. All experiments were conducted at 0.5 GPa using piston cylinder apparatus. All data were combined to examine the dependence of DSiO2 on melt compositions. Though in individual experiments lnDSiO2 is a linear function of SiO2 concentration as shown in literature, the combined data show that lnDSiO2 decreases linearly with XSi+Al, where XSi+Al is defined as cation mole fraction of Si+Al in melts. By fitting concentration profiles at different temperatures using DSiO2 = D0 ea(1-XSi+Al), the results show that the parameter a is roughly composition-independent across all experiments and is linear to 1/T:\na = 2.603(±0.451) + 35282(±627)/T, r2= 0.996.\nD0 is the extrapolated effective binary diffusivity of SiO2 in pure silica melt (XSi+Al = 1 roughly corresponds to XSi = 1 in quartz dissolution experiments). For quartz dissolution experiments in rhyolitic melt, the dependence of D0 on T is:\nlnD0 = -14.041(±1.915) - 34719(±3125)/T, r2= 0.875\nFor cassiterite dissolution, lnD0 values do not follow the above trend because the dominant SnO concentration gradient can affect interdiffusion between SiO2 and other components. That is, XSi+Al alone is not enough to account for how D0 depends on other components. The effect of H2O on both a and D0 is roughly accounted for by simply including H as a cation when calculating XSi+Al. Namely, adding H2O equals to lowering XSi+Al, e.g. at 1300°C, every addition of 1 wt% H2O (i.e. lowering XSi+Al by ~0.05) would increase DSiO2 by ~1.2 lnD units for a melt with initial XSi+Al = 0.85 on anhydrous basis.",

The objective of this study was to study the isotopic composition of the net CO2 exchange (NEE) above and with corn and tall grass canopies. Profiles of stable isotopes of CO2 (12C-CO2, 13C-CO2 and 18O-CO2) were measured using tunable diode laser trace gas analyzers and multiport sampling systems in corn (12C-CO2 and 13C-CO2, only) and tall grass canopies. These measurements were combined with the flux gradient method and Lagrangian dispersion analysis to estimate the isotopic signatures of the net CO2 flux. The use of a gradient of a concentration threshold to screen half hourly period improved the estimates of flux signatures by the isotope flux ratio approach. The Langrangian dispersion analysis and the isotope flux ratio method estimates showed good agreement above the corn canopy, indicating that the former method can be a viable alternative to study the isotopic exchange within plant canopies. The 13CO2 composition of NEE showed a downward trend near the end of the growing season, which may be related to a reduction of autotrophic respiration in the soil.",

            "abstract": "One of the primary leakage pathways of concern at geologic CO2 sequestration sites is abandoned wellbores. Abandoned wellbores are prevalent at many potential CO2 sequestration sites as a result of fossil energy exploration and extraction. Permeable stratigraphic layers within the caprock above the primary reservoir but below aquifers may provide secondary capture of CO2 leakage along wellbores. These features are prevalent at many potential sequestration sites. In fact, under-pressurized permeable layers encountered during drilling operations are referred to as \"thief zones\" due to the loss of drilling fluids when they are encountered. While it is unlikely that CO2 leakage will encounter thief zones, unless the CO2 injection operation leads to damage of the caprock, encountering permeable stratigraphic layers along an abandoned wellbore is a likely scenario. The ability for these permeable stratigraphic layers to act as secondary reservoirs is investigated here. We use the FEHM simulator to perform 3D, multi-phase, multi-component, numerical simulations of CO2 and brine leakage along an abandoned wellbore that encounters a potential secondary reservoir. We perform a parametric study of these simulations varying thief zone permeability, wellbore permeability, and CO2 injection rates to investigate the capture provided by the secondary reservoir. The results of this study provide indications of the potential for secondary reservoirs to mitigate leakage along abandoned wellbores during and after CO2 sequestration operations.",

Aquatic ecosystems are very complex and predicting change of water quality is also determined by accurate prediction of changes of hydrological, hydraulic and hydrodynamic behaviors in the system. In this study, we introduced an integrated catchment-scale modeling which includes developing hydrological-1D hydraulic models, emission and loading models as well as 3D-hydrodynamic and water quality models. We applied the integrated approach in different case studies, suggesting this modelling system may provide a useful framework for future sound management of water resources.",

The reanalysis dataset is based on leveraging information from the MERRA climatological reanalysis, a snow model and Landsat fractional Snow Covered Area (fSCA) data from 1985 to 2014. The assimilation methodology consists of a Particle Batch Smoother, which probabilistically conditions an ensemble prior snowpack estimate derived from MERRA and the snow model on time series of Landsat fSCA data. Uncertainty in precipitation estimates over the Andes proved difficult to quantify, and a statistical approach using snow survey data was devised in order to establish the best possible unbiased prior precipitation flux. Validation results show an increased accuracy of SWE estimates with respect to in-situ snow survey sites. The reanalysis framework is applied to derive climatological characteristics of the snowpack within a high-elevation Andean basin, part of the headwaters of the Maipo River in Central Chile. The large-scale implementation of the reanalysis includes Chilean and Argentinean basins making it of significant regional importance, and will result in spatially and temporally continuous SWE fields for the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 historical record.",

MOMA combines pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS) of bulk powder samples and Mars ambient laser desorption mass spectrometry (LDMS) surface analysis, using a single ion trap MS. This dual source design enables MOMA to detect compounds over a wide range of molecular weights and volatilities. The structure of any detected organics may be further examined using MOMA’s tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) mode. The flight model (FM) ion trap sensor and electronics have been assembled under the extremely clean and sterile conditions required by ExoMars, and have met or exceeded all performance specifications during initial functional tests. After Mars ambient thermal cycling and calibration, the FM will be delivered as a subsystem of MOMA to rover integration in mid-2016. There MOMA will join complementary rover instruments such as the Raman and MicrOmega spectrometers designed to analyze common drill samples.\nFollowing the MOMA design, linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LITMS)-based instruments are under development for future missions. LITMS adds enhanced capabilities such as precision (point-by-point) analysis of drill cores, negative ion detection, a wider mass range, and higher temperature pyrolysis with precision evolved gas analysis, while remaining highly compact and robust. Each of the capabilities of LITMS has been demonstrated on breadboard hardware. The next phase will realize an end-to-end brassboard at flight scale that will meet stringent technology readiness level (TRL) 6 criteria, indicating readiness for development toward missions to Mars, comets, asteroids, outer solar system moons, and beyond.",

Fe(II) is often found in similar redox conditions and can rapidly reduce NO2- to N2 and/or nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas, through a process called chemodenitrification. Microbial communities can also reduce nitrate (NO3-) to NO2- and eventually to N2O through the anaerobic process of biological denitrification. This study compared the impact on NO2- accumulation when Fe(III)-containing minerals ferrihydrite and goethite were added to natural sediments. The presence of dissolved Fe(II), presumably produced by microbial iron reduction, significantly limited the amount of NO2- accumulation, suggesting that Fe(II) may have chemically reduced NO2-. Changes in the δ15N of the intermediate NO2- pool in each bottle was measured, but the apparent isotope effects of NO2- reduction were indistinguishable among treatments, suggesting that the reaction of Fe(II) and NO2- imparts an isotope effect on the NO2- pool of a similar magnitude to that of biological NO2- reduction. The isotopic composition of N2O and its 15N site preference will be measured to determine if chemodenitrification truly occurred, and if so, the relative contributions to N2O production from biological denitrification and chemodenitrification will be determined.",

            "abstract": "We report new, 10-Be-derived denudation rates measured from river sands in basins of the Santa Lucia Range, central California. The Santa Lucia Mountains of the California Coast Range are an asymmetrical northwest-southeast trending range bounded by the San Gregorio-Hosgri (SG-HFZ ) and Rinconada-Reliz faults. This area provides an additional opportunity to analyze the relationships between topographic form, denudation rates, and mapped underlying geologic substrate in an actively deforming landscape.\nAnalysis of in situ-produced 10-Be from alluvial sand samples collected in the Santa Lucia Mountains has yielded measurements of spatially varying basin-scale denudation rates. Despite the impressive relief of the Santa Lucia’s, denudation rates within catchments draining the coastal side of the range are uniformly low, generally varying between ~90 m/Myr and ~350 m/Myr, with one basin eroding at ~500 m/Myr. Preliminary data suggest the lowest erosion rates are located within the northern interior of the range in sedimentary and granitic lithologies, while higher rates are located directly along the coast in metasedimentary bedrock. This overall trend is punctuated by a single high denudation rate, which is hosted by a watershed whose geometry suggests that it previously has, and continues to experience divide migration as it captures the adjacent watershed’s area. Spatial distribution of basins with higher denudation rates is inferred to indicate a zone of uplift adjacent to the SG-HFZ. We compare erosion rates to basin mean channel steepness index, extracted from a 10 m digital elevation model. Denudation rate generally increases with channel steepness index until ~250 m/Myr, at which point the relationship becomes invariant, suggesting a non-linear erosion model may best characterize this region. These hypotheses will be tested further as additional denudation rate results are analyzed.",

            "abstract": "The Earth’s land surface is a complex mosaic of geomorphic units and land cover types resulting in large variations in terrain height, slope, roughness, vegetation height and reflectance, often with the variations occurring over very small spatial scales. Documentation of these landscape properties is a first step in understanding the interplay between the formative processes and response to changing conditions. ICESat-2 will provide a global distribution of geodetic measurements (of both the terrain surface and relative canopy heights) which will provide a significant benefit to society through a variety of applications including sea level change monitoring, forest structural mapping and biomass estimation, and improved global digital terrain models. Topography, or land surface height, is an important component for many height applications, both to the scientific and commercial sectors. In addition to producing a global terrain product, monitoring the amount and distribution of above ground vegetation and carbon pools enables improved characterization of the global carbon budget. Although ICESat-2 is not positioned to provide global biomass estimates due to its profiling configuration and limited detection capabilities for some ecosystems, it is anticipated that the ICESat-2 data products for vegetation will be complementary to other ongoing biomass and vegetation mapping efforts. Topographic and canopy data products from ICESat-2 will be produced and delivered in both an along-track (profiling) mode and gridded mode. To increase the spatial sampling of ICESat-2 measurements over non-cryospheric regions, ICESat-2 will be off-nadir pointed at various angles (maximum of 1.8 degrees) from the reference ground track during the entire mission.",

            "abstract": "Kawai-type multianvil apparatus are widely used as high-pressure devices to generate pressures to the uppermost lower mantle using tungsten carbide (WC) anvils. Combination with sintered diamond (SD) anvils allows generating pressure above 30 to usually 60 GPa. However, it is difficult to use SD anvils practically, because they are much expensive than WC anvils. We therefore developed experimental techniques to generate pressures over 40 GPa using a Kawai-type apparatus with WC anvils particularly for studying phase relations in multi-component systems in the lower mantle down to 1000 km depth. We used a 15-MN Kawai-type multianvil apparatus with DIA-type guide blocks with careful optimization of a cubic compression space formed by first-stage anvils. Pressures were generated using hard WC anvils (TF05, Fujilloy Co., Ltd) with truncation of 1.5 mm and taper of 1.0ᴼ with a semi-sintered MgO + 5wt.%Cr2O3 octahedron as a pressure medium. Pressure was calibrated by detecting resistance changes of Bi, ZnS, GaP and Zr at room temperature. The maximum achievable pressure at 2000 K, which was generated using a Re heater in a LaCrO3 thermal insulator, was examined by the Al2O3 content in aluminous bridgemanite. Al2O3 rods were placed at the both side of the sample in a furnace. The starting material was sintered ilmenite-type Mg3Al2Si3O12 synthesized at 1200 K and 26 GPa (Kubo and Akaogi, 2000). We observed the ω-β transition in Zr (34 GPa) (Ono and Kikegawa, 2015) at a press load of 8 MN at room temperature. The sample synthesized at 2000 K and 15 MN has a composition nearly equal to pyrope and the LiNbO3-type structure. The LiNbO3 structure of the recovered sample with pyrope composition suggests that it had the perovskite structure before recovery. The composition of this sample suggests generation of 44 GPa at a high temperature of 2000 K, according to the phase relations in the MgSiO3-Al2O3 system (Liu, private communication).",

            "abstract": "Observed tropical convection exhibits zonal asymmetries that strongly influence spatial precipitation patterns. The drivers of changes to this zonally-asymmetric Walker circulation on decadal and longer timescales have been the focus of significant recent research. Here we use two state-of-the-art earth system models to explore the impact of earth's mountains on the Walker circulation. When all land-surface topography is removed, the Walker circulation weakens by 33-59%. There is a ~30% decrease in global, large-scale upward vertical wind velocities in the middle of the troposphere, but only minor changes in global average convective mass flux, precipitation, surface and sea-surface temperatures. The zonally symmetric Hadley circulation is also largely unchanged. Following the spatial pattern of changes to large-scale vertical wind velocities, precipitation becomes less focused over the tropics. The weakening of the Walker circulation, but not the Hadley circulation, is similar to the behavior of climate models during radiative forcing experiments: in our simulations, the weakening is associated with changes in vertical wind velocities, rather than the hydrologic cycle. These results indicate suggest that mountain heights may significantly influence the Walker circulation on geologic time scales, and observed changes in tropical precipitation over millions of years may have been forced by changes in tropical orography.",

The PREcision Monitoring Sensor (PREMOS) instrument aboard the PICARD satellite acquired solar irradiance measurements in specific spectral windows in the UV, visible and near infrared from October 2010 to March 2014. This contribution aims at presenting the Level 3 data, corrected for non solar features as well as for degradation. These level 3 data has been tested over different scientific cases, such as observations during the Venus transit and the presence of the p-mode signature within high-cadence data. The PREMOS Level 3 data have also been compared to others data sets, namely the SOLSTICE and SIM instruments aboard SORCE, for nearly 3 and half years. An excellent correlation has been found for the UV spectral ranges. We have also found a rather good correlation for visible and near-infrared observations for short-term variations, for which an error of about 200 ppm has been estimated within PREMOS visible and near-infrared observations. The PREMOS data could also be used to address several scientific topics, i.e. for validating semi-empirical models of the solar irradiance. We will emphasize about our new irradiance model, COSIR for Code of Solar Irradiance Reconstruction, which is successful at reproducing the solar modulation as seen in the PREMOS, SoHO/Virgo and SORCE data.",

            "abstract": "Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) is a powerful tool for characterizing hydrologic processes. Coupled hydrogeophysical inversion can be used to invert time-lapse GPR data to obtain soil hydraulic properties. However, the inversion will fail if the hydrological model is not appropriately conceptualized, or when the ray-based methods that are often used to limit the computation time are not appropriate. Ray-based approaches cannot be used in the case of wetting fronts in the vadose zone due to precipitation/infiltration or thawing events, where low-velocity layers with high water content can trap the GPR waves and act as a waveguide such that multiple internal reflections cause dispersion. Utilizing the dispersion, manifested as a singled appearance of arrivals on multi-offset data, we can invert for waveguide properties. Single- or two-layer waveguide inversion approaches return average water contents but are incapable of representing the gradational nature of the water content distribution of the shallow subsurface. Recently, a shuffled complex evolution algorithm was implemented that used a piece-wise linear function to closely match the shallow gradational water content profile present for early-time infiltration events for different n-parameter values of the Mualem–van Genuchten equation using HYDRUS-1D. Similar waveguide phenomena can arise in the presence of high porosity layers in saturated aquifers for crosshole GPR. These high porosity layers result in significant late arrival high-amplitude elongated wave trains that were detected in crosshole data from the Widen, Boise and Krauthausen aquifers. Full-waveform inversion of these data that uses an accurate forward model to explain the measured data is able to return decimeter scale resolution of the porosity based on the GPR velocity. With increasing computer power, it is expected that these advanced processing can be soon included in the coupled inversion approaches.",

Heavy rainfall in southern California is generated by warm-wet storms associated with atmospheric rivers (ARs) producing flood events, while drought conditions occur when winter precipitation associated with north Pacific low pressure systems does not reach the region. Winter rainfall delivers siliciclastic sediment to Santa Barbara Basin (SBB), CA while spring summer marine productivity provides biogenic sediment resulting in a simple two component laminae couplet. Laminations are preserved in the low oxygen bottom of SBB providing a high temporal resolution paleoclimate record.\nHere we present scanning XRF generated annually resolved elemental concentrations for the last 9.5 ka in SBB from SPR0901-03KC (34°16.99’N; 120°2.408’W) and MV0811-14JPC (34°16.54’N; 120°2.10’W) in ~586 m water depth. High siliciclastic elemental counts are interpreted as indicating increased river runoff, while low values indicate droughts. Floods events indicative of extreme precipitation events occur throughout the Holocene, however long intervals between floods occur 8.5-7 Ka, 5.6-6.4 Ka and 0.8-1.1 Ka. Notable droughts occur 5.6-6.1, 4.7-5.1, 3.5-4.1, 2.6, 2.1, 1.8, 1.1 and 0.9 Ka. Spectral analysis indicates silicilastic elemental peaks are close to an annual resolution, however annual tuning increases the power of the interannual frequencies without changing the frequency appreciably. High frequency variability is lost during drought intervals.",

Population is projected to double within the next 50 years in the 2,650 square miles watershed. With prolonged drought conditions, and projected climate change, a strong concern exists about sustainable water supply of the area. In this study, historic climate and streamflow trend from water year 1965 to 2014 is analyzed using the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test. Climate trends are studied using annual rainfall, and annual average maximum and minimum temperature at 5 and 4 weather stations, respectively. Three of the precipitation stations show precipitation is decreasing in the watershed while minimum and maximum temperature has an increasing trend at three stations (p < 0.05). To assess whether streamflow and stream-channel characteristics are tended to increase or decrease monotonically with time, four variables – (1) annual maximum peak, (2) annual mean, (3) low to moderate and (4) moderate to high maximum peak streamflow were tested at 20 stream gauge sites. Only at 5 stream gage stations, significant streamflow trend is observed. At two stream gages, annual peak and annual average streamflow is increasing and at two stations, annual average streamflow has a decreasing trend. Low to moderate peak streamflow is increasing at two gage locations but there is no monotonic trend in moderate to high flows. As precipitation is decreasing in some part of the watershed, the effect of increasing urbanization in the area can be attributed for the localized increase in mean and peak streamflow. The trend analysis in weather and stream gage data will be presented in detail.",

            "abstract": "A new fully digital bistatic 50-MHz VHF radar is currently being developed by the radar group in the Institute of Space and Atmospheric Studies (ISAS) at the University of Saskatchewan. This paper presents the scientific motivation for the new radar. Traditionally bistatic radars have had excellent time resolution, but were significantly lacking in range resolution. With the now available accurate timing abilities and advanced pulse modulation techniques, bistatic radar configurations with both excellent temporal and spatial resolution are able to map or 'image' the E-region. The E-region portion of the ionosphere being the base of the magnetosphere has both global (ionosphere-magnetosphere system) and local phenomena of interest. The currents in the magnetosphere close in the E-region. Field-aligned currents (FACs) and Alfven waves are phenomena with origins in the magnetosphere which present their 'signatures' in the E-region. For example, Alfven waves (produced by the Alfven wave resonator) have different time scales, from less than a Hertz to periods of tens of minutes --- and the high temporal and spatial resolution of this new digital E-region radar will be able to detect them all. The E-region is also a dynamic plasma medium with the two-steam and gradient drift instabilities present and the improved measurement abilities will give fresh physical insight.",

            "abstract": "Recent results have shown the occurrence of a large-scale flux rope (enhancement in magnetic field strength and rotation in magnetic field vectors) on the dayside of Mars as associated with a dayside current sheet region forming at the proximity of strong crustal magnetic fields. This dayside current sheet region including the example of the large-scale flux rope occurred when the draped solar wind magnetic field showed a +By component in the MSO frame. All events involved similar anisotropic pitch angle distribution of electrons with low-energy field aligned electrons and higher-energy trapped electrons, indicating either the mixing of trapped magnetosheath electrons with low energy field aligned ionospheric electrons and/or the pitch angle diffusion of ionospheric electrons. During a time of weak draped field, the current sheet region became highly extended and was observed alongside a decrease in magnetic field strength and highly anisotropic plasma indicative of a mirror mode structure or magnetic hole. The occurrence of magnetic decreases or magnetic holes are an established feature of the solar wind and are often found in the terrestrial magnetosheath, and have also been observed near Jupiter, Venus and comets. More recently, mirror mode structures have been reported within the Earth’s magnetosphere. The occurrence of the mirror mode instability could result in the excitation of ULF waves and has also been related to Alfvén waves that could cause heating of the local plasma. Hence, both the large-scale flux ropes and mirror mode structures of current sheet regions on the dayside of Mars may have an important role in ionospheric heating and atmospheric escape at Mars. Therefore, using an automated routine we will attempt to search for the occurrence of magnetic field enhancements and magnetic field decreases in measurements of magnetic field by the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) satellite Magnetometer (MAG) instrument whilst comparing to the other Particle and Fields Package (PFP) instruments to further explore the properties of the large-scale flux ropes and magnetic mirror instability at Mars and assess their role in the escape of the Martian atmosphere.",

The VIS is designed as a tower-based, solar-powered, automated phenology camera (Phenocam) that collects red, green, blue (RGB) and near-infrared (NIR) landscape images in High Dynamic Range (HDR) with fully programmable temporal resolution. HDR composite images are made through combining a series of rapid-capture photos with incremental increases of exposure times and a fixed focus, minimizing the spatial and visual data lost from shadows or from the over-saturation of light. This visual record of ecosystem phenology stages (Phenophases) is being used to (1) investigate vegetation-dependent spectral indices; (2) establish a cross-year comparison record of Phenophase seasonality; (3) investigate meteorological-dependent vegetation Phenophases; (4) provide ground-truthing measurements that enhance broader spatial-scale remote sensing analyses of subarctic wetlands.",

It is hypothesized as a standing shock wave generated by super-magnetosonic reconnection outflows impinging upon dense, newly-reconnected magnetic loops during the flare energy release process. However, such shock wave has largely remained a theoretical concept inferred from model predictions due to the lack of observational evidence. Here we present observations of a termination shock in a solar flare and trace its morphology and dynamics using high-cadence radio imaging spectroscopy enabled by the upgraded Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. The observed properties of the shock, including its location, morphology, and dynamics, are well-reproduced by magnetohydrodynamics simulations in a standard Kopp-Pneuman-type reconnection geometry for two-ribbon flares. We further show that a disruption of the shock coincides with an abrupt reduction of the energetic electron population. These results strongly suggest that a termination shock is responsible, at least in part, for accelerating energetic electrons in solar flares.",

            "abstract": "From late January to early March of 2015, the ARM Cloud Aerosol Precipitation Experiment (ACAPEX) deployed a variety of instruments to study atmospheric rivers as they made landfall on the western United States. These atmospheric rivers are an important source of rainfall for the drought-ridden regions of California, so it is important to understand the cloud characteristics and processes that occur during the events. For this study, the KAZR zenith pointing millimeter wavelength radar aboard the Ron Brown research vessel as well as two cloud probes, namely the Two-Dimensional Stereo Probe (2DS) and High Volume Precipitation Spectrometer-3 (HVPS3), flown on the ARM Aerial Facility Gulfstream-1 (AAF G1) aircraft were used to analyze the clouds associated with the atmospheric rivers. PyDisdrometer, an open-source software, is used to calculate radar reflectivity values based on the drop size distributions observed by the cloud probes so that the aircraft data may be directly compared to the KAZR data. This research will focus on two flight days. First, a coordinated flight flown on February 5, where the G1 flew a spiral pattern over the Ron Brown while the KAZR was running will be used to examine the clouds over the ocean. This will also allow for a direct comparison between the calculated radar reflectivity from the cloud probes and the KAZR measured reflectivity. The second case was chosen to be the atmospheric river landfall event on February 6. This case will be analyzed over the ocean using the KAZR, then over the shoreline, Sacramento, and the inland mountains using the cloud probe data, as well as other instrumentations onboard the G1, such as those that measure cloud thickness and liquid water content. In this way, the changes that occur to the clouds as they move from open-ocean to land may be examined in greater detail.",

Employing the radical-clock technique, we quantified the production of gaseous atomic Cl. When the artificial sea salt aerosols contained suspended Fe2O3 alone at pH 6, no significant Cl production could be observed, even if the dissolution of iron was forced by “weathering” (repeatedly freezing and thawing for five times). Adjusting the pH in the stock suspension to 2.6, 2.2, and 1.9 and equilibrating for one week resulted in a quantifiable amount of dissolved iron (0.03, 0.2, and 0.6 mmol/L, respectively) and in gaseous Cl production rates of ~1.6, 6, and 8 × 1021 atoms cm-2 h-1, respectively. Exposing the pure Fe2O3 aerosol in the absence of salt to various gaseous HCl concentrations resulted in rates ranging from 8 × 1020 Cl atoms cm-2 h-1 (at ~4 ppb HCl) to 5 × 1022 Cl atoms cm-2 h-1 (at ~350 ppb HCl) and confirmed the uptake and conversion of HCl to atomic Cl (at HCl to Cl conversion yields of 2-5 % mol/mol, depending on the relative humidity).

            "abstract": "The spectacular Indonesian Lusi mud eruption started in May 2006 following to a 6.3 M earthquake striking the island of Java. Previous studies investigated the mechanisms of reactivation of the Watukosek fault system that crosses Lusi locality and continues to the NE of Java. Results show that the quake triggered lateral movement of this strike-slip system resulting in several aligned eruptions sites including Lusi. Geochemical studies of the erupted fluids reveal a mantle signature and point to a connection with the neighboring Arjuno-Welirang volcanic complex indicating that Lusi is a sedimentary hosted geothermal system.\nIn order to better understand 1) the geometry of the Lusi subsurface plumbing system, 2) to estimate the type and the amount of gas released, and 3) how tectonic structures may control this activity, we conducted a comprehensive survey around the Lusi crater. We sampled more than 60 seepage sites to analyze the composition of the gas released and conducted a flux measurements survey of over 350 stations (CO2 and CH4). In addition we completed three CO2, CH4, radon profiles (120 points) perpendicular to the NE-SW oriented Watukosek strike-slip fault system and complemented that with geoelectric surveys.\nResults show that the whole area is characterized by diffused gas release through seeps, fractures, microfractures and soil degassing. Overall the highest gas flux were recorded at stations crossing the fractured zones that coincide with the position of the Watukosek fault system. The fractures release mainly CO2 (with peaks up to 400 g/m2day) and display higher temperatures (up to 41°C). This main shear zone is populated by numerous seeps that expel mostly CH4. Flux measurements in the seeping pools reveal that φCO2 is an order of magnitude higher than that measured in the fractures, and two orders of magnitude for φCH4. Radon measurements vary from 30 and 90 Bq/m3 on the edges of the study area to 6000 Bq/m3in the proximity of the faulted zone suggesting the presence of preferential leakage pathways towards the surface. The higher gas measurements in the faulted areas coincide with the anomalies recorded by the geoelectric survey.\nStatistical analyses over the 7 km2 area allowed estimating the full amount of gas release. Estimates from the crater zone suggest an order of magnitude higher than the surroundings.",

A surficial chaotic mass transport deposit (MTD) filling the failure scar exceeds 100 m in thickness over large sections of the deposit, thinning towards the margins of the slide. Below 5000 m, the CFS truncates the surficial MTD of the Cape Lookout Landslide in several places, indicating that it post-dates the Cape Lookout Landslide. At depth, the MCS data image the edge of the Cape Fear salt diapir and a seismically transparent region that may be associated with fluid flow focused along the edge of the diapir. This potential fluid pathway sits directly beneath the headwalls of the CFS, supporting the hypothesis that the salt diapir is responsible for the failure, either through deformation of sediments during salt emplacement or by focusing of fluids, or both. The MCS data also image several earlier MTDs. These deposits are confined to sediments younger than the early Cenozoic, consistent with interpretations of major canyon cutting in the Eocene and initiation of intense deep and erosive currents in the Late Paleogene. These processes can over-steepen and redistribute slope sediments, enhancing conditions for slope failures and salt diapirism.",

Snow often contains significant concentrations of organic matter. We have investigated the effects of coloured dissolved organic matter (cDOM) on anthracene photolysis kinetics in ice and at ice surfaces. We show that competitive photon absorption is the main effect of cDOM.

Despite a refined framework of Gondwanan ice distribution, questions remain about the timing, volume, and synchronicity of high-latitude continental ice and the subsequent deglaciation. These questions ultimately preclude our understanding of linkages between ice volume, sea level, and high- and low-latitude climate. Poor constraints on the timing and synchronicity of glacial and interglacial transitions reflect a lack of high-resolution radioisotopic dates from high-latitude, ice-proximal Carboniferous-Permian successions. The Rio Bonito Fm in Rio Grande do Sul State of southern Brazil hosts the oldest non-glaciogenic Carboniferous- Permian deposits of the Paraná Basin, thus recording the icehouse-to-greenhouse transition. Despite a widespread effort over the last two decades to constrain these deposits in time by means of U-Pb zircon geochronology, published data sets of the Candiota and Faxinal coals of the Rio Bonito Fm host discrepancies that may reflect post- eruptive open system behavior of zircon and analytical artifacts. These discrepancies have hindered the correlation of the Candiota and Faxinal sediments within the larger Gondwanan framework. Here we present the first U-Pb ages on closed system single zircons using CA-TIMS techniques on Permo-Carboniferous ash deposits of the Paraná Basin. Preliminary results indicate two major and distinct coal-forming periods that are separated by ca 10 Ma. Our results and conclusions are not in agreement with multi- crystal U-Pb TIMS and SIMS ages that suggest coeval deposition of the Candiota and Faxinal coals. CA-TIMS analyses applied to zircons from additional ash deposits are aimed at constructing a robust chronostratigraphic framework for the Carboniferous- Permian succession of the Paraná Basin, which will facilitate a better understanding of the timing and ice dynamics of the LPIA.",

Multiple data-constrained techniques that reconstruct the 3D coronal field based on photospheric magnetograms have been used to achieve this goal. In particular, we have used the flux rope insertion method to obtain the coronal magnetic field of multiple regions containing flux ropes or sheared arcades based on line-of-sight magnetograms and X-ray and EUV observations of coronal loops. For the purpose of developing statistical measures of the goodness of fit of these models to the observations, here we present our modeling of flux ropes based on synthetic magnetograms obtained from Fan & Gibson emerging flux rope simulation. The goal is to reproduce the flux rope structure from a given time step of the MHD simulations based only on the photospheric magnetogram and synthetic forward modeled coronal emission obtained from the same step of the MHD simulation. For this purpose we create a large grid of models with the flux rope insertion method with different combinations of axial and poloidal flux, which give us different morphology of the flux rope. Then we compare the synthetic coronal emission with the shape of the current distribution and field lines from the models to come up with a best fit. This fit is then tested using the statistical methods developed by our team.",

            "abstract": "Subsurface materials are generally anisotropic due to complicated geological conditions, for example, sedimentary materials, fractures reflecting various stress conditions in the past and present in the subsurface. There are many studies on seismic wave propagation in TI (transversely isotropic) and orthorhombic media (e.g., Thomsen, 1986; Alkhalifah, 2000; Bansal and Sen, 2008). In most of those studies, the magnitude of anisotropy is assumed to be weak. Therefore, it may be not appropriate to apply their theories directly to strongly anisotropic subsurface media in seismic exploration. It is necessary to understand the effects of the anisotropy on the behavior of seismic wave propagation in strongly anisotropic media in the seismic exploration.\nIn this study, we investigate the influence of strong anisotropy on received seismic waveforms using three-dimensional numerical models, and verified capability of detecting subsurface anisotropy. Our numerical models contain an isotropic and an anisotropic (VTI, transversely isotropic media with vertical symmetry axis) layer, respectively, in the isotropic background subsurface. Since the difference between the two models is only the anisotropy in the vertical propagation velocity, we could look at the influence of anisotropy in the residual wavefield that is the difference in the observed wavefields of two models. We analyzed the orbital motions of the residual wavefield to see what kind of wave motions the waveforms show. We found that the residual waveforms generated by the anisotropic layer include the orbital motions of shear waves right after the first arrival, i.e., mode conversion from the compressional waves due to the anisotropy. The residual waveforms could be exploited to estimate both the order of anisotropy and the thickness of anisotropic layer in subsurface.",

Students specialized in electrical and aerospace engineering, and space physics topics. They interacted regularly with NASA engineers, presented at telecons, and prepared reports. A number of students decided to pursue internships and/or jobs related to space science and technology. Outreach to the campus and broader community included demos and flight projects. The physics payload includes plasma density and temperature measurements using a Langmuir and a triple probe; plasma frequency measurements using a radio sounder (WVU) and an impedance probe (U.S.A); and a magnetometer (WVWC).

            "abstract": "Soil organic matter is one of the largest reservoirs in global carbon cycle, and black carbon (BC) represents a chemical resistant component. Black C plays an important role in global climate change. Generally considered recalcitrant due to high aromaticity, the reactive surface and functional groups of BC are crucial for carbon sequestration in soils. Mineral sorption and physical protection is an important mechanism for BC long term stabilization and sequestration in environments. Previous studies on mineral protection of BC were limited to analysis techniques in two-dimensions, for example, by SEM, TEM, and NanoSIMS. Little is known about the scope of organo-mineral association, the in-situ distribution and forms of minerals, and the ultimate interplay of BC and minerals. The aim of this study is to investigate the three-dimensional interaction of organic C and minerals in submicron scale using synchrotron-based Transmission X-ray Microcopy (TXM) and Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Abundant poorly-crystallined nano-minerals particles were observed. These short-range-order (SRO) minerals also aggregate into clusters and sheets, and form envelops-like structures on the surface of BC. On top of large surface contact area, the intimate interplay between BC and minerals reinforces the stability of both organic C and minerals, resulting from chemical bonding through cation bridging and ligand exchange. The mineral protection enhances BC stabilization and sequestration and lowers its bioavailability in environment. The results suggest that mineral physical protection for BC sequestration may be more important than previous understanding.",

Here we analyze ENSO variability using a new CESM ensemble that samples the effects of internal variability of the coupled Earth system. The CESM experiment consists of 50 ensemble members, featuring historical and future RCP8.5 forcing conditions (1850-2100). Each ensemble member is initialized from unique model states sampled from a ~10,000 year fully coupled unforced equilibrium simulation corresponding to pre-industrial conditions. We use the climate change ensemble and 10,000 year control run to examine ENSO behavior within the model under pre-industrial, historical, and future conditions, and we analyze the effect of anthropogenic forcing on key ENSO statistics. Results indicate that unforced internal variability is a major contributor to ENSO variability, while anthropogenic forcing plays a secondary role.",

            "abstract": "Field and laboratory observations indicate that bedload transport frequently exhibits clockwise hysteresis. Several grain-scale mechanisms could account for this, including increases in the median surface particle size, development of stable particle arrangements on the bed surface, or reductions in the sediment supply. Alternatively, bedload hysteresis at steady flow could occur if the bed configuration stabilizes as bedforms approach a configuration that is in quasi-equilibrium with prevailing hydraulic conditions. The roles of bedform development and changes in coarse sediment availability as potential causes of hysteresis are investigated with a unique dataset obtained during a high flow release in the Trinity River, a regulated gravel-bed river in California. Physical bedload samples were obtained over the release hydrograph along with continuous seismic monitoring with 3-component broadband seismometers at four locations along the river. At one location, changes in bed topography during the peak of the release were monitored with repeated multibeam sonar surveys over a channel length of about 1 km. In addition, a network of 80 vertical-component seismometers was deployed adjacent to the channel to support development of a time series of maps showing local variations in seismic energy production on the stream bed. Finally, a gravel augmentation operation was being implemented at the upstream end of the reach during the release peak, permitting evaluation of how changes in sediment supply affect downstream transport rates. Sampled bedload transport rates were found to increase briefly during gravel augmentation operations, but return to pre-augmentation levels within a few hours after augmentation activities stop and generally decline over a period of peak flow lasting about 3 days. The sonar data indicate that most of the topographic change observed during the peak flow period occurred in the first several hours of the period, supporting the hypothesis that decreasing bedload transport rates in the latter part of the hydrograph peak correspond to the development of relatively stable bedforms. Seismic measurements were found to correspond well to temporal and spatial variation in bedload transport and bed deformation rates, as determined by the physical samples and sonar surveys.",

            "abstract": "Despite their high rates of long-term carbon (C) sequestration when compared to upland ecosystems, coastal C accounting is only recently receiving the attention of policy makers and carbon markets. Assessing accuracy and uncertainty in net C flux estimates requires both direct and derived measurements based on both short and long term dynamics in key drivers, particularly soil accretion rates and soil organic content. We are testing the ability of remote sensing products and national scale datasets to estimate biomass and soil stocks and fluxes over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. For example, the 2013 Wetlands Supplement to the 2006 IPCC GHG national inventory reporting guidelines requests information on development of Tier I-III reporting, which express increasing levels of detail. We report progress toward development of a Carbon Monitoring System for “blue carbon” that may be useful for IPCC reporting guidelines at Tier II levels. Our project uses a current dataset of publically available and contributed field-based measurements to validate models of changing soil C stocks, across a broad range of U.S. tidal wetland types and landuse conversions. Additionally, development of biomass algorithms for both radar and spectral datasets will be tested and used to determine the “price of precision” of different satellite products. We discuss progress in calculating Tier II estimates focusing on variation introduced by the different input datasets. These include the USFWS National Wetlands Inventory, NOAA Coastal Change Analysis Program, and combinations to calculate tidal wetland area. We also assess the use of different attributes and depths from the USDA-SSURGO database to map soil C density. Finally, we examine the relative benefit of radar, spectral and hybrid approaches to biomass mapping in tidal marshes and mangroves. While the US currently plans to report GHG emissions at a Tier I level, we argue that a Tier II analysis is possible due to national maps of wetland area and soil carbon, as well as sediment accretion and sea-level rise correlations and wetland area change data. The uncertainty analyses performed nationally and in six regionally-representative “sentinel sites” will be an important guide for future efforts towards more accurate and complete wetland C inventories.",

            "abstract": "Parameter inversion involves inferring the model parameter values based on sparse observations of some observables. To infer the posterior probability distributions of the parameters, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are typically used. However, the large number of forward simulations needed and limited computational resources limit the complexity of the hydrological model we can use in these methods. In view of this, we studied the implicit sampling (IS) method, an efficient importance sampling technique that generates samples in the high-probability region of the posterior distribution and thus reduces the number of forward simulations that we need to run. For a pilot-point inversion of a heterogeneous permeability field based on a synthetic ponded infiltration experiment simu­lated with TOUGH2 (a subsurface modeling code), we showed that IS with linear map provides an accurate Bayesian description of the parameterized permeability field at the pilot points with just approximately 500 forward simulations.\nWe further studied the use of surrogate models to improve the computational efficiency of parameter inversion. We implemented two reduced-order models (ROMs) for the TOUGH2 forward model. One is based on polynomial chaos expansion (PCE), of which the coefficients are obtained using the sparse Bayesian learning technique to mitigate the “curse of dimensionality” of the PCE terms. The other model is Gaussian process regression (GPR) for which different covariance, likelihood and inference models are considered. Preliminary results indicate that ROMs constructed based on the prior parameter space perform poorly. It is thus impractical to replace this hydrological model by a ROM directly in a MCMC method. However, the IS method can work with a ROM constructed for parameters in the close vicinity of the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimate. We will discuss the accuracy and computational efficiency of using ROMs in the implicit sampling procedure for the hydrological problem considered.\nThis work was supported, in part, by the U.S. Dept. of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC02-05CH11231",

The source of these multiple atmospheric pressure waves could have different origins. Among the physical mechanisms that could explain these behaviors are pulsating eruptions, the dynamics of shock waves, coupled pressure wave-supersonic jet interaction, or a combination of all these factors. In order to elucidate the causes of these complex fluid flow dynamics, a series of analog volcanic eruption experiments using an atmospheric shock tube were performed. During the testing, single and multiple pressure waves and the subsequent supersonic jet were generated. The controlled laboratory conditions enable studies of the most relevant variables potentially responsible for the formation of the multiple pressure waves. The tests were performed using dry, compressed nitrogen at standard room temperature that was free of particles. Yet, under this idealization of a real volcanic eruption, multiple pressure waves were observed on the high-speed video imaging and recorded on the pressure transducer. The amount of energy being released on each test was varied to achieve different discharge dynamics and the formation of single and multiple pressure waves. The preliminary experimental observations indicate a coupled pressure wave-jet interaction as source of multiple pressure waves.",

            "abstract": "In our experiments (at JPL, NASA) for DARPA Memex project, we wanted to crawl a large amount of data for various domains. A big challenge was data relevancy in the crawled data. More than 50% of the data was irrelevant to the domain at hand. One immediate solution was to use good seeds (seeds are the initial urls from where the program starts to crawl) and make sure that the crawl remains into the original host urls. This although a very efficient technique, fails under two conditions. One when you aim to reach deeper into the web; into new hosts (not in the seed list) and two when the website hosts myriad content types eg. a News website.\nThe relevancy calculation used to be a post processing step i.e. once we had finished crawling, we trained a NaiveBayes Classifier and used it to find a rough relevancy of the web pages that we had. Integrating the relevancy into the crawling rather than after it was very important because crawling takes resources and time. To save both we needed to get an idea of relevancy of the whole crawl during run time and be able to steer its course accordingly. We use Apache Nutch as the crawler, which uses a plugin system to incorporate any new implementations and hence we built a plugin for Nutch.\nThe Naive Bayes Parse Plugin works in the following way. It parses every page and decides, using a trained model (which is built in situ only once using the positive and negative examples given by the user in a very simple format), if it is relevant; If true, then it allows all the outlinks from that page to go to the next round of crawling; If not, then it gives the urls a second chance to prove themselves by checking some commonly expected words in the url relevant to that domain. This two tier system is very intuitive and efficient in focusing the crawl. In our initial test experiments over 100 seed urls, the results were astonishingly good with a recall of 98%.\nThe same technique can be applied to geo-informatics. This will help scientists gather data that is relevant to their specific domain. As a proof of concept we also crawled nsidc.org and some similar websites and were very efficiently able to keep the crawler from going into the hub websites like Yahoo, commercial/advertising portals and irrelevant content pages.\nIt is a strong start towards focused crawling using Nutch, one of the most scalable and ever evolving crawler available today.",

This work quantifies the urban water security of 108 large cities in the United States (n=50) and Africa (n=58) based on their hydrologic, hydraulic and institutional settings. Using publicly available data, urban water availability was estimated as the volume of water available from local water resources and those captured via hydraulic infrastructure (e.g. reservoirs, wellfields, aqueducts) while urban water institutions were assessed according to their ability to deliver, supply and regulate water resources to cities. When assessing availability, cities relying on local water resources comprised a minority (37%) of those assessed. The majority of cities (55%) instead rely on captured water to meet urban demands, with African cities reaching farther and accessing a greater number and variety of sources for water supply than US cities. Cities using captured water generally had poorer access to local water resources and maintained significantly more complex strategies for water delivery, supply and regulatory management. Eight cities, all African, are identified in this work as having water insecurity issues. These cities lack sufficient infrastructure and institutional complexity to capture and deliver adequate amounts of water for urban use. Together, these findings highlight the important interconnection between infrastructure investments and management techniques for urban areas with a limited or dwindling natural abundance of water. Addressing water security challenges in the future will require that more attention be placed not only on increasing water availability, but on developing the institutional support to manage captured water supplies.",

In particular, the sensitivity of tropical rainforest ecosystems to eCO­2 is largely unknown even though the importance of tropical forests for biodiversity, carbon storage and regional and global climate feedbacks is unambiguously recognized. The AmazonFACE (Free-Air Carbon Enrichment) project will be the first ecosystem scale eCO2 experiment undertaken in the tropics, as well as the first to be undertaken in a mature forest. AmazonFACE provides the opportunity to integrate ecosystem modeling with experimental observations right from the beginning of the experiment, harboring a two-way exchange, i.e. models provide hypotheses to be tested, and observations deliver the crucial data to test and improve ecosystem models. We present preliminary exploration of observed and expected process responses to eCO2 at the AmazonFACE site from the dynamic global vegetation model LPJ-GUESS, highlighting opportunities and pitfalls for model integration of tropical FACE experiments. The preliminary analysis provides baseline hypotheses, which are to be further developed with a follow-up multiple model inter-comparison. The analysis builds on the recently undertaken FACE-MDS (Model-Data Synthesis) project, which was applied to two temperate FACE experiments and exceeds the traditional focus on comparing modeled end-target output. The approach has proven successful in identifying well (and less well) represented processes in models, which are separated for six clusters also here; (1) Carbon fluxes, (2) Carbon pools, (3) Energy balance, (4) Hydrology, (5) Nutrient cycling, and (6) Population dynamics. Simulation performance of observed conditions at the AmazonFACE site (a.o. from Manaus K34 eddy flux tower) will highlight process-based model deficiencies, and aid the separation of uncertainties arising from general ecosystem responses and those responses related to eCO2.",

The GPM precipitation Level II (active and passive) and Level III (IMERG) estimates are compared to the NEXRAD-based precipitation estimates derived from NOAA/NSSL’s Multi-Radar, Multi-Sensor (MRMS) platform. The NEXRAD network has undergone an upgrade in technology with dual-polarization capabilities and the MRMS products, after having been adjusted by rain gauges and passing several quality controls and filtering procedures, are 1) accurate with known uncertainty bounds and 2) measured at a resolution below the pixel sizes any GPM estimates. They are used by a number of NASA investigators to evaluate Level II and Level III satellite precipitation algorithms.\nA comparison framework was developed to examine the consistency of the ground and space-based sensors in term of precipitation detection, typology (e.g. convective, stratiform) and quantification. At the Level II precipitation features are introduced to analyze satellite estimates under various precipitation processes. Specific factors for passive (e.g. surface conditions for GMI) and active (e.g. attenuation of the radar signal, non uniform beam filling for DPR) sensors are investigated. Prognostic analysis directly provides feedback to algorithm developers on how to improve the satellite estimates. Comparison with TRMM products serves as a benchmark to evaluate GPM precipitation estimates. A the Level III the contribution of Level II is explicitly characterized and a rigorous characterization is performed to migrate across scales fully understanding the propagation of errors. This cross products characterization acts as a bridge to intercalibrate microwave measurements from the GPM constellation satellites and propagate to the combined and global precipitation estimates.

This is because in addition to the uncertainties associated with climate projections, it is difficult to anticipate how farmers will respond to climatic change or to economic and policy incentives. Some sophisticated decision support systems available to water managers consider farmers’ adaptive behavior but they are data intensive and difficult to apply operationally over large regions. Satellite-based observational technologies, in conjunction with models and assimilation methods, create an opportunity for new, cost-effective analysis tools to support policy and decision-making over large spatial extents at seasonal scales.\nWe present an integrated modeling framework that can be driven by satellite remote sensing to enable robust regional assessment and prediction of climatic and policy impacts on agricultural production, water resources, and management decisions. The core of this framework is a widely used model of agricultural production and resource allocation adapted to be used in conjunction with remote sensing inputs to quantify the amount of land and water farmers allocate for each crop they choose to grow on a seasonal basis in response to reduced or enhanced access to water due to climatic or policy restrictions. A recursive Bayesian update method is used to adjust the model parameters by assimilating information on crop acreage, production, and crop evapotranspiration as a proxy for water use that can be estimated from high spatial resolution satellite remote sensing. The data assimilation framework blends new and old information to avoid over-calibration to the specific conditions of a single year and permits the updating of parameters to track gradual changes in the agricultural system.\nThis integrated framework provides an operational means of monitoring and forecasting what crops will be grown and how farmers will allocate land and water under expected adverse conditions, and the resulting consequences for other water users. The Bayesian update framework constitutes an efficient method for the identification of the production function parameters and provides valuable information on the associated uncertainty of the forecasts.

            "abstract": "There is a large difference in the footprints over which remote sensing instruments, such as the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, retrieve soil moisture and that of in situ networks. Therefore a method for upscaling in situ measurements is required before they can be used to validate remote sensing instruments. The upscaling problem is made more difficult when measurements are sparse and irregularly spaced within the footprint. To address these needs, we have developed a method for producing upscaled estimates of soil moisture based on a network of in situ soil moisture measurements and airborne P-band SAR data, and utilizing a Random Forests-based regression algorithm. Sites within the SoilSCAPE network, for which the technique was developed, typically contains sensors at ~30 locations, with each location sampled at multiple depths. Measurements are taken at 20 minute intervals and averaged over a selectable time interval, thereby supporting near-real time generation of soil moisture maps. The collected measurements are automatically uploaded to a central database from which they can be accessed for use in the regression algorithm. Our regression-based approach works well with irregularly-spaced sensors by incorporating a set of data layers that correlate well with soil moisture. The layers include thematic land cover, elevation, slope, aspect, flow accumulation, clay fraction, air temperature, precipitation, and P-Band HH, VV, and HV backscatter. Values from these data layers are extracted for each sensor location and applied to train the Random Forests algorithm. The decision trees generated are then applied to estimate soil moisture at a 100 m spacing throughout the network region, after which the evenly-spaced values are averaged to accord with the 3-, 9-, and 36-km SMAP measurement grids. The resulting set of near-real time soil moisture estimates suitable for SMAP calibration and validation is placed online for use by the SMAP Cal/Val team. Accuracy of the algorithm has been verified against three independent soil moisture sensors from Oregon State University, with RMS errors ranging from 0.034 to 0.063 volumetric soil moisture.",

These particles slowly migrate inward due to Poynting - Robertson drag and their spatial distribution is shaped by mean motion resonances with the gas giant planets in the outer solar system. The expected mass influx into Pluto's atmosphere is on the order of 50 kg/day, and the arrival speed of the incoming particles is on the order of 3 - 4 km/s. We have followed the ablation history as function of speed and size of dust particles in Pluto’s atmosphere, and found that, if the particles are rich in volatiles, they can fully sublimate due to drag heating and deposit their mass in a narrow layer. This deposition might promote the formation of the haze layers observed by the New Horizons spacecraft. This talk will explore the constraints on the composition of the dust particles, as well as on our newly developed models of Pluto’s atmosphere that can be learned by matching the altitude where haze layers could be formed.",

The results, supported by Raman lidar measurements at Eureka and Ny Alesund, show degrees of similarity as well as differences that help to understand the quality of cloud-screened, starphotometry optical depths and the AOD / cloud discrimination performance of integrated CALIOP backscatter profiles (in the presence of very challenging statistical sampling constraints) as well as the quality of model predictions in a region and a time period of rare, model evaluation opportunities. The comparisons also help to understand the role of different types of aerosols (predominantly sub-micron) at these high Arctic sites and how one can prepare for the development of long-term, Polar-winter AOD climatologies.",

Several modeling techniques have been implemented to date, but none can be used as a general strategy for all porous media applications due to challenges presented by non-smooth high-curvature and deformable solid surfaces, and by a wide range of pore sizes, porosities and thicknesses.\nRecently, we have developed a new micro-scale modeling technique, Pore Topology Method (PTM), to simulate multiphase flow in porous media. The core of PTM is to reduce the complexity of the 3-D void space geometry by working with its medial surface as the solution domain; hence, provides a simple, topologically consistent and fast methodology to simulate multi-phase flow in porous materials. To validate PTM, we implemented a simplified version to simulated quasi-static drainage/imbibition and to compute absolute permeability for a set of isotropic fibrous materials with 25-95% porosities. The results were in excellent agreement with those of currently available numerical approaches. Our current efforts are focused on employing more sophisticated assumptions in quasi-static simulation, and including the solid matrix swelling in PTM simulation.",

Our goal is to compile statistics on recent ice flow velocities and surface elevation change rates near the fronts of all available glaciers using literature and our own data sets of the Russian Arctic, Patagonia, Alaska, Greenland and Antarctica, the Himalayas, and other locations. We quantify the percentage of the glaciers on the planet that can be regarded as fast flowing glaciers, with surface velocities of more than 50 meters per year, while also recording glaciers that have elevation change rates of more than 2 meters per year. We examine whether glaciers have significant interannual variations in velocities, or have accelerated or stagnated where time series of ice motions are available. We use glacier boundaries and identifiers from the Randolph Glacier Inventory. Our survey highlights glaciers that are likely to react quickly to changes in their mass accumulation rates. The study also identifies geographical areas where our knowledge of glacier dynamics remains poor.\nOur survey helps guide how frequently observations must be made in order to provide quality satellite-derived velocity and ice elevation observations at a variety of glacier thermal regimes, speeds and widths. Our objectives are to determine to what extent the joint NASA and Indian Space Research Organization Synthetic Aperture Radar mission (NISAR) will be able to provide global precision coverage of ice speed changes and to determine how to optimize observations from the global constellation of satellite missions to record important changes to glacier elevations and velocities worldwide.",

            "abstract": "Active margins are particularly efficient in the burial of organic carbon due to the close proximity of highland sources to marine sediment sinks and high sediment transport rates. Compared with passive margins, active margins are dominated by small mountainous river systems, and play a unique role in marine and global carbon cycles. Small mountainous rivers drain only approximately 20% of land, but deliver approximately 40% of the fluvial sediment to the global ocean. Unlike large passive margin systems where riverine organic carbon is efficiently incinerated on continental shelves, small mountainous river dominated systems are highly effective in the burial and preservation of organic carbon due to the rapid and episodic delivery of organic carbon sourced from vegetation, soil, and rock.\n\nTo investigate the erosion, transport, and burial of organic carbon in active margin small mountainous river systems we use the Waipaoa River, New Zealand. The Waipaoa River, and adjacent marine depositional environment, is a system of interest due to a large sediment yield (6800 tons km-2 yr-1) and extensive characterization. Previous studies have considered the biogeochemistry of the watershed and tracked the transport of terrestrially derived sediment and organics to the continental shelf and slope by biogeochemical proxies including stable carbon isotopes, lignin phenols, n-alkanes, and n-fatty acids. In this work we expand the spatial extent of investigation to include deep sea sediments of the Hikurangi Trough. Located in approximately 3000 m water depth 120 km from the mouth of the Waipaoa River, the Hikurangi Trough is the southern extension of the Tonga-Kermadec-Hikurangi subduction system. Piston core sediments collected by the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA, NZ) in the Hikurangi Trough indicate the presence of terrestrially derived material (lignin phenols), and suggest a continuum of deposition, resuspension, and transport across the margin. Based on tephra beds identified within the sediments, this material was likely transported by a series of turbidite events, delivered to the Hikurangi Trough through Poverty Canyon.",

            "abstract": "Zonally asymmetric circulations maintain an intense hydrologic contrast between monsoon regions and drylands in the present climate of Earth’s subtropics. Simulations of 21st century global warming scenarios suggest that zonal contrasts in subtropical precipitation and surface evapotranspiration will increase during local summer, especially over land. Part of this projected change is associated with substantial variations in the zonally asymmetric vertical mass flux. Yet despite the clear importance of zonally asymmetric circulations in the hydrological cycle and its variations, existing theories for hydrological change are focused strongly on the zonal mean. A comprehensive understanding of zonally asymmetric tropical and subtropical circulations and their contribution to the hydrologic cycle remains elusive. Furthermore, simulations of 21st century climate exhibit little quantitative agreement on the magnitude of subtropical hydrological changes.\nHere, we suggest a novel mechanism to explain projected changes in the strength of zonally asymmetric circulations with global warming. Using an analytical convective quasiequilibrium, first-baroclinic mode framework, we relate changes in the vertical structure of the circulation to tropopause height and to the land-ocean contrast in near-surface moist entropy. In this framework, an increase in tropopause height strengthens zonally asymmetric circulations as climate warms, while the land-ocean contrast in entropy may weaken or strengthen those circulations depending on surface properties. We first demonstrate the relevance of this mechanism over a wide range of climates using an idealized moist GCM. We then use this mechanism to quantify the influence of changes in tropopause height and near-surface thermal properties on changes in zonally asymmetric circulations in CMIP5 simulations of next-century climate.",

            "abstract": "The marine ecosystem of the Paleocene was disturbed by several transient warming events. One of these is the Latest Danian Event (LDE aka “Top C27n Event”). In deep-sea records the LDE is usually characterized by two distinctive XRF Fe peaks, paralleled by a ~0.7 ‰ negative δ13C excursion (prev. publ.). Here we present new stable isotope and faunal datasets from planktic foraminifera representing three ocean basins: The Pacific is covered by ODP Site 1210, the South Atlantic by ODP Site 1262 and the North Atlantic by IODP Site U1407. We compare the generated datasets in aspects of biotic response (planktic foraminifera), carbonate preservation as well as δ18O and δ13C signals of surface, subsurface and benthic taxa covering a time span of 900 kyr around the event to figure out to what extent the LDE influenced oceans and biota.\nAt Site 1210 a drop in planktic and benthic δ18O record suggest a temperature rise of ~2.5°C within 100 ky which is on the same scale as the benthic δ18O shift at 1209 (prev. publ.) suggesting the LDE to be a further potential Paleocene hyperthermal. Multivariate statistics imply distinct faunal changes starting below the LDE. A different assemblage after the event was observed specifically in photosymbiont-bearing taxa including the disappearance of Praemurica spp. and the strong increase of Igorina albeari . Minor dissolution is considered to be present during the LDE according to enhanced test fragmentation and decreased CaCO3 and planktic foraminifera test abundance. A rising δ13C gradient between surface and subsurface dwelling foraminifera suggests sudden increased stratification of the upper water column ~100 ky below the LDE, strongly enhanced during it and less but still high above it. This might include a shallower thermocline and be linked to the development of a deep-chlorophyll maximum.\nFaunal assemblages of 1262 show a similar development with an overall higher abundance of subsurface dwellers. Multivariate statistisc hint towards a change of the community during and after the LDE in contrast to Site 1210. Benthic δ18O and δ13C reflect the two Fe peaks and imply a ~2.8°C bottom water warming. Bulk-rock δ13C trends of U1407 are comparable to the other sites, the CaCO3 record shows strong response to the event, but a distinct lithological expression of the LDE is not apparent.",

These studies have produced a wealth of detailed data on key processes driving these cycles. In parallel, sophisticated models of these processes have been formulated to answer a variety of questions relevant to natural resource management. Recent advances in data assimilation techniques offer exciting new possibilities to combine this wealth of ecosystem data with process models of ecosystem function to improve prediction and quantify associated uncertainty. Using forests of the southeastern United States as our focus, we will specify how fine-scale physiological (e.g. half-hourly sap flux) can be scaled up with quantified error for use in models of stand growth and hydrology. This approach represents an opportunity to leverage current and past research from experiments including throughfall displacement × fertilization (PINEMAP), irrigation × fertilization (SETRES), elevated CO­2­ (Duke and ORNL FACE) and a variety of observational studies in both conifer and hardwood forests throughout the region, using a common platform for data assimilation and prediction. As part of this discussion, we will address variation in dominant species, stand structure, site age, management practices, soils and climate that represent both challenges to the development of a common analytical approach and opportunities to address questions of interest to policy makers and natural resource managers.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_poster_scaled.pdf\nTimber harvest practices have a long-standing association with changes in water and sediment yields. We quantify the trends in water and sediment yields in the Mica Creek Experimental Watershed (MCEW) in relation to management practices with linear regression and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). From 1991 to 2013, an increase in water yield resulted from both clearcutting and thinning treatments, with monthly water yield rate increases of 13-57% and annual water yield increases up to 210 mm (40%) in the clearcut watershed. Following treatment, annual sediment yields increased in the clearcut watershed by 40-131% and the thinned watershed by 33-163%, both relative to the control watershed, with statistically-significant monthly load increases in the year immediately following treatment. Water and sediment yield changes do not follow the same post-treatment patterns. Water yields increased immediately following treatment and, over time, gradually dropped towards pre-harvest levels. Annual sediment yields increased in some years after the harvest, but in some cases the increase was years after treatment. Monthly sediment yields increased in the first year following the clearcut harvest, but elevated monthly loads following the partial cut harvest came years later. Hence, we investigate the changes in sediment yield through an examination of water yield and sediment concentration and in response to events. We test the sensitivity of our results to different methods for computing sediment yields based on total suspended solids concentration and continuous discharge measurements. Flow-weighted sediment yield averaged 24% higher than sediment yield computed from linear-interpolated total suspended solids concentration values. During typical summer and fall conditions, flow-weighting was found to overweight storm measurements and produce large sediment yield estimates. Further work is suggested to test methods of calculating monthly sediment yields with irregularly-spaced sediment concentration data.",

            "abstract": "Given that streamflow response at the watershed outlet is a function of soil moisture and groundwater dynamics within the watershed, it is reasonable to hypothesize that observations of groundwater and soil moisture can be used to estimate event streamflow. We investigate this hypothesis by using spatially-distributed groundwater and soil moisture time series generated by a physics-based hydrologic model, PIHM. In the absence of data from an intensely observed real watershed, the simulated time series are considered as a surrogate for observed data in this analyses. Next, we identify the optimal locations for groundwater and soil moisture observation for estimating the magnitude of quickflow events. Results indicate that even in a large watershed with heterogeneous land cover and soil properties, nearly 90% of the variance in event quickflow can be explained with measurements of antecedent and in-event soil conditions.  Close examination of the identified sites show that soil properties and topography of the modeled system allows for general, practical rules to enhance the accuracy of streamflow estimation via groundwater wells and soil moisture sensors. The experiment also demonstrates that the problem of sensor placement, typically cast as a combinatorial optimization is easily tractable in practice via a combination of evolutionary optimization and random sampling.

            "abstract": "The Korean Peninsular has unique agricultural environments due to the differences in the political and socio-economical systems between the Republic of Korea (SK, hereafter) and the Democratic Peoples’ Republic of Korea (NK, hereafter). NK has been suffering from the lack of food supplies caused by natural disasters, land degradation and failed political system. The neighboring developed country SK has a better agricultural system but very low food self-sufficiency rate (around 1% of maize). Maize is an important crop in both countries since it is staple food for NK and SK is No. 2 maize importing country in the world after Japan. Therefore evaluating maize yield potential (Yp) in the two distinct regions is essential to assess food security under climate change and variability.\nIn this study, we have utilized multiple process-based crop models capable of regional-scale assessments to evaluate maize Yp over the Korean Peninsula – the GIS version of EPIC model (GEPIC) and APSIM model that can be expanded to regional scales (APSIM regions). First we evaluated model performance and skill for 20 years from 1991 to 2010 using reanalysis data (Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System (LDAPS); 1.5km resolution) and observed data. Each model’s performances were compared over different regions within the Korean Peninsula of different regional climate characteristics. To quantify the major influence of individual climate variables, we also conducted a sensitivity test using 20 years of climatology. Lastly, a multi-model ensemble analysis was performed to reduce crop model uncertainties. The results will provide valuable information for estimating the climate change or variability impacts on Yp over the Korean Peninsula.",

            "abstract": "Paleolake basins on Mars have long been studied in an attempt to further understand the hydrology and climate conditions of the ancient martian surface. While the formation of these lacustrine features is evident, the timescale over which they were active and the magnitude of related fluvial activity remains uncertain. The most convincing evidence of paleolake activity comes from hydrologically open basins, or open-basin lakes, that have an outlet valley breaching the basin confining topography, commonly a crater rim. This observation requires that the basin filled completely with standing water before overtopping and incising the outlet valley. The total amount of incision for a given outlet valley is ultimately controlled by a variety of factors, including the susceptibility of the crust to erosion, the topography and hydrology (e.g., gradient, base level) of the terrain exterior to the breach, the magnitude of flooding caused by the initial overtopping of the crater rim, the rate of outflow from the lake once it has reached an equilibrium level following catastrophic breaching, and the duration of time over which the basin contained a hydrologically open lake.\nHere we present morphometric analyses of the outlet valleys of 20 open-basin lakes on Mars to help further understand ancient martian paleolake activity. We measured the outlet valley depth of incision as compared to the estimated pre-breach topography, as well as the breach width using CTX stereo-derived digital elevation models. Results from basins with different morphometric parameters (e.g., area, mean depth, volume) are compared to one another to assess any systematic relationship(s) between outlet valley morphometry and paleolake basin morphometry. We also examine these lakes in the context of their broader hydrological setting, and consider how our results compare to terrestrial analogs for the process of crater rim breaching. In particular, we examine the process of catastrophic breaching of natural earthen dams, which we suggest provides the best terrestrial analog to the process of breaching an outlet valley for a crater lake.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol play crucial role in earth’s radiative budget by scattering and absorbing solar radiation. The impact of aerosol on radiation budget depend on several factors including single scattering albedo (SSA), composition, and the growth processes, like coating or mixing.\nWe describe findings relevant to optical properties of aerosol characterized over the Cape Cod and nearby northwest Atlantic Ocean during the Two Column Aerosol Project (TCAP) during the summer (July 2012) and winter (February 2013) campaigns. The average single scattering albedo (SSA) shows distinctly different vertical profiles during the summer and winter periods. During the summer study period, the average SSA is greater than 0.95 near surface, it increases to 0.97 until an altitude of 2.5 km, and then decreases to 0.94 at top of the column near 4 km. In contrast, during the winter study period the average SSA is less than 0.93 and decreases with height reaching an average value of 0.87 near the top of the column. The large difference in summer and winter time SSA is linked to the presence of biomass burning (BB) aerosol rather than black carbon or soot in both seasons. In our study, the BB on average is factor of two higher in free troposphere (FT) during summer and more than a factor of two higher in the boundary layer during winter. Single particle analysis indicates that the average profiles of refractory black carbon (rBC) mass are similar in both seasons. The average rBC size are similar at all altitudes sampled (0-4 km) in summer time but different during winter time. In addition, the particles sampled in the summertime FT appear to be more aged than those seen during winter. The observed large heterogeneity in SSA and its links to the particle coating and composition highlights the importance of aging and mixing processes of aerosol in this region and represents a challenge for both regional and global scale models.",

            "abstract": "To investigate the ion-neutral coupling that creates the global electrical daytime “dynamo” currents in the mid-latitude, lower ionosphere, NASA carried out two multiple sounding rocket experiments from Wallops Island, VA on July 10, 2011 (14:00 UT, 10:00 LT) and July 4, 2013 (14:31 UT, 10:31 LT). The rockets were launched in the presence of well-defined, westward Hall currents observed on the ground with ΔH values of ­–25 nT and –30 nT, respectively, as well as a well-defined, daytime ionospheric density observed by the VIPIR ionosonde at Wallops. During the 2011 experiment, a narrow, intense sporadic-E layer was observed near 102 km. Each experiment consisted of a pair of rockets launched 15 sec apart. The first rocket of each pair carried instruments to measure DC electric and magnetic fields, as well as the ambient plasma and neutral gases and attained apogees of 158 km and 135 km in the 2011 and 2013 experiments, respectively. The second rocket of each pair carried canisters which released a lithium vapor trail along the upleg to illuminate neutral winds in the upper atmosphere. This daytime vapor trail technology was developed jointly by researchers at JAXA and Clemson University. In the second experiment, the lithium release was clearly visible in cameras with infrared filters operated by US and Japanese researchers in a NASA airplane at 9.6 km altitude. The observed wind profiles reached speeds of 100 m/s with strong shears with respect to altitude and were consistent with an independent derivation of the wind from the ionization gauge sensor suite on the instrumented rocket. The “vapor trail” rockets, which also included a falling sphere, attained apogees of 150 km and 143 km in the 2011 and 2013 experiments, respectively.\nBy measuring the current density, conductivity, DC electric fields, and neutral winds, we solve the dynamo equation as a function of altitude, revealing the different contributions to the lower E-region currents. We find that the DC electric fields (~2 mV/m, peak) and neutral winds (~100 m/s, peak) are organized such that their contributions to the overall dynamo current largely cancel, leaving net current densities commensurate with those largely predicted by tidal theory. We discuss the implications of these measurements for our understanding of the daytime dynamo process.",

            "abstract": "Lithology is a widely recognized first-order control on chemical weathering rates of landscapes. This may help explain why topography often differs from one rock type to the next: If lithologic differences in weathering rates lead to variations in erosion rates, then they could be expressed in the landforms that characterize the topography. However, the linkages between lithology, chemical weathering, and topography have been hard to quantify from measurements in the field because it is difficult to isolate lithology from other factors that influence chemical weathering rates. To overcome this limitation, we conducted a controlled laboratory study of weathering of granitoid rocks sampled from the Laramie Range, Wyoming. The topography surrounding our sampling sites is bimodal, with gently sloped, deeply weathered surfaces juxtaposed by tall, weathering-resistant tors. Although granitoid bedrock underlies both modes of topography, differences in mafic mineral content are big enough in some areas to explain the bimodality in landscape form, allowing us to explore the possibility of lithologic control on weathering and its implications for topography. We conducted through-flow reactor experiments on three granitoids with mafic mineral content ranging from 7 to 36% by volume. Six reactors were loaded with crushed rock (two replicates each) for gravity-fed, passive flow experiments conducted over six months. We found Ca, K, and SO4 dominate the elemental outputs of weathering measured in effluent from all three granitoids. For most elements, flux from the reactors increases rapidly, peaks at ~30 days, then declines gradually. However solute yield varies in magnitude with overall mafic content; mafic-rich rock produced more solutes than either of the mafic-poor rocks, especially for Ca (5–6 times greater) and SO4 (11–17 times greater). Here we discuss our results and the connections between lithology, chemical weathering, and topography within granitoids of the Laramie Range.",

The Nankai Trough subduction zone, to the southwest of the area affected by the Tōhoku disaster and facing the densely populated and heavily industrialized southern coastline of central and west Japan, is expected to generate another megathrust earthquake and tsunami in the near future. This subduction zone is, however, segmented and appears to be characterized by a variable rupture mode, involving single- as well as multi-segment ruptures, which has immediate implications for their tsunamigenic potential, and also renders the collection of sufficiently long time records of past earthquakes and tsunami in this region fundamental for an adequate hazard and risk assessment.\nOver the past three decades, Japanese researchers have acquired a large amount of geological evidence of past earthquakes and tsunami, in many cases extending back in time for several thousands of years. This evidence includes uplifted marine terraces, turbidites, liquefaction features, subsided marshes and tsunami deposits in coastal lakes and lowlands. Despite these efforts, current understanding of the behaviour of the subduction zone still remains limited, due to site-specific evidence creation and preservation thresholds and issues over alternative hypotheses for proposed palaeoseismic evidence and insufficiently precise chronological control.\nWithin the QuakeRecNankai project we are generating a long and coherent time series of megathrust earthquake and tsunami recurrences along the Nankai Trough subduction zone by integrating all existing evidence with new geological records of paleo-tsunami in the Lake Hamana region and of paleo-earthquakes from selected lakes in the Mount Fuji area. We combine extensive fieldwork in coastal plain areas and lakes, with advanced sedimentological and geochemical analyses and innovative dating techniques.",

            "abstract": "As scientists we are often encouraged to describe our research in terms of its “broader impacts” – to link our results to a tangible action or change outside of our scientific discipline. Although writing these goals in a proposal is simple, actually executing the proposed “broader impacts” is often more complicated. This presentation will briefly describe several international and domestic experiences that sought to utilize scientific research to inform pressing policy decisions related to water management. The lessons draw from ongoing efforts to improve transboundary groundwater collaboration in the Middle East, mitigate the impact of glacial lake outburst floods in high mountain regions, and prompt a political response to the California drought and groundwater depletion. As current initiatives at the science-policy interface, key challenges and ideas for improvement will be discussed, particularly: effective, concise communication of scientific data, awareness of broader political/economic contexts, and long-term trust building with decision-makers. Finally, this presentation will highlight several opportunities and suggestions to promote graduate students' involvement in these activities and to build skills at the science-policy interface.",

            "abstract": "Maintaining software compatibility across new computing environments and the associated underlying hardware is a common problem for software engineers and scientific programmers. While traditional software engineering provides a suite of tools and methodologies which may mitigate this issue, they are typically ignored by developers lacking a background in software engineering. Causing further problems, these methodologies are best applied at the start of project; trying to apply them to an existing, mature project can require an immense effort. Visualization software is particularly vulnerable to this problem, given the inherent dependency on particular graphics hardware and software API's. As a result of these issues, there exists a large body of software which is simultaneously critical to the scientists who are dependent upon it, and yet increasingly difficult to maintain.\nThe solution to this problem was partially provided with the advent of Cloud Computing; Application Streaming. This technology allows a program to run entirely on a remote virtual machine while still allowing for interactivity and dynamic visualizations, with little-to-no re-engineering required. When coupled with containerization technology such as Docker, we are able to easily bring the same visualization software to a desktop, a netbook, a smartphone, and the next generation of hardware, whatever it may be.\nUnidata has been able to harness Application Streaming to provide a tablet-compatible version of our visualization software, the Integrated Data Viewer (IDV). This work will examine the challenges associated with adapting the IDV to an application streaming platform, and include a brief discussion of the underlying technologies involved.",

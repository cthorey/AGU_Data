            "abstract": "During the past four years, the number of earthquakes with magnitudes greater than three has substantially increased in the southern section of Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). While some of these events are likely associated with tectonic forces, especially along the foothills of the Canadian Rockies, a significant fraction occurred in previously quiescent regions and has been linked to waste water disposal or hydraulic fracturing. A proper assessment of the origin and source properties of these ‘induced earthquakes’ requires careful analyses and modeling of regional broadband data, which steadily improved during the past 8 years due to recent establishments of regional broadband seismic networks such as CRANE, RAVEN and TD. Several earthquakes, especially those close to fracking activities (e.g. Fox creek town, Alberta) are analyzed. Our preliminary full moment tensor inversion results show maximum horizontal compressional orientations (P-axis) along the northeast-southwest orientation, which agree with the regional stress directions from borehole breakout data and the P-axis of historical events. The decomposition of those moment tensors shows evidence of strike-slip mechanism with near vertical fault plane solutions, which are comparable to the focal mechanisms of injection induced earthquakes in Oklahoma. Minimal isotropic components have been observed, while a modest percentage of compensated-linear-vector-dipole (CLVD) components, which have been linked to fluid migraition, may be required to match the waveforms. To further evaluate the non-double-couple components, we compare the outcomes of full, deviatoric and pure double couple (DC) inversions using multiple frequency ranges and phases. Improved location and depth information from a novel grid search greatly assists the identification and classification of earthquakes in potential connection with fluid injection or extraction. Overall, a systematic comparison of the source attributes of intermediate-sized earthquakes present a new window into the nature of potentially induced earthquakes in the WCSB.",

            "abstract": "Following the SAM experiment aboard the Curiosity rover, the Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer (MOMA) experiment aboard the 2018 ExoMars mission will be the continuation of the search for organic matter on the Mars surface. One advancement with the ExoMars mission is that the sample will be extracted as deep as 2 meters below the Martian surface to minimize effects of radiation and oxidation on organic materials. To analyze the wide range of organic composition (volatile and non-volatile compounds) of the Martian soil, MOMA is equipped with a dual ion source ion trap mass spectrometer utilizing UV laser desorption / ionization (LDI) and pyrolysis gas chromatography (pyr-GC). In order to analyze refractory organic compounds and chiral molecules during GC-ITMS analysis, samples may be submitted to a derivatization process, consisting of the reaction of the sample components with specific reactants (MTBSTFA [1], DMF-DMA [2] or TMAH [3]).\nPrevious experimental reports have focused on coupling campaigns between the breadboard versions of the GC, provided by the French team (LISA, LATMOS, CentraleSupelec), and the MS, provided by the US team (NASA-GSFC). This work focuses on the performance verification and optimization of the GC-ITMS experiment using the Engineering Test Unit (ETU) models which are representative of the form, fit and function of the flight instrument including a flight-like pyrolysis oven and tapping station providing by the German team (MPS). The results obtained demonstrate the current status of the end-to-end performance of the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry mode of operation.\n",

            "abstract": "Rapid progression of ocean acidification is a threat to key organisms of the Southern Ocean ecosystem. While the severity of ocean acidification impacts is mainly determined by the duration, intensity, and spatial extent of low aragonite or calcite saturation state events, little is known about the nature of these events, their evolving attributes, and the timing of their onset. Using output of historical and RCP 8.5 simulations from ten Earth System Models from CMIP5, we found that aragonite undersaturation, which decreases the calcification rate of pteropods and causes dissolution of their aragonitic shell, will spread rapidly after 2035, covering 70 % of the Southern Ocean surface waters by 2095. Surface aragonite undersaturation events will last for about 5 months in areas south of 60°S by 2055, and for more than 8 months by the end of the century. Overall, the duration of these events increases from 1 month to more than 6 months within fewer than 20 years in >75 % of the affected area. This abrupt change in exposure duration to unfavorable conditions may be too fast for pteropods to adapt, as these chemical changes will occur within just a few generations. As a result of two month-long calcite undersaturation events projected for the end of this century, even organisms built of the more stable calcium carbonate mineral calcite will face prolonged chemical dissolution. The threat of ocean acidification to the Southern Ocean ecosystem may be more imminent than previously thought, and may spread quickly to the southern tips of New Zealand, South America, and South Africa, with potentially far-reaching consequences to fisheries, local economies, and livelihoods.",

            "abstract": "A quantum sensor measures photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, in µmol of photons m-2 s-1) in the 400 nm to 700 nm waveband. Plants utilize this radiation to drive photosynthesis, though individual plant responses to incident radiation may vary within this range. The new quantum sensor (model LI-190R, LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE), with an optical filter and silicon photodiode detector housed in a cosine-corrected head, is designed to provide a better response to incident radiation across the 400-700 nm range. The new design is expected to significantly improve spectral response due to uniformity across the PAR waveband, but particularly in the wavebands from 520 nm to 600 nm and 665 nm to 680 nm, and sharp cutoffs in the regions below and above the PAR waveband. Special care was taken to make sure that PAR sensor would not substantially respond to incident radiation above the 700 nm threshold because this can lead to errors when performing measurements in environments with a large proportion of near-infrared radiation, such as canopy understory. The physical housing of the sensor is designed to be weather-resistant, to effectively shed precipitation, provide protection at high temperature and high humidity conditions, and has a cosine-corrected response to 82° zenith angle. The latter is particularly important when measuring incident radiation at low elevation angles, diffuse light, or low light conditions. This presentation describes the principles of the new design, and shows the performance results from field experiments and laboratory tests.",

            "abstract": "Wide-spread and severe geomagnetic storms are primarily caused by the\nejecta of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that impose long durations of\nstrong southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) on the\nmagnetosphere, the duration and magnitude of the southward IMF ($B_s$)\nbeing the main determinants of geoeffectiveness. Another important\nquantity to forecast is the arrival time of the expected geoeffective\nCME ejecta. In order to accurately forecast these quantities in a\ntimely manner (say, 24--48 hours of advance warning time), it is\nnecessary to calculate the evolving CME ejecta---its structure and\nmagnetic field vector in three dimensions---using remote sensing solar\ndata alone. We discuss a method based on the validated erupting flux\nrope (EFR) model of CME dynamics. It has been shown using STEREO data\nthat the model can calculate the correct size, magnetic field, and the\nplasma parameters of a CME ejecta detected at 1 AU, using the observed\nCME position-time data alone as input (Kunkel and Chen 2010). One\ndisparity is in the arrival time, which is attributed to the\nsimplified geometry of circular toroidal axis of the CME flux rope.\nAccordingly, the model has been extended to self-consistently include\nthe transverse expansion of the flux rope (Kunkel 2012; Kunkel and\nChen 2015). We show that the extended formulation provides a better\nprediction of arrival time even if the CME apex does not propagate\ndirectly toward the earth. We apply the new method to a number of CME\nevents and compare predicted flux ropes at 1 AU to the observed ejecta\nstructures inferred from in situ magnetic and plasma data. The EFR\nmodel also predicts the asymptotic ambient solar wind speed ($V_{sw}$) for\neach event, which has not been validated yet. The predicted Vsw\nvalues are tested using the ENLIL model. We discuss the minimum and\nsufficient required input data for an operational forecasting system\nfor predicting the drivers of large geomagnetic storms.\nKunkel, V., and Chen, J., ApJ Lett, 715, L80, 2010.\nKunkel, V., PhD thesis, George Mason University, 2012.\nKunkel, V., and Chen, J., ApJ, submitted, 2015.\nWork supported by the Naval Research Laboratory Base Research Program",

            "abstract": "Opportunities for carbon sequestration are an important consideration in developing policies to manage the mass balance of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Assessments of potential carbon sequestration, like other resource assessments, should be widely accepted within the scientific community and broadly applicable to public needs over a range of spatial and temporal scales. The essential public concern regarding all forms of carbon sequestration is their effectiveness in offsetting CO2 emissions. But the diverse forms and mechanisms of potential sequestration are reflected in diverse assessment methodologies that are very difficult for decision-makers to compare and apply to comprehensive carbon management. For example, assessments of potential geologic sequestration are focused on total capacities derived from probabilistic analyses of rock strata, while assessments of potential biologic sequestration are focused on annual rates calculated using biogeochemical models. Non-specialists cannot readily compare and apply such dissimilar estimates of carbon storage.\nTo address these problems, assessment methodologies should not only tabulate rates and capacities of carbon storage, but also enable comparison of the time-dependent effects of various sequestration activities on the mitigation of increasing atmospheric CO2. This outcome-based approach requires consideration of the sustainability of the assessed carbon storage, as well as the response of carbon-cycle feedbacks. Global models can be used to compare atmospheric CO2 trajectories implied by alternative global sequestration strategies, but such simulations may not be accessible or useful in many decision settings. Simplified assessment metrics, such as ratios using impulse response functions, show some promise in providing comparisons of CO2 mitigation that are broadly useful while minimizing sensitivity to differences in global models and emissions scenarios. Continued improvements will require close collaboration between carbon-cycle researchers and those concerned with carbon sequestration resource assessment.",

            "abstract": "The wet climatic periods in the Quaternary in north Africa and in Arabia were traditionally attributed to intensification of paleo-monsoons during interglacial periods and progressive northward migration of monsoonal front. In N Africa, the monsoonal model could not account for: (1) progressive W to E depletion (Morocco: -20 to -40‰; ; Libya: -70 to -80‰; Egypt: -80 to -83‰) in isotopic composition of fossil groundwater ; (2) observed high lake levels during glacial periods (e.g., Lake Lisan: 160 m bmsl during glacial period MIS2); (3) the depleted isotopic compositions in the groundwater compared to modern precipitation (e.g., d2H: Morocco: - 25.8‰; ; Libya: -17.7; Egypt: -11.7‰) is consistent with deposition during relatively cool periods; (4) ages (Cl-36 : 170ka to 1000ka) of groundwater in the Empty Quarter are consistent with deposition in glacial periods; and (5) low recharge temperatures (e.g., 2-6 °C below average annual temperatures). Intensification of the paleo-westerlies during previous glacial periods can account for these observations. We propose a similar model for northern and central Arabia and probably the northern sectors of the Empty Quarter. Our reasoning: (1) a progressive north to south depletion in groundwater composition (north & center: d2H :-26.6 to -2.5‰, south: d2H: -76.6 to -26.9‰) is inconsistent with a paleo-monsoon origin; (2) ages of sediments in paleo-lakes (e.g., lake Mundafan: OSL ages: 88 to 147ka) favor deposition during glacial periods; (3) depleted isotopic compositions in the groundwater (d2H: -76.6 to -26.9‰) compared to modern precipitation (d2H: -22 to -45‰); (4) Cl-36 ages of groundwater (170ka to 1000ka ) are consistent with precipitation during glacial periods; (5) well documented records of monsoon-related wet events in Oman are not well developed northwards; and (6) well developed paleo-channels and theater-headed valleys in north and central Arabia compared to southern Arabia.",

In this pilot study we evaluate the impact on student learning from switching to more user-friendly software for lab assignments in an undergraduate course on climate modelling. Computer programming-based labs are replaced by a menu-driven modelling application called EdGCM, developed by Columbia University and the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. The EdGCM tool allows students to explore and visualize a wider array of aspects of climate variability and change—and in greater depth—than was possible previously. The goals of this study are (i) to make the course material more accessible to students regardless of their computing background; and (ii) to improve the level of students' knowledge retention in core climate science concepts. The impact of the change in software is measured using a combination of class surveys and students’ test scores. Differences in the level of integration between content and process learning, compared to previous iterations of the course without EdGCM, are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Globally, geological hazards are communicated using maps. In traditional hazard mapping practice, scientists analyse data about a hazard, and then display the results on a map for stakeholder and public use. However, this one-way, top-down approach to hazard communication is not necessarily effective or reliable. The messages which people take away will be dependent on the way in which they read, interpret, and understand the map, a facet of hazard communication which has been relatively unexplored.\nDecades of cartographic studies suggest that variables in the visual representation of data on maps, such as colour and symbology, can have a powerful effect on how people understand map content. In practice, however, there is little guidance or consistency in how hazard information is expressed and represented on maps. Accordingly, decisions are often made based on subjective preference, rather than research-backed principles. Here we present the results of a study in which we explore how hazard map design features can influence hazard map interpretation, and we propose a number of considerations for hazard map design.\nA series of hazard maps were generated, with each one showing the same probabilistic volcanic ashfall dataset, but using different verbal and visual variables (e.g., different colour schemes, data classifications, probabilistic formats). Following a short pilot study, these maps were used in an online survey of 110 stakeholders and scientists in New Zealand. Participants answered 30 open-ended and multiple choice questions about ashfall hazard based on the different maps.\nResults suggest that hazard map design can have a significant influence on the messages readers take away. For example, diverging colour schemes were associated with concepts of “risk” and decision-making more than sequential schemes, and participants made more precise estimates of hazard with isarithmic data classifications compared to binned or gradational shading. Based on such findings, we make a number of suggestions for communicating hazard using maps. Most importantly, we emphasise that multiple meanings may be taken away from a map, and this may have important implications in a crisis. We propose that engaging with map audiences in a two-way dialogue in times of peace may help prevent miscommunications in the event of a crisis.",

            "abstract": "Climate engineering (or geoengineering) has emerged as a possible component of a strategy to mitigate global warming. This emergence has produced a novel intersection of atmospheric science, environmental ethics and global governance. The scientific questions of climate engineering, while difficult to answer in their own right, are compounded by ethical considerations regarding whether these questions should be addressed and governance questions of how research and deployment could be managed. In an effort to address this intersection of ideas and provide our students with a rich interdisciplinary experience, we (T. Ackerman and S. Gardiner, both senior professors at the University of Washington) taught a cross-listed course in the Atmospheric Sciences and Philosophy departments. The course attracted 12 students (mostly graduate students but with two upper level undergraduates), with roughly equal representation from environmental sciences, ethics, and public policy disciplines, as well as two post-docs. Our primary goal for the course was to develop a functioning research community to address the core issues at the intersection of science and ethics. In this presentation, we discuss the course structure, identify strategies that were successful (or less so), and describe outcomes. We consider this course to be primarily pedagogical in nature, but we also recognize that many of the students in the class, perhaps even a majority, are intending to pursue careers outside academia in areas of public policy, environmental consulting, etc., which added an extra dimension to our class. Here, we also discuss the possibility of developing and teaching such courses in an academic environment that is stressed financially and increasingly dependent on metrics related to class size and student credit hours.",

For the past year, a mobile observing platform including a ground-based passive cavity aerosol spectrometer probe (PCASP-X2), an optical disdrometer (PARSIVEL-2), a tipping bucket rain gauge, and a Vaisala weather station, collocated with a Micro Rain Radar, has been recording observations in valley locations in the inner mountain region of the Southern Appalachian Mountains (SAM). In 2014, the SAM hosted a Global Precipitation Mission field campaign (the Integrated Precipitation and Hydrology Experiment), and during this experiment the platform was also collocated at various times with a microwave radiometer, W- and X- band radars, a Pluvio weighing rain gauge, a 2D video disdrometer, among other instruments. These observations will be discussed in the context of previous findings based on observations and model results (stochastic column model and the Advanced Research Weather and Forecasting Model (WRF)). Specifically, in previous work, seeder-feeder processes have been found to govern the enhancement of light rainfall in the SAM through increased coalescence efficiency in stratiform rainfall due to the interactions with low level clouds and topography modulated fog. This presentation will focus on measurements made by the platform and collocated instruments, as well as observations made by fog collectors on ridges, with the aim of developing a process-based understanding of the characteristics of low cloud and fog through describing the diurnal cycle of microphysical and dynamical processes and properties in the region. The overarching goal is to employ observations of the formation and evolution of the “feeder” clouds and fog to further understand the magnitude and function of their contribution to the local hydrometeorological regime.",

            "abstract": "Normal faults at the junction of the Dinarides and Hellenides in northern Albania trend both perpendicular and parallel to thrusts and fold axes. Most prominent is the SSE-dipping Skutari-Pec Normal Fault (SPNF), one of a system of normal faults that accommodate NW-SE-directed, orogen-parallel extension. Extensional throw along the SPNF increases from zero in northwestern Albania to at least 2 km near the Albania-Kosovo border, near where the brittle arm of the SPNF bounds the Mio-Pliocene Kosovo Basin. This differential orogen-parallel extension along the SPNF defines a vertical rotational axis in northwestern Albania that is interpreted to have accommodated 20-30° of clockwise motion of internal units on the southeastern (Hellenic) side of the fault with respect to the northwestern (Dinaric) side. Such rotation is in agreement with previously published paleomagnetic data and plate motion studies. The footwall of the SPNF exposes lower units of the Dinaric nappe stack that underwent vertical shortening and non-coaxial shearing during extensional exhumation. In the hangingwall of the SPNF, a system of orogen-parallel trending normal faults accommodate orogen-normal displacement of up to several km. Both orogen-parallel and –perpendicular systems of normal faults cut Late Cretaceous to Oligocene thrusts and folds, and are associated with pronounced Miocene paleo-relief. Most of this normal faulting is Miocene to Pliocene based on syn-extensional deposits in the Kosovo Basins and on thermal modelling of ZHe, AFT and AHe data, which suggest accelerated cooling at 18 Ma and between 4-6 Ma. Both fault systems also cut Holocene deposits, indicating ongoing extension. This corroborates published GPS data and earthquake focal mechanisms indicating active extension of the crust south and southeast of the SPNF. It is proposed that extension and clockwise rotation in this area were coeval and accommodated southwestward retreat and radial expansion of the Hellenic arc during rollback subduction.",

            "abstract": "The seismic spectrum can be modeled by assuming a Brune spectrum and estimating the parameters of seismic moment (M0), corner frequency (fc), and the high frequency site attenuation (κ). Traditionally studies either hold fixed or use a predefined set of trial values for one of the parameters (e.g., fc) and then solve for the remaining parameters. Here, we use the Gauss-Newton nonlinear least-squares method to simultaneously determine the M0, fc, and high-frequency κ for each event-station pair.\nWe use data collected during the Canterbury, New Zealand earthquake sequence. The seismic stations include the permanent GeoNet accelerometer network as well as a dense network of nearly 200 Quake-Catcher Network (QCN) MEMs accelerometers installed following the 3 September 2010 M 7.1 Darfield earthquake. We examine over 180 aftershocks ≥ Mw3.5 that occurred from 9 September 2010 to 31 July 2011 and are captured by both networks.\nWe use Fourier-transformed S-wave windows that include 80% of the S-wave energy and fit the acceleration spectra between 0.5 and 20 Hz. We apply a path and site correction to the data as described in Oth and Kaiser (2014). Then, the records are smoothed using a Konno and Omachi (1998) filter and uniformly resampled in log space. Initial “best guesses” for M0 and fc are determined from GNS catalog magnitudes and by assuming a 100 bar (10 MPa) stress drop and an initial κ is determined from an automated high-frequency fit method. We use a parametric inversion technique that requires a single M0 and fc for each event, while κ is allowed to vary by station to reflect varying site conditions. Final solutions for M0, fc, and κ are iteratively calculated by minimizing the residual function. After Brune (1970, 1971), the stress drop is determined from the best-fit fc.\nMoment magnitudes determined agree well with the GNS catalog, with a median difference of 0.12 Mw and 0.20 Mw for GeoNet and QCN inversions, respectively. Stress drop results are within the range reported by Oth and Kaiser (2014) who use a non-parametric inversion of GeoNet data.",

We further examine possibilities for instrument miniaturization, using smaller UAS and smaller sensors for collecting data. The quality and type of data is compared to that of satellite observations, observations from manned aircraft and to measurements made during field experiments on the ground. For example, a small UAS can be sent out to observe a sudden event, such as a natural catastrophe, and provide high-resolution imagery, but a satellite has the advantage of providing the same type of data over much of the Earth's surface and for several years, but the data is generally of lower resolution.

            "abstract": "Enactment of the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) in January 1, 2015 marks a historic transition in groundwater management in California. The new legislation requires all high- and medium-priority groundwater basins (as defined by the California Statewide Groundwater Elevation Monitoring [CASGEM] Program) in the State to develop and implement science-based groundwater sustainability plans (GSPs) by January 2020 or 2022. GSP development will be undertaken by Groundwater Sustainability Agencies (GSAs) and must include interim milestones and measurable objectives to achieve sustainable groundwater management within 20 years of GSP implementation. Achieving these goals will require GSAs to: (1) develop a comprehensive understanding of their respective groundwater basin(s) (or subbasin(s)); (2) create and implement a comprehensive groundwater monitoring network that is tied to quantifiable groundwater management objectives; and (3) to coordinate these data and efforts across an entire groundwater (sub)basin.\nAchieving these legislative requirements will be particularly challenging given that groundwater in California is currently managed by approximately 2,300 local agencies all collecting varying degrees of information about their respective groundwater subbasin(s). In many cases, groundwater monitoring programs are not consistent or coordinated across a (sub)basin or with adjoining (sub)basins. We conducted a survey in the summer and fall of 2015, targeting local agencies and groundwater consultants in California, to develop a more informed understanding of current agency-level data collection, use, and sharing practices. The results of this survey will lay the foundation for the development of information and tools to help managers overcome the challenges of decentralized management and facilitate data sharing and integration.",

To improve at a relatively low cost the spatial resolution of regional earthquake early warning (EEW) systems, decentralized onsite EEW and building monitoring, a wireless sensing unit, the Self-Organizing Seismic Early Warning Information Network (SOSEWIN) was developed and further improved to include the multi-parameter acquisition. SOSEWINs working in continuous real time mode are currently tested on various sites. In Bishkek and Istanbul, an instrumented building is located close to a borehole equipped with downhole sensors. The joint data analysis of building and borehole earthquake recordings allows the study of the behavior of the building, characteristics of the soil, and soil-structure interactions.\nThe interferometric approach applied to recordings of the building response is particularly suitable to characterize the wave propagation inside a building, including the propagation velocity of shear waves and attenuation. Applied to borehole sensors, it gives insights into velocity changes in different layers, reflections and mode conversion, and allows the estimation of the quality factor Qs.\nWe used combined building and borehole data from the two test sites: 1) to estimate the characteristics of wave propagation through the building to the soil and back, and 2) to obtain an empirical insight into soil-structure interactions. The two test sites represent two different building and soil types, and soil structure impedance contrasts. The wave propagation through the soil to the building and back is investigated by the joint interferometric approach. The propagation of up and down-going waves through the building and soil is clearly imaged and the reflection of P and S waves from the earth surface and the top of the building identified. An estimate of the reflected and transmitted energy amounts is given, too.",

            "abstract": "As concentrations of greenhouse gases continue to increase in the troposphere, general circulation models predict an acceleration in the Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC). A common diagnostic used to evaluate this change in circulation is age of air, which is defined as the time elapsed since stratospheric air was last in contact with the troposphere. An acceleration in the BDC can lead to shorter residence times and hence younger age of air. This change would affect the chemical distribution of pollutants and ozone-depleting substances in the stratosphere and potentially impact the recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer. In this study, we use in-situ measurements and model outputs to derive and compare vertical profiles of age of air and to assess the impact of various dynamical processes on age of air over the tropics and Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. We focus on measurements of winds and several tracers with varying atmospheric lifetimes recently obtained in the tropopause region and lower stratosphere during the NASA ATTREX and NASA SEAC4RS campaigns between Jan 2013 and Mar 2014. We derive age of air using CO2 measurements at the surface and at altitude. This tracer is nearly chemically inert in the atmosphere and has well-known sources at the surface: an increasing trend over time resulting from anthropogenic activity and a superimposed seasonal cycle resulting from photosynthesis and respiration by the biosphere. During the field deployments, we encountered episodes of contrasting transport and mixing processes compared to background conditions, namely local and non-local convection as identified by trajectories and distinct chemical signatures, nearby typhoons, wave activity, and shifts in large-scale circulation. In addition to aircraft measurements, we also examine data from earlier high-altitude balloon flights, which allowed us to sample deeper into the stratosphere. We complement the observations with model outputs from the NASA GEOS-5 atmospheric global climate model and Lagrangian trajectories driven by ERA-interim circulation. These comparisons indicate good agreement in age of air at and above the tropopause with increasing biases deeper into the stratosphere. The implications of these results will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Radiocarbon in dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in seawater varies greatly, both geographically and with depth. This “reservoir effect” is thought to be reflected in the radiocarbon content (∆14C) of marine organisms, via DIC fixation by primary producers and subsequent trophic transfer. The ∆14C of marine organismal soft tissues might thus provide unique information about their habitats, diets, migration and other environmental histories. However, the effectiveness of this approach has yet to be extensively explored, with data on ∆14C variability in soft tissues of marine organisms being markedly limited. Here we examined whether ∆14C values of individual pinnate blades (leaf-like structures) of brown seaweed (Undaria pinnatifida) reflect the ∆14C of DIC in the water current prevailing at the time of blade formation. The study was conducted in Otsuchi Bay located in the Sanriku coastal region, northeastern Japan, where 14C-depleted cold Oyashio current and warm Tsugaru current (high ∆14C) converge, affecting the physiology and growth of marine organisms growing there. U. pinnatifida individuals cultured in the bay (length of saprophytes, 140–215 cm) were harvested in April 2014 and ∆14C of blades were determined by accelerator mass spectrometry. Younger blades formed after the Oyashio water intrusion had significantly lower ∆14C values compared to older blades formed before the event. The ∆14C values of younger and older blades were generally consistent with the ∆14C of DIC in Oyashio (-60.5 ‰) and Tsugaru (24.9 ‰) waters, respectively. Thus, despite possible turnover of organic carbon in seaweed soft tissues, blade-order-dependent ∆14C variability appeared to strongly reflect the Oyashio intrusion event (radiocarbon shift) in the bay.",

However, parameterizations of this process in regional and global models remain relatively untested. Measurements taken during the 2015 Wintertime Investigation of Transportation, Emissions, & Reactivity (WINTER) allow both empirical and theoretical calculations of the N2O5 reactive uptake coefficient (γ) and ClNO2 yield (Y) during 13 winter flights over the eastern US. We use observations of gas and particle composition as inputs to the offline thermodynamic equilibrium models, ISORROPIA II and AIM, to generate outputs of particulate aqueous phase concentrations of NO3-(aq), Cl-(aq), and H2O(l) . These outputs are used to theoretically calculate γ (N2O5) and Y(ClNO2), using the parameterizations described in Bertram & Thornton, 2009. The calculated values are then compared to the empirical counterparts to assess the validity of the parameterization’s representation of temperature, humidity, and composition dependences. The updated parameterization is then used in the online GEOS-Chem chemical transport model to examine the role of wintertime multiphase chemistry in controlling the regional distribution and export of NOx and Cl-atom source downwind of the northeast United States.",

These standards and software solutions have been developed around the new Observations Data Model version 2.0 (ODM2,\nhttp://ODM2.org\n), which was designed as a profile of the Open Geospatial Consortium’s (OGC) Observations and Measurements (O&M) standard. The ODM2 standards and software ecosystem has at it’s core an information model that balances specificity with flexibility to powerfully and equally serve the needs of multiple dataset types, from multivariate sensor-generated time series to geochemical measurements of specimen hierarchies to multi-dimensional spectral data to biodiversity observations. ODM2 has been adopted as the information model guiding the next generation of cyberinfrastructure development for the Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance (\nhttp://www.iedadata.org/\n) and the CUAHSI Water Data Center (\nhttps://www.cuahsi.org/wdc\n).\nHere we present several components of the ODM2 standards and software ecosystem that were developed specifically to help CZ scientists and their data managers to share and manage data through the national Critical Zone Observatory data integration project (CZOData, http://criticalzone.org/national/data/) and the bio integration with geo for critical zone science data project (BiG CZ Data, http://bigcz.org/). These include the ODM2 Controlled Vocabulary system (http://vocabulary.odm2.org), the YAML Observation Data Archive & exchange (YODA) File Format (https://github.com/ODM2/YODA-File) and the BiG CZ Toolbox, which will combine easy-to-install ODM2 databases (https://github.com/ODM2/ODM2) with a variety of graphical software packages for data management such as ODMTools (https://github.com/ODM2/ODMToolsPython) and the ODM2 Streaming Data Loader (https://github.com/ODM2/ODM2StreamingDataLoader).",

            "abstract": "While many geoscience-related repositories and data discovery portals exist, finding information about available resources remains a pervasive problem, especially when searching across multiple domains and catalogs. Inconsistent and incomplete metadata descriptions, disparate access protocols and semantic differences across domains, and troves of unstructured or poorly structured information which is hard to discover and use are major hindrances toward discovery, while metadata compilation and curation remain manual and time-consuming. We report on methodology, main results and lessons learned from an ongoing effort to develop a geoscience-wide catalog of information resources, with consistent metadata descriptions, traceable provenance, and automated metadata enhancement. Developing such a catalog is the central goal of CINERGI (Community Inventory of EarthCube Resources for Geoscience Interoperability), an EarthCube building block project (earthcube.org/group/cinergi). The key novel technical contributions of the projects include: a) development of a metadata enhancement pipeline and a set of document enhancers to automatically improve various aspects of metadata descriptions, including keyword assignment and definition of spatial extents; b) Community Resource Viewers: online applications for crowdsourcing community resource registry development, curation and search, and channeling metadata to the unified CINERGI inventory, c) metadata provenance, validation and annotation services, d) user interfaces for advanced resource discovery; and e) geoscience-wide ontology and machine learning to support automated semantic tagging and faceted search across domains. We demonstrate these CINERGI components in three types of user scenarios: (1) improving existing metadata descriptions maintained by government and academic data facilities, (2) supporting work of several EarthCube Research Coordination Network projects in assembling information resources for their domains, and (3) enhancing the inventory and the underlying ontology to address several complicated data discovery use cases in hydrology, geochemistry, sedimentology, and critical zone science.\nSupport from the US National Science Foundation under award ICER-1343816 is gratefully acknowledged.",

            "abstract": "The research explores the highly oblique continental convergence at the South Island of New Zealand, considering the fundamental geodynamic mechanisms of sub-crustal lithospheric deformation during the orogenesis. In addition to the high velocity of along-strike plate motion, the oppositely verging subduction zones bounding the collision make the problem inherently three-dimensional. To study such factors during orogenesis, we conduct 3D computational modelling and present the results of a series of new experiments configured for the oblique South Island collision. The geodynamic modelling uses ASPECT – a robust highly-scalable and extendable geodynamic code featuring adaptive mesh refinement and complex rheologies. The model domain is defined by a box with prescribed velocities on the left and right faces with varied ratio of convergent versus strike-slip components, periodic boundary conditions for the front and back faces, free surface on top, and free slip at the bottom. Two different rheology types are used: brittle (pressure-, strain rate-, and material strength-dependent) for crust and visco-plastic (temperature-, pressure- and strain rate-dependent) for mantle. The obtained results provide insight into the behaviour of the lithosphere under the situation of young oblique convergence. We focus on the development of the mantle lithosphere, considering how the morphology of the sub-crustal orogenic root evolves during the convergent/strike-slip plate motions. The numerical experiments explore the dependence of this process on such factors as ratio of convergent versus strike-slip motion at the plate boundary, and rheological parameters of crust and mantle. The behaviour of the crust is also tracked to determine how the deep 3D tectonics may manifest at the surface.",

SGD has been identified as an important source of limiting nutrients to coastal ecosystems, and is conceivably even more critical in a dry climate. Groundwater inflows are rarely considered in estuary mass budgets, therefore sampling stations were chosen over the entire bay system to identify spatial differences in SGD and to estimate direct groundwater contributions. This interdisciplinary approach proved necessary to differentiate between the bay recirculation and terrestrial components of SGD. Resistivity measurements using a towed electrode array were used to identify sampling stations at areas favorable to SGD. While NORTs may provide an estimate of basin-wide groundwater input, these sampling stations ascertain the favorable geologic environment for hydraulic interconnectivity between surface water and groundwater in the system. A sampling suite (including metals and nutrients) of surface, bottom, and pore waters during winter and summer months display spatio-temporal changes in nutrient fluxes. This study reinforces the understanding of the necessity to use multiple methods to accurately quantify SGD and associated solute fluxes and advances the knowledge of coastal groundwater interaction in semi-arid environments.",

Working with the USGS, NGA, ASI, and JAXA, in the hours and days following the event, the team generated a number of scientific data products that were distributed to organizations responding to the event. Data included, ground based geodetic observations, optical and radar data from international and domestic partners, to compile a variety of products, including “vulnerability maps,” used to determine risks that may be present, and “damage proxy maps,” used to determine the type and extent of existing damage. This talk will focus on the response process, highlighting some of the products generated and distributed and lessons learned that would be useful for responding to future events that would improve the effectiveness of such a broad, agency wide response.",

            "abstract": "The degree of connectivity between thrust-belt deformation and foreland basin evolution has been a matter of debate for decades. This is in part due to the lack of temporal constraints on the relationship between thrust-belt deformation and associated deposition. New high-resolution zircon (U-Th)-(Pb-He) double dating of pre- and syn-tectonic sedimentary strata along the Sevier thrust front and basin provide an unprecedented geochronological framework to temporally and spatially link the Sevier foreland basin stratigraphy to deforming hinterland sources. Results improve constraints on timing and magnitude of deformation, depositional ages, sediment dispersal and sources. In Late Cretaceous proximal deposits of the Indianola Group (IG) and Canyon Range Conglomerates (CRC), detrital zircon U-Pb (zUPb) and (U-Th)/He ages (ZHe) chronicle the sequential unroofing of the Charlestone-Nebo Salient (CNS) and Canyon Range (CR) duplexes. Furthermore, short ZHe depositional lag-times indicate rapid hinterland exhumation (>1km/my) associated with active thrusting during Cenomanian and Coniacian-Santonian times as supported by bedrock ZHe ages in the CNS and CR thrust sheets. Detrital zircon analyses on the Late Cretaceous marine Book Cliffs strata suggest a more complex source-to-sink evolution compared to the time-equivalent IG and CRC proximal strata due to mixing of multi-source detrital zircons, sediment recycling and more prominent volcanic input. Nonetheless, the overall cooling history recorded in the Book Cliffs clearly reflects three hinterland exhumational phases, an early phase derived from the frontal thrusts and two additional phases with more integrated hinterland ZHe signatures. These three short lag-time phases correlate with fast clastic progradational wedges in the Sevier foreland. These results strengthen the role played by hinterland deformation on clastic progradation and elucidate the temporal relationship between thrusting and foreland basin architecture.",

We collected dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), channel hydrology and geomorphology, and temperature from multiple locations throughout stream networks in seven sites across six biomes, specifically tropical forest, temperate deciduous forest, temperate coniferous forest, tallgrass prairie, boreal forest, and arctic tundra. We estimated the activation energy (Ea) of GPP and ER from diel changes in DO, temperature and PAR for each stream reach. We showed the relationship between Ea and environmental variables, such as temperature, light availability and discharge. In addition, we found that Ea of GPP and ER were highly variable from reach to reach within each biome. The estimated Ea of GPP and ER was generally higher than predicted by metabolic theory. Ea of GPP ranges from 20 to 140 KJ/mol and Ea of ER ranges from 50 to 150 KJ/mol. There was no consistent trend of larger Ea for GPP or ER. This suggests that the changes in carbon balance in streams caused directly by warming is likely to be site specific.",

Activities this past year include the installation of a geodetic quality wellhead monument for the new SEY2 station to replace SEY1, which is mounted on a UCSD seismic station in the Seychelles Islands. SEY1 will be removed soon to accommodate planned maintenance and upgrades by UCSD. Data from both SEY1 and SEY2 are being collected concurrently until maintenance begins.\nMRTG (Multi Router Traffic Grapher), a tool to aid in characterizing bandwidth usage and to identify communications problems, is now being used to monitor data throughput at 7 stations where VSAT or radio telemetry are used, including: ABPO; AREQ; FALK; GUAM; HARV; ISPA; QUIN; and STHL. Aging computers are being replaced with new hardware running Linux CentOS. These are semi-ruggedized low power solid-state systems built to endure challenging environments. With the aid of on-site collaborators, systems are now deployed at: FALK; CUSV; KELY; STHL; SANT; and ZAMB.\nLast, 4 new GPS stations were deployed for NASA’s Space Geodesy Project (SGP); three of which (KOKF, KOKG, and KOKR) are located at Koke’e Park Geophysical Observatory on Kauai, Hawai’i, and HAL1 at the Haleakala observatory complex on Maui, Hawai’i. A campaign system was set up at Koke’e in order to sample data quality to determine if an additional station would be viable.

The technique has been used extensively as a non-intrusive means to quantify land-atmosphere exchanges of mass and energy. A variety of sensor technologies and gas sampling designs have been tried. Gas concentrations are commonly measured using infrared or laser absorption spectroscopy. Open-path sensors directly sample the ambient environment but suffer when the sample volume is obstructed (e.g., rain, dust). Closed-path sensors utilize pumps to draw air into the analyzer through inlet tubes which can attenuate the signal. Enclosed-path sensors are a newer, hybrid of the open- and closed-path designs where the sensor is mounted in the environment and the sample is drawn through a short inlet tube with short residence time. Five gas analyzers were evaluated as part of this experiment: open-path LI-COR 7500A, enclosed-path LI-COR 7200, closed-path Picarro G2311-f, open-path Campbell Scientific IRGASON, and enclosed-path Campbell Scientific EC155. We compared the relative performance of the gas analyzers over an irrigated alfalfa field in Davis, CA. The field was host to a range of ancillary measurements including below-ground sensors, and a weighing lysimeter. The crop was flood irrigated and harvested monthly. To compare sensors, we evaluated the half-hour mean and variance of gas concentrations (or mole densities). Power spectra for the gas analyzers and turbulent fluxes (from a common sonic anemometer) were also calculated and analyzed. Eddy covariance corrections will be discussed as they relate to sensor design (e.g., density corrections, signal attenuation).",

This method differs from cavity ringdown spectroscopy, because it uses an inexpensive, incoherent light source and allows optical extinction to be determined simultaneously across a broad wavelength region.\nSpectral fitting methods can be used to retrieve multiple absorbers across the observed wavelength region. We have successfully used this method to measure glyoxal (CHOCHO), nitrous acid (HONO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) from ground-based and aircraft-based sampling platforms. The detection limit (2-sigma) in 5 s for retrievals of CHOCHO, HONO and NO2 is 32, 250 and 80 parts per trillion (pptv).\nAlternatively, gas-phase absorbers can be chemically removed to allow the accurate determination of aerosol extinction. In the laboratory, we have used the aerosol extinction measurements to determine scattering and absorption as a function of wavelength. We have deployed a ground-based field instrument to measure aerosol extinction, with a detection limit of approximately 0.2 Mm-1 in 1 min.\nBBCES methods are most widely used in the near-ultraviolet and visible spectral region. Recently, we have demonstrated measurements at 315-350 nm for formaldehyde (CH2O) and NO2. Extending the technique further into the ultraviolet spectral region will allow important additional measurements of trace gas species and aerosol extinction.",

            "abstract": "Recent developments in machine reading and learning approaches to text and data mining hold considerable promise for accelerating the pace and quality of literature-based data synthesis, but these advances have outpaced even basic levels of access to the published literature. For many geoscience domains, particularly those based on physical samples and field-based descriptions, this limitation is significant. Here we describe a general infrastructure to support published literature-based machine reading and learning approaches to information integration and knowledge base creation. This infrastructure supports rate-controlled automated fetching of original documents, along with full bibliographic citation metadata, from remote servers, the secure storage of original documents, and the utilization of considerable high-throughput computing resources for the pre-processing of these documents by optical character recognition, natural language parsing, and other document annotation and parsing software tools. New tools and versions of existing tools can be automatically deployed against original documents when they are made available. The products of these tools (text/XML files) are managed by MongoDB and are available for use in data extraction applications. Basic search and discovery functionality is provided by ElasticSearch, which is used to identify documents of potential relevance to a given data extraction task. Relevant files derived from the original documents are then combined into basic starting points for application building; these starting points are kept up-to-date as new relevant documents are incorporated into the digital library. Currently, our digital library stores contains more than 360K documents supplied by Elsevier and the USGS and we are actively seeking additional content providers. By focusing on building a dependable infrastructure to support the retrieval, storage, and pre-processing of published content, we are establishing a foundation for complex, and continually improving, information integration and data extraction applications. We have developed one such application, which we present as an example, and invite new collaborations to develop other such applications.",

            "abstract": "Being trained as a scientist provides many valuable tools needed to address society's most pressing environmental issues. It does not, however, provide training on one of the most critical for translating science into action: the ability to engage decision makers. Engagement means different things to different people and what is appropriate for one project might not be for another. However, recent reports have emphasized that for research to be most useful to decision making, engagement should happen at the beginning and throughout the research process. There are an increasing number of boundary organizations (e.g., NOAA’s Regional Integrated Sciences and Assessment program, U.S. Department of the Interior’s Climate Science Centers) where engagement is encouraged and rewarded, and scientists are learning, often through trial and error, how to effectively include decision makers (a.k.a. stakeholders, practitioners, resource managers) in their research process. This presentation highlights best practices and practices to avoid when scientists engage decision makers, a list compiled through the personal experiences of both scientists and decision makers and a literature review, and how this collective knowledge could be shared, such as through a recent session and role-playing exercise given at the Northwest Climate Science Center’s Climate Boot Camp. These ideas are presented in an effort to facilitate conversations about how the science community (e.g., AGU researchers) can become better prepared for effective collaborations with decision makers that will ultimately result in more actionable science.",

            "abstract": "The Bureau of Reclamation’s Dam Safety Office has initiated a series of pilot studies focused on exploring potential impacts of climate change on hydrologic hazards at specific dam locations across the Western US. Friant Dam, located in Fresno, California, was chosen for study because the site had recently undergone a high-level hydrologic hazard analysis using the Stochastic Event Flood Model (SEFM). SEFM is a deterministic flood-event model that treats input parameters as variables, rather than fixed values. Monte Carlo sampling allows the hydrometeorological input parameters to vary according to observed relationships. In this study, we explore the potential impacts of climate change on the hydrologic hazard at Friant Dam using historical and climate-adjusted hydrometeorological inputs to the SEFM. Historical magnitude-frequency relationships of peak inflow and reservoir elevation were developed at Friant Dam for the baseline study using observed temperature and precipitation data between 1966 and 2011. Historical air temperatures, antecedent precipitation, mean annual precipitation, and the precipitation-frequency curve were adjusted for the climate change study using the delta method to create climate-adjusted hydrometeorological inputs. Historical and future climate projections are based on the Bias-Corrected Spatially-Disaggregated CMIP5 dataset (BCSD-CMIP5). The SEFM model was run thousands of times to produce magnitude-frequency relationships of peak reservoir inflow, inflow volume, and reservoir elevation, based on historical and climate-adjusted inputs. Results suggest that peak reservoir inflow and peak reservoir elevation increase (decrease) for all return periods under mean increases (decreases) in precipitation, independently of changes in surface air temperature.",

The Urban Water Innovation Network (UWIN), a consortium of 14 academic institutions and other key partners across the U.S., is working to address challenges that threaten urban water systems across the nation. UWIN’s mission is to create technological, institutional and management solutions to help communities increase the resilience of their water systems and enhance their preparedness for responding to water crisis. The network seeks solutions that achieve widespread adoption consistent with inclusive, equitable and sustainable urban development. The integrative and adaptive analysis framework of UWIN is presented. The framework identifies a toolbox of sustainable solutions by simultaneously minimizing pressures, enhancing resilience to extreme events, and maximizing cobenefits. The benefits of sustainable urban water solutions for linked urban ecosystems, economies, and arrangements for environmental justice and social equity, will be discussed. The network encompasses six U.S. regions with varying ecohydrologic and climatic regimes ranging from the coastal moist mid-latitude climates of the Mid-Atlantic to the subtropical semi-arid deserts of the Southwest. These regions also represent a wide spectrum of demographic, cultural, and policy settings. The opportunities for cross-site assessments that facilitate the exploration of locally appropriate solutions across regions undergoing various development trajectories will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Kirby, Wang, and Brocher (Earth Planets and Space, 2014) recently showed how the change in kinematics of the California margin from subduction motion to continental transform motion with the birth and growth of the San Andreas Fault System (SAFS) beginning at about 33 Ma BP likely led to a warming of the former forearc mantle and the release of water by serpentinite dehydration. Such discharges from serpentinized mantle increase fluid pressures along the SAFS under the Coast Ranges and this gives insights into both the low sliding resistance for the SAFS and the mobilization and ascent of some serpentinized mantle peridotites through the crust. Thermal modeling by others has also shown that changes in the incoming plate age and subduction rate can also lead to warming of the forearc mantle during subduction. This development gives insights into the Mesozoic and Paleogene ages of emplacement of some, but not all, California serpentinites. Recent mineralogical and geochemical observations of serpentinized blocks in serpentinize mélange bodies in the San Francisco Bay Area (Uno and Kirby, 2015; Lewis and Kirby, 2015, this session) suggest that these rocks sustained multiple stages of serpentinization that are broadly consistent with the model of Kirby et al. (2014). Previous studies of localized late-stage silica-carbonate-water alteration of serpentinite bodies in California by carbonated water suggest that this alteration occurred largely in Neogene time when the highest rate of water release from the former forearc mantle probably happened. I also suggest that the occurrence of serpentinite belts emplaced in Cenozoic time during changing plate-boundary kinematics, such as the Cenozoic closing of the Tethys Ocean bordering Eurasia and arc reversal and decreasing convergence rates under the Greater Antilles, may give insights into the serpentinite belts in those regions.",

Risk Finder can also be used to identify specific points of interest in danger of exposure at different flood levels.

The research demonstrates how the Poisson’s PDE can provide us with a capability to extract the near-surface mass-density anomalies from land-based gravity data. Herein, this version of the Poisson’s PDE is mathematically introduced to the Earth’s surface and then it is used to develop the new method for approximating the mass-density via derivatives of the Earth’s gravitational field (i.e. via the gradient tensor). Herein, the author believes that the PDE can give us new knowledge about the behavior of the Earth’s gravitational field at the Earth’s surface which can be so useful for developing new methods of Earth’s mass-density determination. In a case study, the proposed method is applied to a set of gravity stations located in the south of Iran. The results were numerically validated via certain knowledge about the geological structures in the area of the case study. Also, the method was compared with two standard methods of mass-density determination. All the numerical experiments show that the proposed approach is well-suited for tracking near-surface mass-density anomalies via using only the gravity data. Finally, the approach is also applied to some petroleum exploration studies of salt diapirs in the south of Iran.",

            "abstract": "To improve the predictions of aerosol composition in chemical transport models (CTMs) and global climate models (GCMs), we have developed an aerosol classification algorithm (called Specified Clustering and Mahalanobis Classification, SCMC) that assigns an aerosol type to multi-parameter retrievals by spaceborne, airborne or ground based passive remote sensing instruments [Russell et al., 2014]. The aerosol types identified by our scheme are pure dust, polluted dust, urban-industrial/developed economy, urban-industrial/developing economy, dark biomass smoke, light biomass smoke and pure marine. We apply the SCMC method to two different total-column datasets of aerosol optical properties: inversions from the ground-based AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and retrievals from the space-borne POLDER (Polarization and Directionality of Earth’s Reflectances) instrument. The POLDER retrievals that we use differ from the standard POLDER retrievals [Deuzé et al., 2001] as they make full use of multi-angle, multispectral polarimetric data [Hasekamp et al., 2011]. We analyze agreement in the aerosol types inferred from both AERONET and POLDER globally. Then, we investigate how our total-column “effective” SCMC aerosol types relate to different aerosol types within the column (i.e. either a mixture of different types within one layer in the vertical or the stacking of different aerosol types within the vertical column). For that, we compare AERONET-SCMC aerosol types to collocated NASA LaRC HSRL vertically resolved aerosol types [Burton et al., 2012] during the SEAC4RS and DISCOVER-AQ airborne field experiments, mostly over Texas in Aug-Sept 2013. Finally, in order to evaluate the GEOS-Chem CTM aerosol types, we translate each of our SCMC aerosol type into a unique distribution of GEOS-Chem aerosol composition (e.g. biomass burning, dust, sulfate, sea salt). We bridge the gap between remote sensing and model-inferred aerosol types by using multiple years of collocated AERONET retrievals and GEOS-Chem simulations globally",

Here, we utilize a national raster of burn probabilities from wildland fire, a tree list for the western United States, and a national map of fuel loading models to calculate the risk to terrestrial carbon from wildland fires in the western United States. Annual burn probabilities are estimated by the Large Fire Simulator (FSim), based on current static landscape conditions and at least 10,000 years of statistically plausible weather sequences. For fires of varying intensity, forest carbon retained onsite and carbon emissions are estimated by the Fire and Fuels Extension of the Forest Vegetation Simulator. In grasslands and shrublands, carbon retained and emitted by wildfire is estimated based on current fuel loading and estimated consumption. We summarize expected carbon stocks and expected annual carbon loss at a variety of scales, aggregating values from the 270m pixel to National Forest, ecoregion, state, and regional scales. Our results indicate that following even a high intensity wildland fire in forested areas, the majority of aboveground carbon is retained onsite in the form of tree trunks. Because of the low annual probability of burning, emissions are small relative to carbon stocks. Additional work will be needed to integrate the complex temporal dimension of the carbon cycle, with areas burned in recent years being at first a carbon source and then a carbon sink after less than a decade in most areas.",

The spectrograph uses an echelle grating that operates at high dispersion orders (28-43) such that extended sources for airglow and auroral emissions can be observed at high resolution (about 0.02 nm). By using four slits (instead of the conventional one slit setup), with the appropriate foreoptics it images extended emissions along a long field of view of about 0.1° × 50°. It observes spectral regions around six prominent atmospheric emission lines (HI 656.3 nm, HI 486.1 nm, OI 557.7 nm, OI 630.0 nm, OI 777.4 nm and N+2 427.8 nm) using order sorting interference filters at the entrance slits and a filter mosaic on an image plane.\nWe present observations from the instrument during the June 22, 2015 G4 storm. OI 557.7 nm (green line) and OI 630.0 nm (red line) showed strong brightness enhancements that lasted throughout the night from 8 P.M June 22, 2015 to 3 AM June 23,2015 when compared to the same times after the storm had passed.",

            "abstract": "Our work focuses on development of a multi-agent, hydroeconomic model for purposes of water policy evaluation in Jordan. The model adopts a modular approach, integrating biophysical modules that simulate natural and engineered phenomena with human modules that represent behavior at multiple levels of decision making. The hydrologic modules are developed using spatially-distributed groundwater and surface water models, which are translated into compact simulators for efficient integration into the multi-agent model. For the groundwater model, we adopt a response matrix method approach in which a 3-dimensional MODFLOW model of a complex regional groundwater system is converted into a linear simulator of groundwater response by pre-processing drawdown results from several hundred numerical simulation runs. Surface water models for each major surface water basin in the country are developed in SWAT and similarly translated into simple rainfall-runoff functions for integration with the multi-agent model. The approach balances physically-based, spatially-explicit representation of hydrologic systems with the efficiency required for integration into a complex multi-agent model that is computationally amenable to robust scenario analysis. For the multi-agent model, we explicitly represent human agency at multiple levels of decision making, with agents representing riparian, management, supplier, and water user groups. The agents' decision making models incorporate both rule-based heuristics as well as economic optimization. The model is programmed in Python using Pynsim, a generalizable, open-source object-oriented code framework for modeling network-based water resource systems. The Jordan model is one of the first applications of Pynsim to a real-world water management case study. Preliminary results from a tanker market scenario run through year 2050 are presented in which several salient features of the water system are investigated: competition between urban and private farmer agents, the emergence of a private tanker market, disparities in economic wellbeing to different user groups caused by unique supply conditions, and response of the complex system to various policy interventions.",

This general form allows for long-range dependancies with only 3 parameter while remaining within the linear forcing paradigm. This establish a one-to-one relation between the scaling exponent H and the ratio of the Transient Climate Response, TCR, and the Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity, ECS. The scaling exponent of the power law is estimated by a regression of temperature as a function of forcing and by a spectral analysis of the temperature and the forcing. We consider for the analysis 5 different datasets of historical global mean temperature and 100 CMIP5 RCP runs distributed among the 4 scenarios. We find that the error function for the estimate on historical temperature is very wide and thus, many scaling exponent can be used without meaningful changes in the fit residuals of historical temperatures; their response in the year 2100 on the other hand, is very broad. CMIP5 runs allow a narrower estimate of H which can then be used to estimate the ECS by dividing the TCR estimated from the historical data.",

            "abstract": "The IARPC Collaborations website (\nwww.iarpccollaborations.org\n) was developed to support collaborative implementation of the Interagency Arctic Research Policy Committee’s (IARPC) 5-Year Plan for Arctic Research. The Plan describes an ambitious agenda for advancing understanding of the changing Arctic, a challenge that requires innovative approaches to integrate disparate research activities. IARPC was created by Congress to address this integration with a mandate that includes developing interagency collaboration and outside partnerships, specifically those with the State of Alaska, indigenous communities, academia, industry and non-governmental organizations. The IARPC Collaborations website was introduced in October of 2014 as an innovative means to address IARPC’s mandate. It is an open, social networking platform with member-driven content and features to support dialog and milestone tracking. In its first year, IARPC Collaborations has attracted more than 600 members. Member-supplied content added to the site includes more than 575 research planning documents and scientific presentations and 300 updates on research plans and resources; all content is tagged with descriptive keywords to expedite discovery and elucidate connectivity across members and topics. Applying a social network analysis to metadata from the site reveals the strength and nature of this connectivity. This analysis demonstrates that Collaboration Team phone meetings remain the dominant form of communication. Dialog on the site through comment forums has been slow to emerge despite its merits of persistence and transparency. While more than 80 members have used the comment features at least once, the strong centrality of the IARPC Secretariat to website dialog is apparent. An analysis of content keywords demonstrates the potential for improved dialog based on overlapping interests as revealed by trending topics like “sea ice prediction”, “traditional knowledge” and “permafrost carbon”. Less than one year into launch, this analysis of IARPC’s experiment in collaborative integration reveals the enduring strengths of traditional collaboration tools like secretariat support and phone meetings; the full potential of IARPC’s social networking tools remains to be seen.",

This approach is based on the observation that apparent 2H/1H fractionation between surface water and mangrove lipids increases with surface water salinity in six species of mangroves with different salt management strategies growing at sites spanning a range of relative humidities throughout Australia and Micronesia.\nIn order to more robustly apply mangrove lipid δ2H as a paleoclimate proxy, we investigated the cause of the correlation between apparent 2H fractionation and salinity. We present results from two related experiments that assessed controls on isotopes of mangrove leaf water, the direct source of hydrogen in lipids: (1) Measurements of natural δ2H in precipitation, surface water, and mangrove tissue water from a series of lakes with varying salinity and water isotope composition in Palau, and (2) measurements of mangrove tissue water and treatment water from a controlled simulation in which mangroves were treated with artificial rain of varying isotopic composition.\nRainwater 2H/1H fluctuations of 30‰ over a one-month period explain up to 65% of the variance in leaf water δ2H for Bruguiera gymnorhiza mangroves from Palau despite lake water isotope differences among sites of up to 35‰. This indicates that in humid tropical settings, leaf water isotopes are more closely related to those of precipitation and water vapor than to those of lake surface water, explaining the observed change in apparent fractionation in B. gymnorhiza lipids with salinity. The relationship between leaf water and rainwater isotopes may be due to either equilibration of leaf water with water vapor in the nearly saturated air or direct foliar uptake of rain and/or dew.\nFoliar uptake is an important water source for many plants, but has not been documented in mangroves. We tested the capacity for mangroves to perform this function by treating leaves of Rhizophora mangroves on the island of Kosrae with artificial rain that varied in δ2H from -30 to +500‰. The influence of enriched “rain” on leaf water demonstrates how increased apparent fractionation in mangroves at high salinity may be driven by greater differences between surface water and rainwater isotopes with increasing salinity.",

The historical rates of bluff retreat are derived from 1947 T-sheet maps, various periods of satellite imagery, aerial orthophoto mosaics, and more recently acquired lidar and SfM DEM data. Coastal change rates at 50 m transect spacing have been calculated over a seven decade time span.

            "abstract": "Seismic discontinuities are fundamental to the understanding of mantle composition and dynamics. Their depth and impedance are generally determined using secondary seismic phases, most commonly SS precursors and P-to-S converted waves. However, the analysis and interpretation using these approaches often suffer from incomplete data coverage, high noise levels and interfering seismic phases, especially near tectonically complex regions such as subduction zones and continental margins. To overcome these pitfalls, we apply Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to remove random noise, reconstruct missing traces and enhance the robustness of SS precursors and P-to-S conversions from seismic discontinuities. Our method takes advantage of the predictability of time series in frequency-space domain and performs a rank reduction using a singular value decomposition of the trajectory matrix. We apply SSA to synthetic record sections as well as observations of 1) SS precursors beneath the northwestern Pacific subduction zones, and 2) P-to-S converted waves from the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). In comparison with raw or interpolated data, the SSA enhanced reflectivity maps show a greater resolution and a stronger negative correlation between the depths of the 410 and 660 km discontinuities. These effects can be attributed to the suppression of incoherent noise, which tends to reduce the signal amplitude during normal averaging procedures, through rank reduction and the emphasis of principle singular values. Our new results suggest a more laterally coherent 520 km reflection in the western Pacific regions. Similar improvements in data imaging are achieved in western Canada, where strong lateral variations in discontinuity topography are observed in the craton-Cordillera boundary zone. Improvements from SSA relative to conventional approaches are most notable in under-sampled regions.",

            "abstract": "Alkenone paleothermometry (via the Uk37and UK'37 indices) is widely used to reconstruct sea surface temperature and, more recently, lake water temperature. Genetic analyses indicate that there is a diversity of different alkenone-producing lacustrine haptophytes, and differences among UK37-temperature calibrations suggest that unique calibrations might be required to quantify past temperature variation from individual lakes. The only term needed to quantify UK37-inferred temperature relative to a reference period (e.g., modern temperature, or 20th Century mean temperature) is the slope of the calibration regression: UK37-temperature sensitivity (i.e., the change in UK37 per °C temperature change). Here, we present new data developed by culturing four different species of alkenone-producing haptophyte algae across a range of temperatures (6-30 °C) and light levels (20-200 mE). The simultaneous culture of four distinct species allows direct comparison of the absolute quantities of alkenones and alkenoates, as well as other lipids, produced by different species of haptophytes under identical environmental conditions. Our results indicate that algal growth rate, when controlled by light intensity, has no impact on values. As expected, we find that growth temperature controls both the degree of alkenone unsaturation and the relative production of alkenones vs. alkenoates in all four species. Importantly, comparison of the four UK37-temperature calibrations resulting from our experiments with preexisting calibrations supports the hypothesis that UK37-temperature sensitivity is controlled by phylogeny. Therefore, even in the absence of a site-specific calibration, this term can be used to quantify past temperature variation from lake sediments if the genetic identity of the lake’s alkenone-producer is known.",

Although substantial progress has been made over the past decade, few studies have simultaneously examined how plant stress can constrain larger scale phenomenon (e.g. plant and landscape phenology), and how large scale phenomenon (e.g. climatic extremes and variability) can impact relatively small scale processes such as plant photosynthetic stress. This study, conducted in a creosote shrubland on the USDA Jornada Experimental Range (JER) in southern New Mexico during 2012-2015, documents seasonal changes in plant and landscape phenology (NPN protocols and phenocams) across four different land cover types (LCTs). The selected LCTs includes grassland, grassland-tobosa playa, shrubland-sandy ridge, and shrubland where each vegetative growth is captured with Windscape “PlantCams” between 11:00 am and 2:00 pm MST. An image processing program (Phenology Analyzer Software), developed in-house has been used to process and analyze imagery. Regions of interest (ROIs) were chosen at the plant and landscape scale to enable inter-comparison of plant phenological trends within and between LCTs using a well-acceted greenness index (Richardson et al. 2007). Timing of green-up was similar between sites but peak greenness varied between LCTs. Shrubland greenness was substantially greater than values from other LCTs. Ongoing analysis is also exploring the utility of alternate color spaces (HSV and L*a*b*) for describing plant phenology using custom phenocams maintained on the JER by UTEP Systems Ecology Lab. This study is expected to expand current knowledge of the effects of climate variability and change in dryland ecosystems by understanding which LCTs and species are more/less sensitive to change. The study is also novel in that it will explore image processing methods that have yet to be fully explored by ecosystem scientists.",

Measurements of precipitation are sparse, and extrapolation of measurements to surrounding terrain is challenging, particularly in areas with high relief and complex topography.\nThe NASA Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) offers a unique approach to quantifying snowfall distributions. The ASO is a combined airborne laser scanner (ALS) and hyperspectral imager designed to map snow depth, water equivalent, and albedo at high resolution in mountain basins. Over the past 3 winter seasons, the ASO has collected data on a nominally weekly basis over the full extent of the Tuolumne River Basin in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California, offering an unprecedented opportunity to examine the spatial distribution of storm snowfall at high resolution in a mountain basin. Where snowfall events occurred between flights, the difference in ALS-derived elevations reveals the accumulation pattern. We demonstrate snow accumulation patterns for several snowfall events in 2013-15, and compare to other precipitation distribution products and methods.",

Samples were hydrated at 200-250 MPa and 850 °C to water contents of 5.4-6.0 wt%, followed by decompression at rates of 60-150 MPa.s-1. Samples were held at final pressures for 6-90 s, allowing for bubble growth and coalescence after decompression and nucleation. Scanning electron microscopic (SEM) images and computed tomography (CT) scans of the decompressed glasses were analyzed for size distributions of both isolated and coalesced bubbles separately. Sample porosities vary from 4% to 63%, and connected porosity is positively correlated with total porosity for samples where it is greater than approximately 35%. A steep increase in the proportion of connected bubbles is observed once the average bubble wall thickness becomes lower than approximately 2 μm. In combination with SEM, CT and bubble size distributions these results indicate that bubble coalescence is independent of bubble size. Bubble number density varies from 8.9×1011 m−3 to 4.4×1016 m−3 (melt-referenced), and is positively correlated with the degree of supersaturation (130-210 MPa), as well as initial water content. For most experiments, we do not observe any increase in bubble number density after 10-20 s, suggesting that bubble nucleation has stopped. The bubble number density does not show a systematic correlation with decompression rate.",

            "abstract": "Early crystallization of magma oceans may generate original compositional heterogeneities in the mantle. Dense basal melts may also be trapped in the lowermost mantle and explain mantle regions with ultralow seismic velocities (ULVZs) near the core-mantle boundary [1]. To test this hypothesis, we first constructed the solidus curve of a natural peridotite between 36 and 140 gigapascals using laser-heated diamond anvil cells. In our experiments, melting at core-mantle boundary pressures occurs around 4100 ± 150 K, which is a value that can match estimated mantle geotherms. Similar results were found for a chondritic mantle [2] whereas much lower pyrolitic melting temperatures were recently proposed from textural and chemical characterizations of quenched samples [3]. We also investigated the melting properties of natural mid ocean ridge basalt (MORB) up to core–mantle boundary (CMB) pressures. At CMB pressure (135 GPa), we obtain a MORB solidus temperature of 3950 ±150 K. If our solidus temperatures are in good agreement with recent results proposed for a similar composition [4], the textural and chemical characterizations of our recovered samples made by analytical transmission electron microscope indicate that CaSiO3 perovskite (CaPv) is the liquidus phase in the entire pressure range up to CMB. The partial melt composition is enriched in FeO, which suggests that such partial melts could be gravitationnally stable at the core mantle boundary.\nOur observations are tested against calculations made using a self-consistent thermodynamic database for the MgO-FeO-SiO2 system from 20 GPa to 140 GPa [5]. These observations and calculations provide a first step towards a consistent thermodynamic modelling of the crystallization sequence of the magma ocean, which shows that the existence of a dense iron rich and fusible layer above the CMB at the end of the crystallization is plausible [5], which is in contradiction with the conclusions drawn in [4].\n[1] Williams & Garnero (1996) Science 273, 1528.

Results from Principle Component Analysis indicate that El Niño/Southern Oscillation modulates the interannual variability of Western Pacific CEFs. Both Matsuno-Gill mechanism and Lindzen-Nigam mechanism are introduced and applied in order to better explain the development of CEFs. Using the Mixed Layer Model by Stevens (2002) and methods stated by Back and Bretherton (2009), the low-level CEFs are decomposed into two pressure gradient contributions: free-atmosphere and boundary layer; and further found mainly contributed by the latter one. The intensity of boundary layer pressure gradient is highly coincide with the distribution of sea surface temperature (SST) gradient on Western Pacific, which is intensified by El Niño in boreal summer. These results show that the Lindzen-Nigam mechanism plays a major role on CEFs’ interannual change. An atmosphere general circulation model is included to support the influence of SST forcing on low-level CEFs. North American Multi-Model Ensemble is further adopted to understand the seasonal predictability of CEFs.",

            "abstract": "Observations and analysis of the surface characteristics and internal structure of deep-sea brine pools are currently limited to discrete in-situ observations. Complementary acoustic and structured light imaging sensors mounted on a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) have demonstrated the ability systematically detect variations in surface characteristics of a brine pool, reveal internal stratification and detect areas of active hydrocarbon activity.\nThe presented visual and acoustic sensors combined with a stereo camera pair are mounted on the 4000m rated ROV Hercules (Ocean Exploration Trust). These three independent sensors operate simultaneously from a typical 3m altitude resulting in visual and bathymetric maps with sub-centimeter resolution.\nApplying this imaging technology to 2014 and 2015 brine pool surveys in the Gulf of Mexico revealed acoustic and visual anomalies due to the density changes inherent in the brine. Such distinct changes in acoustic impedance allowed the high frequency 1350KHz multibeam sonar to detect multiple interfaces. For instance, distinct acoustic reflections were observed at 3m and 5.5m below the vehicle. Subsequent verification using a CDT and lead line indicated the acoustic return from the brine surface was the signal at 3m, while a thicker muddy and more saline interface occurred at 5.5m, the bottom of the brine pool was not located but is assumed to be deeper than 15m. The multibeam is also capable of remotely detecting emitted gas bubbles within the brine pool, indicative of active hydrocarbon seeps. Bubbles associated with these seeps were not consistently visible above the brine while using the HD camera on the ROV.\nAdditionally, while imaging the surface of brine pool the structured light sheet laser became diffuse, refracting across the main interface. Analysis of this refraction combined with varying acoustic returns allow for systematic and remote detection of the density, stratification and activity levels within and across a brine pool. Furthermore, a typical ‘mowing the lawn’ survey covering an area of 30m x 30m can be completed in approximately 1 hour. Multiple surveys over time will indicate the stability of a particular brine system and can be used for the long term monitoring of hydrocarbon seeps.",

Adaptive optics (AO) systems are used to help ground telescopes achieve diffraction-limited seeing. AO systems have historically relied on the use of bright natural guide stars or laser guide stars projected on a layer of the upper atmosphere by ground laser systems. There are several challenges with this approach such as the sidereal motion of GEO objects relative to natural guide stars and limitations of ground-based laser guide stars; they cannot be used to correct tip-tilt, they are not point sources, and have finite angular sizes when detected at the receiver. There is a difference between the wavefront error measured using the guide star compared with the target due to cone effect, which also makes it difficult to use a distributed aperture system with a larger baseline to improve resolution. \nInspired by previous concepts proposed by A.H. Greenaway, we present using a space-based laser guide starprojected from a satellite orbiting the Earth. We show that a nanosatellite-based guide star system meets the needs for imaging GEO objects using a low power laser even from 36,000 km altitude. Satellite guide star (SGS) systemswould be well above atmospheric turbulence and could provide a small angular size reference source. CubeSatsoffer inexpensive, frequent access to space at a fraction of the cost of traditional systems, and are now being deployed to geostationary orbits and on interplanetary trajectories. The fundamental CubeSat bus unit of 10 cm cubed can be combined in multiple units and offers a common form factor allowing for easy integration as secondary payloads on traditional launches and rapid testing of new technologies on-orbit. We describe a 6U CubeSat SGS measuring 10 cm x 20 cm x 30 cm with laser power on the order of milliwatts, and a commercial off the shelf based attitude determination and control system, among others. Different from standard 1U and 3U buses, the 6U form factor allows for a propulsion system for navigating around multiple targets in the GEO belt.",

It is thus critically important to fully understand the sensitivity of MCP and CEM detectors in situ. In the lab, MCPs are estimated to be ~ 20 times more sensitive per unit input area than CEMs. We will compare the background rates for two recent instruments, the Helium Oxygen Proton Electron (HOPE) mass spectrometer for the Van Allen Probes, and the Fast Plasma Investigation (FPI) instrument suite on the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission to their respective penetrating radiation environment and estimate the relative response rates for these two types of detectors.",

            "abstract": "During periods when the z-component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) becomes negative, the dayside auroral oval moves equatorward [Feldstein and Starkov, 1967; Horrwitz and Akasofu, 1977]. During these expansion periods poleward-auroral moving forms (PMAFs) are observed. PMAFs are also observed during periods when the auroral oval is expanded. PMAFs are not observed when the dayside auroral oval moves poleward of 79° [Lockwood et al., 1989]. Past studies of PMAFs show that they drift poleward and fade [Vorobjev et al., 1975; Horwitz and Akasofu, 1977; Sandholt et al., 1986, 1989, 1990; Rairden and Mende, 1989; Lockwood, 1991], rebrighten as they drift into the polar cap [Fasel et al., 1992, 1994; Fasel, 1995], or rebrighten and slow down while moving into the polar cap, eventually stopping while maintaining their luminosity at least 10 minutes [Fasel, 1995; Fasel et al., 1995]. Fasel [1995] classified these three types of PMAFs as PMAF1, PMAF2, PMAF3 events, respectively.\nThis study looks at the three classes of PMAF events. The study will show the brightening histories of the PMAF events and their evolution as they move into the polar cap. PMAF1 events usually do not drift as far poleward as PMAF2 and PMAF3 events. The lifetime of PMAF1 events are shorter than those of PMAF2 and PMAF3 events. At least two rebrightenings are observed in PMAF2 and PMAF3 events as they drift into the polar cap.",

            "abstract": "Three-dimensional transpressional strain is commonly associated with zones of oblique convergence, rather than ideal 2D simple shear or pure shear. Consequently, a considerable body of modeling has been aimed at understanding the progressive evolution of transpression, which has been used to explain an assortment of structures observed in natural settings. The basic tenants of most models involve simultaneous strike-slip and shortening, which provide the underlying mechanism for a constantly evolving finite strain geometry and magnitude. Despite the obvious temporal-dependence, very few studies have evaluated timescales of transpression. In the Northern Appalachians, the Bronson Hill arc and Central Maine basin of southern New England largely reflect highly oblique dextral transpression. Fabrics were initially characterized by strong foliations, subhorizontal lineations, and dextral kinematics, all of which are present in 360-354 Ma tonalite, diorite, and granite intrusions, the youngest placing a maximum age on transpression. As strains accumulated, fabrics began to reflect the increasing manipulation of the shortening component, marked by tightening of foliations, closed to isoclinal folding, and reverse high strain zones; stretching lineations changed in orientation to steeply plunging parallel to dip, while older pre-existing subhorizontal lineations were rotated. Syntectonic monazite and metamorphic zircon nucleated episodically throughout this time. Y-enriched monazite nucleated at 330 Ma along with fabric-forming biotite and sillimanite, and place a minimum age on the development of dip-parallel lineations. Mineral assemblages and associated ages document retrograde cooling attending deformation from partial melting at 355-350 Ma, to sillimanite grade at 330 Ma, below the Ar closure temperature for amphibole of 500°C at 326-314 Ma, and into biotite grade deformation as young as 295 Ma. Collectively, structures, fabrics, mineral assemblages, and petrochronology reveal that mid-crustal transpression in the Northern Appalachians was sustained for 60 million years, while the fabric geometry evolved only over the course of the first 25 million years from ~355 Ma to ~330 Ma at relatively high temperatures. The common assumption of extrusion is also valid even in the middle crust.",

Snow can also cause potentially hazardous weather, and rapidly-melting snowpack may cause flooding. For large-scale weather monitoring, snowfall observations from ground radar have become highly desirable. However, verification and refinement of these retrievals requires ground-validation datasets. This study conducts a comprehensive evaluation of NOAA/NSSL Multi-Radar/ Multi-Sensor (MRMS) snowfall products using the Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) hourly and daily precipitation and Snow Water Equivalent (SWE) datasets. The statistical analysis reveals that the MRMS snowfall estimation has bias compared to SNOTEL in-situ measurements. The bias between MRMS and SNOTEL is studied by considering environmental variables, radar beam sampling characteristics (blockage, beam height and width) and snow density. We expect a step forward towards establishing a robust surface-based snowfall reference database in West Mountainous Region, which can be shared with the satellite snowfall and snowpack community.",

Here, we present two case studies from Death Valley National Park – Devils Hole and Travertine Springs – in which physical parameters are used as proxies for ecological processes to assess the consequences of environmental change on aquatic ecosystems. In Devils Hole, seasonal thresholds for water temperature and food availability are defined to quantify the optimal recruitment window for the Devils Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis). At Travertine Springs, physical thresholds of water depth, velocity, and temperature are used to define the spatial extent of the preferred habitat of several threatened macroinvertebrate species. In both systems, mechanistic models are developed to predict the response of those physical thresholds to changing environmental conditions informed by climate change scenarios and potential changes in water availability. By examining the temporal and spatial response of targeted physical parameters to alternative scenarios, we can assess potential ecosystem impacts without direct measurement of ecological processes.",

            "abstract": "This presentation explores the biogeophysical impacts of land use/land cover (LULC) in the Southeastern U.S. over the past century. A reconstructed LULC change dataset was constructed from a series of existing LULC datasets. Land surface and satellite observations were analyzed to estimate the net radiative forcing due to LULC change. Albedo and latent energy were specifically addressed for the dominant land use change of agriculture to evergreen forests. The results show that in the Southeastern U.S. for the period of 1920 to 1992 the change in sensible (as a result of albedo) and latent energies are in direct competition with each other. In the spring and early summer months, the croplands are in peak production and the latent energy associated with their ET is comparable to that of the forested areas, so the change in radiation due to albedo dominates the signal. However, during the late summer and fall months most major crops have matured (or been harvested) thus reducing their transpiration rate while forests (particularly evergreens) maintain their foliage; and with their deep roots, are able to continue to transpire as long as atmospheric conditions are favorable. This later influence of latent energy appears to more than offset the increased radiative forcing from the spring and early summer. Overall, the mean annual net radiative forcing as a result of the LULC change from cropland and forests is estimated to be -1.06 w/m2. This result supports a probable contribution to the ‘warming hole’ over the Southeast during the majority of the 20th century.",

We have performed laboratory experiments in order to assess the processes of evaporation and infiltration of fuel spilled onto concrete samples. Changes in mass of both spilled diesel and gasoline droplets as a function of time have been analyzed. The infiltrated mass is affected by variations in humidity, among other parameters, which influence the amount of water condensed onto the concrete. Therefore, we used a humidity data logger and statistical tools to predict the evolution of the real mass of infiltrated fuel. The infiltrated mass roughly decreases exponentially, but the difference in behavior between both fuel types is important. The percentage of evaporated mass is much larger for gasoline, while infiltration is more significant for diesel. Also, the percentage of infiltrated liquid depends on the initial droplet mass. We also developed a multiphysics model, which couples pore-scale infiltration to turbulent atmospheric transport, to explain the experimental data. In conclusion, a substantial amount of fuel could both seep into the ground to contaminate groundwater and be released to the atmosphere. More studies are needed to quantify the public health implications of the released pollutants.",

Since the receivers would record the full wave field (direct waves, up- and downward reflections, multiples, etc.), this would give a wealth of information about the local structures, material properties and processes in the earth's interior. Although in reality one cannot place sources and receivers anywhere inside the earth, it appears to be possible to create virtual sources and receivers at any desired position, which accurately mimics the desired situation. The underlying method involves some major steps beyond standard seismic interferometry. With seismic interferometry, virtual sources can be created at the positions of physical receivers, assuming these receivers are illuminated isotropically. Our proposed method does not need physical receivers at the positions of the virtual sources; moreover, it does not require isotropic illumination. To create virtual sources and receivers anywhere inside the earth, it suffices to record the reflection response with physical sources and receivers at the earth's surface. We do not need detailed information about the medium parameters; it suffices to have an estimate of the direct waves between the virtual-source positions and the acquisition surface. With these prerequisites, our method can create virtual sources and receivers, anywhere inside the earth, which record the full wave field. The up- and downward reflections, multiples, etc. in the virtual responses are extracted directly from the reflection response at the surface. The retrieved virtual responses form an ideal starting point for accurate seismic imaging, characterization and monitoring.",

Coseismic and postseismic deformation from these events affect efforts to use Global Positioning System (GPS) observations collected since these events to establish a secular surface velocity field, especially in the near field of the coseismic ruptures. We devise block motion models constrained by both historical pre-Landers triangulation and trilateration observations and post-Landers GPS measurements to recover the secular deformation field and differentiate the postseismic transients in the Mojave region. Postseismic transients are found to remain in various “interseismic” GPS velocity solutions in the form of 2-3 mm/yr excess right-lateral shear across the Landers and Hector Mine coseismic ruptures [Liu et al., 2015 JGR]. Postseismic GPS time series differentiated from the secular velocity field reveal enduring late-stage transient motions in the near field of the coseismic ruptures. Using the postseismic time series data as model constraints, we develop postseismic deformation model invoking afterlip on faults and viscoelastic relaxation in the lower crust and upper mantle. A Burgers body material and a Maxwell material are assumed for the lower crust and upper mantle respectively. Our preliminary modeling result, constrained using GPS time series data from the SCEC Crustal Motion Map 4.0 (covering the time period of 1992-2004), reveals that both the long-term viscosities for the lower crust and upper mantle are on the order of e+19 Pa-s. This finding differs significantly from the “Crème Brulee” model predictions about the rheological structure of the lower crust and upper mantle, in which the lower crust has a substantially higher viscosity. We are incorporating more GPS time series data into our model, particularly the ones from continuous sites of the Plate Boundary Observatory network with post-2004 time span, and the modeling result will be presented at the meeting.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_timmermans_poster.pdf\nRecent studies have investigated how regional and global wave climate may change in a warmer world. The approach is often to project wave climate by using output from atmospheric circulation models, either as input to statistical downscaling methods that determine the resulting waves, or as forcing for numerical wind-wave models. An important influence on the wave climate is the frequency and intensity of tropical cyclones, but to date, many atmospheric models have been run at resolutions too low (~1.0 degree) to accurately reproduce such phenomenon, which in turn has lead to poor predictions of waves in affected regions. Tropical cyclones therefore remain an important source of uncertainty in projections of wave climate. However, output from recent high resolution simulations (~0.25 degree) of atmospheric circulation shows considerable improvement in the model's ability to simulate tropical cyclones. In order to investigate the importance of this issue on projections of waves, we present results of the analysis of wave climate in the North Atlantic, by forcing the global wave model, Wavewatch III, with both low and high resolution output from the Community Atmosphere Model 5.1, under atmospheric conditions of both the early 1990s, and conditions with a 2 degree increase in sea surface temperature and increased atmospheric CO2. Extremes of the wave climatology in the North Atlantic are examined and the consequences for the U.S. eastern seaboard are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Drylands cover 41% of global land surface, and the carbon balance of these ecosystems is water limited. In the Southwestern United States precipitation events are infrequent and unpredictable with great spatial and temporal variation. “Pulses” of water availability are often the major driver of nutrient cycling and vegetation productivity. Rain induces biological activity and the ecosystm carbon balance depends on carbon fixed by plants in photosynthesis and carbon lost via heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration during and after precipitation. The current paradigm is that soil microbes respond rapidly to small rainfall events whilst plants respond to relatively larger pulses. Therefore arid ecosystems are predicted to act as a carbon source immediately following rainfall followed by a period of carbon accumulation while soil moisture is available.\nAt three flux-tower sites, two desert grasslands and a creosote shrubland, all in New Mexico, continuous measurements of carbon, water and energy fluxes and micrometeorology can be used to determine if respiration pulses occur following precipitation events. We identified all rain pulses during the growing season each year that were followed by five dry days to assess the structure of pulses and their abiotic controls.\nRegardless of conditions before rain only 39% (68/175) of precipitation pulses show a classic carbon-out, carbon-in response, with variation in timing (on day of rain to 5 days post-rain) and size (0.1–1 g C m-2 day-1) of respiratory peak. Rain often led to no identifiable gross primary production (carbon uptake) by plants. Rather, pulses are remarkably variable in size and duration. Analyses using multivariate autoregressive state-space (MARSS) models indicated that the shape of different subsets of pulses varied as a function of season, available soil moisture before a pulse, size of a rain pulse, and whether the system is a carbon source or sink before rain.\nThe complexity of precipitation pulses and carbon fluxes is in the size and sensitivity of both photosynthetic and respiratory responses. Understanding how these natural systems respond to rain is important for estimating future carbon storage capacity under altered precipitation regimes and assessing the potential contribution of arid and semi-arid ecosystems to the global carbon budget.",

            "abstract": "The Amazon basin is a biodiversity biome and plays a significant role into shaping the earth’s climate, ocean and atmospheric gases. Understanding the history of the formation of the basin is essential to our understanding of the region’s biodiversity loss and response to climate change. Ancient River channels in lowland Amazonia exhibit right angle branching structures as well as intricately intertwined channels. Past research has attributed these characteristic as a result of subsurface faults but makes it difficult to validate this augment due to dense vegetation and sedimentation. We seek to employ remote sensing techniques for examining geomorphological features and the relationship to evolutionary processes that shaped biodiversity in the modern Amazon River Basin.\nWe utilize UAVSAR imagery gathered from the NASA/JPL airborne imaging radar over the Planalto, in the Madre de Dios region of Southeastern Peru in an assessment of the underlying geomorphology, its relationship to the current distribution of vegetation, and geologic processes through deep time. In the late Neogene, the Amazonian lowlands comprised either a series of independent basins or a single sedimentary basin. The Amazonian Planalto is variously described as either erosional surface or a surface of deposition. We employ UAVSAR data collection to assess (1) the utility of these radar data for use in identifying associated geomorphologic features, and (2) UAVSAR’s utility in aiding interpretation of ALOS PALSAR and STRM datasets to support a basin-wide characterization. We derive maps of river networks using a canny based edge detection method applied on the UAVSAR backscatter images. We develop an algorithm, which separates the river networks into various catchments based on connected component and then calculates angles at each branch point. We then assess distribution of right angle branching structure throughout the entire region. The results of the analysis will have a major impact on interpretation of the evolutionary history of the Amazon Basin.\nWe are grateful to Naira Pinto and JPL UAVSAR for the acquisition of the UAVSAR data and NASA Biodiversity Program for funding, JAXA Kyoto and Carbon initiative, JAXA EORC and Alaska Satellite Facility for providing PALSAR data, and the NSF DIMENSIONS of Biodiversity program for the grant.",

            "abstract": "The shrinking summer Arctic sea ice extent (SIE) over the satellite era has challenged our understanding of the climate system. In response to changes in anthropogenic radiative forcings, the multi-model ensemble mean summer Arctic SIE in CMIP5 simulations shows a less dramatic decline than observed during the recent global warming hiatus period, implying that natural variability may have played an important role in the observed decline. Here the mechanisms for low-frequency variability of summer Arctic SIE are studied using long control simulations from three coupled climate models: GFDL CM2.1, GFDL CM3, and NCAR CESM. It is found that Atlantic/Pacific oceanic heat transport into the Arctic and the Arctic Dipole are key players for the low-frequency variability of summer Arctic sea ice concentration in all three models. Compared with satellite observations, the climatological mean summer Arctic SIE appears to be simulated most realistically in GFDL CM3; ice extent is much smaller than observed in GFDL CM2.1 and much larger in NCAR CESM. In all three models, a positive Arctic Dipole phase leads to a reduction of summer Arctic sea ice concentrations on the Pacific side and an increase on the Atlantic side by transporting more ice from the Pacific side to the Atlantic side. In both GFDL CM2.1 and CM3, the increase of sea ice extent on the Atlantic side is less than the reduction on the Pacific side; hence a positive Arctic Dipole leads to a net reduction of the summer Arctic SIE. However, in NCAR CESM due to the excessive climatological sea ice on the Atlantic side, reduction of sea ice on the Pacific side is largely balanced by the expansion on the Atlantic side, resulting in an insignificant net impact of the Arctic Dipole on the summer Arctic SIE. In all three models, variations in the atmospheric heat transport across the Arctic Circle are forced by anti-correlated variations in the Atlantic oceanic heat transport into the Arctic, which provides a negative feedback on summer Arctic SIE variations.",

            "abstract": "It is possible to examine the quality of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) as a measure of soil moisture content in the shallow vadose zone, where roots are most abundant and water conservation best management practices are critical in active agricultural fields. By analyzing temporal samplings of 100 Mhz reflection profiles and common-midpoint (CMP) soundings over a full growing season, the variability of vertical soil moisture distribution directly after irrigation events are characterized throughout the lifecycle of a production crop. Reflection profiles produce high-resolution travel time data and summed results of CMP sounding data provide sampling depth estimates for the weak, but coherent reflections amid strong point scatterers. The high ratio of clay in the soil limits the resolution of downward propagation of infiltrating moisture after irrigation; synthetic data analysis compared against soil moisture lysimeter logs throughout the profile allow identification of the discrete soil moisture content variation in the measured GPR data. The nature of short duration irrigation events, evapotranspiration, and drainage behavior in relation to root depths observed in the GPR temporal data allow further examination and comparison with the variable saturation model HYDRUS-1D. After retrieving soil hydraulic properties derived from laboratory measured soil samples and simplified assumptions about boundary conditions, the project aims to achieve good agreement between simulated and measured soil moisture profiles without the need for excessive model calibration for GPR-derived soil moisture estimates in an agricultural setting.",

Moreover, the exponents of these two functions are connected with a proper accuracy by the standard “magic relation”, 10q-2p=1. Recent massive numerical experiments as far as experiments in wave tanks also confirm this magic relation. All these experimental facts can be interpreted in a framework of the following simple theory. The wind-driven sea is described by the “conservative” Hasselmann kinetic equation. The source terms, wind input and white-capping dissipation, play a secondary role in comparison with the nonlinear term Snl that is responsible for the four-wave resonant interaction. This equation has four-parameter family of self-similar solutions. The magic relation holds for all numbers of this family. This fact gives strong hope that development of self-consistent analytic theory of wind-driven sea is quite realizable task.",

The lower section consists of early to late Oligocene coarse volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks, and is overlain by late Oligocene to Pleistocene nannofossil chalks and oozes with volcanic sand and ash-rich layers. We have studied the chemical composition of pyroxene, feldspar and glass grains separated from the coarse volcaniclastic rocks at depths from 435 to 1082 meters below sea floor, and of glass shards in layers in the overlying sediments of late Oligocene to early Miocene age. Overall, pyroxene and feldspar compositions show little systematic variation with depth in the core, although for pyroxene, highest En and highest Al2O3 contents are found in the interval from 600-900 meters bsf. An contents in feldspars show a bimodal distribution throughout the core, with most values > 90 or in the range 60-70, with more abundant intermediate compositions in the 600-900 meter interval. Compositions of glass shards vary widely, from basalt to rhyolite, and from low K, light rare earth (LREE)-depleted to high K, strongly LREE-enriched character, without systematic variation with depth in the core. However, all cores sampled from early Oligocene to early Miocene contain relatively low K basalt and basaltic andesite glass. Like the pyroxenes, a wider range of compositions is found in glass from the 600 to 900 mbsf interval. The Site 296 sequence overlaps in age with the uppermost sedimentary section of recently drilled IODP Site 1438, located 230 km to the southwest in the Amami Sankaku basin, thus the two sites may contain volcanic debris shed from contemporaneous sections of the KPR.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic climate change is leading to dramatic fluctuations to Earth’s biodiversity that has not been observed since past interglacial periods. There is rising concern that Earth’s warming climate will have significant impacts to current species ranges and the ability of a species to persist in a rapidly changing environment. The paleorecord provides information on past species distributions in relation to climate change, which can illuminate the patterns of potential future distributions of species. Particularly in areas where there are multiple potential limiting factors on a species’ range, e.g. temperature, radiation, and evaporative demand, the spatial patterns of species migrations may be particularly complex. In this study, we assessed the change in the distributions of white spruce (Picea glauca) from the Last Glacial Maxima (LGM) to present-day for the entire state of Alaska. To accomplish this, we created species distribution models (SDMs) calibrated from modern vegetation data and high-resolution, downscaled climate surfaces at 60m. These SDMs were applied to downscaled modern and paleoclimate surfaces to produce estimated ranges of white spruce during the LGM and today. From this, we assessed the “species velocity”, the rate at which white spruce would need to migrate to keep pace with climate change, with the goal of determining whether the expansion from the LGM to today originated from microclimate refugia. Higher species velocities indicate locations where climate changed drastically and white spruce would have needed to migrate rapidly to persist and avoid local extinction. Conversely, lower species velocities indicated locations where the local climate was changing less rapidly or was within the center of the range of white spruce, and indicated locations where white spruce distributions were unlikely to have changed significantly. Our results indicate the importance of topographic complexity in buffering the effects of climate change, particularly near the edges of the species’ range.",

            "abstract": "The relationship between surface melt and ice motion partly determines the sensitivity of the Greenland Ice Sheet to climate, and the structure of the subglacial drainage system may be critical in controlling how changing melt-rates will impact on future ice dynamics. However, the extent to which efficient subglacial drainage develops tens of km inland from the ice margin under thick (>1km) ice remains equivocal. In particular, several numerical modelling studies suggest that under such conditions subglacial channels cannot evolve on seasonal timescales, even under extreme inputs of surface meltwater.\nHere, we present hydrological and ice-motion data collected in summer 2012 in the vicinity of a moulin located ~40 km from the western margin of the Greenland Ice Sheet, where ice is ~1km thick. Supraglacial discharge into the moulin was monitored from the onset of surface drainage and the tracer sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) was injected into the moulin at repeat intervals and its emergence was monitored at its proglacial river outlet. The tracer results indicate rapid evolution from a slow, inefficient drainage system to a fast, hydraulically efficient system within ~three weeks from the onset of surface drainage. Once an efficient hydrological pathway was established, it remained open - as evidenced by the fast tracer return times - even during periods of low surface melt (~0.01m/d), when discharge into the moulin was <4 m3 s-1 and ceased overnight. Ice motion in the vicinity of the moulin slowed following the establishment of the efficient drainage pathway with a clear diurnal cyclicity driven by variations in supraglacial discharge. \nOur results confirm that hydraulically-efficient subglacial drainage can exist 10s km from the ice sheet margin where ice is ~1km thick, that the drainage configuration can form in a matter of weeks, and that it persists even during cool periods when local surface melt rates and inputs are low.",

            "abstract": "The bathymetry from the surfzone to the shoreline incurs active movement due to wave energy interacting with the seafloor. Measurement of the bathymetry is difficult without direct deployment of single-beam or multi-beam sonar mounted on a boat or jet ski. While these direct measurements are optimal, they are usually limited in space and time. Only a small section of a coastline can be measured during a collection, and it often can be years before another survey is conducted.\nIn this work, we consider a framework for estimating bathymetry in the nearshore that combines model-based inversion with standoff measurement. Standoff measurements allow flexible deployment over large spatial ranges with longer look times than are available from satellite-based platforms, but often do not provide direct measurements of the seabed, necessitating an inverse model. The coupling of nearshore wave measurements with numerical models can provide continuously evolving bathymetry estimates with larger spatial coverage than is available with standard techniques. The considered framework incorporates a variety of sensors including X-band radar, LiDAR, and video imagery to provide measurements of wave height, wave speed, or energy dissipation in order to drive the inversion model. Here, we evaluate a test case at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Field Research Facility where we are able to constrain the inversion problem using a number of different data measurement methods. A methodology for handling both data sparse and data rich environments is examined to determine the impact on the resulting bathymetry. Additionally, reduced order modeling and sampling based frameworks are evaluated for potential performance improvements.",

            "abstract": "Magnetic reconnection is present in most of the unsteady and eruptive phenomena in the Sun atmosphere, including Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and solar flares. Also, it occurs in the chromosphere, bringing about chromospheric jets and spicules and being considered a likely mechanism to play an important role in heating up the corona. In this work, we present a computational model that simulates magnetic reconnection in the Sun chromosphere using a three-fluid model (electrons + ions + neutrals). The model treats separately ions, electrons and neutrals, considering mass, momentum and energy conservation for each fluid. The fluids interact among each other by means of collisions and chemical reactions. The charged particles heat fluxes are anisotropic with the magnetic field, following Braginskii’s description. This model also considers non-equilibrium partial ionization effects including electron impact ionization, radiative recombination reactions and charge exchange. The electromagnetic field evolution is represented by the full Maxwell’s equations, allowing for high frequency waves disregarded by the MHD approximation. Previous two-fluid simulations showed that the dynamics of ions and neutrals are decoupled during the reconnection process when the width of the current sheet becomes comparable to the ion scales. Also, the effect of the chemical non-equilibrium in the reconnection region plays a crucial role, yielding faster reconnection rates. We extended these simulations with a three-fluid model that considers separately the dynamics of electrons. This new model provides a better description of the complex dynamics taking place during the reconnection, both in Sweet-Parker reconnections and during the tearing instability. The results are compared with the two-fluid simulations.",

            "abstract": "Alpine-type orogens are interpreted as result from the collision of former rifted margins. Recent studies showed that the rift-architecture inheritance could play a critical role in controlling the 4D evolution of Alpine-type orogens. In this framework, differences of inversion modes between the internal and external zones of the Western Alps can be related to the pre-orogenic rift-related domains. The external zone is affected by mild reactivation of the former proximal margin domain. On the other hand, the internal zone results from the reactivation of the former distal margin domain. This caused the stacking of a complex pile of pre- and syn-rift sequences against the ‘necking zone’, that is the locus where the lithosphere dramatically thins. The ‘necking zone’ separates the proximal and distal domains and acts as a buttress for shortening. Indeed, both rift architecture and shape of necking play a fundamental role in the building up of an Alpine-type orogen. In this study, we use analog modeling to investigate the role of extension-rate in rift-architecture.\nWe simulated an ideal 4-layer lithosphere where brittle and ductile crustal layers rest on top of brittle and ductile mantle layers. The entire experimental lithosphere floats over a fluid analogue of the asthenosphere. Models were deformed pulling apart a mobile wall of the sandbox that confined the experimental lithosphere. We investigated three different extensional velocities, spanning one-order of magnitude. At the end of deformation, rift architectures show severe differences as a function of extension-rates, at both crustal and lithospheric scales. In particular, at lithospheric scales, localized necking occurred at low extension-rates, while a more distributed deformation happened with increasing the extensional velocity. At crustal scale, well-developed and localized necking zones formed for low and intermediate extension-rates, while tapering occurred over a wide cross-sectional length in high-velocity models.\nBased on the results of our experimental programme, we infer that the inherited rift architectures that have been described in the Western Alps as the locus of major buttressing during the orogenic stage, were likely produced at intermediate to low extensional velocities.",

            "abstract": "Aquatic ecosystems at high-elevations in the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA) are sensitive to the effects of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition. Current and historic N deposition has impacted aquatic ecosystems in the GYA and N deposition is increasing in many areas. Anticipated changes in atmospheric emissions may further affect these sensitive ecosystems. Understanding the spatial variation in atmospheric N deposition is needed to develop estimates of air pollution critical loads for aquatic ecosystems in complex terrain. For the GYA, high resolution (400 meter) maps were developed for 1993-2014 to identify areas of high loading of mean annual Total N deposition (wet + dry) and wet deposition of inorganic N (nitrate and ammonium). Total N deposition estimates in the GYA range from ≤ 1.4 to 7.5 kg N ha-1 yr-1 and show greater variability than inorganic N deposition. Spatially explicit estimates of critical loads of N deposition (CLNdep) for nutrient enrichment in aquatic ecosystems were developed using a geostatistical approach. CLNdep in the GYA ranges from less than 1.5 kg N ha-1 yr-1 to over 10 kg N ha-1 yr-1 and variability is controlled by differences in basin characteristics. The lowest CLNdep estimates occurred in high-elevation basins with steep slopes, sparse vegetation, and exposed bedrock, including areas within GYA Wilderness boundaries. These areas often have high inorganic N deposition (>3 kg N ha-1 yr-1), resulting in CLNdep exceedances greater than 1.5 kg N ha-1 yr-1. The N deposition maps were used to identify CLNdep exceedances for aquatic ecosystems, and to explore scale dependence and boundary issues related to estimating CLNdep. Based on a NO3- threshold of 1.0 μmol L-1, inorganic N deposition exceeds CLNdep in 12% of the GYA, and Total N deposition is in exceedance for 23% of the GYA. These maps can be used to help identify and protect sensitive ecosystems that may be impacted by excess N deposition in the GYA.",

            "abstract": "In probabilistic seismic hazard and risk assessments seismic sources are typically divided into two groups: fault sources (to model known faults) and background sources (to model unknown faults). In areas like the Central and Eastern United States and Hawaii the hazard and risk is driven primarily by background sources. Background sources can be modeled as areas, points or pseudo-faults. When background sources are modeled as pseudo-faults, magnitude-length or magnitude-area scaling relationships are required to construct these pseudo-faults. However the uncertainty associated with these relationships is often ignored or discarded in hazard and risk models, particularly when faults sources are the dominant contributor. Conversely, in areas modeled only with background sources these uncertainties are much more significant. In this study we test the impact of using various relationships and the resulting epistemic uncertainties on the seismic hazard and risk in the Central and Eastern United States and Hawaii. It is common to use only one magnitude length relationship when calculating hazard. However, Stirling et al. (2013) showed that for a given suite of magnitude-rupture length relationships the variability can be quite large. The 2014 US National Seismic Hazard Maps (Petersen et al., 2014) used one magnitude-rupture length relationship (Somerville, et al., 2001) in the Central and Eastern United States, and did not consider variability in the seismogenic rupture plane width. Here we use a suite of metrics to compare the USGS approach with these variable uncertainty models to assess 1) the impact on hazard and risk and 2) the epistemic uncertainty associated with choice of relationship. In areas where the seismic hazard is dominated by larger crustal faults (e.g. New Madrid) the choice of magnitude-rupture length relationship has little impact on the hazard or risk. However away from these regions, the choice of relationship is more significant and may approach the size of the uncertainty associated with the ground motion prediction equation suite.",

            "abstract": "The mountain pine beetle has dramatically altered ecohydrologic processes of lodgepole pine forests in western North America, having caused one of the largest insect-driven tree mortalities in recorded history. Documented and modeled responses to forest mortality include cessation of overstory transpiration, local increases in soil moisture, changes in snow accumulation and ablation, differences in groundwater and runoff contributions to streamflow, changes in sensible and latent heat partitioning, and higher surface temperatures and ground evaporation. However, the scale-sensitivity, spatial variability and interdependence of these responses, and the simultaneous process of forest recovery, mean that watershed response to infestation is often inconsistent and damped at large scales, making it difficult to capture individual hydrologic and energy components of disturbance. This study resolves complicated feedbacks from disturbance at the land surface to responses in the atmosphere with the use of the physically-based, integrated hydrologic model ParFlow, coupled to the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) atmospheric model. The model domain, constructed at 1-km resolution, encompasses a 25,200 square kilometer region over a Rocky Mountain headwaters catchment in Colorado. Land use and vegetation parameters within WRF were adjusted in a detailed ensemble approach to reflect beetle-induced reductions in stomatal conductivity and LAI. Results show spatially variable but generally increased soil moisture and water yield with infestation. Subsequent disturbance of the sensible and latent heat balance propagates into the atmosphere, influencing atmospheric moisture, stability and even precipitation. This work presents the applicability of a deterministic, integrated climate-hydrologic model to identify complicated physical interactions occurring with forest disturbance, which may not be discernable with simpler models or observations.",

For the first time, the proposed Surface Water Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission will provide regular, simultaneous observations of inundation extent and water level from space. SWOT is unique and distinct from precursor altimetry missions in some notable regards: 1) 100km+ of swath will provide complete ocean coverage, 2) in addition to the ocean product, land surface water will be mapped for storage measurement and discharge estimation and 3) Ka-band single-pass interferometry will produce the height measurements introducing a new measurement technique. This new approach introduces additional algorithmic, characterization and calibration/validation needs for which the Ka-band SWOT Phenomenology Airborne Radar (KaSPAR) was developed. In May 2015, AirSWOT (comprised of KaSPAR and a color infrared (CIR) high resolution aerial camera) was part of an intensive field campaign including observations of inundation extent and water level and in situ hydrologic measurements in two rivers and 20 lakes within the Yukon River Basin, Alaska.\nOne goal is to explore the fundamental phenomenology of the SWOT measurement. This includes assessment of the effects of vegetation layover and attenuation, wind roughening and classification. Further KaSPAR-derived inundation extent will to be validated using a combination of ground surveys and coregistered CIR imagery. Ultimately, by combining measurements of changing inundation extent and water level between two collection dates, it will be possible to validate lake water storage variations against storage changes computed from in situ water levels and inundation area derived from AirSWOT. Our paper summarizes the campaign, the airborne and in situ measurements and presents some initial KaSPAR and CIR imagery from the Yukon flats region.",

            "abstract": "Aerosol light absorption in the solar spectral region (300 nm – 2300 nm) of the atmosphere is key for the direct aerosol radiative forcing, which is determined by aerosol single scattering albedo (SSA), asymmetry parameter, and by the albedo of the underlying surface. SSA is of key importance for the sign and quantity of aerosol direct radiative forcing; that is, does the aerosol make the earth look darker (heating) or whiter (cooling)? In addition, these optical properties are needed for satellite retrievals of aerosol optical depth and properties.\nDuring wildland fires, aerosol optical absorption is largely determined by black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC) emissions. BC is strongly absorbing throughout the solar spectrum, while BrC absorption strongly increases toward shorter wavelength and can be neglected in the red and infrared. Optical properties of BrC emitted from wildland fires are poorly understood and need to be studied as function of fuel type and moisture content and combustion conditions. While much more is known about BC optical properties, knowledge for the ultraviolet (UV) spectral region is still lacking and critically needed for satellite remote sensing (e.g., TOMS, OMI) and for modeling of tropospheric photochemistry.\nHere, a project to better characterize biomass burning aerosol optical properties is described. It utilizes a laboratory biomass combustion chamber to generate aerosols through combustion of different wildland fuels of global and regional importance. Combustion aerosol optics is characterized with an integrating nephelometer to measure aerosol light scattering and a photoacoustic instrument to measure aerosol light absorption. These measurements will yield optical properties that are needed to improve qualitative and quantitative understanding of aerosol radiative forcing and satellite retrievals for absorbing carbonaceous aerosols from combustion of wildland fuels.",

            "abstract": "Emerged shoreline deposits are the most important records for studying relative sea level (RSL) of previous interglacial and understanding glacial/hydro isostasy. The Lower Atlantic Coastal Plain in the U.S. is characterized by coast-parallel barrier beaches and back-barrier deposits formed during maximum Pleistocene marine transgressions. Thus, they offer an opportunity to investigate RSL changes of multiple Pleistocene interglacials. However, the chronology of these deposits has been controversial due to the lack of reliable numerical ages, especially in South Carolina. Here we present stratigraphy and OSL dating results for both the late Pleistocene barrier and the back-barrier deposits between Georgetown and Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and discuss their sea-level implications.\nThe barrier ridge near Georgetown is covered by about 1 m aeolian deposits dated to ~20 ka. The aeolian deposits overlie humic sand and laminated beach sand that is dated to ~80 ka, corresponding to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5a. Stratigraphy of back-barrier deposits exposed along the Intracoastal Waterway near Myrtle Beach reveals a unit of back-barrier deposits separated from underlying shallow marine deposits by a paleosol. The back-barrier deposits are dated to MIS 5a while the lower shallow marine deposits yielded OSL ages corresponding to MIS 7 (~200 ka).\nThe beach sand near Georgetown and the back-barrier deposits near Myrtle Beach together suggest that MIS 5a RSL was up to about 5 m above present sea level while the shallow marine deposits near Myrtle Beach indicate a MIS 7 RSL at or above present sea level along the northeastern South Carolina coast. The MIS 5a and MIS 7 RSL are in agreement with previous studies along other U.S. Atlantic coast. However, the missing of MIS 5e deposits between MIS 5a and MIS 7 deposits at the exposure near Myrtle Beach needs be confirmed with additional work.",

            "abstract": "As climate changes and population living along the coastlines continues to increase, an understanding of coastal risk and vulnerability to extreme events becomes increasingly important. With as many as 700,000 people living less than 3 m above the high tide line, New York City (NYC) represents one of the most threatened among major world cities. Recent events, most notably Hurricane Sandy, have put a tremendous pressure on the mosaic of economic, environmental, and social activities occurring in NYC at the interface between land and water. Using information on property damages collected by the Civil Air Patrol (CAP) after Hurricane Sandy, we developed a machine-learning based model able to identify the primary factors determining the occurrence and the severity of damages and intended to both assess and predict coastal vulnerability. The available dataset consists of categorical classifications of damages, ranging from 0 (not damaged) to 5 (damaged and flooded), and available for a sample of buildings in the NYC area. A set of algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting and Random Forest, were trained on 75% of the available dataset and tested on the remaining 25%, both training and test sets being picked at random. A combination of factors, including elevation, distance from shore, surge depth, soil type and proximity to key topographic features, such as wetlands and parks, were used as predictors. Trained algorithms were able to achieve over 85% prediction accuracy on both the training set and, most notably, the test set, with as few as six predictors, allowing a realistic depiction of the field of damage. Given their accuracy and robustness, we believe that these algorithms can be successfully applied to provide fields of coastal vulnerability for future extreme events, as well as to assess the consequences of changes, whether intended (e.g. land use change) or contingent (e.g. sea level rise), in the physical layout of NYC.",

            "abstract": "Backstripping studies of biostratigraphic data from deep wells show that sediment loading is one of the main factors controlling the subsidence and uplift history of sedimentary basins. Previous studies based on single layer models of elastic and viscoelastic plates overlying an inviscid fluid have shown that sediment loading, together with a tectonic subsidence that decreases exponentially with time, can explain the large-scale ‘architecture’ of rift-type basins and, in some cases, details of their internal stratigraphy such as onlap and offlap patterns. One problem with these so-called ‘steer’s head’ models is that they were based on a simple rheological model in which the long-term strength of the lithosphere increased with thermal age. Recent oceanic flexure studies, however, reveal that the long-term strength of the lithosphere depends not only on thermal age, but also load age.\nWe have used the thermal structure based on plate cooling models, together with recent experimentally-derived flow laws, to compute the viscosity structure of the lithosphere and a new analytical model to compute the flexure of a multilayer viscoelastic plate by a trapezoid-shaped sediment load at different times since basin initiation. If we define the nondimensional number Dw = τm/τt, where τm is the Maxwell time constant and τt is the thermal time constant, we find that for Dw << 1 the flexure approximates that of an elastic plate and an onlap pattern forms at the edge of basin (Fig. 1), whereas for Dw >> 1 the flexure approximates that of a viscoelastic plate and an offlap pattern develops (Fig. 2). Interestingly Dw ~ 1 produces a basin in which onlap dominates its early evolution while offlap dominates its later evolution and an unconformity separates the two different stratal patterns (Fig. 3). Therefore, when consideration is given to the fact that the long-term strength of the lithosphere depends on both thermal and load age we are able to produce stratal geometries that not only closely resemble stratigraphic observations, but do not require either long-term sea-level or sediment flux changes in order to explain them.",

            "abstract": "Typically three phases are observed during solar flares: the preflare, impulsive and decay phases. During the impulsive phase it is believed that the electrons and other particles are accelerated after the stored energy in the magnetic field is released by reconnection. The impulsivity of a solar flare is a quantifiable property which shows how fast occur this initial energy release. It is measured via the impulsivity parameter which we define as the inverse of the overall duration of the impulsive phase. We take the latter as the raw width of the most prominent non-thermal emission of the flare. We computed this observable over a work sample of 48 M class events occurred during the present Solar Cycle 24 by using three different methods. The first method takes into account all the non-thermal flare emission and gives very accurate results, while the other two just cover fixed energy intervals (30-40 keV and 25-50 keV) and are useful for fast calculations. We propose an alternative way to classify solar flares according to their impulsivity parameter values, defining three different types of impulsivity, namely: high, normal and low. This system of classification is independent of the manner used to calculated the impulsivity parameter. Lastly, we show the relevance of this tool as a discriminator of different HXR generation processes.",

During the recent years, new mobile instruments were developed for measuring the concentration, size and chemical composition of INPs, which were tested during the three-part Fifth International Ice Nucleation (FIN) workshop. The FIN activities addressed not only instrument issues, but also important science topics like the nature of atmospheric INP and cloud ice residuals, the ice nucleation activity of relevant atmospheric aerosols, or the parameterization of ice formation in atmospheric weather and climate models.\nThe first activity FIN-1 was conducted during November 2014 at the AIDA cloud chamber. It involved co-locating nine single particle mass spectrometers to evaluate how well they resolve the INP and ice residual composition and how spectra from different instruments compare for relevant atmospheric aerosols. We conducted about 90 experiments with mineral, carbonaceous and biological aerosol types, some also coated with organic and inorganic compounds.\nThe second activity FIN-2 was conducted during March 2015 at the AIDA facility. A total of nine mobile INP instruments directly sampled from the AIDA aerosol chambers. Wet suspension and filter samples were also taken for offline INP processing. A refereed blind intercomparison was conducted during two days of the FIN-2 activity. The third activity FIN-3 will take place at the Desert Research Institute’s Storm Peak Laboratory (SPL) in order to test the instruments’ performance in the field.\nThis contribution will introduce the FIN activities, summarize first results from the formal part of FIN-2, and discuss selected results, mainly from FIN-1 for the effect of coating on the ice nucleation (IN) by mineral aerosols. The coating with both secondary organic compounds and sulphuric acid was conducted in the AIDA chamber at relevant temperatures and precursor concentrations and was monitored with the particle mass spectrometers. Already very thin, atmospherically relevant coatings reduced deposition IN, but had little effect on immersion freezing.",

Dislocation creep of quartz in Earth’s crust is dominated by slip on the basal <a> slip system. However, very little is known about the temperature, strain rate, or water fugacity dependence of this slip system.\nIn order to better understand the rheology of the basal <a> slip system, we deformed single crystals of synthetic quartz, with the basal <a> slip system oriented at 45° to the compression direction (O+ orientation). Each core was annealed at 900°C and 1 atm for 24 hours to convert the gel-type water defects found in synthetic quartz into fluid inclusions, like those observed in milky quartz. FTIR analysis indicate that water contents (200-450 H/106Si) were not affected by the annealing process. The annealed single crystals were then deformed in a Griggs piston-cylinder rock deformation apparatus using a solid salt assembly, at temperatures from 800 to 900°C, strain rates from 10-6 to 10-4/s, and a confining pressure of 1.5 GPa.\nThe strength of the quartz crystals increases with faster strain rates and decreases with increasing temperature. During some of the faster strain rate steps at 800°C, the crystals did not deform plastically before the differential stress reached the confining pressure, whereas they deformed at low stresses at 800°C and 10-6/s. The microstructures visible in the deformed samples are consistent with dislocation creep. The samples exhibit undulatory extinction, and show no deformation lamellae or subgrain formation.\nThe strength of synthetic quartz crystals with low water contents deformed in this study is greater than milky quartz single crystals with high water contents deformed at the same conditions in other studies. These results indicate that the strength of basal <a> slip system in quartz is affected by both water content and water fugacity.",

Through improved precipitation measurement system, using advanced radar and radiometer and other constellation operational satellites, the GPM mission has already started providing global precipitation measurement at 0.1o spatial and 30min temporal resolutions. Such high resolution precipitation measurement will help to advance our knowledge on atmosphere-land surface interactions and improve our ability to forecast extreme events (flood and drought). As new mission and to advance its application, the error characteristic inherited in the product needs to be systematically investigated. This study focuses on extensive and systematic validation of IMERG product and addresses the level of improvement in comparison to the predecessor Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) real time product. Retrievals from different passive microwave (PMW) and infrared (IR) sensors are evaluated and compared on an hourly timescale over United States (US). A high resolution ground-based radar data from the NOAA/National Sever Storm Laboratory’s (NSSL) Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor system (MRMS) is used as reference data. An error decomposition scheme is implemented to separate the total error into three independent components, hit, miss-rain, and false-rain biases, to trace the error source and identify the sensors, which contribute more to the final level-3 product. The result shows that the spatial distribution, temporal pattern, and magnitude/volume of the rainfall are captured very well by IMERG product with fair systematic biases depending on rain intensity and season. The scalar and correlation measures are improved for both PMW and IR sensors retrievals in case of IMERG as compared to the TRMM product. During high rain season, more than 70% of the total error is originated from the IR sensor.",

We hope to find innovative ways to fuse the data sources and come up with new and improved ways to study our changing Earth. With the HyspIRI (Hyperspectral Infrared Imager) satellite being launched shortly, this provides an opportunity to evaluate potential benefits that it may provide when in conjunction with other technologies and missions.",

Air masses arriving at the T3 site ranged from near natural conditions to strongly impacted by urban pollution and/or biomass burning. Particle hygroscopicity and chemical mixing state were derived from the size resolved CCN spectra, and the hygroscopicity of the organic component of the aerosol was then calculated from the particle hygroscopicity and composition concurrently measured by an Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS) or an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM). On average, particle hygroscopicity increased with increasing particle diameter, mainly due to an increasing sulfate volume fraction. The diel variations of particle hygroscopicity, mixing state, and organic hygroscopicity were strongly influenced by a combination of emissions, photochemical oxidation, and the development of boundary layer. The diel variations are examined for different air masses during both wet and dry seasons. The impact of urban pollution and biomass burning on both organic and particle hygroscopicities will be presented. The organic hygroscopicity is investigated against its sources and the oxidation levels (e.g., O:C atomic ratio) for improved understanding of its variations and parameterizations in global models.",

Northern Arizona University recently acquired a custom-engineered, cutting-edge UAV and we can now generate our own images with the instrument. The UAV has a unique capability to carry a large payload including a hyperspectral sensor, which images the Earth surface in over 350 spectral bands at 5 cm resolution, and a lidar scanner, which images the land surface and vegetation in 3-dimensions. Both sensors represent the newest available technology with very high resolution, precision, and accuracy.\nUsing the UAV sensors, we are monitoring the effects of regional forest restoration treatment efforts. Individual tree canopy width and height are measured in the field and via the UAV sensors. The high-resolution UAV images are then used to segment individual tree canopies and to derive 3-dimensional estimates. The UAV image-derived variables are then correlated to the field-based measurements and scaled to satellite-derived tree canopy measurements. The relationships between the field-based and UAV-derived estimates are then extrapolated to a larger area to scale the tree canopy dimensions and to estimate tree density within restored and control forest sites.",

            "abstract": "Courses on sustainability can be taught from multiple perspectives with some focused on specific areas (environmental, socio-cultural, economic, ethics) and others taking a more integrated approach across areas of sustainability and academic disciplines. In conjunction with the Climate Change Education Program efforts to enhance climate change literacy with innovative approaches, resources and communication strategies developed by Climate Education Partners were used in two distinct ways to integrate climate change science and impacts into undergraduate and graduate level courses. At the graduate level, the first lecture in the MBA program in Sustainable Supply Chain Management is entirely dedicated to climate change science, local and global impacts and discussions about key messages to communicate to the business community. Basic science concepts are integrated with discussions about mitigation and adaptation focused on business leaders. The concepts learned are then applied to the semester-long business plan project for the students. At the undergraduate level, a new model of comprehensive integration across disciplines was implemented in Spring 2015 across three courses on Sustainability each with a specific lens: Natural Science, Sociology and Philosophy. All three courses used climate change as the ‘big picture’ framing concept and had similar learning objectives creating a framework where lens-specific topics, focusing on depth in a discipline, were balanced with integrated exercises across disciplines providing breadth and possibilities for integration. The comprehensive integration project was the creation of the climate action plan for the university with each team focused on key areas of action (water, energy, transportation, etc.) and each team built with at least one member from each class ensuring a natural science, sociological and philosophical perspective. The final project was presented orally to all three classes and an integrated paper included all three perspectives. The best projects are being compiled so they can be shared with the University of San Diego’s planning committee.",

            "abstract": "We present an analysis of 23 years of thermal plasma measurements in the topside ionosphere from several DMSP spacecraft at ~800 km. The solar cycle variations of the daily averaged densities, temperatures, and H+/O+ ratios show a strong relationship to the solar EUV as described by the E10.7 solar EUV proxy with cross-correlation coefficients (CCCs) with the density greater than 0.85. The H+/O+ varies dramatically from solar maximum when it is O+ dominated to solar minimum when it is H+ dominated. These ionospheric parameters also vary strongly with season, particularly at latitudes well away from the equator where the solar zenith angle (SZA) varies greatly with season. There are strong 27-day solar rotation periodicities in the density, associated with the periodicities in the solar EUV as measured by the TIMED SEE and SDO EVE instruments, with CCCs at times greater than 0.9 at selected wavelengths. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis captures over 95% of the variation in the density over the 23 years in the first two principle components. The first principle component (PC1) is clearly associated with the solar EUV showing a 0.91 CCC with the E10.7 proxy while the PC1 EOFs remain relatively constant with latitude indicating that the solar EUV effects are relatively independent of latitude. The second principle component (PC2) is clearly associated with the SZA variation, showing strong correlations with the SZA and the concomitant density variations at latitudes away from the equator and with the PC2 EOFs having magnitudes near zero at the equator and maximum at high latitude. The magnitude of the variation of the response of the topside ionosphere to solar EUV variability is shown to be closely related to the composition. This is interpreted as the result of the effect of composition on the scale height in the topside ionosphere and the \"pivot effect\" in which the variation in density near the F2 peak is expected to be amplified by a factor of e at an altitude a scale height above the F2 peak. When the topside ionosphere is H+ dominated, DMSP may be much less than a scale height above the F2 peak while when it is O+ dominated, DMSP may be several scale heights above the F2 peak.",

FOXSI is designed as a 3-axis stabilized spacecraft in low-Earth orbit making use of state-of-the-art grazing incidence focusing optics, allowing for direct imaging of solar X-rays. The current design being studied features three telescope modules deployed in a low-inclination low-earth orbit (LEO). With a 15 meter focal length enabled by a deployable boom, FOXSI will observe the Sun in the 3-50 keV energe range. The FOXSI imaging concept has already been tested on two sounding rocket flights, in 2012 and 2014 and on the HEROES balloon payload flight in 2013. FOXSI will image the Sun with an angular resolution of 5'', a spectral resolution of 0.5 keV, and sub-second temporal resolution using CdTe detectors. In this presentation we investigate the science objectives and targets which can be accessed from this mission. Because of the defining characteristic of FOXSI is true imaging spectroscopy with high dynamic range and sensitivity, a brand-new perspective on energy release on the Sun is possible. Some of the science targets discussed here include; flare particle acceleration processes, electron beams, return currents, sources of solar energetic particles (SEPs), as well as understanding X-ray emission from active region structures and the quiescent corona.",

The level of induction is controlled by the geoelectric field at the Earth's surface, which may be calculated by convolving the geomagnetic variations with an earth-conductivity model. We carry out a long-term statistical analysis of calculated geoelectric field variations using about 30 years of geomagnetic observations from selected locations. We find two dominant classes of geoelectric field events: those that are driven by shock arrival at the Earth which produces a sudden impulse or sudden storm commencement, and those that are associated with geomagnetic storm activity. We provide a historical perspective on the distribution of the geoelectric field for these types of events and compare the geoelectric field with other measures of geomagnetic activity. We also demonstrate the sensitivity of these results to different conductivity models and to geomagnetic latitude.",

            "abstract": "Exploration of the subsurface of Mars using radar sounding began with MARSIS (Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding) on Mars Express in 2005 and continued with SHARAD (Shallow Radar) on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2006. These instruments have been operating continuously since, providing a rich legacy of science return and observational experience in the highly variable environments and target sets at Mars. New missions to the icy moons of Jupiter, ESA’s JUICE (Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer) and NASA’s Europa Mission, will both carry radar sounders to probe the subsurface of several of the icy moons (Ganymede, Europa and Callisto by JUICE; Europa by the Europa Mission). The success of the Mars sounders demonstrated the scientific value of the technique and provided confidence that sounding of the icy moons is a promising endeavor. Icy targets at Mars have proven especially amenable to penetration by radar sounding. The polar layered deposits of Mars have been probed to their base (2-4 km deep) by MARSIS, operating at frequencies of 1.3-5.5 MHz. SHARAD, operating with a wider bandwidth at 15-25 MHz, provides higher vertical resolution that allows detection and imaging of fine details of interior layering in the ice deposits. The sounder planned for the Europa mission, REASON (Radar for Europa Assessment and Sounding, Ocean to Near-Surface), will utilize simultaneous dual frequency signals to obtain complementary deep sounding and high-vertical-resolution shallow observations. Co-located observations by MARSIS and SHARAD also demonstrate that high surface roughness (relative to the radar wavelength) affects the strength of the penetrating signals, and thus the capability to detect deep or low-contrast subsurface interfaces. The icy moon sounders’ wavelengths were selected, in part, to mitigate against this degradation of signals by the anticipated rough surfaces of Jupiter’s moons. This paper will discusss these and other examples of lessons learned from Mars sounding that will be applied to the exploration of the icy moons.",

For atmospheric research, ultra-light RPAS (< 2.5kg) are now able to fly at altitudes greater than 3 km and even in cloud, which opens new opportunities to understand aerosol-cloud interactions. We are deploying the RPAS as part of the European project BACCHUS (Impact of Biogenic versus Anthropogenic Emissions on Clouds and Climate: towards a Holistic Understanding).\nField experiments in Cyprus and Ireland have already been conducted to study aerosol-cloud interactions in climatically different environments. The RPAS are being utilized in this study with the purpose of complementing ground-based observations of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) to conduct aerosol-cloud closure studies Cloud microphysical properties such as cloud drop number concentration and size can be predicted directly from the measured CCN spectrum and the observed updraft, the vertical component of the wind vector [e.g., Conant et al, 2004]. On the RPAS, updraft measurements are obtained from a 5-hole probe synchronized with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The RPA (remotely piloted aircraft) are programmed to fly at a level leg just below cloud base to measure updraft measurements while a scanning CCN counter is stationed at ground level. Vertical profiles confirm that CCN measurements on the ground are representative to those at cloud base. An aerosol-cloud parcel model is implemented to model the cloud droplet spectra associated with measured updraft velocities. The model represents the particle size domain with internally mixed chemical components, using a fixed-sectional approach [L. M. Russell and Seinfeld, 1998]. The model employs a dual moment (number and mass) algorithm to calculate growth of particles from one section to the next for non-evaporating species. Temperature profiles, cloud base, updraft velocities and aerosol size and composition, all measured during RPAS flights, constrain the parcel model. The measured thermodynamic and microphysical properties constrained the simulated droplet size distribution sufficiently to match the observed cloud microphysical properties.",

            "abstract": "Observations, reanalysis, and regional modeling simulations support a dynamic mechanism that explains onset of convectively active periods of the Madden-Julian over the Indian Ocean. Observations made during DYNAMO confirm that clouds moisten the middle troposphere prior to MJO onset over the Indian Ocean. Regional modeling (WRF) runs show that the moistening is caused directly by upward advection of moisture within cloud updrafts and divergence of the moisture away from cloud updrafts into the environment.\nTRMM observations during DYNAMO show that, in terms of depth, two modes of precipitating convection over the Indian Ocean exist. One is a congestus-like mode that exists mainly below 500 hPa and increases in areal coverage during a 3–7 day long transition period prior to MJO onset. The other is a deep mode of convection, whose widespread existence is dependent upon the moistening caused by the congestus mode. The question of what permits widespread deep convective events then boils down to why congestus-like convection becomes more likely to develop.\nUpper-tropospheric velocity potential anomalies (anomalies of large-scale (LS) divergence) have long been linked to MJO convective activity. Using ERA-Interim reanalysis, the low zonal wavenumber (1–1.5), eastward-propagating structures of vertical and zonal motion associated with the divergence signal are shown. As LS positive anomalies of divergence in the upper-troposphere approach the Indian Ocean, LS subsidence throughout the troposphere, and thus adiabatic warming, decreases. Peak reduction in LS subsidence occurs near 500 hPa, acting to destabilize the lower half of the troposphere.\nWRF successfully reproduces three convective regimes prior to October and November convective events: suppressed, transition, and active periods, during which, respectively, shallow and non-precipitating, congestus, and deep convection are common. More congestus mode convection develops when the mean 900–700 hPa buoyancy within cloud updrafts becomes less negative, which occurs because the mean environmental (updraft) temperature in that layer decreases (increases) by 0.05–0.2K over a week prior to MJO onset. The updraft and environmental temperatures appear sensitive to boundary layer temperature and the magnitude of LS environmental subsidence.",

One challenge with such experiments is determining the flows present. The opacity of the fluids used in these experiments (e.g. liquid sodium) prevents direct flow visualization techniques from being employed. One method allowing determination of zonal flows in such experiments is acoustic mode velocimetry. In this technique, the rotational splittings of acoustic mode spectra are used to infer the azimuthal velocity profile of the flow. Here we present the use of this technique to study flows in experimental models of the Earth's core. Most of these results were obtained in a 60 cm diameter spherical Couette device, with a 20 cm diameter inner sphere, and using nitrogen gas as the working fluid. Turbulent flow is driven in the system via differential rotation of the outer shell and inner sphere. Acoustic modes are excited in the fluid volume using a speaker, and microphones are used to measure the frequencies and rotational splittings of the modes. We compare the observed splittings with those predicted by theory as a way of validating the method, and infer mean flows from these observations. We also present some preliminary results of acoustic studies in the 3 m diameter liquid sodium spherical Couette experiment. Finally, we discuss future prospects for this experimental technique.",

Emissions from lakes are thought to be controlled primarily by temperature and secondarily by the availability of labile organic carbon. Aquatic plants provide insitu carbon sources to lake bottoms and therefore can potentially impact rates of methane production. We studied vegetation and lake sediment characteristics across shallow depths in Inre Harrsjön, a lake located within the Stordalen Mire in the discontinuous permafrost zone in subarctic Sweden. Vegetation surveys using a submerged quadrat with camera were performed in transects across IH to characterize bottom vegetation. Carbon and nitrogen elemental analysis was performed on vegetation samples from both the lake and surrounding mire ecosystem. Sediment cores representing each vegetation type were analyzed for CH4, δ13CH4, and elemental CHNS. In all cores but one, total organic carbon (TOC) is greatest near the surface and decreases downcore. Methane concentrations correlated with TOC indicating insitu methane production. C:N ratios in sediment cores are more reflective of aquatic than terrestrial mire vegetation indicating that organic carbon in the lake sediments is dominated by aquatic sources. δ13CH4 is relatively constant downcore, which indicates little to no methane oxidation. The methane produced in sediments is consistently within the range of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis via CO2 reduction. We suggest the role of aquatic vegetation in the production of methane in high latitude shallow lakes may be important and will likely have a positive feedback in a warming climate with longer ice-free seasons.",

Using empirical relationships between backscatter and extinction coefficients, as well as cloud ice water content measured by aircraft, the lidar backscatter can be converted into cloud ice water content. A nine-year climatology of ice water content from CALIOP shows that the distribution of ice mass in the tropical UT/LS is dominated by convection over land, with a large longitudinal variation. There are four centers of activity for high altitude tropical convection, over South America, Africa, the Asian Monsoon region and in the tropical Western Pacific over the maritime continent.\nThe distribution of cloud ice water content is very different from that of cloud fraction, which includes many thin cloud layers in the TTL that do not contain much ice, and that are locally and not convectively generated. These results suggest that approaches based on zonal means, or on cloud fraction do not give an accurate accounting of the total water budget of the UT/LS, and that a regional approach is needed. It is found that \"overshooting\" convection likely dominates the stratospheric moistening process in specific regions and at specific times of the year. Finally, upper tropical tropospheric cloud ice mass loading is correlated with the Asian monsoon and with climate cycles such as ENSO and the QBO.",

The Wyoming Center for Environmental Hydrology and Geophysics (WyCEHG) is a multidisciplinary group that is driving scientific breakthroughs to help manage water resources in the Western United States. WyCEHG is mandated by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to share their data. However, the infrastructure from which to share such diverse, complex and massive amounts of data did not exist within the University of Wyoming. We developed an innovative framework to meet the data organization, sharing, and discovery requirements of WyCEHG by integrating both open and closed source software, embedded metadata tags, semantic web technologies, and a web-mapping application. The infrastructure uses a Relational Database Management System as the foundation, providing a versatile platform to store, organize, and query myriad datasets, taking advantage of both structured and unstructured formats. Detailed metadata are fundamental to the utility of datasets. We tag data with Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI’s) to specify concepts with formal descriptions (i.e. semantic ontologies), thus allowing users the ability to search metadata based on the intended context rather than conventional keyword searches. Additionally, WyCEHG data are geographically referenced. Using the ArcGIS API for Javascript, we developed a web mapping application leveraging database-linked spatial data services, providing a means to visualize and spatially query available data in an intuitive map environment. Using server-side scripting (PHP), the mapping application, in conjunction with semantic search modules, dynamically communicates with the database and file system, providing access to available datasets. Our approach provides a flexible, comprehensive infrastructure from which to store and serve WyCEHG’s highly diverse research-based data. This framework has not only allowed WyCEHG to meet its data stewardship requirements, but can provide a template for others to follow.",

Uncertainties on their oceanic inputs and outputs still remains [\nArsouze et al., 2009\n;\nSiddall et al., 2008\n;\nTachikawa et al., 2003\n]. The water-sediment interface were early on identified as a relevant REE source due to the high distribution coefficient between sediments and pore waters [\nElderfield and Sholkovitz, 1987\n] and substantially higher concentration then the water column [\nAbbott et al., 2015\n;\nHaley et al., 2004\n;\nSholkovitz et al., 1989\n;\nSoyol-Erdene and Huh, 2013\n]. Here we present a cross shelf transect of 4 short pore waters REE profiles on a 680 km2 mud bank located in the region of Cabo Frio, Brazil. This study reveals similar trends at the four sites: a REE production zone reflected by a maximum in concentration at the top of the sediment evolving with depth toward a REE consumption zone reflected by a minimum in REE concentrations. PAAS normalized patterns shows 1) a progressive depletion in LREE with depth with HREE/LREE ratios comprised between 1.1 and 1.6 in the 2 first centimeters evolving gradually to ratios comprised between 2.8 and 4.7 above 7 cm 2) A sharp gradient in negative Ce anomaly with Ce/Ce* values reaching 0.3. With maximum Nd concentrations comprised between 780 and 1200 pmol.kg and considering that seawater Nd concentrations of Brazilian shelf bottom waters are comprised between 24 and 50 pmol.Kg-1 we apply the Fick´s First Law of diffusion and estimate that 340 +/- 90 nmol. m-2 Y-1 of Nd is released in the Cabo frio´s mudbank. This flux is in the same order of magnitude of recent estimates by [\nAbbott et al., 2015\n] in the slope of Oregon´s margin. Unraveling processes responsible for the REE production zone will help to refine the global REE fluxes estimates.",

In areas where extensive monitoring is present these impacts can be moderated by ground based monitoring and alert systems, however many volcanoes have little or no monitoring capabilities. In many of these regions volcanic alerts are generated by local communities with limited resources or formal communication systems, however additional eruption alerts can result from chance encounters with passing aircraft. In contrast satellite based remote sensing instruments possess the capability to provide near global daily monitoring, facilitating automated volcanic eruption detection. One such system generates eruption alerts through the detection of thermal anomalies, known as MODVOLC, and is currently operational utilising moderate resolution MODIS satellite data. Within this work we outline a method to distinguish SO2 eruptions from background levels recorded by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) through the identification and classification of volcanic activity over a 5 year period. The incorporation of this data into a logistic regression model facilitated the classification of volcanic events with an overall accuracy of 80% whilst consistently identifying plumes with a mass of 400 tons or higher. The implementation of the developed model could facilitate the near real time identification of new and ongoing volcanic activity on a global scale.",

The anniversary coincided with a major rebuild and expansion of its capabilities for in-situ high-pressure and high-temperature X-ray diffraction.\nA rebuild of the 12.2.2 laser heating table was completed and commissioned in the past year. The new design relies on a vertically positioned small (~1m x 1m) breadboard that is placed perpendicularly to the incident X-ray beam next to the sample stage. Upstream and downstream viewing-, IR-laser and pyrometry-optics are mounted on opposite surfaces of the breadboard. On-line ruby fluorescence optics including a blue diode laser are also mounted on the upstream surface. The much reduced dimensions of the design lead to smaller mechanical lever arms and thus to a significant suppression of vibrations. This was confirmed in the commissioning phase with high-quality optical images (~ 2 μm resolution) as well as a very stable hotspot in DAC samples. A further optimized pyrometry code was cross-calibrated against thermal expansions of Pt and Ta, and was found to agree with those values within experimental uncertainties. Pyrometry relies on imaging the full hot-spot onto a spectrometer and combining the thus obtained average temperature with an intensity map collected at 700 nm to produce a temperature contour map of the entire sample chamber. Besides axial laser heating, double-sided radial laser heating is also being developed and commissioned.\nThe X-ray source of 12.2.2 makes it an ideal station to focus on high-pressure single crystal diffraction. The present set-up operates parasitically with a single rotation axis on the in-situ laser heating powder diffraction sample stage in concert with a fast (15 fps) amorphous silicon/diode array detector. Although this set-up poses limitations with respect to accessible reciprocal space, high pressure single crystal structure solution and refinements of organic compounds incl. anisotropic displacement parameters have been demonstrated. Imminent development plans aim for the installation of a rugged multi-axis diffractometer on its own dedicated end-station in combination with with a compact fast detector on the 2-theta arm. This will be capable of carrying state of the art wide opening angle DAC's (BX90).",

            "abstract": "Extreme climate events play an important and potentially lasting role in terrestrial carbon cycling and storage. In particular, satellite and in-situ measurements have shown that forest recovery time following severe drought can extend several years beyond the return to normal climate conditions. However, terrestrial ecosystem models generally do not account for the physiological mechanisms that cause these legacy effects and, instead, assume complete and rapid vegetation recovery from drought. Using a suite of fifteen land surface models from the Multi-scale Synthesis and Terrestrial Model Intercomparison Project (MsTMIP), we assess models’ ability to capture legacy effects by analyzing the spatial and temporal extent of modeled vegetation response to the 2005 Amazon drought. We compare the simulated primary production and ecosystem exchange (GPP, NPP, NEE) to previous recovery-focused analysis of satellite microwave observations of canopy backscatter. Further, we evaluate the specific model characteristics that control the timescale and magnitude of simulated vegetation recovery from drought. Since climate change is expected to increase the frequency and severity of extreme climate events, improving models’ ability to simulate the legacy effects of these events will likely refine estimates of the land carbon sink and its interannual variability.",

            "abstract": "Linking petrologic and geochronologic evidence for seismicity in the rock record is challenging, yet critical for understanding slip mechanics in natural faults, structural histories, and modern seismic hazards. We couple hematite (U-Th)/He (HeHe) dating with microtextural analysis and thermomechanical modeling to decipher this record from locally iridescent, hematite-coated fault surfaces in the seismogenic Wasatch fault zone (WFZ), Utah. Prior study of one fault surface linked textural evidence for elevated temperatures with a pattern of HeHe dates to hypothesize that this surface preserves evidence of multiple seismic slip events. New scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and HeHe data from a larger sample suite test this hypothesis. The SEM images reveal the presence of <500 nm polygonal hematite crystals at some iridescent regions, suggesting co- to post-seismic hematite annealing and recrystallization at temperatures >800 °C. Fault surface samples yield 3.8 ± 0.03 to 1.5 ± 0.1 Ma dates, with younger dates in iridescent regions. These results are younger than 88.5 ± 15.0 Ma and 10.8 ± 0.8 Ma dates from veins associated with initial hematite mineralization as well as new apatite (U-Th)/He dates of 4.0 ± 0.6 Ma-5.4±1.1 Ma that constrain the footwall thermal history. Reproducible but statistically different HeHe dates from samples on the same fault surface are consistent with prior observations. Collectively, these observations suggest that hematite He dates record rapid cooling from localized shear heating at asperities to temperatures hot enough to reset the hematite He system. Models incorporate rate-dependent friction and half-space cooling to constrain shear zone temperature evolution. Results reveal temperatures >800 °C are sufficient to reset hematite up to 200 µm from the fault surface and HeHe dates may represent patches of rate-strengthening friction during seismic slip. Ongoing work utilizes SEM to target aliquots with textural evidence for elevated temperatures and fast rupture and/or slip rates on the fault surface prior to He dating and refining models to incorporate such data.",

The system is relatively full with few remaining stable locations evenly-spaced for additional moons on uninclined, circular orbits; most of these are Trojan (Tadpole/Horseshoe) orbits (Pires et al. 2011; Porter and Stern 2015).\nIn this work, we study the coorbital region of each moon with long time integrations taking into account the gravitational effects of the satellites Charon, Styx, Nix, Kerberos and Hydra. We numerically simulate a sample of 10,000 test particles initially located randomly around each moon's orbit (Figure). All test particles start on nearly circular and uninclined orbits and are followed for 5000 years. The results of our numerical simulations show stable coorbital objects – both Tadpoles and Horseshoes – for each of the small moons (Table). Horseshoe orbits are most common at all moons, although Hydra also has a sizeable population of Tadpole orbits. We also find interesting cases where the orbits switch from L4 Tadpoles to Horseshoes and even to L5 Tadpoles. These transitioning orbits comprise less than 1% of coorbital objects at all moons, and are most common at Styx. We have also investigated eccentric and inclined orbits and will report on our findings.",

The distribution of ice water path (IWP) in this region is highly skewed, such that the mean value is not representative of the typical ice cloud. In examining how cirrus cloud radiative effects at the TOA vary as a function of IWP, we find that cirrus with an IWP less than 200 g m-2 produce a net warming. And weighting the radiative effect by the frequency of occurrence of IWP, reveals that cirrus with an IWP around 20 g m-2contribute most to the heating at the TOA.\nNext, we use the A-Train results to address the issues of IWP occurrence and high cloud forcing in the Community Atmosphere Model version 5. Our goal is to determine if the clouds that heat the upper troposphere in the model are the same genre of clouds that heat the upper troposphere in the real atmosphere. First, we assess the distribution of ice cloud fraction in the model. Then we define a cloud radiative kernel that’s a function of cloud top pressure and IWP, to determine whether the modeled ice clouds produce similar shortwave and longwave radiative effects at the TOA. Lastly, we use the cloud radiative kernel and cloud fraction histogram to evaluate how the ice cloud forcing in the model compares to the ice cloud forcing derived from A-Train.",

Satellite based Earth observations play an important role for detecting and describing the spatio-temporal development of extremes events. However, in-depth investigations of impacts on ecosystem functioning typically requires in-situ observations. The growth of ecological in-situ networks raises the question if we are well prepared to analyze extreme events in today and in the near future. Here we explore the extreme event monitoring capacity of in-situ stations of land-atmosphere flux observations, soil moisture, and other relevant data streams (e.g. Ameriflux, FLUXNET, NEON and ISMN) as well as a range of hypothetical random networks. We focus on extreme events reveled by different Earth observations over the US and Europe. Our results show that small random networks of less than 100 sites per continent would have detected most large-scale extreme events over the past decade, while many small events would have remained unseen. Very large networks with up to 10000 sites would have only moderately improved the detection efficiency, but become several orders of magnitude more efficient in detecting small events. Another fining is that spatial clustering of real-world networks leads to lower detection potentials for extremes less compared to random networks. However, the bottom-up design of NEON could slightly improves the detection efficiency. Further expansions of ecological networks should carefully consider the spatial occurrence probability of extreme events.",

Our focus was on the segment boundary between the Warm Springs and East Bench faults. We collected 14.5 km along 9 west-east profiles in 3 field days using a 60 m aperture seismic land streamer and 200 kg weight drop system. From a p-wave refraction analysis, we measure velocities from 230-3900 m/s for the upper 20-25 meters. Shear wave velocities for the upper 30 m, derived from a multi-channel analysis of surface waves (MASW) approach, show velocities that range from 100-1800 m/s. P-wave reflection images from the upper 100 m depth indicate offset and truncated (mostly) west-dipping strata (Bonneville Lake deposits?) that suggest active faults extend beneath the downtown urban corridor. We identify saturated sediments on the lower elevation (western) portions of the profiles and shallow high velocity (dry) strata to the east of the mapped faults. We observe slow p-wave velocities near identified faults that may represent the fault’s colluvial wedge. These velocity results are best highlighted with Vp/Vs ratios. Analyzing shear wave velocities by NEHRP class, we estimate soft soil (NEHRP D) limited less than 1 m depth along most profiles, and stiff soil (NEHRP C) to up to 25 m depth in some locations. However near steep topographic slopes (footwall deposits), we identify NEHRP Class D stiff soil velocities to less than 2 m depth before transition to NEHRP Class C soft rock. Depth to hard rock (velocities >760 m/s) are as shallow as 20 m below the land surface on some steep slopes beneath north Salt Lake City and greater than our imaging depths along the western portions of our profiles. Our findings suggest large variations in seismic velocities beneath the Salt Lake City corridor and that multiple fault strands related to the Warm Springs fault segment extend beneath downtown.",

The first interaction occurs within the so-called “dynamo region” (ca. 100-150 km), where winds, plasma and Earth’s magnetic field interact to generate electric fields and currents. These electric fields map to higher altitudes and impose spatial-temporal variability on the F-region ionospheric plasma. The accompanying dynamo-region electric currents induce ground magnetic perturbations measured by magnetometers distributed over the globe, and thus provide important insights into the nature of this neutral-plasma interaction. For instance, one might ask: what kind of longitude variability is imposed by planetary waves? In this study, we analyze the northward component of geomagnetic solar quiet (Sq) variations in an attempt to identify the zonal wave number content of planetary-wave (PW) signals in the Sq field. Data from five northern-hemisphere mid-latitude ground-based magnetometer stations distributed in longitude around one latitudinal circle are analyzed for the solar minimum period of 2009. The Q16DW and its zonal wave number components 0, ± 1 and ±2 are extracted and form the focus of this particular study. Results are interpreted in terms of the longitude variation of the total Q16DW, its connection with the Q16DW in the neutral atmosphere, and possible influences of the longitude dependence of Earth’s magnetic field.",

The NOAA Office for Coastal Management (OCM) provides data, tools, trainings and technical assistance to coastal resource managers. Beginning in 2011, NOAA OCM began developing a sea level rise and coastal flooding impacts viewer which provides nationally consistent data sets and analyses to help communities with coastal management goals such as: understanding and communicating coastal flood hazards, performing vulnerability assessments and increasing coastal resilience, and prioritizing actions for different inundation/flooding scenarios. The Viewer is available on NOAA’s Digital Coast platform: (\ncoast.noaa.gov/ditgitalcoast/tools/slr\n). In this presentation we will share the lessons learned from our work with coastal decision-makers on the role of coastal flood risk data and tools in helping to shape future land use decisions and policies. We will also focus on a recent effort in California to help users understand the similarities and differences of a growing array of sea level rise decision support tools. NOAA staff and other partners convened a workshop entitled, “Lifting the Fog: Bringing Clarity to Sea Level Rise and Shoreline Change Models and Tools,” which was attended by tool develops, science translators and coastal managers with the goal to create a collaborative communication framework to help California coastal decision-makers navigate the range of available sea level rise planning tools, and to inform tool developers of future planning needs. A sea level rise tools comparison matrix will be demonstrated. This matrix was developed as part of this effort and has been expanded to many other states via a partnership with NOAA, Climate Central, and The Nature Conservancy.",

Where complex nonlinear interactions produce unintuitive results, interactive computer simulations can be useful tools for education and decision support. Emotions play important roles in cognition and learning, especially where risks are concerned. Interactive simulations have the potential to harness emotional engagement to enhance learning and understanding of risks in coupled human-natural systems.\nWe developed a participatory agent-based simulation of cities at risk of river flooding. Participants play the role of managers of neighboring cities along a flood-prone river and make choices about building flood walls to protect their inhabitants. Simulated agents participate in dynamic real estate markets in which demand for property, and thus values and decisions to build, respond to experience with flooding over time. By reducing high-frequency low-magnitude flooding, flood walls may stimulate development, thus increasing tax revenues but also increasing vulnerability to uncommon floods that overtop the walls.\nFlood waves are launched stochastically and propagate downstream. Flood walls that restrict overbank flow at one city can increase the amplitude of a flood wave at neighboring cities, both up and downstream.\nWe conducted a pilot experiment with a group of three pre-service teachers. The subjects successfully learned key concepts of risk tradeoffs and unintended consequences that can accompany flood-control measures. We also observed strong emotional responses, including hope, fear, and sense of loss. This emotional engagement with a model of coupled human-natural systems was very different from previous experiments on participatory simulations of purely natural systems for physics pedagogy. We conducted a second session in which the participants were expert engineers. We will present the results of these experiments and the prospects for using such models for middle-school, high-school, and post-secondary environmental science pedagogy, for improving public understanding of flood risks, and as decision support tools for planners.",

            "abstract": "Each year huge amounts of mineral dust are mobilized in deserts and arid regions of the world and transported over large distances forming thick elevated aerosol layers with a substantial fraction of coarse mode particles. Optical properties of mineral dust, including the absorptive refractive index of some components, cause a significant effect on the atmospheric radiative energy balance from optical to infrared wavelengths. The aerosol characteristics, in particular its coarse mode size distribution, are modified during long-range transport by aging and deposition processes. This also affects the aerosol optical properties and therefore the effect on the atmospheric radiative energy budget.\nIn-situ measurements of aerosol microphysical properties are essential to characterize those effects in order to be implemented in global climate models in parametrized form. However, in-situ measurements of airborne coarse mode aerosols such as mineral dust and volcanic ash are challenging and the measurements are usually affected by substantial uncertainties. In this work we use airborne measurements of mineral dust from our optical light-scattering spectrometer CAS-DPOL during SALTRACE 2013 to discuss the analysis of such data. We cover the effects of varying refractive index and particle shapes and develop recommendations for the configuration of the CAS-DPOL for aerosol studies. We also present an inversion method to derive coarse mode size distributions from light-scattering probes for mixtures of non-spherical, absorbing aerosols. The size distributions retrieved from the in-situ measurements are then validated using an independent analysis with a combination of sun-photometer and lidar data.\nWe apply these methods to investigate the Saharan mineral dust particle size distributions measured on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean and discuss the influence of aerosol aging on the atmospheric radiative energy budget. With this example we also assess how the uncertainties affecting coarse mode aerosol measurements translate into uncertainties in radiative forcing estimates.",

Ocean Tracks provides access to data from the Tagging of Pelagic Predators (TOPP) program, NOAA’s Global Drifter Program, and Earth-orbiting satellites via the Ocean Tracks interactive map interface; customized data analysis tools; multimedia supports; along with laboratory modules customized for undergraduate student use. It is part of a broader portfolio of projects comprising the Oceans of Data Institute, dedicated to transforming education to prepare citizens for a data-intensive world. Although originally developed for use in high school science classrooms, the Ocean Tracks interface and associated curriculum has generated interest among instructors at the undergraduate level, who wanted to engage their students in hands-on work with real scientific datasets. In 2014, EDC and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography received funding from NSF’s IUSE program for Ocean Tracks: College Edition, to investigate how a learning model that includes a data interface, set of analysis tools, and curricula can be used to motivate students to learn and do science with real data; bringing opportunities to engage broad student populations, including both in-classroom and remote, on-line participants, in scientific practice. Phase 1, completed in the summer of 2015, was a needs assessment, consisting of a survey and interviews with students in oceanography classes at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Palomar Community College; a document review of course syllabi and primary textbooks used in current college marine science courses across the country; and interviews and a national survey of marine science faculty. We will present the results of this work, and will discuss new curriculum materials that are being classroom tested in the fall of 2015.",

            "abstract": "The Woodlark Spreading Center (WSC) to the east of Papua New Guinea separates the Indo-Australian plate and Solomon Sea microplate. At its eastern terminus, the WSC is being subducted at the New Britain trench, forming a triple junction near the New Georgia Group arc in the Solomon Islands. Previous studies have shown that lavas recovered from greater than 100 km from the trench on the WSC are N-MORB, but closer to the trench they have arc-like Sr–Nd–Pb isotopic ratios, enrichments in LILE, and depletions in HFSE. In the complex triple junction area of the WSC on the Simbo and Ghizo Ridges, island arc tholeiites to medium-K calc-alkaline andesites and dacites have been recovered, many with trace element and isotopic characteristics that are similar to the true arc lavas in the New Georgia Group on the other side of the trench. We suggest that subduction-modified arc mantle migrates through slab windows created by the subduction of the WSC as the plates continue to diverge after subduction. This transfer of mantle across the plate boundary leads to variable mixing between arc and N-MORB end-members, forming the hybrid to arc-like lavas recovered on the WSC. To test this hypothesis and to characterize the end-member compositions, we have analyzed melt inclusions in olivine, pyroxene, and plagioclase phenocrysts in Simbo and Ghizo Ridge lava samples. Major elements were analyzed using the electron microprobe facility at Fayetteville State University and volatiles were analyzed on the ion probe facility at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. The melt inclusions show a wide diversity of magmas from basalts to dacites, and mixing modeling shows that most Woodlark Spreading Center lava compositions are explained by mixing between the most extreme mafic (MORB) and felsic (arc) inclusion compositions.",

The simulations were run using the System for Atmospheric Modeling for a period of 120 days over a 768 km square domain with no large-scale forcing and no rotation. Once convection aggregates and precipitation reaches a sustained increased level, the precipitation rate fluctuates so that the minimum is approximately 20% of the maximum within each period. The same pattern is observed in moisture and energy fields, though the strongest fluctuations occur in the precipitation rate. These simulations were run using both single and double-moment microphysics and this trend is insensitive to the microphysics. This oscillation has also been tested for sensitivities to resolution, domain size, and sea surface temperature.",

The Luliang Shan terrane hosts the oldest, coolest, and most hydrated UHP lithologies within the North Qaidam UHP belt of NW China. Previous work documented extensive fluid flow forming thick phengite+garnet-bearing lithologies (selvage) at the interface of eclogite and quartzofeldspathic gneiss at around 600°C and 75 km depths. We performed in-situ LA-ICP-MS and ion microprobe measurements of trace elements in white micas to determine the sources of infiltrated fluids (i.e. local vs. extra-regional sources of infiltrating fluids). High-Ti and Si phengites within the selvage contain concentrations of Li, Rb, and Cs up to an order of magnitude higher than values predicted from simple mixing of gneiss and eclogite needed to reproduce the major element chemistry recorded in the selvage. Combined with d18O and 40ArE data, the observed enrichments would require extensive fluid mobility to form the UHP selvages. Alternatively, retrograde Ti- and Si- poor muscovites from the host gneiss and shear zones have lower Li, Cs, Rb, and Sr but possess remarkably high B concentrations (up to 3000 ppm), and Be (up to 60ppm) best explained by interaction with fluids derived from devolatilization of altered sediments occurring in more shallow, cool regions of a subduction zone. We conclude that the contrast in the trace element chemistry exhibited by high-pressure phengite vs. low pressure muscovite indicate that the Luliang Shane terrane experiences at least two distinct types of fluid infiltration a high-temperature fluid that infiltrated at near peak UHP conditions to trigger selvage formation and a subsequent event which involved fluid from the shallower regions of a subduction channel and infiltrated the host gneiss as it was exhumed.",

            "abstract": "Wetlands contain one third of the planet’s soil carbon (C) and are characterized by markedly different chemical and physical environments than terrestrial ecosystems. The hydrologic residence time and temperature in wetlands influences their redox conditions and thus biogeochemical reaction rates. In these environments, transformation and movement of C and iron (Fe) are closely linked due to the sorption of organic C by solid Fe(III)-phases. Therefore, changes in Fe biogeochemical cycling will influence the size and turnover rate of soil C pools, which could negatively impact water quality and C storage.\nWe examined the effects of hydrologic residence time and temperature on reduction of autochtonous Fe(III)-oxides. Fe(II)-export rates, used as a lower bound for bulk Fe(III)-reduction rates, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) export rates were measured on intact mineral soil cores using flow-through reactor experiments exposed to temperatures based on mean annual conditions (6°, 12°, and 18°C). Soils were from a slope and a depressional subalpine wetland (USDA Fraser Experimental Forest, CO, USA), characterized by different hydrologic residence times, were compared.\nIn the depressional wetland we observed the shallower soil depths have higher overall Fe(II)-export rates than the deeper soil depths. As temperature increases, Fe(II)-export rate increases, with a more than doubling in magnitude from 12 to 18° C. In comparing sites that are continuously inundated to those that are seasonally inundated, surprisingly we see higher Fe(II)-export rates in the seasonally inundated sites for all temperatures and depths. In the slope wetland we observed an opposite trend with depth and with temperature, with Fe(II)-export rates declining by almost an order of magnitude between 6 and 12°C.\nIn addition, our results showed a positive correlation between Fe(II)-export rates and DOC export rates suggesting Fe(III)-reduction exerts a biogeochemical control on water quality. Overall, knowing Fe(III)-reduction and DOC export are sensitive to changes in temperature and hydrologic residence time provides important insight into how subalpine wetland systems may respond to the predicted increase in soil temperatures and dramatic precipitation events accompanying climate change.",

A summertime ice-free Arctic Ocean is frequently indicated as a signature milestone for these changes, however “ice-free” has a substantially different meaning among scientists and interested stakeholders. To climate scientists it may mean when there is so little sea ice that it plays a minimal role in the climate system. To those interested in development, it may mean a threshold where icebreaker support is not required. To coastal communities it may mean so little ice that hunting is not possible. To species dependent on sea ice, it may mean the point where they cannot find sufficient habitat to survive from spring until fall. In this contribution we document the projected seasonality of the sea ice retreat and address the following questions. For how long will the Arctic Ocean be ice free on average each year? What is the impact of such changes in the seasonality of the sea ice cover on species that are dependent on sea ice? To this end, we analyze the seasonal cycle in the sea-ice extent simulated by the Community Earth System Model 1 - Large Ensemble (CESM1-LE) output for the 21st century. CESM1-LE simulates a realistic late 20th, early 21st century Arctic climate with a seasonal cycle in sea ice extent and rate of decline in good agreement with observations. Results from this model show that even by the end of the 21st century, the length of the ice-free season is relatively short, with ice-free conditions mainly present for 2-3 months between August and October. The result is a much larger amplitude seasonal cycle when compared with the late 20th century climate.",

            "abstract": "In the semi-arid southwest US, legacy mine tailings and the associated metal(loid) contaminants, are prone to wind dispersion and water erosion. Without remediation, tailings can remain barren for decades to centuries, providing a point source of toxic contamination. Successful mitigation of toxins (As, Pb) from fugitive dust is often limited to confinement and stabilization. Capping mine tailings with soil or gravel is an accepted, although expensive, strategy to reduce erosion. Revegetation via assisted direct planting (also known as phytostabilization) has the potential to be a cost-effective and self-sustaining alternative “green-technology” to expensive capping. The impact of phytostabilization, and requisite added organic carbon and irrigation on mechanisms of contaminant mobility is being investigated with concurrent highly-instrumented greenhouse mesocosms and in situ field studies using advanced microbiological tools and synchrotron x-ray based molecular probes. Composted treatments initially neutralized the near surface acid tailings (~2 to ~6.5). However, after 9 mo the mesocosms showed a gradual and eventual decrease back to pH 2. The exception was the root zone of Atriplex lentiformis, which buffered the acidic conditions for 12 months. Rhizosphere microbiota experienced a 5-log increase in the compost-amended compared to control greenhouse mesocosms. Weathering of the primary sulfidic mineral assemblage, indicated by the iron and sulfur speciation, was shown to control the mobility, speciation and bioavailability of both As and Pb via sequestration in (meta)stable neoformed jarosite phases as plumbojarosite and As(V) substituted for sulfate in hydronium jarosite, with important implications for human and environmental health risk management. We conclude that the disequilibrium imposed by phytostabilization results in an increase of heterotrophic biomass that is concurrent with a time series of geochemical transformations, which controls the species, fate, and bioavailability of toxic metal(loid)s. This long-term, multi-disciplinary, multi-scale study describes changes in contaminant lability promoted by biogeochemical weathering and helps establish the feasibility of phytostabilization.",

The receiver functions show discrete arrivals from the mafic layers, the Transvaal sediments under the BIC, and the Mohorovicic discontinuity at the base of the crust.. An interactive forward modeling method has been used to model the receiver functions in order to estimate the thickness of the BIC and the crust. Results show a BIC that is about 5-8 km thick and a Moho at ~40 km depth.",

            "abstract": "The axis of rotation describing relative motion of the Caribbean plate with respect to South America lies in Canada near Hudson’s Bay, such that the Caribbean plate moves nearly due east relative to South America [DeMets et al. 2010]. The plate motion is absorbed largely by pure strike slip motion along the El Pilar Fault in northeastern Venezuela, but in northwestern Venezuela and northeastern Colombia, the relative motion is distributed over a wide zone that extends from offshore to the northeasterly trending Mérida Andes, with the resolved component of convergence between the Caribbean and South American plates estimated at ~10 mm/yr. Recent densification of GPS networks through COLOVEN and COCONet including access to private GPS data maintained by Colombia and Venezuela allowed the development of a new GPS velocity field. The velocity field, processed with JPL’s GOA 6.2, JPL non-fiducial final orbit and clock products and VMF tropospheric products, includes over 120 continuous and campaign stations. This new velocity field along with enhanced seismic reflection profiles, and earthquake location analysis strongly suggest the existence of an active oblique subduction zone. We have also been able to use broadband data from Venezuela to search slow-slip events as an indicator of an active subduction zone. There are caveats to this hypothesis, however, including the absence of volcanism that is typically concurrent with active subduction zones and a weak historical record of great earthquakes. A single tsunami deposit dated at 1500 years before present has been identified on the southeast Yucatan peninsula. Our simulations indicate its probable origin is within our study area.\nWe present a new GPS-derived velocity field, which has been used to improve a regional block model [based on Mora and LaFemina, 2009-2012] and discuss the earthquake and tsunami hazards implied by this model. Based on the new geodetic constraints and our updated block model, if part of the region slipped 2.5 m (500 yrs x 5 mm/yr) in a single 200 km x 200 km rupture, the moment-magnitude of the event would exceed Mw = 8.3. We hypothesize that an active subduction zone exists and supports great earthquake events with a strong possibility of destructive tsunamis, which makes this region the one with the largest seismic hazard in the circum-Caribbean.",

            "abstract": "The GOCE User Toolbox (GUT) is an integrated suite of tools for the analysis and use of GOCE Level 2 gravity products. GUT supports applications in geodesy, oceanography and solid earth physics. The accompanying GUT tutorial provides information and guidance on how to use the toolbox for a variety of applications within each of these domains. An important motivation for the development of GUT has been the desire that users should be able to exploit the GOCE gravity products to calculate derived products relevant to their particular domains without necessarily needing to understand the technicalities of particular geodetic concepts and algorithms. As such, GUT is also suitable for use as an aid to the teaching of geophysics. A comprehensive and up-to-date set of a-priori data and models are supplied with the toolbox, together with a range of pre-defined workflows, allowing the user to immediately calculate useful geophysical quantities. The toolbox is supported by The GUT Algorithm Description and User Guide and The GUT Install Guide. GUT is cross-platform and may be used on Windows PCs, UNIX/Linux workstations and Macs.\nGUT version 2.2 was released in April 2014 and, besides some bug-fixes, the capability to calculate the simple Bouguer anomaly was added. Recently, GUT version 3 has been released. Through a collaborative effort between the relevant scientific communities, this version has built on earlier releases by further extending the functionality of the toolbox within the fields of geodesy, oceanography and solid earth physics. Additions include the ability to work directly with gravity gradients, anisotropic diffusive filtering, and the computation of Bouguer and isostatic gravity anomalies. The interface between the user and the toolbox has also been greatly improved and GUT version 3 now includes an attractive and intuitive Graphical User Interface. An associated GUT VCM tool for analysing the GOCE variance covariance matrices is also available.",

            "abstract": "Symmetry of conjugated rifted margins is controlled by the rheology of the crust and the mantle, extension velocities and heterogeneities in the lithosphere. However, there is a lack of knowledge on how the feedbacks between these initial conditions influence the final architecture of passive margins and the polarity of the asymmetry.\nHere we focus on cratons as stiff heterogeneities which potentially induce asymmetry. For simplicity, we choose to address only non-volcanic rifted margins developed next to cratons, such as the Brazil-Congo and Australia-Antarctica margin pairs. In the South Atlantic case, where cratons are closer to the margins (north of Sao Francisco craton and north and south of Congo craton) the margins are narrow, while wide margins develop far away from cratons. Extreme asymmetry occurs where rifting takes place close to a craton in one margin (narrow) and a fold belt in the conjugate (wide). The same is observed for the Australia-Antarctic pair in the sector of Recherche basin, where the Australian margin is narrow next to the Yilgarn craton and widens towards the east as it lays further from the craton.\nWe use numerical models in order to study how cratons induce asymmetry of conjugated rifted margins and affect the polarity of the asymmetry. We ran experiments with different lower crustal rheologies for a fold belt lithosphere in order to understand which rheologies 'naturally’ result in asymmetric margins. We also ran experiments where a cratonic lithosphere is placed next to a fold belt lithosphere, and where rifting is initiated by a weak seed in the fold belt at different distances from the craton.\nWe found that where some fold belt experiments result in symmetric margins, their equivalent experiments with craton result in asymmetric margins. Furthermore, strong- and intermediate-rheology experiments with cratons showcase narrow margins in the craton side and wide margins on the fold belt side. We also observe that the distance from the rifting initiation to the craton influences the width of the margins. Additionally, we analyse viscosity, stress, strain and temperature fields given as an output from the models, in order to understand the feedbacks between the different processes that shape rifted margins in the presence of a craton.",

We investigated DOC sources in shallow soils on top of bedrock near the catchment divide to assess the hypothesis that organic matter in this portion of the catchment is a significant contributor of DOC to streamwater. In order to examine this hypothesis in the Appalachian mountain region of the eastern USA, we instrumented catchments at Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), NH, Upper Long Branch Experimental Watershed (UPL), NC and Panthertown Valley (PV), NC. Soils in the HBEF developed in glacial till while the soils in ULB and PV developed in unglaciated residuum. No-tension lysimeters were installed under the base layer of organic horizons in both shallow organic soils and the deeper mineral soils found downslope. Throughfall collectors were installed near sample sites to understand the differences of DOC concentration in coniferous and hardwood forests and inputs into the soil. DOC concentrations were compared to organic horizon thickness and flow regime to determine relationships controlling DOC sources. Shallow soils on top of bedrock had the highest DOC concentrations in the catchment in contrast to throughfall and streamwater chemistry. As shallow soils on bedrock are shown to be hotspots for DOC, future work should focus on the mobilization of metals in these zones due to complexation with organic compounds.",

UASs offer a myriad of benefits. Some of the most notable include: (1) reduced operational cost; (2) reduced lead-time for mission planning; (3) high-resolution and high-density data collection; and (4) customization of data collection intervals to fit the needs of a specific project (i.e. acquiring data at hourly, daily, or weekly intervals). Such benefits allow researchers and natural resource managers to acquire airborne remote sensing data on local-scale phenomenon in ways that were previously cost-prohibitive. VTOL UASs also offer a stable platform capable of low speed low altitude flight over small spatial scales that do not require a dedicated runway. Such flight characteristics allow VTOL UASs to collect high-resolution data at very high densities, enabling the use of structure from motion (SFM) techniques to generate three-dimensional datasets from photographs. When combined, these characteristics make VTOL UASs ideal for collecting data over agricultural or forested research areas. The goal of this study is to provide an overview of several lightweight eight-rotor VTOL UASs designed for small-scale forest remote sensing data collection. Specific objectives include: (1) the independent integration of a lightweight multispectral camera, a lightweight scanning lidar sensor, with required components (i.e. IMU, GPS, data logger) and the UAV; (2) comparison of UAS-collected data to terrestrial lidar data and airborne multispectral and lidar data; (3) comparison of UAS SFM techniques to terrestrial lidar data; and (4) multi-temporal assessment of tree decay using terrestrial lidar and UAS SfM techniques.",

The USDA Southwest Regional Climate Hub (SWRCH) developed Climate Change and the Water Cycle, an engaging and scientifically rigorous education unit for 6th -12th grade students. The unit is aligned with Common Core State Standards and Next Generation Science Standards. Nine activities can be conducted over 10 instruction hours. Each activity can also stand alone.\nIn partnership with SWRCH, the Asombro Institute for Science Education developed the unit. Each activity was reviewed by an educator for educational practices and by a scientist for scientific accuracy. The unit was pilot tested with 524 students in 2014, and pre- and post-tests were administered. Ninety-one percent of students were able to name a greenhouse gas on the post-test, compared to only 48% on the pre-test. On the post-test, 86% of students identified the relationship between average global temperature and carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, compared to only 52% on the pre-test. A student commented: “I loved all of the activities! They are fun and help us understand about what goes on in the world.”\nEducators who participated in pilot testing said: “the entire curriculum is great, but I was particularly impressed with the progression of ideas and the variety of lessons,” and “students could see the relevance and importance of these real life issues.”\nAnyone interested in using the unit to host workshops for teachers in southwestern states should contact Asombro for more information (information@asombro.org).

While mass-47 clumped isotope signatures are prone to thermal resetting and diagenesis, it remains the best tool for reconstructing temperatures in uncertain regimes, and can be integrated along with traditional tools such as textural petrography and cathodoluminescence to screen for diagenetic alteration. In this context, we analyze suites of Neoproterozoic and Paleozoic sediments and brachiopods for clumped isotope temperatures, and combine with microscopy and stratigraphic data to infer diagenetic and burial histories of these rocks. Samples judged to be unaltered will be further analyzed for the conditions prevalent during critical transitions during the evolution of metazoan life.",

Thanks to a long daily turbidity time series corresponding to measurements at one major karst spring since the mid-80's, we could investigate the large-scale atmospheric circulation control on below- or above-average turbidity periods. The turbidity time-series actually display periods on pluriannual duration during which daily turbid events are more frequent and have higher amplitudes, which can not be seen on daily precipitation records. Comparison was made between annual precipitation amounts, chalk aquifer water table variations and turbidity throughout this approximately 25-year period, which showed interannual recharge periods associated to above-normal turbid conditions. We then studied the linkages between such variations and large-scale atmospheric circulation using a NOAA sea level pressure reanalysis product. A wavelet multiresolution analysis of all hydrological and climatic signals revealed common aperiodic oscillations on interannual scales and allowed identification of the large-scale, interannual-scale atmospheric pattern that was responsible for those above-normal turbid periods; this atmospheric pattern was not necessarily similar to that responsible to any individual short-term turbid event.",

            "abstract": "Microbial communities mediate major ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling, and their recovery after disturbances plays a substantial role in overall ecosystem recovery and resilience. Disturbances directly shift microbial communities and their related processes, and the severity of impact typically varies significantly with landscape position, depth, and hydrological conditions such that different conditions indicate that a specific process will be dominant. Wildfires in the southwest US are a major source of landscape-scale disturbance, and are predicted to continue increasing in size and intensity under climate change. This study investigates changing nitrogen cycling across a post-wildfire catchment within the Jemez River Basin Critical Zone Observatory. This site experienced a mixed (intermediate to high) burn severity wildfire in June 2013. Nitrogen cycling was investigated by profiling via qPCR the abundance of five key genes involved in microbial nitrogen cycling (nifH, amoA, nirS, nirK, nosZ), at points along and within the catchment. These results are being analyzed in the context of broader microbial community data (enzyme assays, microbial cell counts and biomass, and 16S rRNA gene amplicons surveys) and biogeochemical data (total organic carbon, total nitrogen, pH, graviametric water content, etc). W 22 sites along the sides of the basin (planar zones) and within the hollow (convergent zone) were sampled at 13 days, one, and two years post-fire, at six discrete depth increments from 0 to 40 cm from the surface. We attribute significance of variation in gene abundance in planar versus convergent zones, and among depths, to the strong correlation of nitrogen cycling processes (i.e., nitrification and denitrification) with specific C:N ratios, total organic carbon content, and other biogeochemical and soil edaphic parameters that vary with landscape position and wildfire. Data were also interrogated for evidence of multi-year patterns in nutrient-cycling recovery post-fire, which are expected to correlate with patterns of nitrogen cycling post-wildfire seen in prominent literature.",

            "abstract": "Sea level rise (SLR) caused by climate change could cause significant disruptions in coastal communities across the world. Current projections estimate that we may see in the vicinity of 1 meter of SLR by the end of the century, and due to collapsing ice sheets in West Antarctica, more than 3 meters of global SLR appear very likely in the long run. It is therefore crucial that we begin to accurately understand both the short- and long-term effects this level of flooding could have on each country's land area and population. However, while we have high-resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) publicly available for some parts of the world, such as the coastal lidar datasets distributed by NOAA for the US, most of the rest of the world is only covered by much poorer-quality data, such as data from SRTM (3 arcsec, or roughly 90m, horizontal resolution). In this work, we perform SLR analysis using both NOAA lidar- and SRTM-derived DEMs in the United States, in order to understand how using low-quality DEMs affect the final analysis results. We find that in many states, the computed population exposure at 1 meter SLR is over 2x higher when using the Lidar DEM, compared to the results computed from SRTM. In addition to the clear differences in horizontal resolution, this very large difference in computed exposure could likely be explained by the fact that SRTM is based on surface elevation, while the Lidar DEM is based on bare earth elevation. We therefore conclude that any worldwide SLR analysis using SRTM would produce exposure estimates that are far too low, and higher-quality global DEMs are necessary in order to generate exposure analysis of reasonable accuracy.",

Models have shown that retrowedges behave differently from prowedges but what influences retrowedge behavior is still poorly understood. We use high-resolution numerical models to investigate several factors that influence the evolution of retrowedges and the mechanisms by which they do so. Because pro- and retrowedges are strongly influenced by each other, we model a complete doubly vergent orogen. We investigate the relative importance of 1) inherited extensional shear zones, 2) décollement horizons in the sedimentary cover, 3) sedimentation and erosion, and 4) mantle lithosphere strength. The influence of inherited structural weaknesses is investigated by creating a rift and then inverting it. Our numerical models demonstrate that this facilitates shortening in the retrowedge by reactivation of the rift margin resulting in thrusting of basement blocks on top of the upper plate, and also allows thrusting of lower crust onto the upper plate, such as observed in the Pyrenean and Alpine mountain belts. The décollement horizon in the sedimentary cover controls thin-skinned tectonics. Sedimentation influences rift inversion as well as the length of both thick-skinned and thin-skinned thrust sheets. Efficient erosion facilitates exhumation in the core of the orogen inhibiting transfer of shortening into the retrowedge.",

At the halfway point of the project we have completed two 40-day research cruises circumnavigating the British Isles and Ireland, and over 300 person-days of terrestrial fieldwork, yieldeding around 15 tonnes of samples for dating by optically stimulated luminescence-, surface exposure-, and radiocarbon methods. By March 2016 we expect to have generated about 850 new dates from landforms associated with the deglaciation of the last British and Irish ice-sheet.\nThe success of the project will in part depend on the team being able to provide ice-sheet modellers with robust chronological markers against which the ice-sheet models can be tested. The decision-making process in deciding robustness of ages derived from multiple samples and different Quaternary geochronological methods will be discussed. Some geochronological highlights thus far are that deglaciation of the northwest sector of the ice-sheet was in progress at 28ka, well before the global LGM, and the northern tip of mainland Scotland was ice free by 25ka. At the same time the Irish Sea ice stream in the south appears to have been advancing towards its maximum extend. Although deglaciation in the south commences much later, both the main southern and northern ice streams appear to have persisted for at least 10ka with final retreat onto the mainland occurring at approximately the same time (16ka).",

Due to the emergence of new satellites, such as Skybox, these satellites provide higher resolution imagery (e.g 1m) therefore improving the ability to map smallholder agriculture. For the smallholder farm dominated area of northern India, Skybox high-resolution satellite imagery can aid in understanding how to improve farm yields. In particular, we are interested in mapping winter wheat in India, as this region produces approximately 80% of the country’s wheat crop, which is important given that wheat is a staple crop that provides approximately 20% of household calories. In northeast India, the combination of increased heat stress, limited irrigation access, and the difficulty for farmers to access advanced farming technologies results in farmers only producing about 50% of their potential crop yield. The use of satellite imagery can aid in understanding wheat yields through time and help identify ways to increase crop yields in the wheat belt of India. To translate Skybox satellite data into meaningful information about wheat fields, we examine vegetation indices, such as the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), to measure the “greenness” of plants to help determine the health of the crops. We test our ability to predict crop characteristics, like sow date and yield, using vegetation indices of 59 fields for which we have field data in Bihar, India.",

Here we present a new model of the rise of the abiotic nitrogen fixation and associated pre-biotic chemistry in the early Earth and Mars atmosphere mediated by solar eruptive events. Our physical models of interaction of magnetic clouds ejected from the young Sun with magnetospheres of the early Earth show significant perturbations of geomagnetic fields that produce extended polar caps. These polar caps provide pathways for energetic particles associated with magnetic clouds to penetrate into the nitrogen-rich weakly reducing atmosphere and initiate the reactive chemistry by breaking molecular nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methane and producing hydrogen cyanide, the essential compound for life. The model also shows that contrary to the current models of warming of early Earth and Mars, major atmospheric constituents, CO2 and CH4 will be destroyed due to collisional dissociation with energetic particles. Instead, efficient formation of the potent greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide, as a by-product of these processes is expected. This mechanism can consistently explain the Faint Young Sun’s paradox for the early atmospheres of Earth and Mars. Our new model provides insight into how life may have initiated on Earth and Mars and how to search for the spectral signatures on planets “pregnant” with the potential for life.",

Using data from MagEIS and REPT instruments onboard the Van Allen Probes, a statistical survey of relativistic electron pitch angle distribution (PAD) is performed. By fitting relativistic electron PADs to Legendre polynomials, an empirical model of PADs as a function of L (from 1.4 to 6), MLT, electron energy (~100 keV – 5 MeV), and geomagnetic activity is developed and many intriguing features are found. In the outer radiation belt, an unexpected dawn/dusk asymmetry of ultra-relativistic electrons is found during quiet times, with the asymmetry becoming stronger at higher energies and at higher L shells. This may indicate the existence of physical processes acting on the relativistic electrons on the order of drift period, or be a signature of the partial ring current. In the inner belt and slot region, 100s of keV pitch angle distributions with minima at 90° are shown to be persistent in the inner belt and appears in the slot region during storm times. The model also shows clear energy dependence and L shell dependence of 90°-minimum pitch angle distribution. On the other hand, the head-and-shoulder pitch angle distributions are found during quiet times in the slot region, and the energy, L shell and geomagnetic activity dependence of those PADs are consistent with the wave-particle interaction caused by hiss waves.",

A physically based coupled hydrologic model was applied to a 45 km2 agricultural Iowa watershed. The tile drainage contribution to stream flow (QT/Q) was derived from a tracer driven analysis of instream surface water. QT/Q varied instantaneously from 6% to 71 % at the basin outlet, with tile flow correlating linearly with total stream flow. In low precipitation periods 62 % of stream flow traveled through the tile system. In heavy precipitation periods a dilution effect shifted QT/Q to 27 %. Precipitation driven events produced a strong positive logarithmic correlation between QT/Q and drainage area. The addition of precipitation into the system saturated near surface soils, increased lateral soil water movement, and diluted the relatively stable instream tile flow. A negative logarithmic trend in QT/Q to drainage area persisted non-event durations. Larger groundwater (non-tile) contribution to stream flow at the outlet diluted instream tile flow at increased drainage areas. Logarithmic regression slopes were consistent for event and non-event periods, respectively. While, the intercept responded in a predicable manner to precipitation intensity. This study, indicates a strong systematic response of QT/Q to meteorological forcing, drainage area over a single year.",

The rate of technological and related policy change has accelerated to the point that this historical model does not satisfy the needs of the community, publishers, or funders.\nThe development of a new mechanism for building consensus raises a number of questions:\nWhich aspects of our data are the focus of reproducibility standards?\nWho sets the standards?\nHow do we subdivide the development of the consensus? \nWe propose an open, transparent, and inclusive approach to the development of data and reproducibility standards that is organized around specific sub-disciplines and driven by the community of practitioners in those sub-disciplines. It should involve editors, program managers, and representatives of domain data facilities as well as professional societies, but avoid any single group to be the final authority. A successful example of this model is the Editors Roundtable, a cross section of editors, funders, and data facility managers that discussed and agreed on leading practices for the reporting of geochemical data in publications, including accessibility and format of the data, data quality information, and metadata and identifiers for samples (Goldstein et al., 2014). We argue that development of data and reproducibility standards needs to heavily rely on representatives from the community of practitioners to set priorities and provide perspective.\nGroups of editors, practicing scientists, and other stakeholders would be assigned the task of reviewing existing practices and recommending changes as deemed necessary. They would weigh the costs and benefits of changing the standards for that community, propose appropriate tools to facilitate those changes, work through the professional societies, gain community support, collect suggestions/edits, and ultimately approval and implementation through the journals. Domain data facilities such as the Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance (IEDA) can facilitate this process and support the groups.\nGoldstein et al.

In recent years, GSICS, via collaboration among member agencies across nations has successfully monitored instrument records for both GEO (GOES, SEVIRI, MTSAT) and LEO (AVHRR) based instruments by comparing them to in-orbit references such as IASI, AIRS and MODIS. The cross comparison products undergo stringent quality checks and standarizations and a scientific review of the theoretical bases and are assigned a GSICS maturity level. The accepted products are distributed freely as GSICS correction products. These products have wide applications.\nThe goal of the presentation is to introduce GSICS cross calibration products and demonstrate their applications in developing products such as Fundamental Climate Data Records (FCDRs), evaluating Spectral Response Function status, and providing bias corrections. The impact of the GSICS bias corrections on retrieval of downstream variables such as Cloud Height Sea Surface Temperature will be one component of the presentation.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost peatlands in northern latitudes are large reservoirs of sequestered carbon that are vulnerable to climate change. While peatlands account for a small fraction of total global land surfaces, their potential to release sequestered carbon in response to higher temperatures is of concern. Of particular relevance is the conversion of these carbon stores into methane (CH4), a strong greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 20 times greater than that of CO2 over a 100-year time frame. Here, we explore how key nutrients impact the consumption of CH4 at the Stordalen Mire in Abisko, Sweden, a discontinuous permafrost peatland with expanding thaw over the last century. Peatland CH4 emissions are highly spatially variable due to multiple emission pathways and strong dependence on several environmental factors. Among controls on CH4 emissions, such as temperature and water table depth, primary production of wetland vegetation is also a strong factor in the variability of CH4 emissions. Plant community shifts among permafrost thaw stages subsequently change nutrient cycling and availability, which in turn impacts primary production. Early stages of permafrost thaw are mosaicked with a variety of vascular plants and mosses. We analyzed potential enzymatic activities of chitinase, glucosidase, and phosphatase as proxies for organic nitrogen, carbon, and phosphorus cycling, respectively, in tandem with potential CH4 oxidation rates. In addition, stoichiometric ratios of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations are used to illustrate nutrient limitation controls on CH4 oxidation rates. While CH4 emissions are low throughout initial thaw stages, < 7 CH4 mg m-2 day-1, we found they had the highest rates of potential CH4 oxidation. These permafrost thaw-induced CH4 oxidation rates are 5 and 11 times higher, in the surface and depth of the peat profile respectively, than subsequent aerobic permafrost thaw stages. As CH4 emissions are low in intact permafrost peatlands, these high rates of potential CH4 oxidation indicate the importance of plant communities and the methanotrophic microbes they harbor.",

The scheme uses high-order compact finite differences for spatial derivatives, combined with a low storage Runge-Kutta method for time integration. The spatial and temporal schemes are optimized together for maximum wave number resolution. A high-order spatial filter is applied at each time step, with the coefficients chosen to suppress wavelengths that are not resolved by the difference scheme. An additional low order filter is applied in the vicinity of shocks to prevent spurious oscillations. This numerical scheme is used to solve the compressible Navier-Stokes equations of fluid dynamics in two dimensions on a rectangular Cartesian grid with, and without, molecular relaxation effects. This algorithm will be used to study the effects of nonlinearity on the amplitudes and spectra of infrasound signals of various phase types at up to first-bounce distances.",

It is thus important to evaluate the performance of weather and climate models, used for climate predictions and future projections, in simulating climate extremes. Here, we analyze a suite of atmosphere-only and fully-coupled, low- and high-resolution versions of the US Department of Energy (DOE) baseline Accelerated Climate Model for Energy (ACME v0) to assess their fidelity in simulating the statistics of extremes of surface temperature and precipitation. We generate linear models of extremes using the Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) theory for both observations and model output that capture both the stationary and non-stationary component of the variability of extremes. The non-stationary terms capture the dependence of extremes on large-scale natural modes of variability like the El Nino, North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), etc. We test the null hypothesis that the GEV model parameters derived from observations and the climate simulation are equal. Preliminary results suggest that while the high-resolution simulations capture the stationary component of extremes better over areas with varied topography, there is little gain in simulating the impact of low-frequency variability on climate extremes in simulations of the past few decades with the atmosphere-only model.",

Recently a number of new applications for mobile devices have been developed by our students. The RainMapper has been available on App Store and Google Play for the real-time PERSIANN-CCS observations.

We use the intermittency characteristics of renewable resources to assess the impact of renewable generation on the emissions of carbon dioxide and other air pollutants. Previous studies have investigated the impact of wind or solar generation on emissions; rather than focusing on a particular technology, we separate the intermittent resource into its components – specifically variability, predictability, and timing – and isolate the effect of each component. For the Texas electricity grid, we use the observed outputs of generating units to econometrically estimate the effect of each intermittency characteristic on CO2, SO2, and NOx emissions. We then use the econometric results to evaluate and compare the expected emissions implications of adding different resources to the system. While the econometric estimates are derived from the wind currently online in Texas, the decomposition of the intermittency makes the results technology agnostic and allows for a comparison between prospective resources of different types. Preliminary results will be presented.",

Engineers with extensive experience in science data, software engineering and computer-information architectures are needed to lead and perform these activities. The increasing types and complexity of instrument data and emerging computer technologies coupled with the current shortage of computer engineers with backgrounds in science has led the need to develop a career path for science data systems engineers and architects.\nThe current career path, in which undergraduate students studying various disciplines such as Computer Engineering or Physical Scientist, generally begins with serving on a development team in any of the disciplines where they can work in depth on existing Goddard data systems or serve with a specific NASA science team. There they begin to understand the data, infuse technologies, and begin to know the architectures of science data systems. From here the typical career involves peer mentoring, on-the-job training or graduate level studies in analytics, computational science and applied science and mathematics. At the most senior level, engineers become subject matter experts and system architect experts, leading discipline-specific data centers and large software development projects. They are recognized as a subject matter expert in a science domain, they have project management expertise, lead standards efforts and lead international projects. A long career development remains necessary not only because of the breath of knowledge required across physical sciences and engineering disciplines, but also because of the diversity of instrument data being developed today both by NASA and international partner agencies and because multi-discipline science and practitioner communities expect to have access to all types of observational data.\nThis paper describes an approach to defining career-path guidance for college-bound high school and undergraduate engineering students, junior and senior engineers from various disciplines.",

While extensive literatures and applications about the drug delivery in human and animal bodies exist, the targeted delivery using similar delivery carriers in subsurface porous media is not well understood. The dual transport process study is an explorative study for the targeted delivery in porous media. While the colloid transport is dominated by the advection process and the solute transport is dominated by the advection-dispersion, the dual transport process is the process with the first step of carrier transport, which is dominated by advection, and then after the release of cargo, the transport of cargo is dominated by advection-dispersion. By applying the random walk particle tracking (RWPT) approach, we investigate how the carriers transport in porous media and how the cargo release mechanisms affect the cargo distribution for the targeted delivery in various patterns of porous media. The RWPT numerical model will be verified against the experimental results of dual transport process in packed-disk 2D micromodels. The understanding of the mechanism of dual transport process is crucial to achieve the potential applications of targeted delivery in improved oil and gas recovery, CO2 sequestration, environmental remediation, and soil biomediation.",

Vast fill terrace staircases of up to 400 m height above current river levels, and intercalated lake sediments point to repeated phases of incision and aggradation within the region. Despite a broad interest in a better understanding of mechanisms that modulate plateau erosion, age constraints on the generation of these impressive features remain sparse, though indicate mainly Pleistocene formation ages.\nHere we present new data from the More Plains section, a vast sedimentary fill, located in the headwaters of the Zanskar River, the largest tributary to the upper Indus. The vast sedimentary successions of the More Plains originally belonged to a former endorheic basin that has been tapped by the Zanskar River, today revealing a sedimentary exposures of >250 m thickness.\nWe combine morphometric analysis and field based observations with 10Be surface exposure dating and basin-wide denudation rates to constrain the late Quaternary history of this setting. Analysis of a 10Be depth profile on top of the More Plains section indicate a surface exposure age of ~125 +/- 15 ka, which is supported by ages from nearby amalgamated surface samples. Grounding on a morphometric approach, we estimate that ~1.65-1.95 km3 were removed from this section by fluvial erosion since aggradation ceased, requiring a specific sediment yield of 85-100 t km-2 yr-1 averaged over the past 125 ka. This outweighs the 10Be-constrained flux of sediment from adjacent catchments by a factor of 2-3, suggesting that dissection of large Pleistocene valley fills might constitute a significant source of sediment in Transhimalayan rivers, potentially offsetting estimates of bedrock denudation in the region.",

            "abstract": "Paleoclimate model simulations are often evaluated using observed paleovegetation data (e.g., pollen and plant macrofossils) that record vegetation responses to past climate changes. These observed vegetation data can be combined with mechanistic vegetation model simulations to develop process-based evaluations of paleoclimate model simulations. The use of mechanistic vegetation model simulations allows us to identify the particular spatial and temporal features of individual paleoclimate simulations that may be producing agreement or disagreement between the observed and simulated vegetation data. We used this approach to evaluate a set of eight PMIP3 (Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project phase 3) paleoclimate simulations for 6 ka and 21 ka from the CMIP5 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5) database. Climate data were regridded onto a 10-km grid of North America using the PMIP3 vegetation simulation protocol. The regridded climate data were used as input to BIOME4, an equilibrium vegetation model, to simulate 6 ka and 21 ka biomes across the study area. The simulated biome data were compared with observed paleovegetation data from the BIOME 6000 (version 4.2) dataset. In general, agreement between simulated and observed biomes was greater for forest biomes than for non-forest biomes. We evaluated specific instances of disagreement between the simulated and observed biomes to determine whether the biome disagreement was produced by the climate model simulation (e.g., temperature bias), the vegetation model simulation (e.g., inability to simulate important disturbance regimes), the observed paleovegetation data (e.g., limits in the biomization method), or a combination of these factors. The results are summarized and we describe some of the strengths and limitations of this data-model comparison approach for evaluating paleoclimate simulations.",

However, end-member soil organic carbon from permafrost with different organic carbon contents, C-14 ages, and degradation states remain poorly characterized, especially for soil-derived dissolved organic matter (DOM) which is the active component in carbon cycling. Soil samples collected from permafrost in northern Alaska were used to determine the yield of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the bulk soil organic carbon (SOC) pool. The soil-derived DOM was further characterized for organic composition using fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) coupled with PARAFAC analysis and for DOM size distribution using flow field-flow fractionation techniques. Degradation of soil-derived DOM was also carried out to examine the degradation rate and changes in DOM composition, size spectra and other optical properties. The soil DOC yield was generally low, ranging from ~1-5% of the total SOC, and was correlated to bulk SOC contents and C-14 age, with higher DOC yields in older soil. High SUVA (at 254 nm) values were measured for soil DOM samples, ranging from 8 to 10 mg-C/L/m. Major fluorescent DOM components include terrestrial fulvic-like, protein-like, and humic-like DOM with their Ex/Em at 245/444, <240/376, and 275/508 nm, respectively. Humic-like DOM was partitioned mostly in the <3-6 nm size range, while protein-like DOM partitioned in a much wider size spectrum. However, protein-like DOM in old soil became mostly in the small colloidal size range (<5-8 nm), indicating the preferential degradation of large MW protein compounds. Humic components seem to degrade preferentially compared to protein-like DOM components, resulting in a relatively higher percentage of protein-like DOM in old soil samples. Overall, different soil DOM components may have their distinct fate and degradation pathways during their interaction with aquatic environments in a changing climate.",

            "abstract": "Plate tectonics and subduction operating over much of the Earth’s history can induce mantle mixing, chemical heterogeneities and recycle volatiles into the mantle. Some slabs are penetrating into the deep lower mantle, but others are stagnated near the transition zone (TZ). Presumably, the thermochemical state of the TZ is a consequence of delicate balance and feedback between the short-term and long-term mixing. Near the stagnant slab, what’s the thermochemical state of the TZ? what’s the degree of hydration in the TZ?\nTZ seismic discontinuities hold the key to resolve the mystery of mass and heat transport in the Earth’s mantle as well as the composition of the Earth’s interior. But deciphering discontinuity properties are not trivial. Data were typically limited to either mantle triplications, converted waves (P-to-S or S-to-P) or mantle reflections (e.g. SS precursors, ScS reverberations). These observations place constraints on the velocity gradient near the discontinuity as well as discontinuity reflectivity, but hardly offer independent information on the density jump or/and density gradient. In few cases where multiple datasets are jointly analysed to resolve the density jump, the region of sensitivity (or the fresnel zone) of different dataset does not necessarily coincide. Finally, the use of short period (~1 Hz) data (e.g., P’P’ precursors) or long period (~> 0.1 Hz) data (e.g., SS precursors) does not allow us to simultaneously address the transition width and the gradient near the discontinuity.\nWe advocate a simple and effective strategy. Specifically, we involve broadband direct converted waves (e.g., P410s, P660s) and the topside reflections (the multiples, e.g., PpP410s, PpP660s) in the context of P wave receiver function technique. Such a tactic not only minimizes tradeoffs between velocity and density jumps, but allows self-consistent estimates of the shear velocity jump, the density jump, the transition width and the velocity/density gradient near the boundary. We will detail our first attempt near the region of stagnant slab beneath China. These new observations, along with the thermodynamic framework, HeFESTo, allow us to test and validate hypotheses including the state of mantle mixing and equilibrium, compositional heterogeneities and the degree of hydration in the TZ.",

            "abstract": "Quartzite rheology has been extensively studied to model the strength of continental crust. Previous studies have shown that the presence of water in fluid inclusions weakens polycrystalline quartz, and this weakening is usually related to water fugacity. However, no attempt has been made to determine the effect of water content on the strength of quartz.\nWe have deformed hot-pressed quartz aggregates with low water contents at a pressure of 1.5 GPa, a temperature of 1200°C, and strain rates of 10-4 to 10-6/s. Fine synthetic quartz powders were hot-pressed at 1120°C and 1.5 GPa for 24 hours to create quartzites with a grain size of ~20 microns and water contents of <150 H/106Si. The water band in FTIR spectra collected from the hot-pressed quartz aggregates is similar to the broad water band observed in natural quartzites (i.e. free water in fluid inclusions) rather than the spectra observed in synthetic quartz crystals. Results of deformation experiments indicate that the strain rate sensitivity of the strength of these quartz aggregates is consistent with deformation by dislocation creep (n~3.5). Microstructures observed in samples from these experiments include undulatory extinction, flattened grains, and bulging grain boundaries, which are also consistent with dislocation creep.\nThe strength of these quartz aggregates deformed with low water contents (<150 H/106 Si) are an order of magnitude greater than the strengths predicted by polycrystalline quartz flow laws derived from quartzites with high (>2000 H/106Si) water contents. Our results indicate that quartz strength is dependent on water content, in addition to being dependent on water fugacity.",

The laminar flow regime in unconsolidated surficial aquifers creates narrow reaction zones. Studying these reaction zones requires fine-scale sampling of water together with adjacent sediment in a manner that preserves in situ redox conditions. Collecting representative samples of these narrow zones with traditional subsurface sampling equipment is challenging. For example, use of a basket type core catcher for saturated, non-cohesive sediments results in loss of fluid and sediments during retrieval.\nA sample-freezing drive shoe designed for a wire line piston core sampler allowed collection of cores with intact sediment, microbial, and pore fluid distributions and has been the basis for studies documenting centimeter-scale variations in aquifer microbial populations (Murphy and Herkelrath, 1996). However, this freezing drive shoe design is not compatible with modern-day direct push sampling rigs.\nA re-designed sample-freezing drive shoe compatible with a direct-push dual-tube coring system was developed and field-tested. The freezing drive shoe retained sediment and fluid distributions in saturated sediment core samples by freezing a 10 centimeter plug below the core sample with liquid CO­2. Core samples collected across the smear zone at a crude oil spill site near Bemidji, Minnesota, were successfully extracted without loss of fluid or sediment. Multiple core sections from different depths in the aquifer were retrieved from a single hole. This new design makes a highly effective sampling technology available on modern-day direct push sampling equipment to inform myriad questions about subsurface biogeochemistry processes. The re-design of the freezing drive shoe was supported by the USGS Innovation Center for Earth Sciences.\n",

This paper presents a multi-faceted evaluation of the WRF-hydro modeling system in preparation for operational national streamflow prediction. The testing period encompasses the 2015 warm season which included the National Flood Interoperability Experiment (NFIE) where WRF-Hydro and the RAPID channel routing model were driven by the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) estimates as the real-time precipitation estimate product and the High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) for the short term forecast. Here, we validate the MRMS estimates and HRRR precipitation forecasts at national scale using daily precipitation observations from the Global Historical Climatology Network (GHCN). Because WRF-Hydro has several physics options such as surface overland flow, saturated subsurface flow, channel routing as well as conceptual deep groundwater base flow also conducted additional simulations to evaluate WRF-Hydro performance under different processes configurations. Streamflow verification data for model simulations and predictions was completed for a subset of GAGES-II reference basins. Multi-temporal and spatial scale verification is performed in order to test the robustness and skill improvement in WRF-Hydro streamflow simulations under different configuration over a wide range of basins sizes and from short-term (hourly) to longer-term (monthly) flow simulations. Evaluation will be also carried out based on various geographic regions to relate the skill improvement to dominant controls on flow based on the actual physical and climatic properties of the basins. The goal is to inform WRF-Hydro model configuration for the initial operating capabilities (IOC) project and target processes and parameter estimates for improvement.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Evans_AGU_2015.pdf\nObservational records show substantial interannual to inter-decadal variability in dust concentrations, which have been related to changes in source extent and intensity. GCMs, however, have long struggled to reproduce this low frequency variability. A possible cause for this lack of variability is that GCM dust emission parameterizations frequently are not embedded within dynamic land models with prognostic vegetation and land use changes. These changes vary more slowly in time than surface winds, creating memory in the model, and providing pathways through which dust emission can feedback on itself via dust induced changes in rainfall. Here we use a new dust emission model to explore this structural uncertainty, and demonstrate that inclusion of a prognostic land surface in the dust emission parameterization is important to simulating low frequency dust variability.\nWe use an updated version of GFDL’s Land Model 3 (LM3) running within Coupled Atmosphere-Ocean-Land-Sea ice Models version 3 (CM3) and compare its output to the CM3 runs in the CMIP5 archive. In the CMIP5 control run, dust emission has a prescribed spatial pattern and seasonal cycle that is modulated only by surface wind speed. In our updated version of LM3, dust emission depends not only on wind speed, but also on the soil water and ice, snow cover, leaf and stem area indices, and land use type, all of which, with the exception of land use, are prognostic. We run 500 years of 1860 conditions for the updated LM3 and compare to the CM3 1860 control run in the CMIP5 archive. By allowing soil water and vegetation to respond to climate and in turn affect dust emission, we increase the inter-decadal variability in dust that was lacking. The radiative forcing from the dust then increases the low frequency variability in regional precipitation and climate indices such as the AMO. Our findings suggest that accounting for land surface conditions is an important step toward accurately modeling both the observed climate variability of the recent past and simulating projected changes in the future.",

            "abstract": "Evapotranspiration from maize and soybean crops is an important component of terrestrial water balance in the US Midwest. In this study we examine water use in continuous maize (corn) vs. maize-soybean rotations, with cover crops planted in some years. From 2010-14, we continuously measured growing season evapotranspiration (ET) based on daily drawdown of soil moisture content using TDR (time-domain reflectometry) probes installed throughout the root zone. Treatments included continuous maize (CM), continuous maize with cover crops (CMC) and maize-soybean rotation with cover crops (MSC), all grown without irrigation in a temperate humid climate (Michigan, USA). Cover crops were planted in the autumn after harvest of the main crop and harvested in spring prior to planting of the next main crop during 2012-2013 (2013) and 2013-2014 (2014). Four study years (2010, 2011, 2013 and 2014) had normal growing season rainfall (568, 555, 445, and 472 mm) while 2012 was an extreme drought season with a growing-season rainfall deficit of ~50% (210 mm below average). Growing season ET in CM, CMC and MSC during years of normal rainfall averaged 517, 433, and 443 mm, respectively, compared to 455, 374 and 304 mm in the 2012 drought year. Cover crop ET was inconsequential to the subsequent main crops due to abundant rainfall in the spring periods; soils held as much water as they could at the transition from cover crops to main crops. Grain yield in years of normal rainfall for CM, CMC and MSC averaged 12.6, 8.4 and 7.8 Mg ha-1, respectively, compared to 4.9, 4.0, and 4.0 Mg ha-1 in the 2012 drought year. Maximum biomass in years of normal rainfall averaged 38, 30 and 21 Mg ha-1 compared to 19, 13, and 13 Mg ha-1 in the drought year. Water use efficiencies, defined as ratio of maximum standing-stock biomass to growing season evapotranspiration, were 74, 69, and 47 kg ha-1 mm-1 for CM, CMC and MSC in years of normal rainfall, while values in the drought year were 41, 34 and 46 kg ha-1 mm-1. Compared to CM, our results suggest that ET and biomass were reduced when maize was grown with cover crops either continuously or in rotation with soybean. However the reduced yield of maize with cover crops cannot be ascribed to water competition with the cover crops; rather, the later planting dates following cover crops likely explain the reduced ET and yields.",

            "abstract": "Determining the drivers of tree mortality in Amazonia is a complex task, yet essential to reliable prediction of carbon storage in a warmer climate. Past studies have shown an east-west gradient of forest disturbance and rainfall amount across Amazonia. This study uses remote sensing and dynamic vegetation modeling to take a deeper look at drivers of tree mortality and community composition shifts associated with varying mortality rates. Our analysis, using 20 years of Landsat 5 images, showed that ever-wet Amazonia (located in north-west Amazonia, i.e. NWA) was more susceptible to windthrows than the Central Amazon (i.e. CA), which has a a well-defined dry season. The higher frequency of windthrows in NWA forest correlates with higher frequency and intensity of deep convection events in this region, observed using Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) data. While a combination of factors including: soil characteristics (and by proxy rooting depth) and community composition exacerbate the regional gradient of disturbance, wind was the mechanistic agent of disturbance. Using an individual-based gap model for tropical forests populated with the most representative NWA tree species and increased mortality rates, we found a decrease of biomass in this region and a slight increase in NPP compared to a control simulation, a pattern that is similar to observations. The model predicted which species had the largest response in basal area change due to elevated disturbance, but there was a non-significant shift in community composition in the NWA forests. However, analysis found strong differences in community composition between the modeled NWA and CA regions, consistent with observed results. When CA forests were subject to higher mortality rate similar to the current NWA region, dissimilarity in community composition continued to persist. In addition the model identified species-specific maximum tree height and maximum diameter as the most influential predictors of mortality, thus leading to species-specific susceptibility to windthrows. Including dynamic mortality mechanisms in Earth system models will allow us to examine changes in forest biomass turnover associated with wind-related tree disturbance. This need has become more relevant due to the projected increase in rainfall intensity in NWA.",

            "abstract": "The collapse of turbulence in the stable boundary layer is investigated using a one dimensional model of Couette flow. We demonstrate that the maximum sustainable heat flux (MSHF) framework for predicting turbulent collapse is qualitatively robust to the choice of turbulence parameterization and extend these earlier stability analyses by numerically determining the unstable modes along the unstable branch. All of the parametrizations exhibit a MSHF beyond which turbulence collapses, yet important quantitative differences in equilibrium structure between the models were found. Whereas the equilibrium structure for Businger-Dyer-type stability functions are independent of the momentum roughness length z0, all of the other relations show a strong dependence on z0 with regard to their shapes and the value of the MSHF. As for the stability properties of the equilibrium curves, these all depend on z0 and only a single unstable eigenmode was found along the unstable branches. Transitions between stable and unstable regimes occur at extrema of the equilibrium curves in parameter space. Remarkably, some of the parameterizations even exhibit multiple extrema separating, disjointed regions of stability and instability. In practice, the MSHF framework is robust qualitatively, but the quantitative differences that arise as a result of varying the turbulent closure scheme must be accounted for when using the MSHF framework to predict the collapse of turbulence in the SBL especially in the case of small z0.

These maps allow us to better compare storm evolution with eddies observed in Fast Fourier Synoptic Mapping (FFSM) of Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) temperatures. FFSM analysis of TES 3.7 hPa thermal data shows the presence of eastward traveling waves from 40 - 60° S with a period of about three sols.\nThese maps use a new dust characterization scheme that categorizes dust storms and dust entrained in gravity waves by degree of (visual) structure. Preliminary analysis of these data indicate concurrent eastward migration of both storms and eddies. We hypothesize that these waves are transient baroclinic eddies that contributed to the initiation of precursor storms near Hellas.",

            "abstract": "Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation measurement have been used extensively in petroleum and, more recently, in groundwater resource evaluation to estimate the porosity, pore-size distributions, permeability, fluid saturation, and fluid mobility. In shale, the transverse decay rate of NMR signal is sensitive to the microporosity, but is also affected by the paramagnetic contributions of clay and other iron-bearing minerals. Furthermore, contrasts in the magnetic susceptibility of the mineral matrix and pore fluids that result in an inhomogeneous magnetic field within the pore space results in an extra term in transverse relaxation. These issues can cause errors in NMR-based estimates of pore-size distribution and permeability. In this study we compare T1 and T2 relaxation time distributions in order to study the molecular mechanism of relaxation in brine-saturated mixtures of clay and other common minerals. We collected measurements on a range of mixtures of clay minerals common in shale (illite, glauconite, celadonite, chamosite, montmorillonite and kaolinite) and pyrite. To constrain the interpretation of the NMR data, we measured the magnetic susceptibility and surface area of all samples. We are confident that by accounting for the presence and variations of clay and pyrite in shale, we can substantially improve both the NMR estimate of pore-size distribution and permeability.",

We report on the construction and deployment of detector packages that measure spectra, temperature, pressure, and relative humidity. Each standalone detector is mounted at rooftop level and measures and dumps photon spectra in the 0 to ~1.8 MeV regime every 10 minutes, and meterological parameters and overall photon count rate every 30 seconds. Using the precisely known positions and GPS timing of up to 10 detectors spread over western Illinois, eastern Iowa, and southern Wisconsin, we have measured atmospheric photon events in many different conditions, (including at least one tornadic storm). Our preliminary results demonstrate that a complex and changing background is present that must be characterized and understood before clear identification of TGEs and other high-energy photon events is possible. Our preliminary studies show photon events that occur on a variety of time scales, from rapid events that occur in periods of less than 30 seconds to events that last hours and show the spectral signature of the rainout of U-238 chain daughters. We present these events along with our initial attempts to understand and characterize these events and if/how they correlate with local meteorological conditions and lightning strike data from WWLLN. Finally we present what important experimental techniques we learned, our plans for upgrades and expansion of the detector array, and plans for future modeling activities to understand these data. We present how to access our expanding dataset online. This research is supported by a grant from the NSF: AGS-1232594",

By reducing the divergence damping, all tidal components become significantly larger. In this study, we evaluate tides in the new version of NCAR Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and ionosphere extension (WACCM-X) by comparing the tidal amplitudes and phases with existing observations.

            "abstract": "Plinian eruptions are the most dangerous style of eruptive activity of basaltic magma. In this study, we focus on the two best studied Plinian eruptions of basaltic magma at Mt. Tarawera, New Zealand (1886 CE) and Mt. Etna, Italy (122 BCE). We measured and analyzed the porosity-permeability relationships of the pyroclasts from both eruptions. We then used numerical modeling to assess the relative importance of two competing processes during eruptive magma ascent, which are the syneruptive crystallization that increases viscosity, potentially increasing bubble overpressure, and the open-system degassing of the permeable magma that allows the pressurized gas to escape, potentially reducing bubble overpressure. We find that the onset of crystallization is likely to have occurred prior to the onset of magma percolation. The orders of magnitude increase in magma viscosity due to the nucleation and growth of microlites had the combined effect of rapidly increasing the decompression rate, due to viscous pressure losses associated with magma flow within the volcanic conduit, and decreasing the rates of bubble growth, thus building up large overpressures inside bubbles. Although measured permeabilities of the studied pyroclasts are 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than their silicic counterpart, our model results show that crystallization and subsequent increase in viscosity are likely to surpass the effect of open-system gas loss, thus increasing bubble overpressure, required for explosive magma fragmentation.",

            "abstract": "The Rio Grande-Rio Chama (RG-RC) fluvial system of southern Colorado and northern New Mexico preserves a record of southern Rocky Mountain erosion and sediment transport over the last 8 Ma. During this time the two rivers have evolved wildly, undergoing channel migrations, drainage capture and integration events, carving and refilling of paleocanyons, lake spill-overs, and reshaping of drainage divides. New 40Ar/39Ar basalt ages coupled with new detrital grain age population data for fluvial sediments are beginning to reconstruct the birth of the RG-RC fluvial system and elucidate the processes that drove its evolution over the last ~8 Ma.\nTwenty-three detrital grain samples have been collected from RG-RC river deposits ranging in age from ~8 Ma (RC) and 4.5 Ma (RG) to modern fluvial sediment. Detrital zircon age spectra for the RG reveal peaks at 25 Ma, 28 Ma, 30-35 Ma (San Juan volcanic), and 70-90Ma (San Juan Basin) in sediments deposited from 4.5 to 0 Ma. RC spectra are richer in San Juan Basin and San Juan volcanic detritus. A 2.6 Ma Totavi Lentil deposit downstream of today’s RG-RC confluence is similar to the ancestral RG, while a 1.6 Ma Totavi Lentil is similar to the combined RG-RC, suggesting northward shift of the RG-RC confluence by 1.6 Ma due to Jemez Mountain volcanism. A 4.5 Ma basalt age from Black Mesa and occurrence of San Juan volcanic detritus in 3 to 5 Ma sediment suggests birth of an ancestral RG as early as 4.5 Ma. There is no record of an ancestral RG north of the Red River confluence for the 3.0 to 0.5 Ma time period, supporting prior work that northern San Luis Basin became integrated after 0.5 Ma spill-over of Lake Alamosa. We plan to add detrital sanidine dating to refine the age spectra and help further delineate drainage patterns.\nThe RG-RC system drains a highly tectonically active region. Changes in the fluvial regime suggest: 1) long-lived source of detritus (some recycled) from the San Juan volcanic field, 2) downstream integration of the RG-RC system to central NM at 4.5 Ma due to uplift of the Taos Plateau, 3) drainage reorganization due to Jemez Mountain caldera volcanism, and 4) integration of the RG after 0.5 Ma spillover of Lake Alamosa. Climatic changes likely interacted, but correlation of fluvial changes to magmatic events supports tectonics as the main driver of these major fluvial changes in the RG-RC system.",

            "abstract": "The marine ice instability can trigger rapid retreat of marine ice streams. Recent observations suggest that marine ice systems in West Antarctica have begun retreating. However, unknown ice dynamics, computationally intensive mathematical models, and uncertain parameters in these models make predicting retreat rate and ice volume difficult. In this work, we fuse current observational data with ice stream/shelf models to develop probabilistic predictions of future grounded ice sheet volume.\nGiven observational data (e.g., thickness, surface elevation, and velocity) and a forward model that relates uncertain parameters (e.g., basal friction and basal topography) to these observations, we use a Bayesian framework to define a posterior distribution over the parameters. A stochastic predictive model then propagates uncertainties in these parameters to uncertainty in a particular quantity of interest (QoI)---here, the volume of grounded ice at a specified future time. While the Bayesian approach can in principle characterize the posterior predictive distribution of the QoI, the computational cost of both the forward and predictive models makes this effort prohibitively expensive. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new Markov chain Monte Carlo method that constructs convergent approximations of the QoI target density in an online fashion, yielding accurate characterizations of future ice sheet volume at significantly reduced computational cost.\nOur second goal is to attribute uncertainty in these Bayesian predictions to uncertainties in particular parameters. Doing so can help target data collection, for the purpose of constraining the parameters that contribute most strongly to uncertainty in the future volume of grounded ice. For instance, smaller uncertainties in parameters to which the QoI is highly sensitive may account for more variability in the prediction than larger uncertainties in parameters to which the QoI is less sensitive. We use global sensitivity analysis to help answer this question, and make the computation of sensitivity indices computationally tractable using a combination of polynomial chaos and Monte Carlo techniques.",

Siting and mitigation of solar energy often requires understanding of basic biology and distributions of rare species that are unknown. How can we rapidly collect the information necessary on species- and site-specific population dynamics to effectively design mitigation and conservation measures? We have developed an integrated approach to assessing the vulnerability of a suite of representative rare plant species in the region. We implemented a prioritized series of demographic and experimental studies over the past four years to identify the types of species, populations, and life stages most vulnerable to impact or prone to conservation efforts. We have found substantial variation in vegetative and sexual reproduction between study populations for several rare plants, including between populations that vary in putative impact by development and/or effects of experimental solar arrays. For a subset of species, we designed population viability analysis and applied them to identify sensitive vital rates and compare quasi-extinction probabilities under different climate and impact scenarios. By utilizing practical experiments to test for the effects of real or simulated impacts, we found differences in vital rates between natural and disturbed populations adjacent to and within solar installations. We draw conclusions from our work to guide the analysis of benefits, permitting, and design of utility-scale solar energy facilities.",

Seismic velocities calculated from xenolith compositions are used in conjunction with petrologic information to interpret geophysical models of the area. The lower crust is composed of mafic compositions and contains a high percentage of quenched partial melt. The combination of quenched partial melt and mafic composition explains the relatively low seismic velocities observed in seismic models. The mafic composition is consistent with a rift environment. Melt compositions, some with > 60 wt% SiO2 are found in all types of Cima xenoliths, although pyroxenites and gabbros contain the largest amount. Pyroxenite from the uppermost mantle transitions into gabbroic compositions and plagioclase rich lithologies in the crust. Temperatures calculated for peridotite xenoliths range from ~ 950 to 1030˚ C. Plagioclase bearing samples have the lowest temperatures and are interpreted as residing in the immediate sub-Moho mantle. Plagioclase bearing lherzolite structurally overlies spinel bearing peridotite. Strain accumulation is most prevalent in plagioclase bearing peridotite and virtually absent from pyroxenites and gabbros. Seismic velocities calculated for peridotite xenoliths are faster than pyroxenite and gabbroic samples. Despite the chemical heterogeneity and complex history of the Moho transitional are most mantle is composed dominantly by peridotite. Very little lithosphere, rhelologically speaking, remains under the volcanic field. We interpret lithospheric dismemberment to be caused by hot mantle working northward from the Gulf of California.",

The first phase of model development was initiated in 2014 using the MIKE SHE/MIKE 11 hydrological modeling package which has a geographic information systems (GIS) user interface built into its system that can directly use spatial GIS databases (geodatabases) for model inputs. This study developed an ArcGIS geodatabase to support the hydrological modeling work for SRS. The coupling of a geodatabase with MIKE SHE/MIKE 11 numerical models can serve as an efficient tool that significantly reduces the time needed for data preparation. The geodatabase provides an advanced spatial data structure needed to address the management, processing, and analysis of large GIS and timeseries datasets derived from multiple sources that are used for numerical model calibration, uncertainty analysis, and simulation of flow and contaminant fate and transport during extreme climatic events. The geodatabase developed is based on the ArcHydro and ArcGIS Base Map data models with modifications made for project specific input parameters. The significance of this approach was to ensure its replicability for potential application in other watersheds. This paper describes the process of development of the SRS geodatabase and the application of GIS tools to pre-process and analyze hydrological model data; automate repetitive geoprocessing tasks; and produce maps for visualization of the surface water hydrology of the Tims Branch watershed.\n Key Words: GIS, hydrological modeling, geodatabase, hydrology, MIKE SHE/MIKE 11",

            "abstract": "ePoster - poster.pdf\nThermals—small, transient air bubbles—have proved to be useful when taken as the basic convective element in order to investigate cumulus convection dynamics. The thermals' transient nature is a key element of convection that can hardly be depicted by the classical steady plume, making the thermal framework a good candidate for the development of new convection parameterizations. In order to fully characterize the dynamics of thermals under different convective regimes, we track thousands of thermals in three 3D Large Eddy Simulations (LES) using WRF at 65m resolution: two sea-breeze type experiments with different island sizes and one case of daytime convective development over land based on observations from the Large-Scale Biosphere-Atmosphere (LBA) field study. Overall, thermals are not fundamentally different throughout the different simulations. Their internal vortical circulation is such that they rise much slower than the updraft core speed would suggest, while they mix vigorously with the environment without losing momentum. We find that drag on these thermals is not related to mixing, but rather can be parameterized as standard dissipative drag, proportional to W2R-1. On average thermals suffer a drag comparable to that of a solid sphere moving through a quiescent fluid (with drag coefficient 0.4<cd<0.8). However, this relationship is sensitive to convective intensity: as convection intensifies, the drag coefficient decreases, i.e., thermals become less `sticky' and more `slippery'.",

While there are many estimates of air temperature responses to climate change, the sensitivity of streams, particularly small headwater streams, to warming temperatures is less well understood. A substantial body of literature correlates sub-annual scale temperature variations in air and stream temperatures driven by annual cycles in solar angle. However, these may be a low-precision proxy for climate change driven changes in the stream energy balance, particularly in warmer months. We analyzed summer stream temperature records from forested streams in the Pacific Northwest for interannual correlations to air temperature and standardized annual streamflow departures. A significant pattern emerged where cold streams always showed lower sensitivities to air temperature variation, while warm streams could be insensitive or sensitive depending on geological or vegetation context. A pattern where cold streams are less sensitive to direct temperature increases is important for conservation planning, although substantial questions yet remain for secondary effects related to changes in snowpack, summer runoff, groundwater, or vegetation.",

            "abstract": "How do deeply weathered, soil mantled hillslopes in the tropics respond to sudden changes in the erosion rate? Do they re-adjust gradually, or in flashy, threshold driven pulses? One method for addressing this is to examine the soil profile, by asking the question: is the rate of production of soil in equilibrium with the rate of erosion of topsoil? We measure in-situ produced cosmogenic 10Be in the topsoil, at the soil-saprolite interface, and at several intermediate depth intervals to obtain a quantitative measure of soil mantle disequilibrium in a landscape responding to a rapid change in erosion rate in the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory, Puerto Rico. Geomorphic features in the tropical Luquillo Mountains indicate a well-defined elevation boundary separating a quickly eroding landscape below from a slowly eroding ‘relict’ landscape above. A high-energy knickzone extends from the floodplain to ~600 m elevation on all of the channels draining the ridgelines, but above this elevation streams are sandy and low gradient. Catchment wide erosion rates measured upstream and downstream of the 600 m knickpoint using cosmogenic 10Be confirm that the knickzone defines a sudden change in the rate at which materials are exported. This wave of enhanced erosion triggered by the knickzone migration provides a natural experiment to study the change in morphology and response of soils to a change in rate over time. Ridgelines in the relict zone above 600 m are typically broad with deep, nutrient depleted soil profiles, while ridgelines below the knickzone are sharp, narrow features with shallow, poorly developed soil horizons in the adjusted portion of the landscape. Our study targets ridgetops above and below 600 m that appear to be narrowing in response to the backward propagation of the knickzone. We provide a spatially detailed description of 10Be concentrations with depth in soil profiles and use the deviation from the production curve for in-situ 10Be under site conditions to quantitatively describe the response of the soil profile to landscape scale changes in erosion rate.",

From 2003 to 2009 Siling Co, an endorheic lake in the TP, has seen an areal increase from around 2000km2 to nearly 2220km2 with a lake-level increase of more than 4m. This rapid expansion corresponds to around 9Gt of added water load into the lake and onto the lithosphere. Lake expansion and volume rates in the region have been well documented using various satellite‐derived and in‐situ datasets. However, lithospheric flexure as caused by these increased crustal loads has not been studied in great detail, and ICESat data has not been exploited for this purpose until now. ICESat data was utilized to determine flexure rates along several transects adjacent to an endorheic lake (Siling Co) on the TP. The rates were calculated for each kilometer from the lake boundary and show a clear “bowl-like” trend with flexure rates decreasing as distance increases from the Siling Co lakeshore.",

            "abstract": "Richard Wrangham and others argue that cooked food has been obligate for our ancestors since the time of Homo erectus. This hypothesis provides a particularly compelling explanation for the smaller mouths and teeth, shorter intestines, and larger brains that separate us from other hominins. However, natural ignitions are infrequent and it is unclear how earlier hominins may have adapted to cooked food and fire before they developed the necessary intelligence to make or control fire. To address this conundrum, we present cartographical evidence that the massive and long lasting lava flows in the African Rift could have provided our ancestors with episodic access to heat and fire as the front edges of these flows formed ephemeral pockets of heat and ignition and other geothermal features. For the last several million years major lava flows have been infilling the African Rift. After major eruptions there were likely more slowly advancing lava fronts creating small areas with very specific adaptive pressures and opportunities for small isolated groups of hominins. Some of these episodes of isolation may have extended for millennia allowing these groups of early hominins to develop the adaptations Wrangham links to fire and cooked food. To examine the potential veracity of this proposal, we developed a series of maps that overlay the locations of prominent hominin dig sites with contemporaneous lava flows. These maps indicate that many important developments in hominin evolution were occurring in rough spatial and temporal proximity to active lava flows. These maps indicate it is worth considering that over the last several million years small isolated populations of hominins may have experienced unique adaptive conditions while living near the front edges of these slowly advancing lava flows.",

            "abstract": "Disequilibrium melting has been established as a common process occurring during crustal anatexis and thus demonstrates that crustal assimilation by ascending mantle-derived magmas is likley not a closed system. Observations of extreme compositional heterogeneity within partial melts derived from crustal xenoliths have been documented in several recent examples, however, the retention or transfer of elements to and from residues and glasses, and their relative contributions to potential crustal contaminants warrants further investigation. Sampled lavas from the Huoshaoshan volcano in the Holocene Wudalianchi volcanic field of Northeast China contain crustal xenoliths which preserve a spectrum of partial melting both petrographically and geochemically, thus providing an excellent, natural example of crustal anatexis. Correlations exist between the volume of silicic glass preserved within the xenoliths and bulk rock SiO2 (70-83 wt%), Al2O3 (16-8 wt%), glass 87Sr/86Sr (0.715-0.908), abundances of elements common in feldspars and micas (Sr, Ba, Rb) and elements common in accessory minerals (Y, Zr, Nb). These correlations are likely associated with the consumption of feldspars and micas and the varying retention of accessory phases during partial melting. The xenoliths which contain the greater volumes of silicic glass and residual quartz (interpreted as being the most melted) were found within pahoehoe lava, whilst the least melted xenoliths were found within scoria of the summit cone of Huoshaoshan; thus it is interpreted that the extent of melting is linked to the immersion time in the lava. Small-scale (mm) mingling and transfer of material from the enclosing lava to the xenolith is observed, however, modelling of potential contaminant compositions is inconsistent with crustal contamination during lava petrogenesis. It is inferred that crustal contamination in sampled lavas is localized within the open magmatic system and most likely occurs at the contact zone between the xenolith and host lava. We suggest that it is not only disequilibrium melting that occurs during crustal anatexis, but also ‘disequilibrium extraction’ of anatectic melt(s).",

Are there smaller SSE signals that are currently not recognized geodetically? What is the spatial, temporal and size distribution of SSEs, and how are SSE related to tremor? We address these questions with a catalogue of all detectable SSEs spanning the last 6.5 years using a new methodology based on Vertical Derivatives of Horizontal Stress (VDoHS) rates obtained from cGPS times series.\nVDoHS rates, calculated by solving the force balance equations at the Earth’s surface, represent the most inclusive and spatially compact surface expressions of subsurface deformation sources: VDoHS rate vectors are tightly localized above the sources and point in the direction of push or pull. We compare our results with those from the Network Inversion Filter (NIF) for selected events. We identify and characterize a spectrum of SSEs, including events with moment release at least two orders of magnitudes smaller than has been previously identified with GPS data. We catalogue events timing, interface slip distribution and moment release, and compare our results with existing tremor catalogues.\nVDoHS rates also reveal the boundaries between the locked and unlocked portions of the megathrust, and we can track how this varies throughout the SSE cycle. Above the locked interface, the pull of the subducted plate generates shear tractions in the overlying plate in the direction of subduction, while above the creeping section shear tractions are in the opposite direction, which is reflected in the VDoHS rates. We show that sections of the Cascadia megathrust unlock prior to some SSEs and lock thereafter, with the locked zone propagating downdip and eastward after the SSEs over weeks to months.\nThe catalogue and movies of events will be available at http://www.ig.utexas.edu/people/staff/lada/SSEs.",

A surprising result was that these loss dynamics were coherent with hiss dynamics on a global scale comparable to the size of the plasmasphere. We expand this analysis to the entire BARREL dataset, consisting of three campaigns and more than 40 balloons, by calculating the coherence of electron precipitation signatures (bremsstrahlung X-rays) on all balloon combinations as a function of MLT and L. Preliminary results indicate that large-scale coherence maximizes near noon MLT, suggesting that magnetosphere compressions of solar wind origin are the primary cause of global-scale coherence of electron loss. Coherence also extends out a few hours from noon to both flanks, suggesting that Kelvin-Helmholz waves may also contribute. We will sort these results by solar wind parameters such as IMF clock angle better understand when these ULF waves are able to create a global coherence scale of electron loss in the magnetosphere.",

Various theories have been advanced for this sub-seasonal evolution, but its origins are still poorly understood. We use a new 0.25-degree 1901-2014 daily rainfall dataset from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) to investigate this phenomenon at near-local scale, using more than a century of data. The analysis is based on daily rainfall characteristics, including the spatial coherence of sub-seasonal rainfall anomalies, and on relating these to large-scale moisture variables computed from reanalysis data.\nIndian summer monsoon rainfall is partitioned into three sub-seasonal phases, with a steep ramp-up (June), persistent core (July–August), and a slower decay phase (Sept–Oct). Spatial coherence of sub-seasonal rainfall anomalies is shown to be highest during the onset and decay phases with a marked mark drop during the core phase. Systematic shifts in seasonal timing are found to typify rainfall anomalies during the onset and decay phases, with ENSO preferentially impacting the latter. We identify a large-scale low-level moisture threshold as a necessary condition for local daily rainfall occuring at >5% of spatial locations across monsoonal India. Sub-seasonal rainfall variability during the onset and decay phases is argued to be controlled largely by the crossing of this threshold. However, this necessary condition is generally easily met during the core season, at which time interannual variability in low-level moisture and interannual correlation between rainfall and large-scale ascent both decrease. This decrease in large-scale control and the loss of spatial coherence imply that sub-seasonal to seasonal rainfall variations at local scales during the core of the monsoon are largely a result of local-scale processes, and are thus inherently unpredictable. We conclude that the scope for skillful sub-seasonal to seasonal forecasts of Indian summer monsoon rainfall is likely to be much greater during the onset and decay phases, rather than during the core of the monsoon.",

            "abstract": "Since early 2000, the Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) instrument on NASA’s Terra satellite has been providing operational Level 2 (swath-based) aerosol optical depth (AOD) and particle property retrievals at 17.6 km spatial resolution and atmospherically corrected land surface products at 1.1 km resolution. The performance of the aerosol product has been validated against ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations, model comparisons, and climatological assessments. This product has played a major role in studies of the impacts of aerosols on climate and air quality. The surface product has found a variety of uses, particularly at regional scales for assessing vegetation and land surface change. A major development effort has led to the release of an update to the operational (Version 22) MISR Level 2 aerosol and land surface retrieval products, which has been in production since December 2007. The new release is designated Version 23. The resolution of the aerosol product has been increased to 4.4 km, allowing more detailed characterization of aerosol spatial variability, especially near local sources and in urban areas. The product content has been simplified and updated to include more robust measures of retrieval uncertainty and other fields to benefit users. The land surface product has also been updated to incorporate the Version 23 aerosol product as input and to improve spatial coverage, particularly over mountainous terrain and snow/ice-covered surfaces.\nWe will describe the major upgrades incorporated in Version 23 and present validation of the aerosol product against both the standard AERONET historical database, as well as high spatial density AERONET-DRAGON deployments. Comparisons will also be shown relative to the Version 22 aerosol and land surface products. Applications enabled by these product updates will be discussed.",

Concerns about potential future AMOC changes imply the need for a continuous, large-scale observation capability to detect any such changes on interannual to decadal time scales. Here, we present the first measurements of lower North-Atlantic-Deep-Water (LNADW) monthly transport changes using only space-based time-variable gravity observations from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites, continuously covering the time period from 2003 until now. Improved monthly gravity field retrievals allow the detection of North Atlantic interannual bottom pressure anomalies and yield LNADW transport estimates that are in good agreement with those from the ocean in-situ RAPID-MOCA array at 26.5N. Concurrent with the observed AMOC transport anomalies from late-2009 through early-2010, GRACE measured ocean bottom pressures changes in the 3000-5000 m deep western North Atlantic of -20 mm-H2O, implying a southward volume transport anomaly in that layer of approximately -5.5 Sv. Our results highlight the efficacy of space-gravimetry to observe and detect meridional ocean transport variations that can potentially be retrieved over all latitude ranges in the Atlantic.",

            "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to characterize the stable isotope values of terrestrial, secondary carbonate minerals from five OC meteorites collected in Antarctica. These samples were selected for analysis based upon their size and collection proximity to known Martian meteorites. They were also selected based on petrologic type (3+) such that they were likely to be carbonate-free before falling to Earth. This study has two main tasks: 1) characterize the isotopic composition of terrestrial, secondary carbonate minerals formed on meteorites in Antarctica, and 2) study the mechanisms of carbonate formation in cold and arid environments with Antarctica as an analog for Mars.\n Two samples from each meteorite, each ~0.5g, was crushed and dissolved in pure phosphoric acid for 3 sequential reactions: a) Rx0 for 1 hour at 30°C, b) Rx1 for 18 hours at 30°C, and c) Rx2 for 3 hours at 150°C. CO2 was distilled by freezing with liquid nitrogen from each sample tube, then separated from organics and sulfides with a TRACE GC using a Restek HayeSep Q 80/100 6’ 2mm stainless column, and then analyzed on a Thermo MAT 253 IRMS in Dual Inlet mode. This system was built at NASA/JSC over the past 3 years and proof tested with known carbonate standards to develop procedures, assess yield, and quantify expected uncertainties.\nTwo distinct species of carbonates are found based on the stepped extraction technique: 1) Ca-rich carbonate released at low temperatures, and 2) Mg, or Fe-rich carbonate released at high temperatures. Preliminary results indicate that most of the carbonates present in the ordinary chondrites analyzed have δ13C=+5‰, which is consistent with formation from atmospheric CO2 δ13C=-7‰ at -20°C. The oxygen isotopic compositions of the carbonates vary between +4‰ and +34‰ with the Mg-rich and/or Fe-rich carbonates possessing the lowest δ18O values. This suggests that the carbonates formed under a wide range of temperatures. However, the carbonate oxygen isotope compositions are consistently heavier than what would be expected if the carbonates formed in equilibrium with melted ice in Antarctica.",

Using Tohoku University’s vector supercomputer, we accomplished “10-10-10 challenge”, to complete tsunami source determination in 10 minutes, tsunami inundation modeling in 10 minutes with 10 m grid resolution. Given the maximum flow depth distribution, we perform quantitative estimation of exposed population using census data and mobile phone data, and the numbers of potential death and damaged structures by applying tsunami fragility curve.\nAfter the potential tsunami-affected areas are estimated, the analysis gets focused and moves on to the “detection” phase using remote sensing. Recent advances of remote sensing technologies expand capabilities of detecting spatial extent of tsunami affected area and structural damage. Especially, a semi-automated method to estimate building damage in tsunami affected areas is developed using pre- and post-event high-resolution SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data.\nThe method is verified through the case studies in the 2011 Tohoku and other potential tsunami scenarios, and the prototype system development is now underway in Kochi prefecture, one of at-risk coastal city against Nankai trough earthquake. In the trial operation, we verify the capability of the method as a new tsunami early warning and response system for stakeholders and responders.",

Water shortages are common during the dry season, and water conflicts emerge between domestic water users, intensively irrigated agriculture, the tourism industry, and ecological flows. Climate change may further increase the variability of precipitation and the risk for droughts, and pose challenges for small rural agricultural communities experiencing water stress. To adapt to seasonal droughts and improve resilience of communities to future changes, it is essential to increase understanding of interactions between components of the coupled hydrological-social system. Yet, hydrological monitoring and data on water use within developing countries of the humid tropics is limited. To address these challenges and contribute to extended monitoring networks, low-cost and open-source monitoring platforms were developed based off Arduino microelectronic boards and software and combined with hydrological sensors to monitor river stage and groundwater levels in two watersheds of Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Hydrologic monitoring stations are located in remote locations and powered by solar panels. Monitoring efforts were made possible through collaboration with local rural communities, and complemented with a mix of digitized water extraction data and community water use narratives to increase understanding of water use and challenges. We will present the development of the Arduino logging system, results of water supply in relation to water use for both the wet and dry season, and discuss these results within a socio-hydrological system context.",

The experiments were prepared, synthesized, deformed and analysed at the Bayerisches Geoinstitut (University of Bayreuth,Germany). The sample consisted of hot-pressed powders composed of an olivine-orthopyroxene mix (87.5-12.5, 75-25 and 50-50 %) that were then placed in a simple-shear geometry assembly and deformed in a multi-anvil press employing 6 independently acting hydraulic rams at a constant strain-rate of 10-4 s-1 and 3 GPa-1300°C, 5 GPa-1400°C and 8 GPa-1500°C. The achieved shear strain ranged between 1 and 2. The sample were then analysed under SEM-EBSD. At 3 GPa, the observed CPO are similar to those predicted in previous studies, while the one developed at 5 and 8 GPa varies according to the orthopyroxene content: 1) Experiments with 12.5% orthopyroxene display annealing textures and random CPO; 2) the ones with 25% orthopyroxene display B-type olivine CPO consistent with high pressure dislocation creep deformation experiments; and 3) the experiments with 50% orthopyroxenes display A-type olivine CPO consistent with olivine-pyroxene aggregates deformed at high temperature in diffusion creep regime. The resulting seismic properties could therefore explain the seismic anisotropy observations in the mid and lower part of the Earth’s upper mantle in different geodynamic contexts. For example, the mantle wedge above subduction which has pyroxene content corresponding to our 25% orthopyroxene experiments and often display the olivine fast-axis normal to the expected mantle flow. On the other hand, a more pristine intraplate mantle most often predict olivine fast-axis parallel to the mantle flow and would have an olivine-pyroxene ratio close to our experiment with 50% orthopyroxene.",

            "abstract": "The disastrous 1985 Michoacan earthquake gave rise to a seismic alert system for Mexico City which became operational in 1991. Initially limited to earthquakes along the Guerrero coast, the system now has a much wider coverage. Also, the 2004 Sumatra earthquake exposed the need for a tsunami early warning along the Mexican subduction zone. A fast identification of near-trench earthquakes along this zone may be useful in issuing a reliable early tsunami alert. The confusion caused by low PGA for the magnitude of an earthquake, leading to “missed” seismic alert, would be averted if its near-trench origin can be quickly established. It may also help reveal the spatial extent and degree of seismic coupling on the near-trench portion of the plate interface. This would lead to a better understanding of tsunami potential and seismic hazard along the Mexican subduction zone.\nWe explore three methods for quick detection of near-trench earthquakes, testing them on recordings of 65 earthquakes at station CU in Mexico City (4.8 ≤Mw≤8.0; 270≤R≤615 km). The first method is based on the ratio of total to high-frequency energy, ER (Shapiro et al., 1998). The second method is based on parameter Sa*(6) which is the pseudo-acceleration response spectrum with 5% damping, Sa, at 6 s normalized by the PGA. The third parameter is the PGA residual, RESN, at CU, with respect to a newly-derived ground motion prediction equation at CU for coastal shallow-dipping thrust earthquakes following a bayesian approach. Since the near-trench earthquakes are relatively deficient in high-frequency radiation, we expect ER and Sa*(6) to be relatively large and RESN to be negative for such events. Tests on CU recordings show that if ER ≥ 100 and/or Sa*(6) ≥ 0.70, then the earthquake is near trench; for these events RESN ≤ 0. Such an event has greater tsunami potential. Few misidentifications and missed events are most probably a consequence of poor location, although unusual depth and source characteristics may also be responsible in some cases. We propose routine computation of these parameters (along with location and magnitude) by the National Seismological Service of Mexico and dissemination of the information to other interested agencies which are in charge of tsunami alert, seismic alert, and near real time ground motion intensity maps for Mexico City.",

            "abstract": "Volumetric water content (VWC) in soils is critical for forecasting thresholds for runoff-driven erosion caused by rainfall. Even though theoretical relations (e.g., Richards equation) have been developed to quantify VWC in unsaturated granular soils, site-specific field conditions and hysteresis of suction and VWC in soil preclude their direct use. Although attempts have previously been made to forecast VWC using various time-series models (e.g., autoregressive integrated moving average or ARIMA), these approaches lack hydrologic foundations and perform poorly when used to forecast VWC over time periods longer than 24 hours.\nIn this work, we extend an existing Antecedent Water Index (AWI) based model to express VWC as a function of time and rainfall. AWI models typically overfit data and cannot be used for forecast VWC over long time periods. We developed a new model to overcome this limitation, which accumulates rainfall over a time window and fits a diverse range of wetting and drying curves. Hydraulic redistribution parameters in this model bear resemblance to hydrologic processes driven by gravity and suction. This model reasonably forecasts VWC using only initial VWC values and rainfall forecasts.\nExperimental VWC data were collected from steep gradient post-wildfire sites in southern California. Rapid landscape change was observed in response to small to moderate rain storms. We formulated a mean-squared error minimization problem over the model parameters and optimized using genetic algorithms. We found that our model fits VWC data for 3 distinct soil textures, each occurring at 3 different depths below the ground surface (5 cm, 15 cm, and 30 cm). Our model successfully forecasts VWC trends, such as drying and wetting rate. To a certain extent, our model achieves spatial and seasonal generalizability. Our accumulative rainfall model is also applicable to continuous predictions, where VWC values are repeatedly used to predict future ones within a 12-hr time frame.",

            "abstract": "The Western Anatolia-Aegean back-arc is dominated by lithospheric scale extensional tectonics since the Late Oligocene. Namely, the extension has been attributed to the bimodal (Calc-alkaline – Alkaline) volcanism, metamorphic massif exhumations and the development of normal fault controlled Büyük Menderes, Küçük Menderes and Gediz grabens. While southwestward younging calc-alkaline arc volcanism may be related to the migration of the retreating Aegean subduction since the Oligocene, the presence of alkaline magmatism since the Early-Middle Miocene, - derived from asthenospheric mantle- has been interpreted in the context of the lithospheric thinning/removal beneath the region. Seismic tomography images show low S wave velocities (3.6-3.9 km/s) under the Aegean and Western Anatolia where lithosphere has been anomalously thinned or partially removed. In this work, we use thermo-mechanical numerical experiments to test the surface impacts of large-scale back-arc extension in the subduction retreat geodynamic configuration. By conducting a series sets of experiments with different material rheologies, plate convergence velocities, slab angles and lithospheric thicknesses we evaluate the controlling factors for the back-arc extension/subsidence. The first set of experiments is represented by 100 km thick ocean slab retreat, 40 km thick crust, 110 km thick mantle lithosphere and the imposed convergence velocity is 1cm/year. Models in this design show that retreating ocean slab may cause 2.5 km of back-arc subsidence in 13.5 Myrs while trench migrates 200 km. When the convergence velocity increases to 2 cm/year, the amount of trench retreat decreases to 150 km with 2.4 km subsidence. Models with 3 cm/year convergence velocity predict max. slab retreat of 140 km and the subsidence is lessened to 2.1 km. When lithosphere is thinned to 90 km (40 km crust, 50 km mantle lithosphere) the amount of retreat increases to 225 km with more max. surface subsidence, 3 km. Models with slab detachment of the subducting slab is associated with 280 km slab retreat and 2.5 km of subsidence. Our preliminary results suggest that the amount of trench retreat of 400 km may be predicted by the models with thinner lithosphere and/or break-off of the subducting slab.",

            "abstract": "Sedimentary rocks in the San Rafael Swell, Utah, were deformed by Laramide compression and subsequent Neogene extension. We evaluate the effect of fault damage zone morphology as a function of structural position, and changes in mechanical stratigraphy on the distribution of secondary minerals across the reservoir-seal pair of the Navajo Sandstone and overlying Carmel Formation. We decipher paleo-fluid migration and examine the effect faults and fractures have on reservoir permeability and efficacy of top seal for a range of geo-engineering applications.\nMap-scale faults have an increased probability of allowing upward migration of fluids along the fault plane and within the damage zone, potentially bypassing the top seal. Field mapping, mesoscopic structural analyses, petrography, and geochemical observations demonstrate that fault zone thickness increases at structural intersections, fault relay zones, fault-related folds, and fault tips. Higher densities of faults with meters of slip and dense fracture populations are present in relay zones relative to single, discrete faults.\nCurvature analysis of the San Rafael monocline and fracture density data show that fracture density is highest where curvature is highest in the syncline hinge and near faults. Fractures cross the reservoir-seal interface where fracture density is highest and structural diagensis includes mineralization events and bleaching and calcite and gypsum mineralization. The link between fracture distributions and structural setting implys that transmissive fractures have predictable orientations and density distributions.\nAt the m- to cm- scale, deformation-band faults and joints in the Navajo Sandstone penetrate the reservoir-seal interface and transition into open-mode fractures in the caprock seal. Scanline analysis and petrography of veins provide evidence for subsurface mineralization and fracture reactivation, suggesting that the fractures act as loci for fluid flow through time. Heterolithic caprock seals with variable fracture distributions and morphology highlight the strong link between the variation in material properties and the response to changing stress conditions. The variable connectivity of fractures and the changes in fracture density plays a critical role in subsurface fluid flow.",

            "abstract": "Reproducibility is a cornerstone of the scientific method. Within geophysical modeling and simulation achieving reproducibility can be difficult, especially given the complexity of numerical codes, enormous and disparate data sets, and variety of supercomputing technology. We have made progress on this problem in the context of a large project - the development of new ocean and sea ice models, MOM6 and SIS2. Here we present useful techniques and experience.\nWe use version control not only for code but the entire experiment working directory, including configuration (run-time parameters, component versions), input data and checksums on experiment output. This allows us to document when the solutions to experiments change, whether due to code updates or changes in input data. To avoid distributing large input datasets we provide the tools for generating these from the sources, rather than provide raw input data.\nBugs can be a source of non-determinism and hence irreproducibility, e.g. reading from or branching on uninitialized memory. To expose these we routinely run system tests, using a memory debugger, multiple compilers and different machines. Additional confidence in the code comes from specialised tests, for example automated dimensional analysis and domain transformations. This has entailed adopting a code style where we deliberately restrict what a compiler can do when re-arranging mathematical expressions.\nIn the spirit of open science, all development is in the public domain. This leads to a positive feedback, where increased transparency and reproducibility makes using the model easier for external collaborators, who in turn provide valuable contributions. To facilitate users installing and running the model we provide (version controlled) digital notebooks that illustrate and record analysis of output. This has the dual role of providing a gross, platform-independent, testing capability and a means to documents model output and analysis.",

            "abstract": "Fluxes of CO2 from soils are important to understand in order to predict subsurface feedbacks to the atmosphere and responses to climate change. Such fluxes are commonly monitored at the soil surface and generally assumed to largely originate within shallow depths. Relatively little is understood on the depth distribution of CO2 production below the rhizosphere. We monitored CO2 fluxes at the soil surface, and measured vertical profiles of vadose CO2 concentrations, matric potentials, and temperatures at the Rifle Site, a saline semi-arid floodplain along the Colorado River in order to determine the significance of deeper vadose zone respiration. Vadose zone CO2 profiles exhibit temperature-dependent seasonal variations, and are consistent with CO2 fluxes measured at the soil surface. The measured vadose zone CO2 concentration profiles combined with gas diffusion coefficients estimated from soil properties indicated that local maxima in rates of CO2 production persist in the deeper vadose zone, about 1 m below the rhizosphere, and above the water table (~3.5 m below the soil surface). We hypothesized that water and oxygen activities, nutrient levels, and temperatures remain favorable for microbial respiration throughout the year in the subrhizosphere, unlike overlying drier soils and the underlying poorly aerated aquifer. Using soils and sediments from the field site, the hypothesized existence of deeper subsurface maxima in CO2 production rate is currently being tested in the laboratory through sediment incubation experiments and in 2.0 m tall vadose zone columns. Initial results from the laboratory support the hypothesized persistence of a subrhizosphere “hot zone” for microbial respiration, partly sustained through seasonal pulses of dissolved and labile organic carbon originating from the rhizosphere. These findings suggest that similar sustained deeper local maxima in respiration rates may occur in many other regions where near-surface conditions are seasonally unfavorable for microbial activity.",

We examined ecosystem (E) and intrinsic (i) WUEs derived from eddy covariance (EC) measurements and plant carbon isotope discrimination, respectively, to study how WUE is affected by land-use history, ecosystem type, and plants community composition. We measured EWUE and iWUE of three perennial grasslands planted to mixed-prairie, switchgrass and brome grass as compared to a fields planted to corn. Each of studied ecosystems was replicated on two fields with contrasting land-use histories: one field was managed under the USDA Conservation Reserve Program (CRP, planted to bromgrass) and another was in conventional agriculture (AGR) corn/soybean rotation for few decades before start of the experiment. In 2009, all but one CRP field were converted to no-till soybean. In 2010, the converted CRP and AGR fields were planted to mixed-prairie (C3 and C4 grasses), switchgrass (C4 grass), and no-till corn (C4 grass). During 2009-2013, we measured carbon and water exchange over each field using an EC technique and sampled plant tissue for 13C isotopes analysis. Land-use history, ecosystem type, and species composition had large effects on EWUEs. Intrinsic WUE of individual C3 grass species, however, was similar across the study period, despite drought in 2012. Corn and brome grass had the highest and lowest overall mean EWUE, 4.1 and 2.2 g C kg-1 H2O, respectively. Restored prairie on former AGR land had a mean EWUE of 3.0 g C kg-1 H2O, significantly greater than on former CRP land with a EWUE of 2.5 g C kg-1 H2O. Land use history had no effect on interannual variability of EWUE of corn. Prairie and switchgrass established on former CRP land exhibited no change of EWUE, as well. Same ecosystems established on former AGR land, oppositely, increased their WUEs over the study period from ~ 2.5 g C kg-1 H2O in 2010 to ~3.7 in 2013. Shift in plant dominants from C3 to C4 grasses and C3 to C4 plants ratio, despite identical species composition at planting within all ecosystems explained ~40% of the observed EWUE change.",

            "abstract": "The interior of western Canada has experienced rapid and severe hydro-climatic change in recent decades. This is projected to continue in future. Since 1950, mean annual air temperature has increased by 2 °C (4 °C increase in winter daily means) with associated changes in cryospheric regime. Changes in precipitation have varied regionally; in the Prairies there has been a decrease in winter precipitation, shift from snowfall to rainfall, and increased clustering of summer rainfall events into multiple day storms. Regionally, river discharge indicates an earlier spring freshet and increased incidence of rain-on-snow peak flow events, but otherwise mixed responses due to multiple process interactions. In winter/spring 2015, persistent anomalous ridging conditions developed over western North America causing widespread drought. This produced abnormally warm and dry conditions over the Rocky Mountain headwaters of the Mackenzie and Saskatchewan Rivers, resulting in low spring snowpacks that melted earlier than normal and were followed by an atypical lack of spring rainfall. By summer 2015, most of western Canada was subject to extreme drought conditions leading to record dry soil moisture conditions in parts of the Prairies during a key crop growth time, streamflows that were greatly diminished, and extensive wildfires across the Boreal Forest. The importance of the warmer winter to this drought and the contextual trend for increasing winter warmth provide new insight into the impact of climate warming on droughts in cold regions. This talk will discuss efforts by the Changing Cold Regions Network (CCRN;\nwww.ccrnetwork.ca\n) to understand and diagnose the 2015 drought, its potential linkages with the concurrent California drought and other continental events, and its relevance in the context of historical and predicted future climate change.",

            "abstract": "Lakes in the Swiss central plateau experienced increasing anthropogenic phosphorous loading throughout much of the 20th century. Since the 1980s concerted remediation efforts on the part of the Swiss government have significantly reduced P concentrations in most lakes and reversed previous eutrophication. However, P concentrations remain elevated above their preindustrial levels in many sites. High quality monitoring of lake nutrient levels since the 1950s, along with several lakes of wide-ranging P concentrations in close proximity, make central Switzerland an ideal location for studying the ways in which nutrient loading affects the organic composition of lacustrine sediments. Results of such studies can be used to develop proxies of eutrophication in sites where fewer historical data exist, and to reconstruct historical P concentrations in local lakes from the time before record keeping began.\nWe analyzed the distributions of algal lipid biomarkers from surface sediment and sediment traps collected in the spring of 2015 from ten lakes with variable P concentrations in central Switzerland. Sedimentary lipid distributions from these lakes confirm that biomarkers associated with algal and cyanobacterial sources are more abundant in the sediment of lakes with greater P loading. The dry sedimentary concentrations of biomarkers such as brassicasterol (primarily diatom source) and diplopterol (cyanobacteria source), as well as the less source specific short-chain n-alkanols, linearly increase from 0.3 – 1.9 μg/g as total phosphorous in the upper water column increases by 1 μg/L over a range of 7 – 50 μg/L. We also present preliminary hydrogen isotope data from these biomarkers. Hydrogen isotopes of algal lipids primarily reflect the source water in which the algae grew, and this relationship has been developed as a paleohydrologic proxy. However, laboratory cultures of marine algae demonstrate that they discriminate more against 2H under nutrient replete conditions. We present the first field assessment of how nutrient availability influences 2H fractionation in freshwater algae, and demonstrate how such measurements can be used to infer past information about anthropogenic nutrient loading.",

            "abstract": "For the first forty years of Earth observation satellite imagery, all imagery was collected by civilian or military governmental satellites. Over this timeframe, countries without observation satellite capabilities had very limited access to Earth observation data or imagery. In response to the limited access to Earth observation systems, capacity building efforts were focused on satellite manufacturing. Wood and Weigel (2012) describe the evolution of satellite programs in developing countries with a technology ladder. A country moves up the ladder as they move from producing satellites with training services to building satellites locally. While the ladder model may be appropriate if the goal is to develop autonomous satellite manufacturing capability, in the realm of Earth observation, the goal is generally to derive societal benefit from the use of Earth observation-derived information. In this case, the model for developing Earth observation capacity is more appropriately described by a hub-and-spoke model in which the use of Earth observation imagery is the “hub,” and the “spokes” describe the various paths to achieving that imagery: the building of a satellite (either independently or with assistance), the purchase of a satellite, participation in a constellation of satellites, and the use of freely available or purchased satellite imagery. We discuss the different capacity-building activities that are conducted in each of these pathways, such as the “Know-How Transfer and Training” program developed by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. , Earth observation imagery training courses run by SERVIR in developing countries, and the use of national or regional remote sensing centers (such as those in Morocco, Malaysia, and Kenya) to disseminate imagery and training. In addition, we explore the factors that determine through which “spoke” a country arrives at the ability to use Earth observation imagery, and discuss best practices for achieving the capability to use imagery.",

            "abstract": "Carbon dioxide injection into deep saline aquifers is governed by a number of physicochemical processes at a broad range of spatial scales including mineral dissolution and precipitation, fluid flow, and capillary trapping. Past efforts have mostly focused on measuring the multiphase flow properties, capillarity, relative permeability, and residual trapping. However, the impact of fluid-rock interaction on these properties is less well understood. In this work we have made a series of measurements characterizing the impact of rock mineral dissolution on multiphase flow in three carbonate rocks.\nWe used core flooding techniques to mimic reactive conditions representative of the near the well bore and far field regions of a carbonate reservoir CO2 injection project. Tests sequentially induced mineral dissolution and characterized the impacts on multiphase flow properties. Temperature retarded acid was used to uniformly dissolve calcite in Ketton, Estaillades, and Edward Brown rock cores. A single dissolution stages removed approximately 0.5% of the mass of the rocks and measurements of relative permeability and residual trapping were made after each stage along with mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) to quantify the variation of in the pore size distribution. Three Stages were performed on each of carbonates rocks. Imaging with x-ray micro-CT and medical CT were used to quantify the porosity variation and observe the changes in pore structure and multiphase flow properties at scales from the um to the cm.\nThe pore size distribution of the rocks was observed to both increase and become less uniform with progressive dissolution, as shown in Figure 1. For Ketton, the micro-pores, with size range from 0.01 um to 0.1um, have less been involved in the reaction than the macro-pores (10 um to 100 um). A larger spread in capillary trapping was seen around a characteristic initial-residual curve. Relative permeability changes with progressive dissolution was not well described by correlations to changes in porosity alone (increasing from 0.2187 to 0.2303).",

In this study, we determine 3-D variations of P- and S-wave speed and Possion's ratio (Vp/Vs) perturbations of the southern Alaska subduction zone based on broadband tele-seismic data recorded by 198 seismic stations for about 2000 events with magnitudes greater than 5.5 during the period from June 2000 to December 2014. Relative arrival times of P and S phases bwtween stations are accurately measured by adapting the efficient multi-channel cross-correlation (MCCC) technique. The obtained arrival-time data are then used to tomographically image the Vp and Vs structures beneath the stations based on 3-D finite-frequency sensitivity kernels and a wavelet-based multi-scale model parameterization. Our results show strong positive velocity anomalies in the crust and upper mantle starting at a depth of about 50km and extending to northwestward down to a depth of 200 km and covering about 350 km in horizontal distance. The high velocity feature interpreted as a cold slab has a thickness of about 50km and a subducting angle of about 45o, consistent with some previous studies of southern Alaska. We also plan to further obtain high-resolution seismic imaging of southern Alaska subduction zone by utilizing the converted and coda waves of tele-seismic main phases (e.g., P and S) based on a hybrid tomographic technique combining spectral-element method (SEM) and frequency-wavenumber (FK) method. The 3D Vp and Vs models obtained from finite-frequency traveltime tomography thus can serve as a proper starting velocity model for the hybrid SEM-FK imaging to further reveal high-resolution details of the subduction zone.",

            "abstract": "We present a model of seismic velocity anomalies for the entire continental United States—coast to coast, surface to lower mantle—using a joint body wave-surface wave inversion. This technique (Zhang et al., 2014), performed on a global adaptively-spaced grid, exploits the good vertical resolution at shallow depths of surface wave data, and the sampling of the deep mantle by teleseismic body (P and S) waves. The resultant model has better resolution at all depths than either method alone, enabling evaluation of interactions between lithospheric and mantle processes. We utilize the depth-dependence of surface wave sensitivity kernels to express surface wave phase velocity data directly in terms of spatial velocity structure (Fang et al., 2015). The data used are Rayleigh wave phase velocities from earthquakes and ambient noise (Schaeffer and Lebedev, 2013; Ekström, 2014) and S phase travel times from USArray, measured at the Array National Facility (ANF). We include a suite of synthetic tests to verify the performance of the inversion and compare it to results from traditional tomographic methods. We also use P arrivals and the influence of Vp on Rayleigh wave propagation speed to generate a preliminary model of Vp variations, independent from but consistent with the Vs model.\nOur model corroborates the well-established pattern of slow anomalies in the western US, especially in the Basin and Range and Rio Grande Rift regions. New details emerge in the eastern US, thanks to increasing data from the region. A distinction is observed between widespread fast lithospheric anomalies, associated with stable cratonic material, and deeper fast features, associated with the remnants of the Farallon Plate. It has been proposed that these fragments, near the mantle transition zones, still affect mantle dynamics (Forte et al., 2007), so better resolution of these anomalies is an important advancement. In addition, slower velocities are observed beneath the Appalachians and the Mississippi Embayment, further supporting the hypothesis that the mantle beneath the eastern US is more active and heterogeneous than previously thought.",

            "abstract": "Recent focus on carbon emission from cement industry inspired researchers to improve CSH properties by reducing Ca/Si ratio at the nanoscale, and lower porosity (permeability) of hydrated cement at micro scale. If implemented in wellbore cement technology, both of these efforts could provide advanced properties for wellbore infrastructure. These advancements would further reduce the issue of leaky wellbores in fluid injections, hydraulic fracturing and subsurface storage for existing operating wells. Numerous inadequately abandoned wells, however, pose more complex engineering problems, primarily due to the difficulty in locating fluid flow pathways along the wellbore structure. In order to appreciate the difficulty of this problem, we need to remind ourselves that:\na typical 30,000-ft. wellbore with an average production casing of 8 inches in diameter can be presented in scale by a 6-m long human hair of 150 μm\nthese structures are placed in the subsurface, often not just vertical in geometry but deviated close to 90° tangent where monitoring and remediation becomes demanding\nand if we consider that wellbore cement is not continuously placed along the wellbore and it is approximately 1/10 of a wellbore diameter, we can see that the properties of these materials demand application of nano-science and a different scale phenomena than perhaps previously acknowledged.\nThe key concept behind Ca/Si reduction associated with improved mechanical properties is traditionally achieved chemically, by addition of supplemental cementitious materials. In our study we have tried to evaluate CSH alterations due to mechanically induced phase transformation. The data suggest that confined compression-extrusion of hydrated wellbore cement and the consequent propagation of pore water can change cement composition by dissolving and removing Ca, therefore reducing Ca/Si of cement phases. The advantage of this approach is that the process is less impacted by pressure/temperature oscillations found in subsurface conditions. In addition, we have proved experimentally, that even cement samples stored in corrosive environment for two years can successfully be treated and healed by confined compression of tubular expansion for purpose of microannular gas flow remediation.",

Electric resistivity tomography shows layers of resistances which we relate to the vadose zone (above 1200 Ohm.m), the saturated zone (approx. 300 Ohm.m), and underlying aquitard (above 1200 Ohm.m, made of glacial till). The resistivity sections fail to capture the topography of the sand-till boundary seen in collected radargrams (e.g., from 80 to 120 ns over a 30 m horizontal distance). Converting radar travel times to thickness of the aquifer requires knowledge of water table depth as well as radar velocity in both the saturated and unsaturated sands. Water table depth can be taken from resistivity pseudosections as well as local piezometers. Radar velocities can be estimated based on the properties of the local sand and assuming 100% saturation.

            "abstract": "The goal of the present work was to consider the functionality and applicability of HEC-RAS sediment transport simulations in two situations. The first was as a mode for obtaining quick estimates of the effective discharge, one measure of channel-forming discharge, and the second was as a mode to quickly estimate sediment transport and the commensurate potential erosion and deposition during large flood events. Though there are many other sediment transport and morphodynamic models available, e.g., CCHE1D, Nays2DH, we were interested in using HEC-RAS since this is the model of choice for many regulatory bodies, e.g., FEMA, cities, and counties. This makes using the sediment transport capability of HEC-RAS a natural extension of models that already otherwise exist and are well calibrated. In first looking at the utility of these models, we wanted to estimate the effective discharge of streams. Effective discharge is one way of defining the channel-forming discharge for a stream and is therefore an important parameter in natural channel design and restoration efforts. By running this range of floods, one can easily obtain an estimate for recurrence interval most responsible for moving the majority of sediment over a long time period. Results were compared to data collected within our research group on the Brazos River (TX). Effective discharge is an important estimate, particularly in understanding the equilibrium channel condition. Nevertheless, large floods are contemporaneously catastrophic and understanding their potential effects is desirable. Finally, we performed some sensitivity analysis to better understand the underlying assumptions of the various sediment transport model options and how they might affect the outcome of the aforementioned computations.",

Linking soil organic carbon (SOC) with aboveground vegetation biomass may provide a method to better understand SOC distribution in semiarid ecosystems. The Reynolds Creek Critical Zone Observatory (RC CZO) in Idaho, USA, is approximately 240 square kilometers and is situated in the semiarid Great Basin of the sagebrush-steppe ecosystem. Full waveform airborne lidar data and Next-Generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS-ng) collected in 2014 across the RC CZO are used to map vegetation biomass and SOC and then explore the relationships between them. Vegetation biomass is estimated by identifying vegetation species, and quantifying distribution and structure with lidar and integrating the field-measured biomass. Spectral data from AVIRIS-ng are used to differentiate non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) and soil, which are commonly confused in semiarid ecosystems. The information from lidar and AVIRIS-ng are then used to predict SOC by partial least squares regression (PLSR). An uncertainty analysis is provided, demonstrating the applicability of these approaches to improving our understanding of the distribution and patterns of SOC across the landscape.",

            "abstract": "In 2000 the density of GPS receivers across the continental United States increased to the point that strictly data-driven regional maps of total electron content (TEC) could be constructed. These data-driven maps allowed the TEC to be monitored throughout the course of geomagnetic storms and to observe the progression of traveling ionospheric disturbances. This allowed studies of the development of storm enhanced density plumes in both hemispheres and of the dynamic changes in the equatorial TEC following stratospheric warming events. Currently, GPS TEC maps have become recognized as one of the premier tools to monitor coupling of atmospheric regions from both below and above the ionosphere. The number of available scientific dual-frequency receivers across the globe now exceeds 3000. However this number is anticipated to increase rapidly in part due to the numerous arrays being fielded for commercial applications such as precision farming and highway surveying. In addition, there will be a rapid increase in the number of GNSS signals available in the near future. Besides GPS, the European Union is building a system named GALILEO, which will consist of a 30-satellite constellation. The Russians have a system based on a 24-satellite constellation named GLONASS. The Chinese are developing a system called Beidou, which means “stars of the Big Dipper”. The Beidou system will consist of 35 satellites. By 2023, there will be more than 160 GNSS satellites and 400 signals. Multi-constellation, multi-band GNSS will be a major enabler for space weather studies. This talk will focus on the potential of using the multiple new GNSS signals and the new higher density receiver arrays for measurements of plasma drift, detailed studies of traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDS) and expanded studies of atmospheric coupling. We will conclude by describing the tremendous potential of merging GNSS observations with observations collected by arrays of low-cost, low-power, and small form factor ionosondes. In the future, we predict that new ionosonde and GNSS receiver networks will enable unprecedented mesoscale real-time tomographic observations of the ionosphere.",

            "abstract": "Cohesive sediment in the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta affects pelagic fish habitat, contaminant transport, and marsh accretion. Observations of suspended-sediment concentration in the delta indicate that about 0.05 to 0.20 kg/m2 are eroded from the bed during a tidal cycle. If erosion is horizontally uniform, the erosion depth is about 30 to 150 microns, the typical range in diameter of suspended flocs. Application of an erosion microcosm produces similarly small erosion depths. In addition, core erodibility in the microcosm calculated with a horizontally homogeneous model increases with depth, contrary to expectations for a consolidating bed, possibly because the eroding surface area increases as applied shear stress increases. Thus, field observations and microcosm experiments, combined with visual observation of horizontally varying biota and texture at the surface of sediment cores, indicate that a conceptual model of erosion that includes horizontally varying properties may be more appropriate than assuming horizontally homogeneous erosive properties.\nTo test this hypothesis, we collected five cores and measured the horizontal variability of shear strength within each core in the top 5.08 cm with a shear vane. Small tubes built by a freshwater worm and macroalgae were observed on the surface of all cores. The shear vane was inserted into the sediment until the top of the vane was at the top of the sediment, torque was applied to the vane until the sediment failed and the vane rotated, and the corresponding dial reading in Nm was recorded. The dial reading was assumed to be proportional to the surface strength. The horizontal standard deviation of the critical shear stress was about 30% of the mean. Results of the shear vane test provide empirical evidence that surface strength of the bed varies horizontally. A numerical simulation of erosion with an areally heterogeneous bed reproduced erosion characteristics observed in the microcosm.",

            "abstract": "Himalayan mountain ranges are tectonically and seismically very active and experience many disastrous events with time due to slope failure. Frequent failures of rock cut slopes cause obstruction in traffic and often lead to fatalities. In recent years, the number of tragedies has increased when associated with regional phenomena such at the Kedarnath tragedy of 2013 and the Gorkha earthquake of 2015. The influence of such phenomena on the stability of slopes along important national highways and key settlement areas only raise the risk to lives and property. We conducted a multi-approach investigation for some key slopes along the National Highway 58 in Uttarakhand Himalaya, India. A very detailed field work was conducted to identify the unstable slopes and those with some history of failure. The pertinent geomechanical characteristics of the representative rock samples were determined in the laboratory. Based on the structural data, kinematic analysis was carried out. Finally the slopes were simulated using FDM based simulator, Flac/Slope for analysing the health of the slopes and Rockfall 4.0 to investigate the phenomenon of rockfall along the Highway. It was found that few slopes were weak due to the inherent weak rock materials while few slopes made up of high strength rocks were effectively weak due to prone-to-failure orientation of the joints. Quantification of bounce-height of rock blocks during fall, their energy, velocity and displacement along the slope was also done. Using 3-D simulations, few critically-stable slopes that appear to be stable, were identified. Little ground movement could be capable of triggering a large scale failure in the area. Slopes in the studied region are under threat to failure and need immediate proper planning using the suggested remedial measures.",

            "abstract": "Central Asia holds the distinction of being located further from an oceanic source than any continental environment world-wide. As such, the small amount of precipitation that does fall in this region must travel a long, often complex path from its original oceanic source. This journey likely involves multiple episodes of moisture recycling where surface water evaporates and falls again as precipitation further downwind. A thorough understanding of modern atmospheric circulation in the region and the ultimate source of meteoric water is fundamental to water resource management and our understanding of atmospheric circulation under a changing climate.\nWithin the isotope community, it has been argued that the initial oceanic source of moisture throughout the Tarim Basin and the northern Tibetan Plateau is Atlantic or Mediterranean water, transported across Central Asia via westerlies. This interpretation is based on seasonal patterns of stable isotope variations in meteoric water (δ18O and δD) correlated with temperature (Araguas-Araguas et al., 1998 and others) and modeling of atmospheric circulation using re-analysis data.\nHere, we revisit stable isotope and climate modeling data in addition to spatio-temporal climate patterns to present an alternative interpretation of moisture source for precipitation across the northern Tibetan Plateau and Tarim Basin. Specifically, we argue that the Pamir and Tian Shan mountains are the threshold between westerly-derived and southerly (monsoon) derived precipitation, pushing the boundary much further north than previous interpretations. This alternative interpretation is based on seasonal patterns of precipitation, modeling of atmospheric circulation, and modern water isoscapes throughout Asia.",

            "abstract": "Middle-skilled workers are those whose jobs require considerable skill but not an advanced degree. Nationwide, one-third of the projected job growth for 2010-2020 will require middle-skilled workers. The educational paths to these jobs include career and technical education (CTE), certificates and associate’s degrees from community colleges, apprenticeship programs, and training provided by employers.\n In the oil industry, the demand is expected to about 150,000 jobs. In environmental restoration and monitoring, there will be a need for at least 15,000 middle-skilled workers. Examples of the types of jobs include geological and petroleum technicians, derrick and drill operators, and pump system and refinery operators for the oil and gas sector. For the environmental restoration and monitoring sector, the types of jobs include environmental science technicians, and forest (and coastal) conservation technicians and workers.\nHowever, all of these numbers will be influenced by the growth and contraction of the regional or national economy that is not uncommon in the private sector. Over the past year, for example, the oil and gas industry has shed approximately 75,000 jobs (out of a workforce of 600,000) here in the United States, due almost exclusively to the drop of oil prices globally. A disproportionate number of the lost jobs were among the middle-skilled workforce. Meanwhile, the recent settlements stemming from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill are expected to create a surge of environmental restoration activity in the Gulf of Mexico region that has the potential to create thousands of new jobs over the next decade and beyond. Consequently, there is a need to develop education, training and apprenticeship programs that will help develop flexibility and complementary skill sets among middle-skilled workers that could help reduce the impacts of economic downturns and meet the needs of newly expanding sectors such as the environmental restoration field. This presentation will discuss the programs, activities, and frameworks needed to build this capacity in the middle-skilled workforce over the coming years.",

            "abstract": "EARA2014 –a 3-D radially anisotropic model of the crust and mantle beneath East Asia down to 900 km depth– is developed by adjoint tomography based on a spectral element method. The data set used for the inversion comprises 1.7 million frequency-dependent traveltime measurements from waveforms of 227 earthquakes recorded by 1869 stations. After 20 iterations, the new model (named EARA2014) exhibits sharp and detailed wave speed anomalies with improved correlations with surface tectonic units compared to previous models. As part of tectonic interpretations of EARA2014, we investigated the seismic wavespeed anomalies beneath two prominent uplifted regions in East Asia: (1) Hangai Dome, an intra-continental low-relief surface with more than 2 km elevation in central Mongolia, and (2) Tibetan Plateau, a vast continental-margin surface with an average elevation of 4.5 km in west China. We discover beneath Hangai Dome a deep low shear wavespeed (low-V) conduit indicating a slightly warmer (54 K–127 K) upwelling from the transition zone. We propose that the mantle upwelling induced decompression melting in the uppermost mantle and that excess heat associated with melt transport modified the lithosphere that isostatically compensates the surface uplift of Hangai Dome at upper mantle depths (> 80 km). On the other hand, we observe no discernable focused deep mantle upwelling directly beneath Tibetan Plateau, which is instead dominated by a strong high-V structure, appearing below 100 km depth and extending to the bottom of the mantle transition zone. However, we find a very strong and localized low-V anomaly beneath the Tibetan Plateau in the crust and uppermost mantle (at depths of ~50 km and 100 km) mainly confined within the Songpan Ganzi Fold Belt and the northern Qiangtang Block. This low-V anomaly is spatially linked to a low-V anomaly beneath the Chuandian Block in the same depth range, which is fed by a deep mantle upwelling directly beneath Hainan Volcano in south China. Implications of the observed high-V and low-V anomalies will be further discussed in terms of the formation of Tibetan Plateau.",

            "abstract": "The importance of bivalve shells as proxy archives for changes in environmental conditions is increasingly recognized. However, data for trace metal concentrations, specifically rare earth elements and yttrium (REY) in bivalve shells, are quite scarce. The chemistry of these elements in terms of solution speciation and complexation (mostly by carbonate) makes them particularly useful in acting as geochemical proxies of oceanic change due to the impact of temperature and pH on the activity of CO32- in seawater.\nWe approach this issue via an in situ culture experiment using Mytilus edulis from a site in the North Sea. The M.edulis used in our study were cultured offshore with no contact to the ocean floor. We compare the REY distribution in the shells and ambient seawater with the aim of investigating which REY species is incorporated into the shell. The shells show consistent shale-normalized (“SN”) REY patterns and display distinct REY features of the North Sea. The REY concentrations obtained from the shells were used to calculate apparent bulk REY partition coefficients between shells and ambient seawater (appDREYshell/seawater) and acquired results were then used in the investigation of the potential effects of pH and temperature on REY partitioning. Further comparison of appDREYshell/seawater patterns to the REY speciation in seawater suggests that the free REY3+ may be the most likely REY species that are actually incorporated from seawater into the M. edulis shell. We then modeled the REYSN patterns of a hypothetical mussel shell at pH 8.2 and 7.6 and at temperatures of 25°C and 5°C assuming that only REY3+ are incorporated into the carbonate’s crystal lattice.\nOur findings provide the basis to further understand how we can use shells of mussels like M. edulis as bioarchives that host geochemical proxies for paleoceanic environmental reconstructions. It appears that M. edulis shells are bioarchives of some REY features of seawater and results suggest that with lower pH, REY concentrations in shells increase, but with little effect on the shape of the REYSN patterns, while a temperature change has an impact on the REYSN pattern, but only minor effects on REY concentrations.",

People made thousands of aurora-related tweets and direct reports to Aurorasaurus.org, an interdisciplinary citizen science project that tracks auroras worldwide in real-time through social media and the project’s apps and website. Through Aurorasaurus, researchers are converting these crowdsourced observations into valuable data points to help improve models of where aurora can be seen. In this presentation, we will highlight how the team communicates with the public during these global, sporadic events to help drive and retain participation for Aurorasaurus. We will highlight some of the co-produced scientific results and increased media interest following this event.\nAurorasaurus uses mobile apps, blogging, and a volunteer scientist network to reach out to aurora enthusiasts to engage in the project. Real-time tweets are voted on by other users to verify their accuracy and are pinned on a map located on aurorasaurus.org to help show the instantaneous, global auroral visibility. Since the project launched in October 2014, hundreds of users have documented the two largest geomagnetic storms of this solar cycle. In some cases, like for the St. Patrick’s Day storm, users even reported seeing aurora in areas different than aurora models suggested. Online analytics indicate these events drive users to our page and many also share images with various interest groups on social media.\nWhile citizen scientists provide observations, Aurorasaurus gives back by providing tools to help the public see and understand the aurora. When people verify auroral sightings in a specific area, the project sends out alerts to nearby users of possible auroral visibility. Aurorasaurus team members around the world also help the public understand the intricacies of space weather and aurora science through blog articles, infographics, and quizzes. The project holds public engagement events during large storms via social media “hangouts” where anyone can ask our space weather scientists questions on the recent activity. Focused on long-term engagement, we will discuss our strategies for expanding and retaining this new community and lessons learned.",

            "abstract": "We present preliminary results of a petrologic study of northern Harrat Rahat that is part of an interdisciplinary hazard assessment of this rift-related volcanic field in Saudi Arabia. Alkali basalts and hawaiites occur with mugearites and trachyphonolites. This silica-undersaturated suite is consistent with fractionation at crustal depths greater than 25 km, i.e., at pressures for which experimental studies find that sodic clinopyroxene dominates the liquidus assemblage, resulting in a differentiation trend in which SiO2 rises only moderately. Trachyphonolites lack positive Eu anomalies despite abundant anorthoclase phenocrysts, and exhibit linear crystal-size distributions indicative of a simple, one-stage crystallization history. We suggest that trachyphonolite melts are extracted from extensively crystallized alkali basalts in the middle to lower crust. Any crystals entrained from depth (e.g., sodic clinopyroxene) are resorbed during ascent of these water-poor magmas to shallow levels, where they cool and crystallize. Abundant phenocrysts and low H2O contents resulted in viscous magmas that produced numerous cryptodomes along with domes and spines that pierced the uplifts. Eruption of trachyphonolite domes was accompanied by poorly fluidized scoria flows that traveled up to 4 km from their vents. Explosive disruption of domes produced block flows that ring craters. Vulcanian deposits with accretionary lapilli and lithics of rounded metamorphic rocks point to the involvement of groundwater sourced in basinal sediments eroded from Precambrian basement. Although phreatomagmatic eruptions produced tuff rings up to 1.5 km in diameter, there is no evidence for collapse calderas, suggesting there have not been sizable reservoirs of evolving magma in the shallow crust, consistent with petrologic evidence for a deep origin of the trachyphonolite magmas.\nIn contrast, Harrat Khaybar, which lies 140 km NNE of Harrat Rahat, erupted silica-saturated evolved magmas: trachytes and alkali rhyolites. Experimental studies demonstrate they can be produced by alkali basalt fractionation at low pressures equivalent to those of the upper crust. The Jabal Bayda tuff ring is the product of a phreatomagmatic eruption of phenocryst-poor alkali rhyolite that produced a plinian fall deposit.",

            "abstract": "Biomarkers in Archean sediments are now generally considered contaminants, either incorporated into the sediments after deposition or introduced during coring, sample collection, or laboratory analysis. Not all previously studied Archean formations have yet been re-analyzed using techniques that take a more stringent approach to account for contamination. Here we re-analyze 2.676 - 2.703 billion-year-old (Ga) lower greenschist metasediments collected from the Abitibi Greenstone Belt in Ontario Canada to determine if previously observed biomarkers are actually syndepositional or artifacts.\nOne method to assure the syngeneity of biomarkers with their host rock is to study hydrocarbons trapped within carbon-rich inclusions of specific mineral phases. We analyzed observed carbon-rich inclusions within the Abitibi metasediments to either verify or nullify the results of Ventura et al. 2007, which found evidence for archaeal, bacterial, and eukaryotic life present during primary deposition, and possible archaeal and bacterial life present during post deposition subsurface hydrothermal activity. 16 samples collected from 8 locations within the Tisdale and Porcupine Groups in Timmins, ON, Canada, were made into 75 - 100 μm thick slides, photographed, and petrographically analyzed for carbon-rich inclusions. Carbon-rich inclusions up to 10 - 20 μm in diameter were positively identified within 2.703 Ga greywackes. The 10 - 20 μm inclusions occur within the interstices of occluded quartz grains and within secondary mineral phases such as large (100 - 300 μm) ankerite grains which formed during the precipitation of minerals from hydrothermal fluid at 2.670 ± .007 Ga. The next step in analyzing these inclusions is to use full spectrum-Laser Desorption Postionization-Mass Spectrometry (fs-LDPI-MS), which has the capability of analyzing samples to the 2 μm scale to determine the hydrocarbon composition of the carbon-rich inclusions.",

            "abstract": "Deformation bands in sandstone and other porous rock have been shown to act as barriers or baffles to fluid flow. Changes in flow properties are related to microscale textural changes that occur within the deformation bands through coupled mechanical and chemical diagenetic processes. Microscale textures relating to flow properties, such as brittle grain deformation, preferred cementation, and the entrainment of fines within bands can be studied using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging techniques. Conventional techniques for imaging deformation bands by SEM involve using mechanically polished thin sections. However, mechanical polishing can cause induced sample damage that limits microstructural observations. To mitigate sample damage, we use large-area and cross-sectional Ar ion beam milling to prepare deformation band samples for SEM imaging. These techniques preserve sample integrity allowing the imaging of cement and pore textures at submicron resolution.\nIn an ion milled deformation band from the Entrada sandstone, we observe delicate euhedral quartz crystals that precipitated after band formation. In the same band, broken grain fragments that occupy space between larger framework grains are angular in shape, suggesting that they still bear freshly broken surfaces, not dulled and rounded by grain dissolution and cement overgrowth. The lack of widespread isopachous cement on grain fragments, and the observation, instead, of isolated slender quartz cement prisms indicates that cementation in these bands is highly localized. These localized cement growths increase roughness in the pore walls, increasing surface area and tortuosity in the flow pathway through the band. This may reduce permeability in the band without completely occluding flow pathways and pore connections within the bands.",

            "abstract": "In order to understand how the climate responds to variations in forcing, one necessary component is to understand the full distribution of variability of exchanges of heat and moisture between the atmosphere and ocean. Surface heat and moisture fluxes are critical to the generation and decay of many coupled air-sea phenomena. These mechanisms operate across a number of scales and contain contributions from interactions between the anomalous (i.e. non-mean), often extreme-valued, flux components. Satellite-derived estimates of the surface turbulent and radiative heat fluxes provide an opportunity to assess results from modeling systems. Evaluation of only time mean and variability statistics, however only provides limited traceability to processes controlling what are often regime-dependent errors.\nNon-parametric cluster-based classification of atmospheric and ocean surface properties has shown an ability to identify coherent weather regimes, each typically associated with similar properties and processes. Using satellite-based observational radiative and turbulent energy flux products, this study investigates the relationship between these weather states and surface energy processes within the context of tropical climate variability. Investigations of surface energy variations accompanying intraseasonal and interannual tropical variability often use composite-based analyses of the mean quantities of interest. Here, a similar compositing technique is employed, but the focus is on the distribution of the heat and moisture fluxes within their weather regimes. We will explore how the observed changes in surface energy components dominated by changes in the frequency of the weather regimes or through changes in the associated fluxes within those regimes. We will compare the satellite-based observational results with a similar analysis of the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) model. The extent to which the model simulations of the surface fluxes rectify onto sea surface temperature on seasonal to interannual time scales will be quantified.",

We describe 34+ years of an improved non-stationary 8-km normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) produced from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) instruments that extends from 1981 to the present. The AVHRR instruments have flown or are flying on fourteen polar-orbiting meteorological satellites operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and are currently flying on two European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) polar-orbiting meteorological satellites, MetOp-A and MetOp-B. This long AVHRR record is comprised of data from two different sensors: the AVHRR/2 instrument that spans July 1981 to November 2000 and the AVHRR/3 instrument that continues these measurements from November 2000 to the present. The main difficulty in processing AVHRR NDVI data is to properly deal with limitations of the AVHRR instruments. Complicating among-instrument AVHRR inter-calibration of channels one and two is the dual gain introduced in late 2000 on the AVHRR/3 instruments for both these channels. We have processed NDVI data derived from the Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) from 1997 to 2010 to overcome among-instrument AVHRR calibration difficulties. We use Bayesian methods with high quality well-calibrated SeaWiFS NDVI data for deriving AVHRR NDVI calibration parameters. Evaluation of the uncertainties of our resulting NDVI values gives an error of ± 0.005 NDVI units for our 1981 to present data set that is independent of time within our AVHRR NDVI continuum and has resulted in a non-stationary climate data set.",

This research looks into historic patterns of streamflow drought indicators and their evolution for major watershed regions in the conterminous U.S. (CONUS). The results indicate general linear and non-linear drying trends, particularly in the last four decades, as opposed to wetting trends reported in previous studies. Regional differences in the trends are notable, and echo the local climatic changes documented in the recent National Climate Assessment (NCA). A reversal of linear trends is seen for some northern regions after 1980s. Patterns in return periods and corresponding return values of the indicators are also examined, which suggests changing risk conditions that are important for water-resources decision-making. Persistent or flash drought conditions in a river can lead to chronic or short-term water scarcity—a main driver of societal and cross-boundary conflicts.

In addition, experiments under upper mantle conditions reported Cr-rich fluids in equilibrium with chromium oxide (Cr3+2O3) [4]. These studies suggest the need for theoretical models of the aqueous speciation of chromium in fluids and the stabilities of Cr minerals under deep crustal and upper mantle conditions. We estimated the thermodynamic properties of aqueous Cr2+, Cr3+, HCrO4-, CrO42-, and Cr2O72- using published data [5, 6] and the Deep Earth Water Model [7] to predict the different oxidation states of aqueous Cr to 1,000 °C and 5.0 GPa. We show that Cr(II) becomes the major redox state of Cr in hydrothermal fluids at 100 to 400 °C, with log fO2,g at magnetite/hematite over a wide range of pH values. In subduction zones, with log fO2,g at QFM to QFM – 2, a range of Cr redox states (II, III, and VI) may exist at 600 °C and 5 GPa depending on the pH. However, at higher temperatures (1000 °C), aqueous Cr(III) disappears and Cr(II) is favored relative to Cr(VI), again depending on the pH. Our predicted stability of Cr(II) in aqueous fluids at high temperatures suggests new mechanisms for redox/pH dependent Cr isotopic fractionation. We also estimated the thermodynamic properties of Cr(II)- and Cr(III)-garnets with the Sverjensky-Molling equation [8] to investigate the stability of Cr-garnet-fluid equilibria at elevated pressures and temperatures.\n",

During this event, ionospheric density measurements from the Floating Potential Measurement Unit (FPMU) on board the International Space Station (ISS) show dramatic depletions in the post-sunset (nighttime) local time sector at equatorial latitudes starting in the main phase of the storm and persisting on several subsequent orbits. Near the same time, the Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS) Fast Plasma Investigation (FPI) instrument suite data show ion and electron particle flux dropouts coincident in time with the density depletions seen in the ISS data. Both phenomena seem to follow northward turnings of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) z-component. We present simulations of this event with the SAMI3-RCM numerical model, which is a coupled ionosphere-magnetosphere model with self-consistent large-scale electrodynamics. We will investigate the role of transient changes in the global convection electric field driven by variations in the IMF Bz in connection with observations of the ionospheric depletions. Simulation results will be compared to the ISS FPMU densities, AMPERE Birkeland currents, DMSP ion drift velocities, MMS FPI particle data, as well as the location of the auroral oval and other available multi-instrument observations, in an attempt to understand the details of magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling during this event and characterize the fidelity of the simulation electrodynamic inputs to the ionosphere model.",

            "abstract": "Efforts to accurately monitor, report, and verify anthropogenic CO2 emissions using atmospheric measurements require reliable partitioning of anthropogenic and biogenic sources/sinks. Anthropogenic emissions peak during the daytime, coincident with biogenic drawdown of CO2. In contrast, net biogenic respiration emissions peak at night when anthropogenic emissions are lower. This temporal aliasing of fluxes requires careful accounting of both biogenic and anthropogenic fluxes for accurate source attribution. Relative to non-urban ecosystems, vegetation in urban areas is subject to longer growing seasons, reduced competition, greater nitrogen availability, and unique management practices. Ecosystem models and vegetation maps often omit urban areas despite potentially extensive vegetation coverage. For example, in Massachusetts (MA), models assume no biological flux over as much as 40% of land area.\nTo improve our understanding of the role of vegetation in the urban carbon cycle, we combine a new, comprehensive inventory of anthropogenic emissions, the Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model modified to incorporate altered urban growing conditions such as impervious surface area (ISA) and urban heat island, and an improved map of urban vegetation at 30m resolution. All fluxes are estimated at an hourly time scale for a 1km2 resolution grid extending across MA. We combined Landsat-derived estimates of canopy coverage and EVI of vegetation with ground surveys of tree growth and mortality to improve estimates of aboveground biomass and biogenic flux rates in urban ecosystems.\nModeled biogenic fluxes vary significantly between sites along a gradient of urban density from downtown Boston to the heavily vegetated Harvard Forest in western MA. Our vegetation map demonstrates that vegetation in urban ecosystems may contain up to ~300 Tg of C. Net biogenic C fluxes in urban areas are small relative to anthropogenic emissions but exhibit substantial temporal aliasing. While urban vegetation may have limited potential to directly offset anthropogenic emissions, ignoring biogenic fluxes will adversely impact the accuracy of our efforts to monitor, report, and verify anthropogenic C emissions.",

            "abstract": "Several centennial-scale climate fluctuations during the late-Holocene make it an ideal test case for examining the effects of climate change on sea level at societally-relevant timescales. Across much of the Arctic, glaciers and ice sheets reached their maximum late-Holocene extent during the Little Ice Age (LIA, 1400-1900 C.E.), approximately coincident with the global temperature minima observed during this time. However, ongoing work suggests the south Greenland Ice Sheet (sGrIS) may have behaved differently during the late-Holocene, with several outlet glaciers retreating, rather than advancing, during the LIA, possibly due to regional warming in the region different from the Arctic trend. The Qassimiut lobe, a low-lying piedmont-like extension of the sGrIS, may be especially sensitive to late-Holocene climate changes. Geomorphic evidence outboard of Naujaat Sermia, an outlet glacier draining the Qassimiut lobe, suggests three distinct periods of land exposure. We hypothesize these occurred during the last deglacial period, after an advance from near or behind the present margin during the Neoglacial, and during warming following the Little Ice Age in the last 1-2 centuries. Here, we present data from threshold lake cores immediately outboard of the presumed Neoglacial moraine. A sharp contact divides glacial sands and silts from organic gyttja, indicating glacial retreat from the moraine and subsequent meltwater diversion. The contact is accompanied by several geochemical changes, including increased Fe/Ti ratios, increased Br, and decreased Si and K, indicating a switch from more clastic to organic sedimentation. Radiocarbon ages from eight macrofossils immediately above this contact are calibrated to 1350-1950 C.E., suggesting the ice sheet may have retreated from its late-Holocene maximum during the Little Ice Age, but the wide range in ages suggests reworking of organic material may be significant in this region.",

            "abstract": "I will demonstrate the advantages of a new method of quantifying polar stratosphere-troposphere coupling by considering large-scale movements of mass into and out of the polar stratosphere. This project aims to use these mass movements to explain pressure and temperature anomalies throughout the polar troposphere and lower stratosphere in the aftermath of extreme stratospheric events. We hypothesise that these mass movements are induced by deposition of momentum by breaking waves in the stratosphere, slowing the wintertime polar vortex, and so are associated with sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs). Such a mass movement in the upper stratosphere acts to compress the polar atmosphere below it in the manner of a plunger. In this way the pressure anomaly in the upper polar stratosphere 'controls' the pressure and temperature anomalies below by adiabatic compression of the polar atmospheric column. Better understanding this method of control will allow us to use stratospheric data to improve medium-range forecasting ability in the troposphere.\nOne of the key innovations featured in this project is considering pressure and temperature fields at fixed geopotential surfaces, allowing for the easy observation of mass movement into and out of a polar cap region (which we have defined as north of 65N) as a function of altitude. Reanalysis data considered in this manner demonstrates a relationship between tropospheric pressure anomalies and stratospheric anomalies in the polar cap, and so a way to predict tropospheric variability given stratospheric information.

While chemicals generally make up <2% of the total injected fluid composition by mass, spills may have undiluted concentrations. HF fluids typically consist of a mixture of base fluid, proppant, and additives. Additives, comprised of one or more chemicals, are serve a specific engineering purpose (e.g., friction reducer, scale inhibitor, biocide). As part of the USEPA’s Draft Assessment of the Potential Impacts of Hydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas on Drinking Water Resources, we investigated the different types, volumes injected, and physical-chemical properties of HF fluid chemicals. The USEPA identified 1,076 chemicals used in HF fluids, based on 10 sources covering chemical use from 2005 to 2013. These chemicals fall into different classes: acids, alcohols, aromatic hydrocarbons, bases, hydrocarbon mixtures, polysaccharides, and surfactants. The physical-chemical properties of these chemicals vary, which affects their movement through the environment if spilled. Properties range from fully miscible to insoluble, from highly hydrophobic to highly hydrophilic. Most of these chemicals are not volatile. HF fluid composition varies from site to site depending on a range of factors. No single chemical or set of chemicals are used at every site. A median of 14 chemicals are used per well, with a range of four to 28 (5th and 95th percentiles). Methanol was the chemical most commonly reported in FracFocus 1.0 (72% of disclosures), and hydrotreated light petroleum distillates and hydrochloric acid were both reported in over half the disclosures. Operators store chemicals on-site, often in multiple containers (typically in 760 to 1,500 L totes). We estimated that the total volume of all chemicals used per well ranges from approximately 10,000 to 110,000 L.

This project, part of the Earthscope Flexible Array program, deployed 50 passive broadband stations across the RMCC from 2010 to 2012. Previous investigations of the area have included extensive surface mapping and active seismic profiles across the surrounding basins, but better imaging beneath the mountain range is needed to understand the tectonic processes that formed the RMCC. The RMCC exhibits typical core-complex structure of deep crustal rocks exhumed to the surface beneath a gently dipping detachment, with a thick mylonitic shear zone directly underlying the detachment. In the RMCC, the westward dip of the detachment, the ~1km-thick mylonite zone formed in the Paleogene, and a south-to-north increase in metamorphic grade provide targets for imaging.\nWe used common conversion point stacking of receiver functions to produce 3 profiles of structural discontinuities beneath the RMCC: one along the axis of the RMCC, and two crossing lines, one in the northern RMCC, and one in the southern part of the range. Due to the deep sedimentary basins surrounding the RMCC, various de-multiple processes were required to reduce the effects of basin reverberations. To better constrain the velocity structure of the area, we used ambient-noise tomography, and finally, we produced a joint inversion of our receiver functions and ambient-noise data.\nWe observe a mostly flat Moho at about 30 km depth beneath the RMCC that dips slightly to the south, with faint mid-crustal converters that also dip south at ~30°. In the southern RMCC, the Moho dips ~20° westward, but this is not observed in the northern RMCC. This suggests that much of the exhumation involved in the RMCC formation likely involved ductile flow that left a mostly flat Moho, but more recent processes also may have left observable changes in lower-crustal structure.",

In arctic and sub-arctic regions, elucidating DOM composition and reactivity is complicated by seasonal variations. These include changes in productivity and source inputs to the water column, as well as winter overflow events that may contribute allochthonous organic material. DOM from a small boreal stream in a watershed of discontinuous permafrost in the Goldstream Valley of interior Alaska was isolated by solid-phase extraction (PPL) at multiple points during the year – late spring, late summer, and in the winter during an active overflow event. Compositional characteristics of each of the isolates were characterized by SPR-W5-WATERGATE 1H NMR spectroscopy, specific UV-Vis absorbance, and excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy and compared against end-member reference DOM isolates. Kinetics of photobleaching experiments reveal the influence of compositional differences among the isolated DOMs on their chemical reactivity, and offer insight into potential differences in their source materials and ecological function throughout the year. Photobleaching studies were conducted using a variety of reactive species quenchers or sensitizers in order to assess susceptibility of oxidative transformation mechanisms on the different DOM isolates, which were then analyzed by 1H NMR, UV-Vis degradation kinetics, and parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of fluorescence EEMs. Better understanding of the seasonal variations of boreal DOM character and function on a molecular level is critical to assessing alterations in its ecological role and cycling in the face of current and future ecosystem perturbations in arctic and sub-arctic regions.",

            "abstract": "Solar radiation plays a major role in the energy exchange process between the atmosphere and earth’s surface. The spatial and temporal heterogeneity of incoming solar energy determines the dynamics of some landscape processes such as agricultural, hydrological, ecological and biological processes. Consequently, in order to understand these processes, knowledge of the spatial variability of solar radiation is crucial. At regional scales, particularly in complex topography, terrain is the major factor modifying the distribution of irradiation. Variability in elevation, surface inclination (slope) and orientation (aspect) and shadows cast by topographic features create strong local gradients of insolation which affects micro environmental factor. To account for spatio-temporal variations of solar radiation, spatially distributed DEM-based solar radiation models can be helpful. In this study, estimated daily solar radiation using Solar Analyst and r.sun solar radiation models were evaluated and compared in a mountainous region in south of Iran. The models were evaluated for different sky conditions ranged from completely overcast to clear sky conditions. The sensitivity of the models to the input, based on station data was also analyzed. Additionally, the role of the spatial resolution of the DEM has been evaluated through the use of three different resolutions: 30, 90 and 1000m. The results showed that, under clear-sky conditions, the models can estimate solar radiation favorably, but their accuracy was reduced in cloudy and party cloudy atmospheric conditions. However, the accuracy of r.sun model due to raster format of inputs was better than Solar Analyst model in presence of cloud in the sky. Regarding the role of the DEM spatial resolution, results showed that for complex topography areas, the accuracy of the estimates improves using a higher spatial resolution.",

Using statistical analyses of the GOES X-ray and differential particle observations from the past ~30 years and the SOHO/LASCO CME catalog (1996-present), we present sunspot number dependent predictions for expected flare, SEP, and CME rates. In particular, we present X-ray flare rates as a function of sunspot number for the past three cycles. We also show, as in the attached figure, that the 1-8 Angstrom background flux is strongly correlated with sunspot number across solar cycles. Similarly, we show that the CME properties (e.g., velocity and width) are also correlated with sunspot number for cycles 23 and 24. Finally, SEP rates and background proton flux levels are also scaled to sunspot number. These rates will enable future predictions for geoeffective events and place historical storms in context of present solar activity.",

            "abstract": "Basaltic volcanism is ubiquitous on the terrestrial planets and is the most common form of extrusive activity on Earth, with over half of the world’s volcanoes consisting largely of basalt. Recently, new eruptions (or new phases of ongoing eruptions) have occurred at Tolbachik in Russia (2012-2013); Bardarbunga in Iceland (2014); Etna in Italy (2014); and Kilauea in Hawaii (2014-2015) emphasizing both the hazard potential and volumetric production of basaltic activity. Furthermore, new high-resolution data of flows on Arsia Mons volcano (Mars) show very similar features. Therefore, this style of effusive volcanism and especially its surface manifestation (lava flows) warrants continued study both from a fundamental science as well as a hazard mitigation point of view. Monitoring flow propagation direction and velocity are critical in these situations and a number of models have evolved over time focused on heat loss and down-flow topography to predict flow advance. In addition to topography, the dominant (internal) factors controlling flow propagation are the discharge rate combined with cooling and increasing viscosity. However, all these models rely on accurate temperature measurements derived from the cooling glassy surface using infrared (IR) non-contact instruments. New laboratory and field-based studies are attempting to characterize the cooling, formation, and dynamics of basaltic surfaces using IR data. Preliminary results are focused on resolving inconsistencies in the derived flow temperature, composition, texture and silicate structure, which can all impact the surface-leaving heat flux. Improved accuracy in these retrievals increases our ability to constrain and model flow surface and interior temperatures. The impact of this improved accuracy has now been assessed using flow model simulations of active terrestrial and well-preserved Martian flows, Results are improving our understanding of the initial eruption conditions of these channelized basaltic lava flows on both planets.",

We investigate the effect of 3D velocity structure of the salt dome on wave propagation in the frequency range of interest (0.1-0.3 Hz) by forward modeling synthetic waveforms using MT solutions that were computed using Green’s functions assuming two separate 1D velocity models for stations over the salt dome and stations on the sedimentary strata surrounding the salt dome separately. We also use a matched filter technique to detect smaller events that went undetected by the automated grid-search based scanning and MT inversion algorithm using the waveforms of the larger events as templates. We also analyze the change in spectral content of the events, many of which exhibit a spectral peak at 0.4 Hz with a duration of > 60 seconds. The decrease in spectral amplitudes with distance also gives an estimate of high anelastic attenuation that damps reverberations within the shallow low velocity layers. Finally, we use noise cross-correlation analysis to explore changes in the green’s functions during the development of the sinkhole and verify the sediment velocity model by comparing observed and synthetic surface wave dispersion.",

            "abstract": "Stormwater green infrastructure (SGI), including rain gardens, detention ponds, bioswales, and green roofs, is being implemented in cities across the globe to help reduce flooding, decrease combined sewer overflows, and lessen pollutant transport to streams and rivers. Despite the increasing use of urban SGI, there is much uncertainty regarding the cumulative effects of multiple SGI projects on hydrology and water quality at the watershed scale. To assess the cumulative effects of SGI, major cities across the mid-Atlantic were selected based on availability of SGI, water quality, and stream flow data. The impact of SGI was evaluated by comparing similar watersheds, with and without SGI or by assessing how long-term changes in SGI impact hydrologic and water quality metrics over time. Most mid-Atlantic cities have a goal of achieving 10-75% SGI by 2030. Of these cites, Washington D.C. currently has the highest density of SGI (15.5%), while Philadelphia, PA and New York, NY have the lowest (0.14% and 0.28%, respectively). When comparing watersheds of similar size and percent impervious surface cover, watersheds with lower amounts of SGI, on average, show up to 40% greater annual total nitrogen and 75% greater total phosphorus loads and show flashier hydrology (as indicated by 35% greater average peak discharge, 26% more peak discharge events per year, and 21% higher peak-to-volume ratio) compared to watersheds with higher amounts of SGI. However, for cities with combined sewer systems (e.g. Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia, PA), there was no relationship between the level of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and the amount of SGI, indicating the level of SGI may not yet be sufficient to reduce CSOs as intended. When comparing individual watersheds over time, increases in SGI show no significant effect on the long-term trends in nutrient loads or hydrologic variables, potentially being obscured by the larger effect of interannual variability.",

            "abstract": "Deep borehole disposal (DBD) of certain defense-generated radioactive waste forms is being considered by the US Department of Energy (DOE) as an alternative to mined repositories. The 17 inch diameter vertical boreholes are planned to be drilled in crystalline basement rock. As part of an initial field test program, the DOE will drill a demonstration borehole, to be used to test equipment for handling and emplacing prototype nonradioactive waste containers, and a second smaller diameter borehole, to be used for site characterization. Both boreholes will be drilled to a depth of 5 km.\nConstruction of such boreholes is expected to be complex because of their overall length, large diameter, and anticipated downhole conditions of high temperatures, pore pressures, and stress regimes. It is believed that successful development of DBD boreholes can only be accomplished if geologic and tectonic conditions are characterized and drill activities are designed based on that understanding.\nOur study focuses primarily on using the in situ state of stress to mitigate borehole wall failure, whether tensile or compressive. The measured stresses, or their constrained estimates, will include pore pressure, the vertical stress, the horizontal stresses and orientations, and thermally induced stresses. Pore pressure will be measured directly or indirectly. Horizontal stresses will be estimated from hydraulic fracturing tests, leak off tests, and breakout characteristics. Understanding the site stress condition along with the rock’s strength characteristics will aid in the optimization of mud weight and casing design required to control borehole wall failure and other drilling problems.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.

Detrital zircon geochemistry, however, has been largely overlooked given results from continentally derived igneous zircon that show subtle intersample variation in trace-element concentrations, and which make correlation between detrital zircon and their host terrane difficult. Nevertheless, recent studies suggest systematically variable geochemistry in McCoy Mountain detrital zircons derived from the southern California Mesozoic arc, and our preliminary data from the Peninsular Ranges batholith indicates strong correlations between whole-rock and zircon geochemistry. Here, we present coupled U–Pb geochronology and geochemistry measured by laser ablation split stream ICPMS on detrital zircons from Nacimiento block forearc sediments in Central California to characterize temporal and geochemical trends in the adjacent Mesozoic arc terrane.\n1098 grains of Mesozoic age analyzed from 22 samples in the Nacimiento block define three periods of high magmatic flux in the Permian (270–250 Ma), Jurassic (170–140 Ma), and late Cretaceous (115–90 Ma). Zircon from the Permian arc is the least abundant of the three magmatic pulses, although they consistently display elevated Yb/Gd and U/Yb. Jurassic zircons display consistently low U/Yb, variably elevated Yb/Gd, abruptly higher Th/U and LREE from 155–145, and abruptly lower REE concentrations from 145–140 Ma. Zircon from the Cretaceous arc displays gradually increasing U/Yb, Th/U and LREE, with abruptly decreasing Yb/Gd at 95 Ma. The geochemical trends observed in the Nacimiento block detrital zircons of Cretaceous age are strikingly similar to temporal changes in geochemistry known from Cretaceous arc rocks of the Mojave and Peninsular Ranges, and strongly suggest a southern California provenance for Nacimiento block sediments. Furthermore, the similarity of geochemical trends between Cretaceous detrital grains and known whole-rock analyses suggests that our results can be used to make inferences regarding Jurassic and Permian arc processes, and that with sufficient sampling, detrital zircon geochemistry can be used as a powerful tool to characterize regional-scale geochemical trends over time.",

Through teasing apart the distinct processes that control circulation within these fjords, we are likely to better understand the impact of fjord circulation on modulating outlet glacier dynamics, and thus, changes in Greenland Ice Sheet mass balance. Here, we report on data from the summers of 2013-2015 in two neighboring fjords in the Uummannaq Bay region of west Greenland: Kangerlussuup Sermia (KS) and Rink Isbræ (RI). We find strong subglacial discharge driven plumes in both systems that evolve on synoptic and seasonal time scales, without the complicating presence of other circulation processes. The plumes both modify fjord water properties and respond to differences in ambient water properties, supporting the notion that a feedback exists between subglacial discharge plume circulation and water mass properties. This feedback between subglacial discharge and water properties potentially influences submarine melt rates at the glacier termini. Observed plume properties, including the vertical structure of velocity, and temperature and salinity anomalies, are compared favorably to model estimates. In KS, we find a near-surface intensified plume with high sediment content that slows and widens as it evolves downstream. In contrast, the plume in RI is entirely subsurface, ranging from 100-300 m depth at its core during summer, although it shows similar temperature, salinity, and optical backscatter signals to the KS plume. Importantly, the distinct vertical plume structures imprint on the overall water mass properties found in each fjord, raising the minimum temperatures by up to 1-2°C in the case of RI.",

This evolution makes urban basins heterogeneous socio-ecological-technological systems. We hypothesize that this heterogeneity creates unique impact trajectories in time and impact hotspots in space within and across cities. To explore this, we develop and implement a network hydro-engineering modeling framework based on high-resolution digital elevation and stormwater infrastructure data. The framework also accounts for climatic, soils, land use, and vegetation conditions in an urban basin, thus making it useful to study the impacts of stormwater infrastructure across cities. Here, to evaluate the framework, we apply it to urban basins in the metropolitan areas of Phoenix, Arizona. We use it to estimate different metrics to characterize the storm-event hydrologic response. We estimate both traditional metrics (e.g., peak flow, time to peak, and runoff volume) as well as new metrics (e.g., basin-scale dispersion mechanisms). We also use the dispersion mechanisms to assess the scaling characteristics of urban basins. Ultimately, we find that the proposed framework can be used to understand and characterize the impacts associated with stormwater infrastructure on hydrologic conditions within a basin. Additionally, we find that the scaling approach helps in synthesizing information but it requires further validation using additional urban basins.",

The impacts of NH3 also include: aerosol production affecting global radiative forcing, increases in emissions of the greenhouse gases nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4), and modification of the transport and deposition patterns of SO2 and NOx. Therefore, monitoring NH3 global distribution of sources is vitally important to human health with respect to both air and water quality and climate change. We have developed new daily and global ammonia (NH3) products from AIRS hyperspectral measurements. These products add value to AIRS’s existing products that have made significant contributions to weather forecasts, climate studies, and air quality monitoring. With longer than 13 years of data records, these measurements have been used not only for daily monitoring purposes but also for inter-annual variability and short-term trend studies. We will discuss the global NH3 emission sources from biogenic and anthropogenic activities over many emission regions captured by AIRS. We will focus their variability in the last 13 years. Validation examples using in situ measurements for AIRS NH3 will also be presented.",

Within general circulation models (GCMs), simulation studies have revealed regionally significant changes in temperature, precipitation, and other climate variables. These irrigation impacts are especially notable in key water stressed regions of Asia, western North America, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East. Here we investigate the feedbacks of irrigation with a focus on regional water availability in model simulations. We use two GCM configurations, with and without irrigation, to understand irrigation-induced changes in regional water balances. Importantly, while most other GCM irrigation analyses have focused on monthly changes, we explore changes in daily climate variables. Our simulations reveal shifts in runoff that vary dramatically by region. For example, California’s Central Valley experiences substantial shifts in daily runoff, while runoff is relatively insensitive to irrigation in the Ganges-Brahmaputra basin. It is important to understand such feedbacks, as we face a future with great uncertainty in water-resource availability.",

            "abstract": "Latin America and the Caribbean are at risk of extreme climate events, including flooding rains, damaging winds, drought, heat waves, and in high elevation mountainous regions, excessive snowfalls. The causes of these events are numerous – flooding rains and damaging winds are often associated with tropical cyclones, but also can occur, either separately or in tandem, due to smaller, more localized storms. Similarly, heat waves and droughts can be large scale or localized, and frequently occur together (as excessive drying can lead to enhanced heating, while enhanced heating in turn promotes additional drying). Even in the tropics, extreme snow and ice events can have severe consequences due to avalanches, and also impact water resources. Understanding and modeling the climate controls behind these extreme events requires consideration of a range of time and space scales. A common strategy is to use a global climate model (GCM) to simulate the large-scale (~100km) daily atmospheric controls on extreme events. A limited area, high resolution regional climate model (RCM) is then employed to dynamically downscale the results, so as to better incorporate the influence of topography and, secondarily, the nature of the land cover. But what resolution is required to provide the necessary results, i.e., minimize biases due to improper resolution? In conjunction with our partners from participating Latin American and Caribbean nations, we have made an extensive series of simulations, both region-wide and for individual countries, using the WRF regional climate model to downscale output from a variety of GCMs, as well as Reanalyses (as a proxy for observations). The simulations driven by the Reanalyses are used for robust model verification against actual weather station observations. The simulations driven by GCMs are designed to provide projections of future climate, including importantly how the nature and number of extreme events may change through coming decades. Our results suggest that for proper simulation of both mean climate, and importantly extreme events, a spatial resolution of 4km is required in regions of complex mountainous topography. A somewhat coarser resolution of 12km is adequate in regions without much topographic relief, and where differing land covers account for most of the spatial heterogeneity.",

One satellite estimate is based on using observed surface convergence and precipitation (Handlos and Back, 2014), while another is based on the vertical profile of reflectivity. These estimates are compared with geographic variability in stratiform and shallow rain fractions. TRAIN algorithm latent heating retrievals are used to examine the extent to which geographic variability can be attributed to variations in stratiform rain fraction, variations in the convective heating profile, and/or variations in the stratiform heating profile. We find that in TRAIN, variations in top-heaviness are predominantly associated with variations in depth of the convective heating profile.",

Deposition took place since ~50 ka and incision began at 4.0 +0.6/-0.4 ka at an average rate of 10.5 +0.6/-1.8 mm yr-1.\nIn addition, petrology, isotope geochemistry (εNd, 87Sr/86Sr) and chemical composition performed on modern river sands and late-Quaternary megafan sediments allows characterizing (1) provenance variations through time of megafan deposits and their implication for drainage development (2) the weathering history of Sikkim recorded by the megafan deposits. Results show that the Tista fan deposits are mainly sourced from the High Himalayan Crystalline domain and the Tethyan Sedimentary Series, (consistent with high erosion rates identified in north Sikkim at millennial timescale). Variations in provenance and weathering through time recorded by the Tista megafan deposits can be linked to climatic variations with strong monsoonal precipitations penetrating further northward into the southern Tibetan plateau. Tectonic processes seem to play a minor role.\nOtherwise, we propose as a first hypothesis that the Kosi River has recently (at ~4 ka) captured the upper part of the Tista catchment. That could explain the particular isotopic signature of the Tista megafan deposits, its recent incision, its disproportionate size, as well as the sediment fluxes recorded by the megafan deposits, which are higher than those inferred from modern erosion rates in Sikkim.\nThese data provide a new comprehensive view on erosional processes and associated sedimentary fluxes of Sikkim to the alluvial plain as well as their potential climatic or tectonic controls.",

Significant uncertainties remain, however, in both our understanding of the production and transfer of MSA to the ice sheet, as well as its preservation over time, compromising the paleoclimatological utility of the proxy. Here we apply a numerical modeling approach to quantitatively investigate the post-depositional processes affecting MSA migration and preservation within the firn and ice column, building on recent observational and theoretical studies. Our model allows us to evaluate the timing and magnitude of the vertical movement of MSA in response to varying influences, including the competing effects of 1) concentration gradients of sea-salts typically deposited asynchronously to MSA, 2) snow accumulation and densification rates, and 3) in situ temperature gradients. We first test the model against a recently collected ice core from a high accumulation site in coastal West Antarctica, where monthly-resolved MSA records show an abrupt shift from a summer-to-winter maximum in MSA at ~23m depth (ρ ≈ 650 kg/m3), near the firn-ice transition. We find our model to be a robust predictor of the observed migrational features in this record, capturing both (i) the abrupt shift in summer-to-winter maximal concentrations of MSA (steady state ≈ 3.2 yrs), and (ii) the depression of the seasonal amplitude at depth. Further, our modeling results suggest post-depositional effects can lead to substantial interannual alteration of the MSA signal, contrary to previous assumptions that MSA migration is confined within annual layers at high accumulation sites. Using a broad range of polar MSA records and their associated, site-specific environmental conditions, we will evaluate the fidelity of subannual to interannual variability of MSA records and systematically determine the factors conducive to its migration.",

Transformation rates have not been directly measured in the aquifer. This study quantifies nitrate-nitrogen transformation potential in the UFA using single well push-pull tracer injection (PPT) experiments combined with microbial characterization of extracted water via qPCR and RT-qPCR of selected nitrate reduction genes. Tracer tests with chloride and nitrate ± carbon were executed in two wells representing anoxic and oxic geochemical end members in a spring groundwater contributing area. A significant increase in number of microbes with carbon addition suggests stimulated growth. Increases in the activities of denitrification genes (nirK and nirS) as measured by RT-qPCR were not observed. However, only microbes suspended in the tracer were obtained, ignoring effects of aquifer material biofilms. Increases in nrfA mRNA and ammonia concentrations were observed, supporting Dissimilatory Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia (DNRA) as a reduction mechanism. In the oxic aquifer, zero order nitrate loss rates ranged from 32 to 89 nmol /L*hr with no added carbon and 90 to 240 nmol /L*hr with carbon. In the anoxic aquifer, rates ranged from 18 to 95 nmol /L*hr with no added carbon and 34 to 207 nmol /L*hr with carbon. These loss rates are low; 13 orders of magnitude less than the loads applied in the contributing area each year, however they do indicate that losses can occur in oxic and anoxic aquifers with and without carbon. These rates may include, ammonia adsorption, uptake, or denitrification in aquifer material biofilms. Rates with and without carbon addition for both aquifers were similar, suggesting aquifer redox state and carbon availability alone are insufficient to predict response to nutrient additions without characterization of microbial response. Surprisingly, these rates are consistent with reported rates of denitrification in other PPTs performed in basin fill aquifers which range from 10 to 360 nmol /L*hr. Thus, assuming equivalency between nitrate loss rates and denitrification rates may be an oversimplification when microbial response, nutrient spiraling, and all reaction byproducts are not evaluated.",

            "abstract": "Vertical displacements in unconsolidated material respond to local changes in pressure and temperature, as well as loads applied at the ground surface and changes in water content in shallow soils. Our objective is to use these vertical displacements as a hydrologic monitoring tool, so it is important to understand the various processes that contribute to displacements in order to properly interpret field observations. Several years ago we developed a simple, high resolution, vertical extensometer, called a DEL-X, that is capable of resolving displacements of less than 10 nm in soils. The spatial sampling region of the instrument is approximately 2x its depth. Recent applications have been in the range of 5 to 10 m, so the averaging region extends over many hundreds of square meters. Five DEL-X instruments were deployed at a field site near Clemson, SC at depths of 3m, and 6m within saprolite soil derived from biotite gneiss. Signals from the co-located extensometers are remarkably similar, demonstrating reproducibility of the technique. Rainfall is associated with compression, and ET is associated with extension at 6-m depth. Deep infiltration and lateral surface flow may also contribute to unloading. The loading factor is approximately 200 nm of compression per 1 mm of water load change by either rainfall or ET, and this value is consistent with the elastic modulus of the soil at the site. The displacements include a strong signal with an annual period and an amplitude of approximately 50 microns. The peak compression occurs in January and peak extension is in May for all the 6-m-deep DEL-Xs. These displacements are strongly correlated to the height of the water table, which rises in the spring and drops throughout the fall. Temperature changes also affect displacements over an annual period, but the effect is secondary to changes in pore pressure at 6-m-depth, which is slightly above the water table. Data processing techniques have been developed to resolve these different components of the displacement signal.",

Mantle-like δ18O values are expected if MORB fractionation played a dominant role in PLGT genesis. Magmatic values (monitored here by zircon) shifted away from the mantle-like range indicate open system processes which include partial melting of hydrothermally-altered crust or influx of subduction-related, sediment-derived melt. Zircon (zrn) and quartz (qtz) from twenty-four new samples of PLGT from the crustal and mantle sections of the Oman ophiolite were analyzed for δ18O. Rock-averaged δ18O from the sheeted dikes (zrn: 4.3-4.5‰, qtz: 6.7-6.9‰) and dike-gabbro transition (zrn: 3.9-4.8‰, qtz: 4.7-7.7‰) are mostly below values in magmatic equilibrium with MORB (zrn = 5.2±0.5‰, qtz = 7.0-7.5‰). δ18O for PLGT in the gabbro section (zrn: 4.8-5.1‰, qtz: 7.7-8.3‰) are mostly mantle-like. Quartz is generally found to be more variable than coexisting zrn and likely experienced some sub-solidus exchange. When organized into a relative structural position, δ18Ozrn values typically increase with depth. The lowest δ18Ozrn are observed near the dike-gabbro transition and are consistent with petrogenesis involving hydrous partial melting of mafic crust previously hydrothermally-altered at high-T. The return to nominally mantle-equilibrated δ18Ozrn deeper in the gabbro section may reflect decreasing seawater-signatures of fluids penetrating to depth, lower water/rock ratios, or extreme fractional crystallization. Crustal PLGT thus predate the development of high δ18O signatures in the upper oceanic crust as it cools and experiences low temperature hydrothermal alteration.\nMantle PLGT intrusions (1-3 m thick) from the Haylayn block extend to considerably higher rock-averaged δ18O values (zrn: 5.1-15.4‰, qtz: 7.0-18.5‰). Individual rocks (5 samples) were uniform in δ18O, and coexisting minerals yield calculated T = 640-700°C. Taken with recently published whole rock radiogenic isotope studies, the high-δ18O values require that some mantle plagiogranite formed from deep-seated magmas with a high-δ18O sediment component reflecting an influx of subduction-related melt.",

            "abstract": "To better simulate storms and associated precipitation within atmospheric models, accurate representation of sub-cloud processes is needed. In the Thompson microphysics parameterization in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, graupel and hail are represented by a single hydrometeor category (hereafter, referred to as the graupel category) that only predicts mass mixing ratio and therefore sets particle density to a constant value. This is not realistic given that the densities of graupel and hail are known to vary greatly between and within storms. This study assessed the sensitivity of two simulated squall lines to the prescription of graupel density using the WRF model. One case was an idealized simulation, while the other was a “real” simulation set up to represent an observed squall line. The range of graupel density was varied from 200 kg m-3 to 800 kg m-3, representing particles more characteristic of soft graupel to those of hard hail, respectively. As the density of graupel particles was decreased from being hail-like to graupel-like, the idealized simulation showed a faster squall line with less graupel and more cloud ice. In particular, the lower density graupel case had a notable increase in the graupel melting rate, which resulted in more latent cooling and therefore a more intense cold pool and a faster storm propagation speed. The “real” case exhibited similar trends in graupel melting rate and ice production, but the sensitivity of its cold pool to graupel density was not as strong. This paper will present the results of changing graupel density in these two simulations and the implications this may have on improvements that could be made to the graupel parameterization in the Thompson microphysics scheme.",

The model domain extends from ~45˚N to the North Pole and is configured to run at ~9km resolution for the ice and ocean components, coupled to 50km resolution atmosphere and land models. The baseline sea ice model configuration includes mushy-layer sea ice thermodynamics and level-ice melt ponds. Using this configuration, we compare the use of isotropic and anisotropic sea ice mechanics, and evaluate model performance using these two variants against observations including Arctic buoy drift and deformation, satellite-derived drift and deformation, and sea ice volume estimates from ICESat. We find that the isotropic rheology better approximates spatial patterns of thickness observed across the Arctic, but that both rheologies closely approximate scaling laws observed in the pack using buoys and RGPS data. A fundamental component of both ice mechanics variants, the so called Elastic-Viscous-Plastic (EVP) and Anisotropic-Elastic-Plastic (EAP), is that they are highly sensitive to the timestep used for elastic sub-cycling in an inertial-resolving coupled framework, and this has a significant affect on surface fluxes in the fully coupled framework.",

The landform in this area, in particular in the inner mountain region, is highly complex with nested valleys and ridges. The geometry of the terrain causes distinct diurnal and seasonal local flow patterns that result in highly complex interactions of this low level moisture with meso- and synoptic-scale cyclones passing through the region.\nThe Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) was used to conduct high resolution simulations of several case studies of warm season precipitation in the SAM with different synoptic-scale conditions to investigate this interaction between local and larger-scale flow patterns. The aim is to elucidate the microphysical interactions among these shallow orographic clouds and preexisting precipitating cloud systems and identify uncertainties in the model microphysics using in situ measurements. Findings show that ridge-valley precipitation gradients, in particular the “reverse” to the classical orographic effect observed in inner mountain valleys, is linked to horizontal heterogeneity in the vertical structure of low level cloud and precipitation promoted through landform controls on local flow. Moisture convergence patterns follow the peaks and valleys as represented by WRF terrain, and the topography effectively controls their timing and spatial structure. The simulations support the hypothesis that ridge-valley precipitation gradients, and in particular the reverse orographic enhancement effect in inner mountain valleys, is linked to horizontal heterogeneity in the vertical structure of low level clouds and precipitation promoted through landform controls on moisture convergence.",

            "abstract": "Urban populations are projected to increase throughout the century. As urban areas expand and increase in density as a result of population pressures, urban heat islands (UHIs) will grow and intensify. Characterization of UHIs using remote sensing has focused primarily on the use of thermal infrared (TIR) sensors. Remote sensing of TIR measures, at 1 km spatial resolution or coarser, land surface or skin temperatures to reveal the surface UHI (sUHI) in contrast to in situ approaches that measure air temperature at points in networks or along transects. The city, its suburbs, and rural matrix all emit longwave electromagnetic radiation at wavelengths both shorter and longer than TIR. Here we introduce the use of two other wavelength regions for UHI characterization. Our prior work has shown that the middle infrared (MIR) in the atmospheric window from 3-5 microns offers some advantages to imaging urban areas. We demonstrate a new method for characterizing the intensity and the seasonality of sUHI in the MIR for selected cities in North America and Europe using MODIS band 23. In contrast to MIR and TIR sensors, microwave radiometers (MWR) can retrieve both air temperature and water vapor, albeit at coarse spatial resolution (~25 km) relative to most urban areas. Using the AMSR-E/AMSR2 product time series, we show both the advantages and limitations of using MWR data to characterize UHIs in the megacities and major conurbations of North and South America. These new approaches to UHI characterization complement the traditional TIR methods to reveal other impacts of cities on their environment.",

            "abstract": "The US EPA produces annual estimates of national anthropogenic methane emissions in the Inventory of US Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks (EPA inventory). These are reported to the UN and inform national climate policy. The EPA inventory uses best available information on emitting processes (IPCC Tier 2/3 approaches). However, inversions of atmospheric observations suggest that the inventory could be too low. These inversions rely on crude bottom-up estimates as a priori because the EPA inventory is only available as national totals for most sources. Reliance on an incorrect a priori greatly limits the value of inversions for testing and improving the EPA inventory as allocation of methane emissions by source types and regions can vary greatly between different bottom-up inventories.\nHere we present a 0.1° × 0.1° monthly version of the EPA inventory to serve as a priori for inversions of atmospheric data and to interpret inversion results. We use a wide range of process-specific information to allocate emissions, incorporating facility-level data reported through the EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program where possible. As an illustration of used gridding strategies, gridded livestock emissions are based on EPA emission data per state, USDA livestock inventories per county, and USDA weighted land cover maps for sub-county localization. Allocation of emissions from natural gas systems incorporates monthly well-level production data, EIA compressor station and processing plant databases, and information on pipelines. Our gridded EPA inventory shows large differences in spatial emission patterns compared to the EDGAR v4.2 global inventory used as a priori in previous inverse studies. Our work greatly enhances the potential of future inversions to test and improve the EPA inventory and more broadly to improve understanding of the factors controlling methane concentrations and their trends. Preliminary inversion results using GOSAT satellite data will be presented.",

Geared to K-12 classrooms and the general public, VISL’s main goal is to improve climate literacy, especially in regards to the crucial role of the polar ice sheets in Earth’s climate and sea level. VISL will allow users to perform guided experiments using the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM), a state-of-the-art ice flow model developed at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and UC Irvine that simulates the near-term evolution of the ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica. VISL users will access ISSM via a graphical interface that can be launched from a web browser on a computer, tablet or smart phone. Users select climate conditions and run time by moving graphic sliders then watch how a given region evolves in time under those conditions. Lesson plans will include conceptual background, instructions for table top experiments related to the concepts addressed in a given lesson, and a guide for performing model experiments and interpreting their results. Activities with different degrees of complexity will aim for consistency with NGSS Physical Science criteria for different grade bands (K-2, 3-5, 6-8, and 9-12), although they will not be labeled as such to encourage a broad user base. Activities will emphasize the development of physical intuition and critical thinking skills, understanding conceptual and computational models, as well as observation recording, concept articulation, hypothesis formulation and testing, and mathematical analysis. At our present phase of development, we seek input from the greater science education and outreach communities regarding VISL’s planned content, as well as additional features and topic areas that educators and students would find useful.",

Biomass has strong influences on carbon, water, and nutrient cycles. Traditionally biomass estimation requires intensive, and often destructive, field measurements. However, with advances in technology, airborne LiDAR has become a convenient tool for acquiring such information on a large scale. In this study, we use infrared full waveform LiDAR to estimate biomass information for individual trees in the Sangamon River basin in Illinois, USA. During this process, we also develop automated geolocation calibration algorithms for raw waveform LiDAR data. In the summer of 2014, discrete and waveform LiDAR data were collected over the Sangamon River basin. Field measurements commonly used in biomass equations such as diameter at breast height and total tree height were also taken for four sites across the basin. Using discrete LiDAR data, individual trees are delineated. For each tree, a voxelization methods is applied to all waveforms associated with the tree to result in a pseudo-waveform. By relating biomass extrapolated using field measurements from a training set of trees to waveform metrics for each corresponding tree, we are able to estimate biomass on an individual tree basis. The results can be especially useful as current models increase in resolution.",

Continuous measurements are particularly challenging because of the remote locations, low power availability, and extreme weather conditions. The necessity for tailoring instrumentation at different sites further complicates the interpretation of results and may add uncertainty to estimates of annual CO2 budgets. We investigated the influence of different sensor combinations on FCO2, latent heat (LE), and FCH4, and assessed the differences in annual FCO2 estimated with different instrumentation at the same sites. Using data from four sites across the North Slope of Alaska, we resolved FCO2 and FCH4 to within 5% using different combinations of open- and closed-path gas analyzers and within 10% using heated and non-heated anemometers. A continuously heated anemometer increased data coverage relative to non-heated anemometers while resulting in comparable annual FCO2, despite over-estimating sensible heat fluxes by 15%. We also implemented an intermittent heating strategy whereby activation only when ice or snow blockage of the transducers was detected. This resulted in comparable data coverage (~ 60%) to the continuously heated anemometer, while avoiding potential over-estimation of sensible heat and gas fluxes. We found good agreement in FCO2 and FCH4 from two closed-path and one open-path gas analyzer, despite the need for large spectral corrections of closed-path fluxes and density and temperature corrections to open-path sensors. However, data coverage was generally greater when using closed-path, especially during cold seasons (36-40% vs 10-14% for the open path), when fluxes from Arctic regions are particularly uncertain and potentially critical to annual C budgets. Measurement of Arctic LE remains a challenge due to strong attenuation along sample tubes, even when heated, that could not be accounted for with spectral corrections.",

One such example of features not being captured occurs over the Central North Pacific's Hawaiian Island chain, where most large-scale models poorly resolve the small islands and their complex topographies, which have a significant influence on the regions winds, temperature, and precipitation. For the dynamical downscaling procedure to realistically resolve the small Hawaiian Islands we must use three nested, where the innermost domain centered over Oahu, Hawaii has a grid resolution of 1.1 km. Also during the dynamical downscaling process RCMs interior solution tends to drift away from the large-scale driving fields resulting in significant RCM temperature and precipitation biases especially during extreme events. Two possible solutions developed to allow the RCM to retain the large-scale features, yet still generate the small scale variabilities are analysis and spectral nudging. Here, we examine the performance of both analysis and spectral nudging in the downscaling of NCEPII reanalysis data during the extreme 2-month wet period known as the 40-days and 40-nights of rain over the Hawaiian Islands using the Advanced Research Weather and Forecasting (WRF-ARW) model. The simulations are compared against land based observations acquired from the National Climate Data Center (NCDC) to show the differences for 2-m temperature and precipitation between the nudging techniques and observations from Oahu, Hawaii.",

            "abstract": "Marked patterns of seasonal and diurnal variations of discharge and temperature characterise meltwater rivers draining from large Alpine glaciers. Meltwater temperature warms with distance downstream, influenced both by energy availability and the volume of meltwater flowing. The amount of meltwater produced depends also on energy availability but also on the area of ice substrate over which melt occurs. As climate warms, meltwater production by ablation in summer will first increase with increasing energy for melting, before decreasing as the area of ice available for melt decreases, off-setting continuing increase in energy availability. Future meltwater temperature changes will depend on the inter-relationship between increasing energy availability and enhancing volume of meltwater produced. Relationships between rates of ice melt, reduction in ice area, and meltwater production will influence melt water temperature changes as climate warms. Meltwater temperature is inversely related to discharge whilst positively related to heat availability. Records of water temperature and discharge of meltwaters in rivers draining from three valley glaciers in Kanton Wallis, Switzerland have been examined. Hourly data for the Massa, Grosser Aletschgletscher, for the period 2003-2014, the Gornera, Gornergletscher , 2007-2014, and Findelenbach, Findelengletscher, 2007-2014 obtained at distances of a few kilometres from the glacier portals have been analysed, for summer months, during which more than 90% of discharge occurs. Distinctive seasonal temperature regimes have highest annual water temperatures during low flows in May., but then as discharge increased with first increasing radiation, increasing ice area as the transient snow line moved up glacier, and higher air temperatures, water temperatures decreased. On a diurnal basis, meltwater temperatures increased with rising radiation ahead of rising discharge (discharge being delayed by flow through time within the glacier between ice surface and portal) before reducing through daily peak flows. These relationships are assessed with a simple radiation-forced model integrating changing ice areas, lengthening distances of water exposure radiation from the glacier portal and flow through velocities dependent on discharge.",

Base stations are monumented field stations; they were surveyed in 2012 and 2013 with the A10-020 gravimeter. They are the subject of the paper.\nBesides absolute gravity measurements the vertical gravity gradient was precisely determined at all 168 base stations. Inconsistency of the determined vertical gravity gradients with respect to the normal ones has been presented. 77 base stations are also the stations of the previous gravity (POGK98) established in 90. of 20 century. Differences between newly determined gravity at those stations with those of POGK98 were evaluated. Alongside the establishment of the base stations of the gravity control multiple additional activities were performed to assure and provide the proper gravity reference level.

            "abstract": "The hyporheic zone (HZ) is a critical ecosystem component that links terrestrial, surface water, and groundwater ecosystems. A dominant feature of the HZ is groundwater-surface water mixing and the input of terrestrially—as well as aquatically—derived organic carbon. In many systems the HZ has a relatively small spatial extent, but in larger riverine systems groundwater-surface water mixing can occur 100s of meters beyond the surface water shoreline; we consider these more distal locations to be within the ‘subsurface interaction zone’ (SIZ) as they are beyond the traditional HZ. Microbial communities in the HZ and SIZ drive biogeochemical processes in these system components, yet relatively little is known about the ecological processes that drive HZ and SIZ microbial communities. Here, we applied ecological theory, aqueous biogeochemistry, DNA sequencing, and ultra-high resolution organic carbon profiling to field samples collected through space (400m spatial extent) and time (7 month temporal extent) within the Hanford Site 300 Area. These data streams were integrated to evaluate how the influence of groundwater-surface water mixing on microbial communities changes when moving from the HZ to the broader SIZ. Our results indicate that groundwater-surface water mixing (i) consistently stimulated heterotrophic respiration, but only above a threshold of surface water intrusion, (ii) did not stimulate denitrification, (iii) caused deterministic shifts in HZ microbial communities due to changes in organic carbon composition, and (iv) did not cause shifts in SIZ microbial communities. These results suggest that microbial communities and the biogeochemical processes they drive are impacted by groundwater-surface water mixing primarily in the HZ and to a lesser extent in the SIZ.",

Recent observational studies support that KHI can operate under southward IMF conditions. As such, it is suggested that both magnetic reconnection and the KHI can operate simultaneously. The nonlinear interaction between these two modes significantly modulates their respective onset conditions. Consequently, the observational features of these two modes are expected to be modified. This study will focus on the plausible observational features of the nonlinear interaction between the KHI and reconnection (KHRX) based on three-dimensional MHD simulations. The typical plasma and field observational signatures from KHRX and traditional magnetic reconnection will be compared in this presentation. We will also discuss how those results compare with in-situ observational signatures of \"flux transfer events\".",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture is one of the main input variables for hydrological models. However due to the high spatial and temporal variability of soil properties it is often difficult to obtain accurate soil information at the required resolution. The new satellite SMAP promises to deliver soil moisture information at higher resolutions and could therefore improve the results of hydrological models. Nevertheless it still has to be investigated how precisely the SMAP soil moisture data can be used to delineate rainfall-runoff generation processes and if SMAP imagery can significantly improve the results of surface runoff models. Important parameters to understand the spatiotemporal distribution of soil humidity are infiltration and hydraulic conductivities apart from soil texture and macrostructure. During the SMAPVEX15-field campaign data on hydraulic conductivity and infiltration rates is collected in the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW) in Southeastern Arizona in order to analyze the spatiotemporal variability of soil hydraulic properties. A Compact Constant Head Permeameter is used for in situ measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity within the soil layers and a Hood Infiltrometer is used to determine infiltration rates at the undisturbed soil surface. Sampling sites were adjacent to the USDA-ARS meteorological and soil moisture measuring sites in the WGEW to take advantage of the long-term database of soil and climate data. Furthermore a sample plot of 3x3km was selected, where the spatial variability of soil hydraulic properties within a SMAP footprint was investigated. The results of the ground measurement based analysis are then compared with the remote sensing data derived from SMAP and aircraft-based microwave data to determine how well these spatiotemporal variations are captured by the remotely sensed data with the final goal of evaluating the use of future satellite soil moisture products for the improvement of rainfall runoff models. The results reveal several interesting features on the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture at multiple scales, and the capabilities and limitations of remote sensing derived products in reproducing them.",

            "abstract": "A synthesis of the impacts of the Amazon River hydrological changes on the sedimentation process of organic matter (OM) in three different floodplain lakes (Santa Ninha, Maracá, and Comprido lakes) is presented in this study.Today the Santa Ninha and Maracá lakes are directly and permanently connected with the main channel of the Amazon River, in contrast to Comprido Lake, which is indirectly and periodically influenced by the Amazon River due to its greater distance from the main channel. All three lake sediment records showed a reduced river inflow due to dry climatic conditions during the early and middle Holocene followed by an increased fluvial input during the wetter late Holocene. In Santa Ninha and Maraca Lakes, the reduced river inflow periodwas recorded by sediments with a lowabundance of smectite (~20 wt.%), a clay mineral mainly transported by the fluvial system, high total organic carbon (TOC) contents (~8.2 wt.%). During the late Holocene, a higher smectite abundance (~43 wt.%) and a lower TOC content (~1.4 wt.%) pointed to greater dilution by riverine lithogenic matter. In Comprido Lake, a sedimentation gap occurred during the early and middle Holocene. The wetter late Holocene, since 3000 cal years BP, was characterized by high TOC values (~9 wt.%), but the smectite content was low (~14%). This combination suggests that the sedimentary input to Comprido Lake from the local catchment area became dominant during the wet-climate late Holocene due to the large distance of the lake from the Amazon River main channel. Consequently, our study shows that the sedimentation processes of OM in Amazonian floodplain lakes were strongly influenced by variations in the hydrodynamic regime of the Amazon River during the Holocene. However, the impacts of the variations on the three floodplain lakes were different depending on the distance of each lake from the main channel of the Amazon River.",

The Landsat data record includes regular 16-day acquisitions for the conterminous US and a few other regions since 1984 and regular 16-day acquisitions for most other land areas since 2013. These data can provide unique information regarding the spatial and temporal distribution of snow cover, particularly in mountainous environments where substantial snow cover heterogeneity is common at scales finer than 1 km. The USGS Landsat snow covered area science data product maps per-pixel snow cover fraction, often referred to as fractional snow covered area (fSCA), and will be available on-demand for nearly all Landsat scenes acquired since 1984. Fractional snow covered area is computed from Landsat surface reflectance data using TMSCAG, a spectral unmixing approach that also provides vegetation and rock/soil fractions for each pixel. In addition to the standard, sensor-viewable fSCA product, vegetation fraction is also used to produce a canopy-adjusted fSCA product. Early validation results indicate good agreement between Landsat-derived fSCA and fSCA computed from high spatial resolution imagery as well as from in situ sensor arrays. Data from sensor arrays also indicate the canopy adjustment approach substantially improves agreement between Landsat-derived fSCA and in situ fSCA in areas with forest cover. A comprehensive validation effort currently underway will provide a more complete assessment of product accuracy across a wide range of snow conditions and land cover types. An alternative cloud mask provided also facilitates the use of Landsat snow covered area data in mountainous regions with mixtures of snow, rock, and vegetation where existing cloud masking approaches often result in false identification of cloud cover. The availability of the Landsat-derived snow covered area dataset presents the opportunity for new analysis of spatial and temporal snow cover variability at higher spatial resolutions and over a longer period of record than has previously been possible.",

            "abstract": "The Australian-Antarctic Ridge (AAR) is located between the Australian-Antarctic Discordance (AAD) of the Southeast Indian ridge (SEIR) in the west and Pacific-Antarctic Ridge (PAR) in the east. The AAR has intermediate spreading rate (~70 mm/yr) and consists of a series of 1st order segments bounded by parallel transform faults. KR1, a southernmost segment (63°S) of the AAR, is a 300-km-long super-segment with shallow axial depth (~2000 m). KR1 is bounded by the Macquarie transform fault in the east and the Balleney transform fault in the west, which connects KR1 with KR2 at ~ 200 km north. KR2 is 180 km long with axial depth (~2300 m) deeper than KR1. Both KR1 and KR2 are shallow relative to global mid-ocean ridges. Most of the basaltic rocks from the two segments show enriched geochemical characteristics that differ from both the AAD (Southeast Indian Ridge) and the PAR. La/Sm ratios vary from N-MORB to T-MORB; however, K2O/Nb ratios of all samples are consistently low like OIB. Their Pb isotopes are mostly more radiogenic than the N-MORB samples from PAR (and EPR) and SEIR, with 206Pb/204Pb mostly >18.6. At a given 206Pb/204Pb, their 87Sr/86Sr are higher than the PAR, but lower than the SEIR. The basalts from the two segments are geochemically similar to Cenozoic volcanoes erupted on southeast Australia, Zealandia and northwest Antarctica, suggesting a genetic relationship. According to tectonic reconstruction models, these three continents were originally joined, but separated from each other after ~80 Ma. Notably, the KR1 and KR2 segments are located at the boundary of this continental separation. The ages of Cenozoic volcanoes span from ~ 60 Ma to the recent, and the volcanoes might be related to a plume head that caused the breakup of the continents. Seismic tomography studies show that there is a low velocity zone (LVZ) in the shallow mantle (> 250 km) between Antarctica and Australia where the AAR is located. The AAR would be sampling this LVZ, and this implies that plume-like material is distributed at a 3,500 km scale in the shallow depths of the mantle. Such large-scale mantle anomaly in the Southern Ocean is of similar size to proposed “super-swells” beneath Africa and the South Pacific Ocean.",

            "abstract": "The ability of soil to infiltrate large volumes of water is fundamental to managed aquifer recharge (MAR) when using infiltration basins or agricultural fields. In order to investigate the feasibility of using agricultural fields for MAR we conducted a field experiment designed to not only assess the resilience of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) to large (\u0007300 mm\b), short duration (1.5 hour), repeated irrigation events during the winter but also how crop resilience was influenced by soil water movement. We hypothesized that large irrigation amounts designed for groundwater recharge could cause prolonged saturated conditions in the root-zone and yield loss. Tensiometers were installed at two depths (60 and 150 cm) in a loam soil to monitor the changes in soil matric potential within and below the root-zone following irrigation events in each of five experimental plots (8 x 16 m2). To simulate the individual infiltration events we employed the HYDRUS-1D computational module (Simunek et al., 2005) and compared the finite-water content vadose zone flow method (Ogden et al. 2015) with numerical solutions to the Richards' equation. For both models we assumed a homogenous and isotropic root zone that is initially unsaturated with no water flow. \u0007 \b\u0007\u0007Here we assess the ability of these two models to account for the control volume applied to the plots and to capture sharp changes in matric potential that were observed in the early time after an irrigation pulse. The goodness-of-fit of the models was evaluated using the root mean square error (RMSE) for observed and predicted values of cumulative infiltration over time, wetting front depth over time and water content at observation nodes. \b\bFor the finite-water content method, the RMSE values and output for observation nodes were similar to that from the HYDRUS-1D solution. This indicates that the finite-water content method may be useful for predicting the fate of large volumes of water applied for MAR. Moreover, both models suggest a relatively short residence time of that water in the soil profile which may explain the lack of observed deleterious effects on the crop.",

            "abstract": "The roughness of fault surfaces is the fingerprint of past slip events and a major parameter controlling the resistance to slip. The most obvious slip indicator and record of tractions are the grooves and striations with elongate axes in the direction of slip. We focus on this roughness feature by analyzing the micro-roughness of slip surfaces from natural and experimental fault zones at scales of several millimeters down to one micron. For each topographic map acquired by White Light Interferometry, an average Fourier spectrum is computed in the slip parallel and slip perpendicular direction seeking to define the scale dependence of the roughness anisotropy. We show that natural and experimental fault surfaces have a minimum scale of grooving at 4-500 micrometers. Below this scale, fault surfaces are isotropic. We have systematically measured this minimum scale of grooving on 42 topographic maps of eight different natural fault zones and 25 topographic maps of nine experimental fault zones. Our results are interpreted in terms of the aspect ratio H/L with H the average asperity height and L the observation scale. This aspect ratio is proportional to the strain necessary to completely flatten the asperities. H/L systematically increases with the decreasing of L. The transition between anisotropic and isotropic is well predicted by a critical aspect ratio. With the scale of observation decreasing the grooves become steeper and once they reach a critical aspect ratio they fail. At all scales, evidence of failure of the slip surfaces are observed and we interpret the minimum scale of grooving as a manifestation of the change in deformation mode from brittle- to plastic-dominated. As the scale of observation decreases, the aspect ratio of the grooves increases and the resulting higher stress concentrations at micro-asperities favor plasticity. The transition is dependent on the rock properties and faulting history, and for each fault one unique critical aspect ratio (between 0.1-8%) maps the transition scale. This transition in deformation mode will control the asperity distribution and therefore be an important factor in controlling the frictional strength. The observations underline the crucial role that plasticity might play at the micrometer scale in controlling sudden large-scale brittle failures along faults.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU.Poster.SStrand.pdf\nThe state of permafrost in a given area is dependent on heat balance, which is largely controlled by major trends in climate. However, smaller-scale meteorological events can impact the thermal regime as well, depending on a number of ground surface factors. This project investigates the impact of short-term meteorological fluctuations on near-surface ground temperatures in central Spitsbergen, Svalbard, and identifies the depths at which these changes are perceptible. The Svalbard archipelago is subject to significant air temperature fluctuations due to its maritime climate; this can result in wintertime rain events. Even when snow is present, rain has the potential to notably affect near-surface ground temperatures. A few studies have examined Svalbard ground temperatures during specific wintertime warm periods, but no previous research has utilized the available long-term active layer and permafrost temperature data to compare distinct events. Though summer air temperatures on Svalbard are more stable, particularly warm intervals alter active layer thaw progression. By comparing high-resolution air temperature data with high-resolution ground temperature data, the temporal and spatial impact of short-term meteorological fluctuations is assessed and compared between sites from varying locations and lithology.",

Although WHAM is primarily used for making observations of the interstellar medium, the terrestrial emission present in each of WHAM’s astronomical spectra offers a rich resource for studying the Earth’s atmosphere. Here we present an overview of the terrestrial Balmer-alpha emission collected during WHAM’s first five years of operation under southern skies. Seasonal trends and comparisons with northern hemisphere observations will be discussed. WHAM can detect Balmer-alpha emission as faint as 0.05R in a 30s exposure, covering a 200 km/s (4.4 Angstrom) spectral region with 12 km/s spectral resolution from a 1 degree beam on the sky. With this sensitivity, hundreds of spectra can be collected in a single clear night. Although not capable of fully resolving the geocoronal Balmer-alpha line profile itself, WHAM’s sensitivity makes it an exceptional instrument for geocoronal Balmer-alpha intensity observations.

            "abstract": "Mars lacks an intrinsic dipole magnetic field, creating a scenario where the solar wind directly interacts with the upper atmosphere and newly created ions can be picked up and swept away by the background convection electric field. These pick-up ions can directly escape or precipitate back into the atmosphere and induce atmospheric sputtering of neutrals. Sputtering is believed to be one of the main drivers of atmospheric escape during the early epochs of our solar system when the solar activity and EUV intensities were much higher than the present day. Using the March 8th ICME event and other extreme solar wind events, we simulate three phases of the Mars-solar wind interaction using fluid and kinetic models and compare the predicted heavy ion precipitation with MAVEN observations in order to derive heavy ion precipitation and the first set of data-based sputtering rates. The fluid model reproduces the observed features in the solar wind density, velocity and magnetic field seen along the MAVEN orbit during the March 8th ICME event, and the subsequent precipitation shows strong agreement with other published predictions of sputtering in extreme conditions.",

Recent work shows that at short lead times (typically up to a few months), hydrologic forecast skill is mostly controlled by hydrologic initial conditions (primarily soil moisture and where and when relevant, snow water storage), but at longer lead times, climate forecast skill dominates. Unfortunately, aside from a few special situations, climate forecast skill for lead times beyond about a month is minimal. Therefore, for practical purposes, hydrological initial conditions are the primary source of hydrological forecast skill. This is the premise of the widely used Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) method. I also investigate barriers to the use of seasonal hydrological forecasts in water resource systems operation. I review in particular work approximately a decade ago by Maurer, which casts light on the potential for improved reservoir system operations through improved forecasts as a function of the usable reservoir storage relative to the mean annual inflow, relative to the simplest forecast (climatology). In general, the potential economic benefits of improved forecasts are largest for relatively small reservoirs.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) deposition is one of the primary threats to plant biodiversity world-wide after habitat destruction and climate change. As a primary limiting nutrient and contributor to soil acidification, N inputs have the capacity to alter ecosystems through several mechanisms. Up until now, there was very little detailed information on the impacts from this stressor at the species level, or how climate and edaphic factors could alter ecosystem sensitivity. Here we summarize and synthesize four major efforts, funded by EPA, USGS, USFS, and the NPS, which greatly advance our understanding of this stressor. These include (1) a national analysis of sensitivity to N deposition for 114 tree species, (2) a national analysis of impacts from N deposition on herbaceous species and how climate and soil factors modify that sensitivity, (3) a regional dynamic modeling study of impacts and recovery from N and S deposition for a dominant northeastern forest type under a range of future climate and deposition scenarios, and (4) a large assessment of impacts to streams, soils, and vegetation along the 2000+ mile stretch of the Appalachian Trail.\nHere we show many responses to this stressor for all taxonomic groups, with some species decreasing, some increasing, and some unaffected by N deposition. However, dozens of tree and herb species are negatively affected and are of particular concern for conservation purposes, with vulnerability being greatly affected by regional climate and local edaphic factors. Dynamic modeling suggests that, at least in some northeastern forests, recovery across a broad range of climate change and management scenarios is unlikely by 2100. The study along the Appalachian Trail, a beloved national recreation trail, echoes these findings, with stream, soils, and vegetation impacted across large percentages of sites, and only moderate capacity for recovery by 2100. In total, this work highlights several recent advances in the area of critical loads research for N and S deposition, and discusses the importance of strengthening national air policies to protect natural environments.",

            "abstract": "Soil genesis is a coupled hydrologic and biogeochemical process that involves the interaction of weathering rock surfaces and water. Due to strong nonlinear coupling, it is extremely difficult to predict biogeochemical changes from hydrological modeling in natural field systems. A fully controlled and monitored system with known initial conditions could be utilized to isolate variables and simplify these natural processes.\nTo investigate the initial weathering of host rock to soil, we employed a 10° sloping soil lysimeter containing one cubic meter of crushed and homogenized basaltic rock. A major experiment of the Periodic Tracer Hierarchy (PERTH) method (Harman and Kim, 2014) coupled with its bonus experiment were performed in the past two years. These experimental applications successfully described the transit-time distribution (TTD) of a tracer-enriched water breakthrough curve in this unique hydrological system (Harman, 2015). With intensive irrigation and high volume of water storage throughout the experiments, rapid biological changes have been observed on the soil surface, such as algal and grass growth. These observations imply that geochemical hotspots may be established within the soil lysimeter. To understand the detailed 2D spatial distribution of biogeochemical changes, 100 selected and undisturbed soil blocks, among a total 1000 sub-gridded equal sized, are tested with several geochemical tools. Each selected soil block was subjected to elemental analysis by pXRF to determine if elemental migration is detectable in the dynamic proto-soil development. Synchrotron XRD quantification with Reitveld refinement will follow to clarify mineralogical transformations in the soil blocks. The combined techniques aim to confirm the development of geochemical hotspots; and link these findings with previous hydrological findings from the PERTH experiment as well as other hydrological modeling, such as conducted with Hydrus and CATHY. This work provides insight to the detailed correlations between hydrological and biogeochemical processes during incipient soil formation, as well as aiding the development of advanced tools and methods to study complex Earth-system dynamics.",

            "abstract": "The onset of the runaway greenhouse of water vapor is one of the important criteria defining the inner edge of the habitable zone, and has been extensively studied in one-dimensional (1D) radiative-convective models. One limitation of 1D simulations is the assumption of the fully saturated troposphere. In the real atmosphere, sub-saturated regions are created by the large-scale subsidence of air. These regions significantly delay the onset of the runaway greenhouse by playing the role of “radiator fins” that allow more infrared radiation escaping the planet. Here, we show that the degree of sub-saturation in the atmosphere strongly depends on the mass of background non-condensable component (e.g., N2) in an idealized three-dimensional general circulation model (3D GCM). We specially develop the GCM to simulate the climate dynamics of water-rich atmospheres, based on the GFDL finite-volume dynamical core, a two-stream gray-radiation scheme and an energy-conserving convection scheme. Numerical simulation shows that the mid-troposphere becomes more saturated by reducing the background partial pressure from 105 Pa to 500 Pa. The increase in relative humidity can be explained by the increase in static stability of the atmosphere when water vapor becomes dominated. In general, the mass of the background non-condensable components on potentially habitable planets could be regulated by many processes including the volcanic outgassing, stellar wind and impact erosion. These processes may also play an important role in determining the inner edge of the habitable zone besides the stellar spectral type and planetary rotation.",

Away from the equator, this implies convergence of the Eulerian mean meridional flow in zones (anticyclonic shear) and divergence in belts (cyclonic shear). It suggests lower-tropospheric downwelling in zones and upwelling in belts because the mean meridional circulation almost certainly closes at depth. Yet the banded structure of Jupiter's clouds and hazes suggests that there is upwelling in the brighter zones and downwelling in the darker belts. Here we show that this apparent contradiction can be resolved by considering not the Eulerian but the transformed Eulerian mean circulation, which includes a Stokes drift owing to eddies and is a better approximation of the Lagrangian mean transport of tracers such as ammonia. The structure of the potential vorticity inferred from observations paired with mixing length arguments suggests that there is transformed Eulerian mean upwelling in zones and downwelling in belts, and that this transformed Eulerian mean flow is about an order of magnitude stronger than the Eulerian mean flow. Simulations with a general circulation model of Jupiter's upper atmosphere demonstrate the plausibility of these inferences.",

Winter lake ice regimes (floating-ice or bedfast-ice conditions) determine whether lakes develop and maintain taliks and can support overwintering fish habitat. Lake ice thickness is a key variable determining whether a lake has a bedfast or floating-ice regime. Recent observations suggest a trend towards more lakes with floating-ice conditions due to thinner ice growth, but the broader scale associated climate conditions driving these regime shift are less certain. This study finds that the changing arctic summer/fall sea ice conditions might be affecting lake ice thickness on the North Slope. Late ocean freeze-up near the Alaskan coast leads to warmer weather and more snowfall in the early winter. Warmer early winters and thicker snowpack result in thinner lake ice the following winter thus potentially developing more ice-floating lakes before the start of the summer. Experiments with a regional atmospheric model WRF for two years with very different sea ice conditions indicate that the extent of open water next to the North Slope is a crucial factor for developing thicker snowpack, also warmer air temperature in early winter.",

Our current understanding of quartz rheology is derived primarily from studies of polycrystalline quartz and little is known about the temperature, strain rate, or water dependence of the individual quartz slip systems.\nIn order to better understand the rheology of quartz slip systems, we have deformed synthetic quartz single crystals with the prism <a> oriented at 45° to the compression direction (⊥m orientation). We converted the gel-type water found in synthetic quartz crystals to free water fluid inclusions, similar to water observed in milky quartz crystals, by annealing the crystals at 900°C/0.1 MPa for 24 hours. The single crystals were deformed at a confining pressure of 1.5 GPa with temperatures of 850 to 1000°C and strain rates of 10-6 to 10-4/s.\nFTIR measurements of water concentrations in the starting material, annealed synthetic crystals and deformed synthetic quartz crystals indicate that the water concentrations (125-300 H/106Si) are not affected by the annealing process or deformation. However, the spectra in the annealed and deformed samples are similar to those of natural milky quartz rather than those of synthetic quartz. Results of temperature and strain rate stepping experiments indicate that the strength of the crystals decreases with increasing temperature and/or decreasing strain rate. Undulatory extinction is the predominant microstructure observed in deformed samples, which is consistent with deformation by dislocation creep. The strength of the ⊥m oriented quartz crystals deformed in this study with free water is greater than those of the studies of synthetic quartz with gel type water (Linker and Kirby, 1981 and Muto et al., 2011).",

            "abstract": "Cloud, aerosol and precipitation processes play a fundamental role in the water and energy cycle. It is critical to accurately represent these microphysical processes in numerical models if we are to better predict cloud and precipitation properties on weather through climate timescales. Much has been learned about cloud properties and precipitation characteristics from NASA satellite missions such as TRMM, CloudSat, and more recently GPM. Furthermore, data from these missions have been successfully utilized in evaluating the microphysical schemes in cloud-resolving models (CRMs) and global models. However, there are still many uncertainties associated with these microphysics schemes. These uncertainties can be attributed, at least in part, to the fact that microphysical processes cannot be directly observed or measured, but instead have to be inferred from those cloud properties that can be measured. Evaluation of microphysical parameterizations are becoming increasingly important as enhanced computational capabilities are facilitating the use of more sophisticated schemes in CRMs, and as future global models are being run on what has traditionally been regarded as cloud-resolving scales using CRM microphysical schemes.\nIn this talk we will demonstrate how TRMM, CloudSat and GPM data have been used to evaluate different aspects of current CRM microphysical schemes, providing examples of where these approaches have been successful. We will also highlight CRM microphysical processes that have not been well evaluated and suggest approaches for addressing such issues. Finally, we will introduce a potential NASA satellite mission, the Cloud and Precipitation Processes Mission (CAPPM), which would facilitate the development and evaluation of different microphysical-dynamical feedbacks in numerical models.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_Poster_2015.pdf\nThe impact of climate change on spring phenology depends on many variables that cannot be separated using current models. Phenology can influence carbon sequestration, plant nutrition, forest health, and species distributions. Leaf phenology is sensitive to changes of environmental factors, including climate, species composition, latitude, and solar radiation. The many variables and their interactions frustrate efforts to attribute variation to climate change. We developed a Bayesian framework to quantify the influence of environment on the speed of forest green-up. This study presents a state-space hierarchical model to infer and predict change in forest greenness over time using satellite observations and ground measurements. The framework accommodates both observation and process errors and it allows for main effects of variables and their interactions. We used daily spaceborne remotely sensed data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to quantify temporal variability in the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) along a habitat gradient in the Southeastern United States. The ground measurements of meteorological parameters are obtained from study sites located in the Appalachian Mountains, the Piedmont and the Atlantic Coastal Plain between years 2000 and 2015. Results suggest that warming accelerates spring green-up in the Coastal Plain to a greater degree than in the Piedmont and Appalachian. In other words, regardless of variation in the timing of spring onset, the rate of greenness in non-coastal zones decreases with increasing temperature and hence with time over the spring transitional period. However, in coastal zones, as air temperature increases, leaf expansion becomes faster. This may indicate relative vulnerability to warming in non-coastal regions where moisture could be a limiting factor, whereas high temperatures in regions close to the coast enhance forest physiological activities. Model predictions agree with the remotely sensed observations of the enhanced vegetation index. These findings could be used in forest managements for identifying vulnerable forests based on their habitat type and hydrological status.",

Agricultural solutions to address soil degradation and crop water stress are needed to combat this increasingly difficult situation. Significant differences in crop success have been observed in peanut and millet grown in association with two native evergreen shrubs Piliostigma reticulatum, and Guiera senegalensis at the sites of Nioro du Rip and Keur Matar, respectively. We investigate how farmers can increase crop productivity by capitalizing on the evolutionary adaptation of native shrubs to the harsh Sudano-Sahelian environment as well as the physical mechanisms at work in the system that can lead to more robust yields. Soil moisture, transpiration rate, crop growth and soil and leaf water potential data were collected during a dry season millet irrigation experiment where stress was imposed in the intercropped system. Despite lower soil moisture content, crops grown in association with shrubs have increased biomass production and a faster development cycle. An isotopic tracer study investigating hydraulic redistribution was carried out by injecting deuterated water into the roots of three shrubs at one meter depth and sampling shrubs and nearby crops for isotopic analysis of plant water. Deuterium Enriched water was found in the shrubs of two out of three plots. Deuterium enriched water was found in the crops and shrubs in all three plots. These findings build on work that was completed in 2004 at the site, but point to larger differences in crop growth and strong evidence for the sharing of hydraulically redistributed water. Using even the limited resources that farmers possess, this agroforestry technique can be expanded over wide swaths of the Sahel.",

We employ a variety of techniques to characterize its morphology. Digital terrain modeling (DTM), indispensable for quantitative morphological analysis is performed using stereophotoclinometry (SPC). Depending upon the observational coverage, the resolution of the DTMs exceeds 1 m in the most favorable cases. The ultimate stereographic analysis is performed by exploiting pairs of images able to produce anaglyphs whose spatial resolution surpasses that of the DTMs. Digital image filtering and contrast enhancement techniques are applied on the original images as appropriate. We first concentrate on the dust covered terrains possibly resulting from airfall deposits, on the quasi circular depressions or basins possibly connected to collapses of the underground terrain, and on large scarps that suggest extensive mass disruption. We pay special attention to lithologies that may give clues to the subsurface structure of the nucleus. Our ultimate goal is to understand the processes at work on the nucleus, directly or indirectly connected to its activity as there appears to a variety of processes far beyond what was classically considered in the past, for instance airfall deposits, surface dust transport, mass wasting, and insolation weathering.",

The peat carbon storage results from the progressive accumulation of organic matter since the end of the last glaciation (~10 000 years). The stability of these large carbon storages, under the influence of climate change, is unknown. Runoff represents one of the major C fluxes out of northern peatlands, and is particularly sensitive to changes in climate and hydrological regimes. Identifying the sources and age of aquatic C export will help assess the stability and future role of northern peatlands as active components of the global C cycle. We have characterized both radiogenic (14C) and stable carbon isotopes (δ13C) of DOC, CO2 and CH4 across a four-meter deep ombrotrophic peatland and its stream outlet. Previous studies have shown that about 34% of the estimated net ecosystem exchange from this peatland system, is lost through aquatic C export. We determined that fermentation processes in the peat acts as the main production pathway for stream CO2 (mean δ13C =-4.9‰) and CH4 (mean δ13C = -67.8‰). The seasonal variability in both sources and age of C was high. Despite this dynamism, the application of carbon isotopes allowed us to trace back the origin of aquatic C exports from the peatland.",

The small-scale fluctuating dynamics are described by a magnetically-modified quasi-geostrophic equation set, and the large-scale mean dynamics are governed by a diagnostic thermal wind balance. The model utilizes three timescales that respectively characterize the convective timescale, the large-scale magnetic evolution timescale, and the large-scale thermal evolution timescale. Distinct equations are derived for the cases of order one and low magnetic Prandtl number. It is shown that the low magnetic Prandtl number model is characterized by a magnetic to kinetic energy ratio that is asymptotically large, with ohmic dissipation dominating viscous dissipation on the large-scales. For the order one magnetic Prandtl number model the magnetic and kinetic energies are equipartitioned and both ohmic and viscous dissipation are weak on the large-scales; large-scale ohmic dissipation occurs in thin magnetic boundary layers adjacent to the horizontal boundaries. The new models provide a new theoretical framework for understanding the dynamics of convection-driven dynamos in regimes that are only just becoming accessible to direct numerical simulations.",

Many studies, among global and regional models have been used to simulate climatic impact due to deforestation. Most of them used relatively coarse resolution, small domains over South America, besides do not consider deforestation as usually observed. In order to verify the RegCM3 ability to simulate climate impacts due to Amazon deforestation including relatively higher horizontal resolutions, 50 km, a larger domain, the whole South America, deforested areas more similar to the route-shaped commonly seen, and a landuse updating, the model was run for the 2001-2006 period. As the major part of the previous studies focusing Amazon deforestation, RegCM3-50km simulated over degraded areas air temperature increase, ranging from 1.0 to 2.5oC, and precipitation decreasing, ~10%. These aspects are mainly resulting from soil water depletion and roughness vegetation decreasing, both inhibiting evapotranspiration processes. Apart from these results, the model with 50 km simulated precipitation increasing, ~10%, over the eastern South America and adjacent South Atlantic ocean, after Amazon deforestation. Seeking for physical related reasons able to provide the precipitation increasing during rainy seasons, over eastern South America, we found out that upper levels high pressure system (the Bolivian High) intensification, coupled to the southeastward trough, what follows the low troposphere warming, seems to contribute to the precipitation increasing. The climatic impact simulated for winter seasons presents strongest values for areas with altered landuse, over the north region of South America.",

            "abstract": "Characterizing the interplay between urbanization, energy production, and water resources is essential for ensuring sustainable population growth. In order to balance limited water supplies, competing users must account for their realized and virtual water footprint, i.e. the total direct and indirect amount of water used, respectively. Unfortunately, publicly reported US water use estimates are spatially coarse, temporally static, and completely ignore returns of water to rivers after use. These estimates are insufficient to account for the high spatial and temporal heterogeneity of water budgets in urbanizing systems. Likewise, urbanizing areas are supported by competing sources of energy production, which also have heterogeneous water footprints. Hence, a fundamental challenge of planning for sustainable urban growth and decision-making across disparate policy sectors lies in characterizing inter-dependencies among urban systems, energy producers, and water resources. A modeling framework is presented that provides a novel approach to integrate urban-energy infrastructure into a spatial accounting network that accurately measures water footprints as changes in the quantity and quality of river flows. River networks (RNs), i.e. networks of branching tributaries nested within larger rivers, provide a spatial structure to measure water budgets by modeling hydrology and accounting for use and returns from urbanizing areas and energy producers. We quantify urban-energy water footprints for Atlanta, GA and Knoxville, TN (USA) based on changes in hydrology in RNs. Although water intakes providing supply to metropolitan areas were proximate to metropolitan areas, power plants contributing to energy demand in Knoxville and Atlanta, occurred 30 and 90km outside the metropolitan boundary, respectively. Direct water footprints from urban landcover primarily comprised smaller streams whereas indirect footprints from water supply reservoirs and energy producers included larger river systems. By using projections in urban populations for 2030 and 2050, we estimated scenarios of expansion in water footprints depending on urban growth policies and energy production technology. We provide examples of how this framework can be used to minimize water footprints and impacts to aquatic biodiversity.",

These plumes were identified using the following criteria: (1) 5-minute ambient aerosol scattering σsp ≥ 20 Mm-1 for at least two hours, (2) 5-minute CO ≥ 150 ppbv for at least two hours, (3) strong correlation (r2 ≥ 0.70) between σsp and CO, and (4) consistent air mass back trajectories indicating transport over known fire locations.\nWe measure nitrogen oxides using a chemiluminescence detector and jNO2 photolysis using a diode array actinic flux spectroradiometer. We also measure O3 using two techniques: (a) UV method with a cavity ring-down spectrometer and (b) chemiluminescence method with a custom-made instrument. We compare fire event observations between these two procedures to prove consistency.\nBased on these measurements, we quantify a lower bound for the HO2 and RO2 radical concentrations in wildfire plumes. We then look at plume and non-plume data and examine deviations from the photostationary state. Finally, we use the TUV model v5.2 to simulate clear-sky conditions and therefore quantify the reduction/enhancement in jNO2 values and O3 production due to wildfire aerosols.

We have developed a chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) that can detect amines and ammonia at the pptv and sub-pptv level with a 1 min of integration time. Here, we report ambient measurements of amines and ammonia made in a moderately polluted continental site (Kent, Ohio) and in a rural Southeastern U.S. forest (Centreville, Alabama). Our finding indicate that there are much more abundant gas phase amines (C1-C6) and ammonia in the polluted site than in the rural forest, highlighting the importance of constraining anthropogenic emission sources of amines. At both locations, concentrations of these base compounds show clear temperature dependence, indicating strong gas-to-particle conversion processes. Compared to ammonia, amines can partition into aerosol phases even more effectively due to lower saturation vapor pressures. Measurements in the clean rural forest show that transported biomass burning plumes are the major source of amines.

            "abstract": "Icy and rocky satellites of our solar system display a wide range of geological deformation on their surfaces. Some are old and heavily cratered while other are observed to be presently active. Many of the potential sources of stress which can deform satellites are tied to the tidal deformation the moons experience as they orbit their parent planets. Other plausible sources of global-scale stress include a change in orbital parameters, nonsynchronous rotation, or volume change induced by the melting or freezing of a subsurface layer. We turn to computer modeling to correlate observed geologic features to the possible stresses that created them. One model is the SatStress open-source program developed by Z. Selvans (Wahr et al.,2009) to compute viscoelastic diurnal and nonsynchronous rotation stresses using a four-layer viscoelastic satellite model. Kay and Katternhorn (2010) expanded on this work by developing SatStressGUI, which integrated SatStress’s original features into a graphical user interface. SatStressGUI computes stress vectors and Love numbers, and generates stress plots and lineaments. We have expanded on SatStressGUI by adding features such as the ability to generate cycloid-style lineaments, calculate stresses resulting from obliquity, and more efficient batch the processing of data. Users may also define their own Love numbers to propagate through further calculations. Here we demonstrate our recent enhancements to SatStressGUI and its abilities, by comparing observed features on Enceladus and Europa to modeled diurnal, nonsynchronous, and obliquity stresses.",

            "abstract": "Public speaking organizations are highly valuable for individuals seeking to improve their skills in speech development and delivery. The methodology of such groups usually focuses on repetitive, guided practice. Toastmasters International, for instance, uses a curriculum based on topical manuals that guide their members through some number of prepared speeches with specific goals for each speech. I have similarly developed a public speaking manual for scientists with the intention of guiding scientists through the development and presentation of speeches that will help them hone their abilities as public speakers. I call this guide The Oratorical Scientist.\nThe Oratorical Scientist will be a free, digital publication that is meant to guide scientists through five specific types of speech that the scientist may be called upon to deliver during their career. These five speeches are: The Coffee Talk, The Educational Talk, Research Talks for General Science Audiences, Research Talks for Specific Subdiscipline Audiences, and Taking the Big Stage (talks for public engagement). Each section of the manual focuses on speech development, rehearsal, and presentation for each of these specific types of speech. The curriculum was developed primarily from my personal experiences in public engagement. Individuals who use the manual may deliver their prepared speeches to groups of their peers (e.g. within their research group) or through video sharing websites like Youtube and Vimeo. Speeches that are broadcast online can then be followed and shared through social media networks (e.g. #OratoricalScientist), allowing a larger audience to evaluate the speech and to provide criticism.\nI will present The Oratorical Scientist, a guide for scientists to become better public speakers. The process of guided repetitive practice of scientific talks will improve the speaking capabilities of scientists, in turn benefitting science communication and public engagement.",

The model output will in turn be used to determine the expected auroral intensities (in Rayleighs) when considering only the primary precipitating electrons and also when both the primary and mirroring secondary electrons are included. These predicted auroral intensities will be compared to measured ones from several ground-based imagers at Poker Flat, AK, where we have high-resolution multiple emission line (557.7 nm and 427.8 nm) data at a 3.3 Hz frame rate.",

            "abstract": "In the past decade, large and dense seismic arrays have been deployed across much of eastern Asia (e.g., the “CEArray” and the “China Array” deployed by the China Earthquake Administration (CEA), the NECESS Array deployed collaboratively by China, Japan and the US, Korean Seismic Network, KNET and other networks in Japan, and historical PASSCAL installations), which have been used to produce increasingly well resolved models of the crust and uppermost mantle at different length scales. These models, however, do not cover eastern Asia uniformly. In this presentation, we report on an effort to generate a uniform high resolution 3-D model of the crust and uppermost mantle beneath eastern Asia using state-of-art surface wave and body wave inversion techniques. Highlights of this effort include: 1) We collect ambient noise cross-correlations using more than 1,800 seismic stations from multiple seismic arrays in this area and perform uniform surface wave tomography for the study area. 2) We collect P-wave receiver functions for over 1,000 stations and Rayleigh wave H/V ratio measurements for over 200 stations in this area. 3) We adopt a Bayesian Monte Carlo inversion to the Rayleigh wave dispersion maps and produce a uniform 3-D model with uncertainties of the crust and uppermost mantle. 4) In the areas where receiver functions and/or Rayleigh wave H/V ratios are collected, we replace the surface wave inversion by a joint inversion of surface waves and these seismic observables. The resulting model displays a great variety and considerable richness of geological and tectonic features in the crust and in the uppermost mantle which we summarize and discuss with focus on the relationship between the observed crustal variations and tectonic/geological boundaries and lithospheric modifications associated with volcanism in Northeast China.",

            "abstract": "Green infrastructure (GI) is growing in popularity, but we are failing to remove nutrients and are missing the target to protect water quality. GI has shown mixed abilities to reduce N, and alarmingly export N in some conditions. The goal of this project was to investigate the microbial processes controlling N cycling (mainly denitrification) within stormwater basins and how these processes influence water quality.\nWe examined two stormwater basins in Ithaca, NY; one slow draining ‘wet’ site and one quick draining ‘dry’ site. Multiple lines of evidence were used to investigate N cycling within these systems: (1) metagenomics investigation of functional genes, (2) water quality field monitoring, and (3) denitrification lab-scale assays. Water quality monitoring was paired with microbial functional genes; differences in N reductions within the basins were related to N cycling genes. To determine if influent stormwater pollutants affect denitrification, a controlled field manipulation experiment was also conducted. Soil from each site, and a control site without stormwater influence, were exchanged. Potential denitrification was measured weekly via denitrification enzyme assay (DEA).\nSoil DNA was sent for sequencing on July 27, 2015; results are expected in September 2015. The stormwater effects on denitrification using the exchanged soils is ongoing until September 8, 2015. Preliminary results show the wet site has considerably higher denitrification potential compared to the dry site, 2.00 and 0.27 mg N kg-1 hr-1, respectively. Initial water quality monitoring indicate nitrate mass loads are reduced following treatment within the basin. However, nitrate concentrations remain almost constant, indicating that volume reduction, and not microbial treatment, is “removing” nitrate.",

            "abstract": "Mantle-derived volcanism on Earth’s surface is generally associated with magma generation as a consequence of volatile addition to suprasubduction zone mantle or in response to decompression melting at diverging plates or in thermochemical anomalies thought to originate deep in the convecting mantle. Many of the hotspots surrounding the northern and northwestern African margin are thought to originate from decompression melting due to upwellings from deep thermochemical anomalies. Similar compositions of lavas erupted in Sicily in the Hyblean Plateau and Mount Etna, Europe’s largest most active volcano, have been attributed to contributions from subduction zone enrichments. Considering high-MgO lavas from the northern to northwestern African-Mediterranean margins in the context of recent petrologic models we find the strong majority of the lavas in this region are predominantly alkaline and bear geochemical signatures consistent with derivation from fusible lithologies (volatilized peridotite and/or pyroxenite) [1]. Such results are consistent with implications from recent experimental results that suggest that the mobilization of hydrous, carbonate-rich melts commonly occurs during subduction zone processing [2]. Accordingly, we argue many products generally considered “hot spot” volcanism in this region largely result from partial melting of easily fusible pyroxene-rich and carbonated mantle domains that are relics of shallow-level recycling of volatile-rich melts and/or lithosphere shed during plate boundary processes along the African margin. Long-lived volcanism near continental margins subsequently develops as a consequence of convective anomalies associated with unique tectonic arrangements (oversteepened slabs or slab windows) [3] or, alternatively, as manifestations of convective tectonic anomalies beneath thin lithosphere juxtaposed next to thicker, more stable continental margins [4].\n[1] Herzberg and Asimow, 2008; [2] Poli, 2015; [3] Schellart, 2010; [4] King and Ritsema, 2000.",

In basins such as the Colorado River Basin (CRB), streamflow is not stationary but exhibits variability that reflects teleconnections with large scale climate indices such as Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). A recently developed stochastic streamflow simulation and projection model, the Wavelet K-Nearest Neighbor (WKNN) model, identifies and reconstructs dominant quasi-periodic signals in the AMO and PDO using wavelet analysis, simulates each using block K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) bootstrap, then simulates the streamflow using a K-NN bootstrap conditioned on the simulated climate forcings, and has been demonstrated to produce skillful decadal scale projections of streamflow in the CRB. The Bureau of Reclamation’s 2012 Colorado River Basin Supply and Demand Study used scenarios to explore the use of options and strategies such as infrastructure development, conservation and efficiency improvements to address supply-demand imbalances. Each year in the simulated scenarios, decision criteria such as reservoir elevations and average flows over recent years were applied to determine system vulnerability and the need to implement options and strategies to mitigate future shortages. This presentation describes the addition of the WKNN generated decadal scale flow projections to the decision criteria. In addition, periods of poor predictability are identified by using a nonlinear dynamical system based approach to recover the underlying dynamics. Time varying predictability is assessed by quantifying the divergence of trajectories in the phase space with time, using Local Lyapunov Exponents (LLE). Skillful decadal scale streamflow projections within the high predictable time epochs are used to indicate future flow conditions and improve decisions. An ensemble of projections is considered to be wet or dry based whether or not the mean exceeds some reference threshold and that information is used to constrain the decisions. Based on projections being wet, dry or unpredictable, improved decisions are shown to reduce cost or reduce shortage and are illustrated by tradeoff curves of risk of shortage vs. cost.",

The chemical pathways leading to haze formation and the resulting haze optical properties are still highly uncertain. Here we examine the compositional and optical properties of Titan haze aerosol analogs. By studying these properties together, the impact of haze on Titan's radiative balance can be better understood. The aerosol analogs studied are produced from different initial methane concentrations (0.1, 2 and 10% CH4) using spark discharge excitation. To determine the complex refractive index of the aerosol, we combine two spectroscopic techniques, one that measures absorption and one that measures extinction: photoacoustic spectroscopy coupled with cavity ring-down spectroscopy (PASCaRD). This technique provides the benefit of a high precision determination of the imaginary component of the refractive index (k), along with the highly sensitive determination of the real component of the refractive index (n). The refractive indices are retrieved at two wavelengths, 405 and 532 nm, using the PASCaRD system. To yield aerosol composition, quadrupole aerosol mass spectrometry is used. Compositional information is obtained from a technique that uses isotopically labeled and unlabeled methane gas. I will present preliminary data on the complex refractive indices of Titan aerosol analogs at both wavelengths, in conjunction with the aerosol composition as a percent by weight of carbon, nitrogen and hydrogen. The correlation of optical and chemical properties should be useful for remote sensing instruments probing Titan haze.",

Anthropogenic Cr(VI) contamination has compromised drinking water in the alluvial aquifer underlying the town of Hinkley, CA and extensive in-situ remediation (ISR) is underway to mitigate the threat to residents. ISR capitalizes on the redox sensitivity of chromium by using ethanol to reduce soluble, toxic, Cr(VI) to insoluble and non-hazardous Cr(III). However, the sequence of reduction reactions that occurs within the aquifer is not well understood. Therefore, we use computer-modeled and experimental redox titrations to examine how pH, oxygen supply, mineral surface chemistry, agitation, and microbial activity impact the reduction of Cr(VI) by ethanol. We further use experimental titrations to confirm the validity of our modeled results. Aqueous and gaseous phases are monitored throughout the experiment to track changes in pH, dissolved oxygen, CO2, Mn(II), Fe(II), and SO42-. Aqueous Fe(II) is a dominant control on Cr(VI) reduction; thus the cycling of Fe in the system must be considered. Our modeled results show that reductive dissolution of manganese oxides and Fe(III) (oxy)hydroxides increases pH, making sulfate reduction thermodynamically favorable. Simultaneous Fe(III) and sulfate reduction allows precipitation of iron sulfide minerals, limiting the available Fe(II) to reduce Cr(VI). Computational model results indicate that elevated organic buffer (HEPES, MOPS, EPPS) concentrations are required to maintain pH values below 8.8 where simultaneous reduction of Fe(III) and SO42- during ethanol oxidation becomes thermodynamically favorable. Microbial activity within the aquifer may also play a significant role in the transfer of electrons from ethanol to the terminal electron acceptors.",

            "abstract": "The need for a better understanding of fluid and morphodynamic processes over Antarctic sea ice motivates the development of detailed models of small-scale snow-atmosphere interactions. At large scales, in fact, these interactions drive observed spatial patterns of snow distribution, ice deformation, and snow transport from the marginal ice to the sea. However, challenges arise when representing the detailed sequence of processes involved, such as aerodynamic entrainment, particle dynamics, feedback on fluid momentum and particle impact on the surface. Here, we use a Lagrangian stochastic model coupled to large eddy simulations to represent particle trajectories in turbulent flows and momentum extraction caused by heavy suspended particles. An Immersed Boundary method is used to represent the underlying surface and a dynamic surface roughness model is used to account for the drag induced by the subgrid-scale roughness. The model is implemented over an Antarctic sea ice floe over which pre- and post-storm snow distributions were measured using a terrestrial laser scanner. The dataset, collected in October 2012 as part of the Sea Ice Physics and Ecosystem Experiment 2 (SIPEX-2), indicates marked changes in the snow distribution as a result of snow particle transport processes, providing valuable testing grounds for the model. Model results are in agreement with blowing snow concentrations at different heights and with the observed patterns of erosion and deposition. Conclusions with respect to larger scale sea ice drag and sea ice mass balance are drawn.",

However, our knowledge of the age of magmatism in the laterally equivalent Karakul-Mazar Terrane in the Northern Pamir is limited. While previous investigations indicate Karakul-Mazar igneous bodies have generally documented crystallization ages 225-245 Ma, detrital zircon studies of Late Triassic/Early Jurassic strata within the Northern Pamir and the Tarim Basin record a significant quantity of <220 Ma zircons (Bershaw et al., 2011) sourced from the Pamir. 6 granite samples were analyzed for zircon U-Pb and Hf isotopes, representing plutons distributed across the Chinese Pamir, to determine the distribution of crystallization ages and chemical maturity of the magma source. Analyses yielded 204 Ma and 212-214 Ma zircon U-Pb crystallization ages. The dated samples yield εHf(t) values ranging from -6.7 to 9.6. Results show that a large volume of magmatic rocks in the Northern Pamir intruded in the Late Triassic prior to closure of the Paleotethys Ocean at ~200 Ma (Angiolini et al., 2013). Weakly positive and negative εHf(t) values indicate a primitive source for the dated magmatic bodies. Additionally, compliation of previously published data with these results suggests two pulses of magmatism, ~210 Ma and 230-245 Ma respectively. Finally, Triassic igneous bodies in the Pamir show similar crystallization ages and chemical signatures compared to plutons in the Songpan-Ganzi/Hoh-Xil Terranes to the east, suggesting lateral continuity of geodynamic processes across the terrane in the Mesozoic.",

The satellite sensors analyzed here are: The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI), Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder (SSMIS) on the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program F16 and F17 satellites, and The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-2) on board the Global Change Observation Mission – Water (GCOM-W1). Satellite retrievals show an overall correlation with hourly-averaged in-situ observations of 0.86 and a positive bias of 10.0 gm2, which decreases to 1.0 gm2 and a correlation that increases to 0.91 when selecting overcast scenes. The satellite bias for broken scenes remains below 22.2 gm2, although the removal of clear-sky in-situ samples yields an unbiased relationship. Satellites produce a diurnal cycle with amplitudes (35-47 gm2) consistent with ship-based observations. Longitudinal biases remain below 17.4 gm2, and they are negligible in overcast scenes and when clear-sky samples are removed from the in-situ hourly average. Our study indicates that satellite microwave retrievals are a reliable dataset for climate studies in marine warm low clouds. The implications for satellite visible/infrared retrievals will be also discussed.",

The need for such datasets is becoming increasingly important as we try to quantify the impact of human activities across various scales and in some cases, as we try to determine the success of management interventions. Unfortunately, long-term data sets for coastal ecosystems are rare and curating them is a real challenge. However, if we wish to make our data available for interested parties (e.g., students, managers, etc.) then we need to provide mechanisms that allow others to understand our methods, access the data, reproduce the results, and see updates as they become available. Here we use techniques, learned through the EarthCube Geosoft Geoscience Paper of the Future project, to develop best practices that will allow us to share a long-term data set of directly measured net sediment N2 fluxes in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. By developing these data and software sharing tools we hope to help disseminate our data so that the community can better assess how this temperate estuary has changed overtime. We also hope to provide a model for others to follow so that long-term estuarine data is more easily shared and not lost overtime.",

While marine-sourced aerosols have been shown to make important contributions to surface aerosol loading, cloud condensation nuclei and ice nuclei concentrations over remote marine and coastal regions, it is still a challenge to differentiate the marine biogenic aerosol signal from the strong influence of continental pollution outflow. As a pre-mission analysis, we examine here the spatiotemporal variability and quantify the sources of tropospheric aerosols over the North Atlantic during November 2008 using a state-of-the-art chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). The model is driven by the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA at 2°×2.5° horizontal resolution) from the NASA Global Modeling Assimilation Office (GMAO). It includes sulfate-nitrate-ammonium aerosol thermodynamics coupled to ozone-NOx-hydrocarbon-aerosol chemistry, mineral dust, sea salt, elemental and organic carbon aerosols, especially a recently implemented parameterization for the marine primary organic aerosol emission. The simulated aerosols over the North Atlantic are evaluated with available satellite (e.g., MODIS) observations of aerosol optical depths (AOD) and surface aerosol measurements. We diagnose transport pathways for continental pollution outflow over the North Atlantic using carbon monoxide, an excellent tracer for anthropogenic pollution transport. Simulations indicate that, along the NAAMES nominal ship and flight tracks (40°W, 40-57°N), episodic pollution transport associated with frontal passages occurs at both the surface and free troposphere, with periods of relatively unperturbed marine air as indicated by simulated sea salt aerosols. We will also conduct model perturbation experiments to quantify the relative contributions of terrestrial and oceanic sources to the aerosol loading, AOD, and their variability over the North Atlantic. These simulations will provide valuable guidance to the NAAMES flight planning.",

            "abstract": "Many of the storms that generate damaging floods are caused by locally intense, sub-daily precipitation, yet the spatial and temporal resolution of the most widely available climate model outputs are both too coarse to simulate these events. Thus there is often a disconnect between the nature of the events that cause damaging floods and the models used to project how climate change might influence their magnitude. This could be a particular problem when developing scenarios to inform future stormwater management options under future climate scenarios. In this study we sought to close this gap, using sub-daily outputs from the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF) from each of the nine climate regions in the United States. Specifically, we asked 1) whether WRF outputs projected consistent patterns of change for sub-daily and daily precipitation extremes; and 2) whether this dynamically downscaled model projected different magnitudes of change for 3-hourly vs 24-hourly extreme events. We extracted annual maximum values for 3-hour through 24-hour precipitation totals from an 11-year timeseries of hindcast (1995-2005) and mid-century (2045-2055) climate, and calculated the direction and magnitude of change for 3-hour and 24-hour extreme events over this timeframe. The model results project that the magnitude of both 3-hour and 24-hour events will increase over most regions of the United States, but there was no clear or consistent difference in the relative magnitudes of change for sub-daily vs daily events.",

These continuous data have revealed a great deal about short time-scale temporal responses to environmental drivers such as soil temperature and moisture content, as well as linkages between above- and below-ground processes.\nForced Diffusion (FD) is a novel method for continuous measurement of soil respiration (Risk et al., 2011). The FD technique is functionally similar to dynamic steady-state chamber systems but uses a diffusive membrane to regulate the flow of gases rather than a pump. Measurement of soil respiration using this diffusive regulation approach has several benefits including reduced power consumption and the ability to function in harsh environments including under snow pack.\nHere we present a continuous multi-month forest soil respiration data set collected using the FD technique in Nova Scotia, Canada. Data spanning the autumn (August-December) will be presented, which includes both autotrophic senescence as well as the Atlantic hurricane season. Temporal dynamics associated with long-term and short-term temperature variability are evident in the data set, as well as multiple respiration pulse events associated with heavy rainfalls during autumnal storms. We will also demonstrate the application of a straightforward algorithm used for quality control (QC) of continuous soil respiration data. The QC technique uses a combination of predictive modeling and comparison of probability density functions (Lavoie et al., 2015) that result in robust identification of outliers in continuous soil respiration data sets.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Reanalysis_Gauge_Poster.pdf\nRain gauge networks have provided primary in situ observations of precipitation for over centuries and are widely used in meteorological and hydrological operations. In the last several decades, many new automated rain gauge networks were deployed to increase the spatial coverage and resolution of the precipitation observations. However, automated gauges are subject to a range of error sources, including clogging by clutter or frozen precipitation, undercatch in strong wind, wind turbulence, evaporative losses, double tipping of the sensor, or signal failure. Quality control of the gauge data has been a challenge, especially at hourly or sub-hourly scales. The current study takes advantage of a high-resolution, radar-based quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) and develops an automated gauge data quality control (QC) using the radar QPE and atmospheric environmental data. The gauge QC technique compares hourly gauge observations with the radar QPE and identifies five types of potentially erroneous gauge data: 1) stuck gauges; 2) false precipitation; 3) frozen gauges; 4) spurious low outlier; and 5) spurious high outlier. An 11-year dataset (2001-2011) of hourly gauge observations, including 1) Hydrometeorological Automated Data System (HADS); 2) US Climate ",

We investigated model felsic systems in this study: Ab(NaAlSi3O8)-Or(KAlSi3O8)- Qz(SiO2), Ab-Qz , and Ab. The experiments were all conducted at 1 GPa. For the first two systems, synthetic glass + H2O was homogenized well above the liquidus T, then T was lowered by increments until quartz and alkali feldspar crystalized. To establish reversed equilibrium, we crystallized the homogenized melt at the lower T, then raised the T until we found that the crystalline phases were resorbed into the liquid. For the Ab system, crystalline albite was used and the liquidus was bracketed by varying water concentration. All curves were fit with cubic equations to the experimental data, giving\n1. T(°C)= -0.063 wH2O3 + 3.892 wH2O2 - 79.217 wH2O + 1166 (Ab36.25-Or36.25-Qz27.5)\n2. T(°C)= -0.050 wH2O3 + 2.872 wH2O2 - 64.864 wH2O + 1196 (Ab72.5-Qz27.5)\n3. T(°C)= -0.021 wH2O3 + 2.224 wH2O2 - 63.188 wH2O + 1239 (Ab100)\nwhere wH2O and the dry starting mixtures are reported in weight percent. The new liquidi were combined with previous data on the melting of granite and albite in the presence of CO2-H2O fluids (Ebadi and Johannes, 1991; Eggler and Kadik,1979) and a CO2-H2O activity model (Aranovich and Newton, 1998) to derive activity-concentration relationships along the liquidi. The solubilities of CO2 in liquids and of liquids in CO2-H2O fluid were neglected. We obtain the following relationships between water activity (aH2O) and concentration along the liquidus\n4. aH2O = 0.0084 wH2O2 + 0.0117wH2O for the Ab36.25-Or36.25-Qz27.5system\n5. aH2O = 0.0028 wH2O2 + 0.0266 wH2Ofor Ab system\nThe absence of data on Ab-Qz melting with CO2-H2O fluid prevents similar analysis for this system. The equations are accurate up to ~8 wt.% water and describe a rapid rise in aH2O with increasing water content (decreasing liquidus T). At 8 wt% H2O, aH2O is 0.39 and 0.63 in albite and simple granite liquids, respectively. High water activity is consistent with abundant molecular H2O in the liquids and is necessary for critical mixing in melt-H2O systems. Our results provide a quantitative basis for understanding the chemical effects of water dissolution in felsic liquids during crustal melting.",

Biological productivity in the global ocean is often resulting in significant amounts of primary organic matter in the aerosol phase. The North Atlantic Ocean is among the most productive oceanic regions and is the most studied ocean on Earth. The Southern Ocean, on the other hand, has been far less studied, even though similar organic matter enrichment patterns have been observed in marine aerosol. While numerous processes can contribute to organic matter in marine aerosols, carbon isotope analysis offers the most unambiguous estimates of the contributing sources. The stable carbon isotope ratios in marine aerosol samples collected during austral summer of 2007 at Amsterdam Island (Southern Indian Ocean) were examined. The measured δ13C values in the fine (Da <2.5µm) and coarse (Da >2.5µm) particle fractions were found to be evenly distributed between -28.2‰ and -20.0‰. These values are far lower than the previously reported ones as typical of unperturbed marine aerosol (-20‰). The δ13C values in the fine and coarse particle fractions were correlated with organic matter enrichment in sea spray. It was attempted to explain the variation of the δ13C values by the competition of the “fresh” and “old” organic matter pools in sea water during transfer into the aerosol phase, thereby implicating trophic level interactions. The hypothetical model suggests that fresh organic matter readily results in organic matter enrichment in sea spray particles and likely contains fresh colloidal and nanogel particulate matter, while the old organic matter is largely dissolved and unable to significantly enrich sea spray. Air mass back trajectory analysis suggests that the most productive regions, where sea spray particles are the most enriched in organic matter, are associated with low sea-water temperatures around the Antarctic Circumpolar current, thereby confirming an established relationship between sea-water temperature and phytoplankton stable isotope ratios. The proposed hypothetical model offers quantitative support for processes linking ocean biology and primary marine aerosol.",

            "abstract": "Infrastructures are the result of systems, networks, and inter-networks that accrete, overlay and segment one another over time. As a result, working infrastructures represent a broad heterogeneity of elements – data types, computational resources, material substrates (computing hardware, physical infrastructure, labs, physical information resources, etc.) as well as organizational and social functions which result in divergent outputs and goals. Cyber infrastructure’s engineering often defaults to a separation of the social from the technical that results in the engineering succeeding in limited ways, or the exposure of unanticipated points of failure within the system. Studying the development of middleware intended to mediate interactions among systems within an earth systems science infrastructure exposes organizational, technical and standards-focused negotiations endemic to a fundamental trait of infrastructure: its characteristic invisibility in use. Intended to perform a core function within the EarthCube cyberinfrastructure, the development, governance and maintenance of an automated brokering system is a microcosm of large-scale infrastructural efforts. Points of potential system failure, regardless of the extent to which they are more social or more technical in nature, can be considered in terms of the reverse salient: a point of social and material configuration that momentarily lags behind the progress of an emerging or maturing infrastructure. The implementation of the BCube data broker has exposed reverse salients in regards to the overall EarthCube infrastructure (and the role of middleware brokering) in the form of organizational factors such as infrastructural alignment, maintenance and resilience; differing and incompatible practices of data discovery and evaluation among users and stakeholders; and a preponderance of local variations in the implementation of standards and authentication in data access. These issues are characterized by their role in increasing tension or friction among components that are on the path to convergence and may help to predict otherwise-occluded endogenous points of failure or non-adoption in the infrastructure.",

            "abstract": "Sample size, material properties and image resolution are all tradeoffs that must be considered when imaging porous media samples with X-ray computed tomography. In many natural and engineered samples, pore and throat sizes span several orders of magnitude and are often correlated with the material composition. Local tomography is a nondestructive technique that images a subvolume, within a larger specimen, at high resolution and uses low-resolution tomography data from the larger specimen to reduce reconstruction error. The high-resolution, subvolume data can be used to extract important fine-scale properties but, due to the additional noise associated with the truncated dataset, it makes segmentation of different materials and mineral phases a challenge. The low-resolution data of a larger specimen is typically of much higher-quality making material characterization much easier. In addition, the imaging of a larger domain, allows for mm-scale bulk properties and heterogeneities to be determined.\nIn this research, a 7 mm diameter and ~15 mm in length sandstone core was scanned twice. The first scan was performed to cover the entire diameter and length of the specimen at an image voxel resolution of 4.1 µm. The second scan was performed on a subvolume, ~1.3 mm in length and ~2.1 mm in diameter, at an image voxel resolution of 1.08 µm. After image processing and segmentation, the pore network structure and mineralogical features were extracted from the low-resolution dataset. Due to the noise in the truncated high-resolution dataset, several image processing approaches were applied prior to image segmentation and extraction of the pore network structure and mineralogy. Results from the different truncated tomography segmented data sets are compared to each other to evaluate the potential of each approach in identifying the different solid phases from the original 16 bit data set. The truncated tomography segmented data sets were also compared to the whole-core tomography segmented data set in two ways: (1) assessment of the porosity and pore size distribution at different scales; and (2) comparison of the mineralogical composition and distribution. Finally, registration of the two datasets will be used to show how the pore structure and mineralogy details at the two scales can be used to supplement each other.",

Fewer studies, however, explore the utility and feasibility of using Earth system models to generate and evaluate ecological hypotheses. Here, we assess simulations from the Community Land Model (CLM, the terrestrial component of the Community Earth System Model) configured to represent an extreme tundra environment at the Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in Colorado. The Niwot Ridge LTER has the highest continuously operating weather station in North America (‘D-1l’, 3700 m asl), with climate data extending from 1953 to present. The site also has what are believed to be the highest operating eddy-covariance towers in North America (‘T-Van’, 3500 m asl). Using these observations as well as ancillary data from the Niwot LTER, we simulated four distinct vegetation communities that characterize this alpine tundra site. We demonstrate how CLM reproduces carbon, water, and energy fluxes that broadly match observations and generates testable hypotheses about the shifting nature of energy, water, and nutrient limitations across space and through time in this heterogeneous landscape. Our results highlight the value in using diverse data streams related to hydrology, eddy covariance measurements, and biogeochemistry to critically evaluate and improve process-level representations in Earth system models at multiple scales of interest. These findings also illustrate how models like CLM can be used to generate hypotheses that ultimately guide further experimental work and model development.",

However, past studies have focused solely on the temperature variability of climate due to eruptions, using modern eruptions with the aid of satellite records. By using tree-ring data from a variety of sites that are temperature or moisture limited, it may be possible to attain a more complete understanding of the climatic effects of large eruptions from the past 2600 years. We used existing tree-ring data from Mongolia to understand how volcanic eruptions influence different climatic variables (temperature, moisture, and solar irradiance) in Inner Asia. This study, part of a larger research project on human ecology of Inner Asia, focuses on past volcanic eruptions ( 600 BCE to 2015 CE) at three sites in north central Mongolia: Solongotyn Davaa (48.3°N, 98.93°E), a temperature limited site, Khorgo Lava (48.17°N, 99.87°E), and Urgaat Lava (46.40°N, 101.46°E), both moisture limited sites. We collected more than 200 tree-ring samples of Siberian pine (Pinus sibirica) from the three sites. We used the Grid Analysis and Display System to run composite analyses using Climatic Research Unit temperature and precipitation data to test how modern eruptions between 1961 and 1999 influenced temperature and precipitation regimes in Mongolia. Four eruptions were analyzed and both composite analyses suggest that each variable is altered by volcanic eruptions during the 1 to 2 years following an eruption. We then used superposed epoch analysis to evaluate how past eruptions affect regional climate in Mongolia by separating temperature and precipitation variables. Our results indicate that most of Mongolia experienced 0.5°C cooler and dryer conditions following major eruptions. This research shows that tree-ring data is invaluable to studying volcanic eruptions by extending the time range of eruptions available to study and providing a more complete understanding of how they affect climate.",

While the 2014 Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) established new management requirements for 127 high and medium priority groundwater basins, it exempted all 26 of the state’s adjudicated groundwater basins from the Act. The State Water Resources Control Board prioritized the evaluation of these adjudicated basins to assist in aligning the processes and outcomes of adjudication with SGMA’s goals for the sustainable management of groundwater. Working with the Board, our research evaluated the history and current condition of all of California’s adjudicated basins along with potential future improvements to the adjudication process. Our presentation will provide a summary of our findings and highlight some successful features of the adjudication process along with the challenges adjudicated basins face to achieve long-term sustainable groundwater management. Our discussion will include a review of: whether most adjudications result in groundwater extractions at or near a basins’ designated safe yield; whether overdraft conditions are reduced or eliminated over the long term; and the degree of collaboration and inclusion of community stakeholders in the adjudication process. In addition to this overview, we will highlight 3-4 basins with particularly interesting management challenges and solutions. For each of these basins, we will describe the problem that precipitated the need for the adjudication and how adjudication outcomes were influenced by: how the judgment defined and distributed water rights; the management structure and strategies to manage the basin; how safe yield and overdraft are defined and determined; and, importantly, the effectiveness of the adjudication in halting or reversing groundwater overdraft.",

Our previous work used multiple in-situ estimates as well as altimetry in conjunction with a large suite of climate models to quantify how estimates of global upper-ocean warming since 1970 are likely biased low. This apparent underestimation, consistent with earlier studies, was attributed to poor observational coverage of the Southern Hemisphere.\nRecent 2006-2013 Argo ocean heat content (OHC) change estimates have placed 67-98% of increased heat in the Southern Hemisphere. The new estimates contrast markedly to long-term evaluations that place only 35-49% of the warming since 1970 in the Southern Hemisphere – even though the Southern Hemisphere contains more than 60% of the upper ocean volume. Although unforced variability is likely to play a larger role on resolved trends over this shorter time period, results from climate models provide one mechanism for investigating the role of variability across time scales.\nExtending our previous work, we investigate the hemispheric distribution of OHC using a number of observed change estimates along with a large suite of CMIP5 model simulations. We consider changes over decadal (Argo) to multi-decadal (multi-platform) time scales and contrast the observation-based hemispheric partitioning of OHC changes to a distribution of results from individual model simulations.",

In a spherical damped resonator, like the Earth-ionosphere cavity, the electromagnetic field is the superposition of the standing wave (resonance) field with the traveling waves field, which transfers the energy from lightning flashes to the global resonator. This component is quite strong close to the source and weakens with source-observer separation and is a major reason for an asymmetric shape of the observational Schumann resonance (SR) power spectra. In physics the process, where the resonant field interference with the background is very well known and in such a case the resonant lines are always asymmetric. However, it is possible to separate the resonance field component from the signal using the spectrum decomposition method proposed by Kułak et al. [2006].\nHere, we examine the activity of African thunderstorm center using Schumann resonance data collected by the two ELF stations built under the World ELF Radiolocation Array (WERA) project. The first ELF station in located in Poland and it has been recording data continuously since the end of 2004. In May 2015, another ELF station was installed in the Hugo Wildlife Area in Colorado as part of our project WERA. We binned the ELF data in 10-minute files and we derived the SR power spectra. In the next step the decomposition curve, which describes 7 asymmetric SR modes was fitted to the observational data. Using the algorithm, described in Dyrda et al. [2014], we calculated the distances to the tropical thunderstorm center located in Africa with the spatial resolution of 0.1 Mm. This is done independently for each of the ELF stations from WERA array. Then using the information about the distances and about the size of our magnetic antennas beam we derived the possible locations of the storm center on the African continent and hence we construct the 2D thunderstorms activity maps. Moreover, we calculated the thunderstorm intensities in absolute units C2 m2 s-1 and compared them with our previous findings [Dyrda et al., 2014].",

            "abstract": "The majority of organic matter sinking in the ocean is remineralized to carbon dioxide before it reaches the sea floor. Of the organic carbon (OC) that does reach the sediment-water interface, only a small fraction is buried. Organisms residing in the sediment column utilize minerals such as metal oxides as electron donors to degrade a portion of this carbon. However, there is evidence that these metal oxides may also, by adsorbing OC, enhance its preservation and thereby act as a sink for OC on geological timescales. The goal of this research is to examine the potential for mineral-based protection of OC in suboxic and oxic pelagic sediments. Using Elemental Analysis – Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry, we characterize the concentration and isotopic composition of OC and nitrogen in sediments collected during the R/V Knorr expedition 223 to the western subtropical North Atlantic in November 2014. Organic carbon concentrations range from 0.05 to 0.25 mol OC/kg sediment while organic nitrogen (ON) varies from 0.01 to 0.026 mol ON/kg sediment. OC concentrations initially decrease with depth but stabilize ~10 meters below core top, suggesting that OC is protected against remineralization since electron acceptors are still present to fuel anaerobic respiration. At the suboxic site, the ratio of OC/ON decreases sharply in the top two meters of the core and then stabilizes at a OC/ON value of approximately 5, illustrating an enrichment in ON relative to Redfield ratios. Oxidized solid-phase manganese (Mn), presumably Mn(III,IV) oxides, decreases with depth indicating active redox cycling. Conversely, solid-phase Fe(III) content as a proportion of total Fe remains relatively constant with depth. X-ray diffraction and density separations to isolate specific mineral classes, such as metal oxides and clays, were also employed to better correlate mineralogy with trends in OC concentrations. The relatively stable OC concentrations at depth suggest that OC is protected against remineralization. The persistence of iron(III) phases and presence of clays such as illite could provide protection of organic carbon at depth. Differences among the sites and with depth point to mineralogical controls on the amount and type of carbon preserved, which may point to mineral-hosted carbon as a dominant control on the subsurface biosphere.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Kane_Povak 2015 AGU Poster_submit2.pdf\nIn western North America, recent and projected increases in the frequency and severity of large wildfires have elevated the need to understand the key drivers of fire regimes across landscapes so that managers can predict where fires will have the greatest ecological impact, and anticipate changes under future climate change. Yosemite National Park offers a unique opportunity to study potential biophysical controls on fire severity patterns – fire management in this area has allowed many fires to burn since the 1970s, re-establishing a mixed severity fire regime. Previous studies within the park showed a high level of control from a variety of bottom-up (e.g., fire history, topography) and top-down (e.g., climate) variables on fire severity within a portion of the current study area, and found some evidence controls may break down for the largest fires. In the current study, we sought to identify (1) controls on fire severity across all fires that burned within Yosemite (1984-2013), (2) differences in controls across fire sizes, (3) the contributions of topographic, climatic, and fire history variables to total variance explained, and (4) the influence of spatial autocorrelation on model results. Our study includes 147 fires that burned over 78,500 ha within Yosemite. Modeling results suggested that fire size and shape, topography, and localized climate variables explained fire severity patterns. Fires responded to inter-annual climate variability (top-down) plus local variation in water balance, past fire history, and local topographic variability (bottom-up). Climate-only models lead to the highest level of pure variance explained followed by fire history, and topography models. Climate variables had distinctly non-linear relationships with fire severity, and key drivers were related to winter conditions. Fire severity was positively correlated with fire size, and severity increased towards fire interiors. Steeper and more complex topographies were associated with increased fire severity. The level of control among these factors varies across fire sizes indicating possible scale-wise shifts in dominance among controls. We will discuss differences in drivers across fire sizes to help identify where local climate conditions supersede bottom-up controls.",

            "abstract": "Clouds cover roughly two thirds of the globe and act as an important regulator of Earth's radiation budget. Of these, multilayered clouds occur about half of the time and are predominantly two-layered. Changes in cloud top height (CTH) have been predicted by models to have a globally averaged positive feedback, however observational changes in CTH have shown uncertain results. Additional CTH observations are necessary to better and quantify the effect. Improved CTH observations will also allow for improved sub-grid parameterizations in large-scale models and accurate CTH information is important when studying variations in freezing point and cloud microphysics.\nNASA’s airborne Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) is able to measure cloud top height using a novel multi-angular contrast approach. RSP scans along the aircraft track and obtains measurements at 152 viewing angles at any aircraft location. The approach presented here aggregates measurements from multiple scans to a single location at cloud altitude using a correlation function designed to identify the location-distinct features in each scan. During NASA’s SEAC4RS air campaign, the RSP was mounted on the ER-2 aircraft along with the Cloud Physics Lidar (CPL), which made simultaneous measurements of CTH.\nThe RSP’s unique method of determining CTH is presented. The capabilities of using single and combinations of channels within the approach are investigated. A detailed comparison of RSP retrieved CTH’s with those of CPL reveal the accuracy of the approach. Results indicate a strong ability for the RSP to accurately identify cloud heights. Interestingly, the analysis reveals an ability for the approach to identify multiple cloud layers in a single scene and estimate the CTH of each layer. Capabilities and limitations of identifying single and multiple cloud layers heights are explored. Special focus is given to sources of error in the method including optically thin clouds, physically thick clouds, multi-layered clouds as well as cloud phase. When determining multi-layered CTHs, limits on the upper clouds opacity are assessed.",

A coronal mass ejection (CME) caused the Dst-index to reach -80nT, followed by solar wind speeds of over 600 km/s lasting for three days. Electron fluxes measured by the NOAA POES satellites were increased by an order of magnitude and stayed elevated for three days. We investigate the atmospheric nitric oxide (NO) response to these incoming energetic electrons. By combining the low and medium energy electron fluxes from the Total Energy Detector (TED) and Medium Energy Proton and Electron Detector (MEPED) on the NOAA POES satellites we get a continuous energy spectrum ranging from 1-1100 keV, which corresponds to atmospheric altitudes of 50-150km. The multiple NOAA satellites enables us to construct global maps of the precipitating electrons. The energy spectra of the incoming electron fluxes are compared to NO measurements from The Solar Occultation for Ice Experiment (SOFIE) on board the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite and NO from Sub-Millimeter Radiometer (SMR) on the Odin satellite. The correlation between the incoming electrons and the increase of NO is strongly affected by NO's long lifetime when not exposed to sunlight. Winds from Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM) and the empirical wind model HWM07 are used to take into account the transport of NO in order to understand the total impact of the incoming electrons.",

            "abstract": "Paleomagnetic studies of iron and stony iron meteorites suggest that many small planetary bodies possessed molten cores resulting in the generation of a magnetic field. As these bodies cooled, Fe-Ni metal trapped within their mantle underwent a series of low-temperature transitions, leading to the familiar Widmanstatten intergrowth of kamacite and taenite. Adjacent to the kamacite/taenite interface is the so-called \"cloudy zone\" (CZ): a nanoscale intergrowth of tetrataenite islands in an Fe-rich matrix phase formed via spinodal decomposition. It has recently been shown (Bryson et al. 2015, Nature) that the CZ encodes a time-series record of the evolution of the magnetic field generated by the molten core of the planetary body. Extracting meaningful paleomagnetic data from the CZ relies, on a thorough understanding of the 3D chemical and magnetic properties of the intergrowth focsusing on the interactions between the magnetically hard tetrataenite islands and the magnetically soft matrix. Here we present a multi scale study of the chemical and crystallographic make up of the CZ in the Tazewell IIICD meteorite, using a range of advanced microscopy techniques. The results provide unprecedented insight into the architecture of the CZ, with implications for how the CZ acquires chemical transformation remanance during cooling on the parent body.\nPrevious 2D transmission electron microscope studies of the CZ suggested that the matrix is an ordered Fe3Ni phase with the L12 structure. Interpretation of the electron diffraction patterns and chemical maps in these studies was hindered by a failure to resolve signals from overlapping island and matrix phases. Here we obtain high resolution electron diffraction and 3D chemical maps with near atomic resolution using a combination of scanning precession electron diffraction, 3D STEM EDS and atom probe tomography. Using this combined methodology we reslove for the first time the phenomena of secondary precipitation in the tetrataenite islands and chemical partitioning of trace elements between the island and matrix phases. The new crystallographic and compositional measurements present a quantitative picture of low-temperature local equilibrium in the Fe-Ni system. This leads to an improved understanding of the magnetic models used to perform paleomagnetism of the CZ.",

            "abstract": "This paper quantifies the potential impacts of climate change on poverty in 2030 and 2050, in 92 countries covering 90% of the developing world population. It accounts for the deep uncertainties that characterize future socio-economic evolutions and the lack of data regarding the condition and livelihood of poor people. It also considers many impacts of climate change, another source of uncertainty.\nWe use a micro-simulation model based on household surveys and explore a wide range of uncertainties on future structural change, productivity growth or demographic changes. This results, for each country, in the creation of several hundred scenarios for future income growth and income distribution. We then explore the resulting space of possible futures and use scenario discovery techniques to identify the main drivers of inequalities and poverty reduction.\nWe find that redistribution and structural change are powerful drivers of poverty and inequality reduction, except in low-income countries. In the poorest countries in Africa, reducing poverty cannot rely on redistribution but requires low population growth and productivity growth in agriculture. Once we have explored the space of possible outcomes for poverty and inequalities, we choose two representative scenarios of the best and worst cases and model the impacts of climate change in each of these two scenarios. Climate change impacts are modeled through 4 channels. First, climate change has an impact on labor productivity growth for people who work outside because of higher temperatures. Second, climate change has an impact on human capital because of more severe stunting in some places. Third, climate change has an impact on physical capital via more frequent natural disasters. Fourth, climate change has an impact on consumption because of changes in food prices.\nImpacts are very heterogeneous across countries and are mostly concentrated in African and South-East Asian countries. For high radiative forcing (RCP8.5), the impact of climate change on poverty is 6 times larger in the pessimistic scenario than in the optimistic scenario, illustrating how development and poverty reduction are powerful adaptation tools. Our results stress the urgency of achieving poverty eradication by 2030 in order to limit the negative impacts of climate change on the poor.",

Previously, studies have not separated the influence of anthropogenic climate change and natural variability, despite being an essential step in the attribution of climate change impacts. Ensembles of 2900 simulations of regional climate in sub-Saharan Africa for the year 2013, one representing realistic conditions and the other how climate might have been in the absence of human influence, were used to force a P.falciparium climate suitability model developed by the Mapping Malaria Risk in Africa project. Strongest signals were detected in areas of unstable transmission, indicating their heightened sensitivity to climatic factors. Evidently, impacts of human-induced climate change were unevenly distributed: the probability of conditions being suitable for stable malaria transmission were substantially reduced (increased) in the Sahel (Greater Horn of Africa (GHOA), particularly in the Ethiopian and Kenyan highlands). The length of the transmission season was correspondingly shortened in the Sahel and extended in the GHOA, by 1 to 2 months, including in Kericho (Kenya), where the role of climate change in driving recent malaria occurrence is hotly contested. Human-induced warming was primarily responsible for positive anomalies in the GHOA, while reduced rainfall caused negative anomalies in the Sahel. The latter was associated with anthropogenic impacts on the West African Monsoon, but uncertainty in the RCM’s ability to reproduce precipitation trends in the region weakens confidence in the result. That said, outputs correspond well with broad-scale changes in observed endemicity, implying a potentially important contribution of anthropogenic climate change to the malaria burden during the past century. Results support the health-framing of climate risk and help indicate hotspots of climate vulnerability, providing information to direct control interventions and investment, and allude to climate injustices. Extending methods, such as by using multiple climate and malaria models and investigating trends over longer timescales, would make results more generally applicable and improve their policy relevance.",

            "abstract": "NASA’s Dawn spacecraft entered orbit around dwarf planet Ceres in March 2015 to begin a yearlong exploration. The Framing Cameras (FC) onboard Dawn are mapping the surface of Ceres with seven color filters (0.4-1.0 microns) and one clear panchromatic filter. These data provide unprecedented information at high spatial resolution. During its exploration of Vesta, Dawn’s first target, several distinct compositional units were observed in the FC color data. Like Vesta, Ceres exhibits hemispherical dichotomy with the Eastern hemisphere being brighter than the Western hemisphere. In the Eastern hemisphere there appears to be an old impact basin between ~80 and 170 deg E longitude containing the craters Kerwan and Dantu. This old basin seems to have excavated bright material that dominates the hemisphere. Ceres background material has a geometric albedo ranging from 0.09 to 0.11 but the albedo of the small bright spots is much higher, ranging between 0.2 and 0.4. In addition, Dawn FC observed several surface units of intermediate albedo hinting at compositionally distinct surface material. Areas with geometric albedo lower than Ceres average are primarily associated with ejecta blankets of impact craters such as Occator and could either represent material darkened by impact melting, or material mixed with an exogenic component from remnant material of the impactor. A majority of the small bright spots on Ceres are located on the walls, floors or ejecta blankets of impact craters and could represent excavated material from a sub-surface layer. Based on the albedo and colors obtained from Dawn FC, we have identified several units on the surface of Ceres. These include bright spots, dark material, and average Cerean surface material. Color spectra of these different units show a UV drop-off and varying spectral slope. With higher resolution images now being acquired we expect to find more clues revealing their formation mechanism and also detect smaller-scale color units with distinct compositional characteristics.",

            "abstract": "The Sur Ridge, located ~30 km off the Big Sur coast of central California, represents a unique system within the highly productive California Current ecosystem. Its unique high nutrient, but low chlorophyll characteristics are not fully understood. Time series of bulk stable carbon (δ13C) and stable nitrogen (δ15N) isotopes can help us better understand past changes in nutrient dynamics and phytoplankton community baselines for this region in order to better predict future changes. Deep-sea proteinaceous corals are particularly powerful paleoarchives of past ocean conditions. These organisms serve as “living sediment traps,” incorporating the stable isotope values of exported particulate organic material (POM) from the surface into their growth layers. The longevity of bamboo corals (Isidella, up to 400 years) makes them excellent resources for creating high resolution, centennial time series of δ13C and δ15N dynamics. Bamboo corals used in this study were harvested during summer of 2014 from 1220 to 1300 m depths. Two corals were milled in sub-millimeter intervals to generate a 200 year time series at approximately three year temporal resolution. Over the past 200 years, deep-sea coral δ13C values ranged from -15.7 to -19.0‰ and δ15N values ranged from 14.4 to 15.9‰, consistent with earlier data from the CA margin. The δ13C records were characterized by long periods of remarkable stability, contrasted with several large shifts (~1900 and ~1960) in δ13C of approximately 1‰. We hypothesize that these shifts likely reflect changes in plankton composition or production associated with regional climate shifts. The δ15N data were more dynamic, including several large shifts (1940 - 1960), as well as periods of apparent decadal scale oscillation (1825 - 1925 and 1965 – present). These shifts may reflect changes in the source or utilization of nitrogen at the base of the food web. Together, these data give us a first look at baseline stability of biogeochemical systems in this unique region, and will be crucial in connecting potential future system changes in climate and upwelling to possible shifts in nutrient dynamics and phytoplankton species composition.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen isotope analysis of the organic fraction of mollusk shells is beginning to be applied to questions of past anthropogenic and natural environmental variation using samples from archaeological and fossil deposits. Fairly extensive proxy validation research has been conducted in the past decade, documenting the relationship between the δ15N of ambient particulate organic matter, mollusk soft tissues, and shell organic matrix. However, comparatively little research has addressed the potential effects of taphonomy and diagenesis on these proxy records. Assessing archaeological samples are especially complex in that humans may have transported and/or cooked shell prior to deposition. Shell δ15N data will be presented from modern and archaeological oyster (Crassostrea virginica) and clam shell (Mercenaria spp.) of various late Holocene ages and late Cretaceous Crassatellites vadosus shells. Archaeological shells show some loss of organic matter over time, yet some Cretaceous shells retain enough matrix to permit δ15N analysis. The Cretaceous samples required concentration of the remaining organic matrix by removing carbonate via acid pretreatment prior to EA-IRMS analysis, but modern and archaeological shells had sufficient organic matrix to permit analysis without acid pretreatment. The δ15N data from the archaeological shells do not display obvious alteration from the loss of organic matrix. The results of cooking experiments performed on modern oyster shells also indicate little alteration of δ15N values, unless the shell was heated to the point of disintegration. While these experiments indicate promise for the application of δ15N analysis of shell organic matter, the results are incomplete and lack ideal control over initial δ15N values in ancient samples used for comparisons. Future research, perhaps focused on compound-specific δ15N analysis and additional controlled experiments on moderns shells, may improve this assessment.",

This overview will summarize our experiences building and using the Community Earth System Model (CESM) as we transition to more advanced, and complex process interactions. Chief among these interactions is the relationship between aerosols, activation and cloud drop size distributions and radiation. New processes add extra constraints on what constitues an acceptable climate in a GCM and the difficulty this entails for maintaining a credible simulation covering all existing aspects of the climate system. For the evolution of 20th century and ultimately future climate changes the regions and regimes that manifest the models' climate sensitivity are often co-located with the regions of greatest aerosol indirect effect sensitivity and we will show our efforts to disentangle these processes and gain a greater insight into their relative roles.",

In contrast, the link between climate and cooperation remains much less investigated, although it has been studied in the context of transboundary waters. Even for transboundary waters, however, earlier results have not decisively answered whether the effect of climate on conflict or on cooperation is stronger. We have concurrently investigated both cooperation and conflict in transboundary water management as two potential responses to changes in climatic factors. Our results indicate that changes in climate variables affect cooperation much more than conflict, and that lower water flows are associated with worse outcomes primarily through a decrease in cooperation rather than an increase in conflict. Our results therefore suggest that the main effect of adverse climate factors is a decrease in collaborative outcomes such as support of shared goals and scientific and industrial agreements. With water flows projected to decrease in many areas, reinforcing such cooperative activities should therefore be a policy priority. It is clear that including a full set of potential responses, both positive and negative, are needed to understand the climatic influence on human cooperation and conflict.",

            "abstract": "Flash floods have been a major natural hazard in terms of both fatalities and property damage. In the United States, flash floods have only been characterized on a case study basis due to the lack of a comprehensive database matching flood characteristics with geospatial and geomorphologic information. To characterize the ability of a basin to produce flash floods, a new variable called “Flashiness” is derived from the slope of the rising limb in hydrograph time series. It is the basis to document and predict the flash flood potential and severity over the U.S. First a representative and long archive of flood events spanning 78 years is used to analyze the spatial and temporal variability of observed flashiness. The areas and seasons prone to flash floods are documented, highlighting the flash flood alley in Texas, Appalachians, West Coast, and North American monsoon in Arizona etc. Then the flashiness is linked to geomorphologic and climatologic attributes to identify the basin characteristics driving the ability to produce flash floods. The significant impact of characteristics such as slope, precipitation, and basin area are quantified. Next the model is used to predict flashiness all over the continental U.S., specifically over regions poorly covered by hydrological observations. It highlights ungauged areas prone to flash floods such as parts of Florida, Southern Wisconsin, Montana and South Dakota etc. Finally these findings are validated using the National Weather Service storm reports and a historical flood fatalities database. This analysis framework will serve as a baseline for evaluating distributed hydrologic model simulations such as the Flooded Locations And Simulated Hydrographs Project (FLASH) (\nhttp://flash.ou.edu\n).",

Furthermore, rock glaciers are an order of magnitude more abundant than ice glaciers in U.S., yet are not included in budgets for perennial ice carbon stores.\nOur research aims to understand differences in the bioavailability of carbon from ice glaciers and rock glaciers along the Central Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Identical microbial communities were fed standardized amounts of DOM from four different ice glacier-rock glaciers pairs. Using laboratory incubations, paired with mass spectrometry based metabolomics and 16S gene sequencing; we were able to examine functional definitions of DOM lability in glacial ice. We hypothesized that even though DOM quantities are similar in the outputs of both glacial types in our study area, ice glacial DOM would be more bioavailable than DOM from rock glaciers due to higher proportions of byproducts from microbial metabolism than rock glacier DOM, which has higher amounts of “recalcitrant” plant material.\nOur results show that DOM from ice glaciers is more labile than DOM from geologically and geographically similar paired rock glaciers. Ice glacier DOM represents an important pool of labile carbon to headwater ecosystems of the Rocky Mountains. Metabolomic analysis shows numerous compounds from varying metabolite pathways, including byproducts of nitrification before and after incubation, meaning that, similar to large maritime glaciers in Alaska and Europe, subglacial environments in the mountain ranges of the United States are hotspots for biological activity and processing of organic carbon.",

In many areas throughout the northeastern U.S., the resulting declines in sulfate (SO42-) deposition have been accompanied by declines in stream SO42- concentrations. In the southeastern U.S., however, declines in stream SO42- concentrations have not been observed on a widespread basis. In fact, SO42- concentrations continue to increase in many southeastern streams despite decades of declining deposition. This difference in behavior between northeastern and southeastern streams, owing to the distinct geological histories of their catchment soils, was anticipated by the Direct/Delayed Response Project initiated by the U.S. EPA during the early 1980s. At that time, understanding of how catchments store and release SO42- was mostly grounded in theory. Now, with the accumulation of long-term stream chemistry and hydrological datasets in forested catchments, we may develop an empirical basis for characterizing catchment storage and release of SO42-. In particular, are whole-catchment isotherms that described the partitioning between adsorbed and dissolved SO42- (1) linear or non-linear and (2) reversible or irreversible? How do these isotherms vary on a geographical basis? We apply mass balance combined with a simple theoretical framework to infer whole-catchment SO42- isotherms in Virginia and New England. Knowledge of this key soil geochemical property is needed to improve predictions of how catchments will store and export SO42- under changing levels of atmospheric deposition.",

Exploring this more deeply, we observed that PW timeseries determined with various GPS software packages and mapping functions have variations that manifest themselves on seasonal timescales.

            "abstract": "Computational models of Earth's geospace environment are an important tool to investigate the science of the coupled solar-wind -- magnetosphere -- ionosphere system, complementing satellite and ground observations with a global perspective. They are also crucial in understanding and predicting space weather, in particular under extreme conditions. Traditionally, global models have employed the one-fluid MHD approximation, which captures large-scale dynamics quite well. However, in Earth's nearly collisionless plasma environment it breaks down on small scales, where ion and electron dynamics and kinetic effects become important, and greatly change the reconnection dynamics. A number of approaches have recently been taken to advance global modeling, e.g., including multiple ion species, adding Hall physics in a Generalized Ohm's Law, embedding local PIC simulations into a larger fluid domain and also some work on simulating the entire system with hybrid or fully kinetic models, the latter however being to computationally expensive to be run at realistic parameters.\nWe will present an alternate approach, ie., a multi-fluid moment model that is derived rigorously from the Vlasov-Maxwell system. The advantage is that the computational cost remains managable, as we are still solving fluid equations. While the evolution equation for each moment is exact, it depends on the next higher-order moment, so that truncating the hiearchy and closing the system to capture the essential kinetic physics is crucial. We implement 5-moment (density, momentum, scalar pressure) and 10-moment (includes pressure tensor) versions of the model, and use local approximations for the heat flux to close the system. We test these closures by local simulations where we can compare directly to PIC / hybrid codes, and employ them in global simulations using the next-generation OpenGGCM to contrast them to MHD / Hall-MHD results and compare with observations.",

            "abstract": "Owing to the lack of a consistent approach to assimilate probabilistic forecasts for water and energy systems, utilization of climate forecasts for conjunctive management of these two systems is very limited. Prognostic management of these two systems presents a stochastic co-optimization problem that seeks to determine reservoir releases and power allocation strategies while minimizing the expected operational costs subject to probabilistic climate forecast constraints. To address these issues, we propose a high performance computing (HPC) enabled computational framework for stochastic co-optimization of water and energy resource allocations under climate uncertainty. The computational framework embodies a new paradigm shift in which attributes of climate (e.g., precipitation, temperature) and its forecasted probability distribution are employed conjointly to inform seasonal water availability and electricity demand. The HPC enabled cyberinfrastructure framework is developed to perform detailed stochastic analyses, and to better quantify and reduce the uncertainties associated with water and power systems management by utilizing improved hydro-climatic forecasts. In this presentation, our stochastic multi-objective solver extended from Optimus (Optimization Methods for Universal Simulators), is introduced. The solver uses parallel cooperative multi-swarm method to solve for efficient solution of large-scale simulation-optimization problems on parallel supercomputers. The cyberinfrastructure harnesses HPC resources to perform intensive computations using ensemble forecast models of streamflow and power demand. The stochastic multi-objective particle swarm optimizer we developed is used to co-optimize water and power system models under constraints over a large number of ensembles. The framework sheds light on the application of climate forecasts and cyber-innovation framework to improve management and promote the sustainability of water and energy systems.",

However, it is unclear how estuarine processes alter the magnitude and composition of the particulate load prior to transport to the ocean. In this presentation, we present results from in-situ observations and rapid-response sampling along a typical river-estuary system (Alsea River/Bay, Oregon) designed to address this issue. We found marked contrasts in the concentrations of sediment and particulate organic matter in the estuary during different river discharge conditions (flood vs. non-flood), with distinct trends associated with contrasting tidal stage (spring/neap). Elemental, isotopic and biomarker analyses of individual samples revealed large differences in the provenance and composition of organic materials mobilized under different discharge/tidal conditions. Continuous, in-situ measurements of current, salinity, temperature and turbidity, combined with the compositions from individual samples allow us to determine instantaneous material fluxes into and out of Alsea Bay. We use these data to derive net fluxes during wintertime conditions and assess the role of floods in the retention and transport of particulate organic matter across the estuarine interface.",

            "abstract": "USGS’s SAFRR (Science Application for Risk Reduction) Project and its predecessor, the Multi Hazards Demonstration Project, uses the latest earth science to develop scenarios so that communities can improve disaster resilience. SAFRR has created detailed physics-based natural-disaster scenarios of a M7.8 San Andreas earthquake in southern California (ShakeOut), atmospheric-river storms rivaling the Great California Flood of 1862 (ARkStorm), a Tohoku-sized earthquake and tsunami in the eastern Aleutians (SAFRR Tsunami), and now a M7.05 quake on the Hayward Fault in the San Francisco Bay area (HayWired), as novel ways of providing science for decision making. Each scenario is scientifically plausible, deterministic, and large enough to demand attention but not too large to be believable. The scenarios address interacting hazards, requiring involvement of multiple science disciplines and user communities. The scenarios routinely expose hitherto unknown or ignored vulnerabilities, most often in cascading effects missed when impacts are considered in isolation. They take advantage of story telling to provide decision makers with clear explanations and justifications for mitigation and preparedness actions, and have been used for national-to-local disaster response exercises and planning. Effectiveness is further leveraged by downscaling the scenarios to local levels. For example, although the ARkStorm scenario describes state-scale events and has been used that way by NASA and the Navy, SAFRR also partnered with FEMA to focus on two local areas, Ventura County in the coastal plain and the mountain setting of Lake Tahoe with downstream impacts in Reno, Sparks and Carson City. Downscaling and focused analyses increased usefulness to user communities, drawing new participants into the study. SAFRR scenarios have also motivated new research to answer questions uncovered by stakeholders, closing the circle of co-evolving disaster-science and disaster-response improvements.",

Drag removes energy from the flow, leading to lower mean velocities and increased turbulent kinetic energy which can both selectively increase and decrease local sediment transport. Therefore understanding the magnitude and distribution of vegetative drag is key to understanding flow-vegetation-sediment interaction.\nHere, we present results from combined hydraulic-biomechanical modelling of flow through an aquatic vegetation canopy using a dynamic vegetation model coupled with a Large Eddy Simulation of the flow. This allows for dynamic reconfiguration of the stems in response to the flow which acts to decrease the magnitude of drag.\nThe results illustrate the variability in drag due to the stem reconfiguration as well as other factors such as wake sheltering further into the canopy. The results show that the stem-averaged drag coefficient differs significantly from the value for a rigid cylinder and that vegetative drag within a canopy exhibits variability in both space and time.",

The fractures were investigated using high resolution DEMs and orthophotos made by applying Structure from Motion processing to photos taken using a UAV and handheld cameras on 9/20/2014. At DLV the SAF is marked by a distinctive 2-7 m high west-facing scarp that extends northwestward from a dilational step-over. The orthophotos and DEMs were used to measure 110 fractures along a 37 m section of scarp and 15 additional fracture sets along a further 79 m of scarp. The fractures averaged 54 cm long by 1.8 cm wide with 22% overlap, and were mode 1 opening fractures that on average trended 184o, nearly perpendicular to the maximum extension direction for right-lateral slip along the 144o – trending SAF. The fractures occurred in ~5 m long sets that were themselves left-stepping, on average trended 159o, and were confined to a 3-4 m wide zone along the fault scarp. We interpret the fracture sets to be incipient Riedel shears with a component of extension across them based on the orientation of the sets relative to the SAF, the obliquity of the individual fractures to the trend of the sets, and the presence of topographic lows along them. We conservatively estimate 2.5 ± 1 cm of right-lateral creep on the SAF was recorded in the opening of the fractures, which probably began forming at most 21 months before the photographic survey based on precipitation records and prior site inspection. From these results and the 2.5-3.2 cm/yr creep rate for the SAF, we infer that at least ~30%, and probably 50-80% or more of creep occurs along the narrow 5-50 m wide primary geomorphic expression of the fault, and that the same amount of creep can be accommodated by brittle fracturing in a narrow 3-4 m wide zone along the fault scarp during drought periods. In comparison to seismically – created structures, the extensional fractures were similar to some post-seismic creep features, such as those formed by the 2004 Parkfield earthquake. However, through-going master fault rupture and R-shears without extensional fractures, such as those formed in the 2010 Darfield Earthquake, contrast with the DLV fracture sets.",

Numerical models are a key component for methodologies used to estimate tsunami risk. Model predictions are essential for the development of Tsunami Hazard Assessments (THA). By better understanding model bias and uncertainties and if possible minimizing them, a more accurate and reliable THA will result. In this study we compare runup height, inundation lines and flow velocity field measurements between GeoClaw and the Method Of Splitting Tsunami (MOST) predictions in the Sendai plain. Runup elevation and average inundation distance was in general overpredicted by the models. However, both models agree relatively well with each other when predicting maximum sea surface elevation and maximum flow velocities. Furthermore, to explore the variability and uncertainties in numerical models, MOST is used to compare predictions from 4 different grid resolutions (30m, 20m, 15m and 12m). Our work shows that predictions of particular products (runup and inundation lines) do not require the use of high resolution (less than 30m) Digital Elevation Maps (DEMs). When predicting runup heights and inundation lines, numerical convergence was achieved using the 30m resolution grid. On the contrary, poor convergence was found in the flow velocity predictions, particularly the 1 meter depth maximum flow velocities. Also, runup height measurements and elevations from the DEM were used to estimate model bias. The results provided in this presentation will help understand the uncertainties in model predictions and locate possible sources of errors within a model.",

            "abstract": "New and archive cores (N=70), bathymetric, backscatter and sub-bottom data from the Washington margin reveal patterns of Holocene sediment transport and deposition. Barkley, Nitinat, Juan de Fuca (JDF), Quillayute, Grays, Guide, and Willapa Canyons each have different post-glacial mechanisms of loading and dispersal of sediment via turbidity currents. In high-stand conditions, the northern canyons, Barkley, Nitinat, JDF, and Quillayute are mostly relict systems. The remaining canyons, Quinault, Grays, Guide, and Willapa, are recharged to varying degrees by northward transport of Columbia River derived sediment. All systems are nonetheless active conduits for turbidity currents during the Holocene. Sedimentologic and CT analyses, supported by radiocarbon ages, micropaleontology, and the Mazama Ash show that the Holocene sedimentary sequence consists of a series of sand to mud turbidites in the active portions of all systems, interbedded with hemipelagic sediment. The relict systems are finer grained, commonly not visually detected, with Holocene turbidite counts the same as recharged systems. Use of 1960’s core sketches (Atwater) fails to capture the full record, as noted by Barnard (1973). Hydrodynamic models and heavy mineral distributions show that the northern canyon systems (Barkley, Nitinat, JDF, Quillayute) are independent of the southern systems, (Quinault, Guide, Grays, Willapa) during the Holocene. Best fitting flow inversions suggest turbidity currents range in height from 80-170 m, consistent with earlier work and backscatter observations. Mass balancing suggests sediment supplied to the slope canyons and abyssal channels is 4-6 times greater than supplied by recharge to the canyon heads by external sources, strongly indicating autogenic sourcing by earthquakes. Turbidite deposition off Washington is not very sensitive to either sediment supply or slope angle. Lithostratigraphic correlation and age models of Holocene turbidite sequences suggests deposition of ~ 20 Holocene turbidites in most parts of the Canyon systems, with little variation. The explanation most consistent with the data is triggering by a series of 18-20 Holocene earthquakes, in agreement temporal and lithostratigraphic linkages to new marine sites in Canada, as well and land paleoseismic data.",

            "abstract": "Data containers are infrastructures that facilitate storage, retrieval, and analysis of data sets. Big data applications in Earth Science require a mix of processing techniques, data sources and storage formats that are supported by different data containers. Some of the most popular data containers used in Earth Science studies are Hadoop, Spark, SciDB, AsterixDB, and RasDaMan. These containers optimize different aspects of the data processing pipeline and are, therefore, suitable for different types of applications. These containers are expected to undergo rapid evolution and the ability to re-test, as they evolve, is very important to ensure the containers are up to date and ready to be deployed to handle large volumes of observational data and model output. Our goal is to develop an evaluation plan for these containers to assess their suitability for Earth Science data processing needs. We have identified a selection of test cases that are relevant to most data processing exercises in Earth Science applications and we aim to evaluate these systems for optimal performance against each of these test cases. The use cases identified as part of this study are (i) data fetching, (ii) data preparation for multivariate analysis, (iii) data normalization, (iv) distance (kernel) computation, and (v) optimization. In this study we develop a set of metrics for performance evaluation, define the specifics of governance, and test the plan on current versions of the data containers. The test plan and the design mechanism are expandable to allow repeated testing with both new containers and upgraded versions of the ones mentioned above, so that we can gauge their utility as they evolve.",

            "abstract": "The recent increase in injection induced seismicity (IIS) in previously less seismically active regions highlighted a need for better mitigation strategies and physics-based models of induced seismicity. Previous models of pressure diffusion and fluid flow investigated the change in Coulomb stress as a result of induced pore-pressure perturbations (e.g. Zhang et al., 2013; Keranen et al., 2014; Hornbach et al., 2015; Segall and Lu, 2015). Here, we consider the additional effects of permeability structure, operational parameters and reservoir geometry. We numerically investigate the influence of net fluid injection volumes; linear, radial, and spherical reservoir geometry; as well as reservoir size. The latter can have a substantial effect on changes in Coulomb stress and subsequent induced seismicity.\nWe report on results from two series of model runs, which explored pressure changes caused by wastewater disposal and water flooding. We observed that a typical water flooding operation that includes production wells and injectors has a lower probability of inducing seismicity. Our observations are in agreement with assessment by National Research Council report on induced seismicity (2012). We developed a third suite of models that investigate the effect of permeability structure on injection-induced seismicity. We examine two cases of wastewater disposal in proximity to active faults: 1) in Central Illinois Basin and 2) in central California. In both cases, we observed that the size of the reservoir, presence of faults, and permeability contrast relative to the host rock, strongly influences the pressure changes with distance and time. These pressure changes vary widely but can easily lead to fault instability and seismic activity at up to 10 km distance from the injection well. The results of this study may help to select safe injection sites and operational conditions in order to minimize injection induced seismicity hazard.",

            "abstract": "Observations and the output of numerical and statistical models are synthesized to construct a carbon budget of the coastal waters of eastern North America. The domain extends from the head of tide to (roughly) the continental shelf break and from southern Florida to southern Nova Scotia. The domain area is 2% tidal wetlands, 19% estuarine open water, and 78% shelf water. Separate budgets are constructed for inorganic and organic carbon; for tidal wetlands, estuaries, and shelf waters; and for three main subregions: the Gulf of Maine, the Mid-Atlantic Bight, and the South Atlantic Bight. Net primary production for the study region is about 150 Tg C yr-1, with 12% occurring in tidal wetlands and 7% in estuaries. Though respiration and photosynthesis are nearly balanced in most systems and regions, tidal wetlands and shelf waters are each found to be net autotrophic whereas estuaries are net heterotrophic. The domain as a whole is a sink of 5 Tg C yr-1 of atmospheric CO2, with tidal wetlands and shelf waters taking up 10 Tg C yr-1 (split roughly equally) and estuaries releasing 5 Tg C yr-1 to the atmosphere. Carbon burial is about 3 Tg C yr-1, split roughly equally among tidal wetlands, estuaries, and shelf waters. Rivers supply 6-7 Tg C yr-1 to estuaries, about 2/3 of which is organic. Tidal wetlands supply an additional 4 Tg C yr-1 to estuaries, about half of which is organic. Carbon in organic and inorganic forms is exported from estuaries to shelf waters and from shelf waters to the open ocean. In summary, tidal wetlands and estuaries, though small in area, contribute substantially to the overall carbon budget of the region.",

Maintaining a high level of data quality is necessary to extend the continuity of the Landsat thermal band data record. On-orbit, TIRS uses a temperature controlled blackbody for calibration, similar to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on the Terra and Aqua satellite platforms. The thermal band observations of the two on-orbit MODIS instruments have demonstrated good long term calibration stability and consistency over their 15+ (Terra) and 13+ (Aqua) year mission lifetimes. Using repeated observations of selected Earth targets, TIRS calibration stability will be assessed in comparison to that of MODIS. Both cold scenes over Antarctica and more typical scene temperature ranges over coastal ocean buoy sites will be used. A stray light corrected TIRS data set will also be analyzed to determine the impact of the correction on the data product.",

This allows for greatly improved detection of smaller and cooler fires from satellite observations. VIIRS scenes with coincident Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection (ASTER) overpasses are examined after applying the operational VIIRS fire product algorithm and including a modified “candidate fire pixel selection” approach, which lowers the 4 micron brightness temperature threshold from 305 K but includes a minimum day-night band (DNB) radiance. FILDA is tested by applying it to scenes in different environments, including large forest fires like the Rim Fire in California and High Park fire in Colorado, in addition to gas flares. A large increase in the number of detected fire pixels is observed with small non-agricultural wildfires, as verified with the finer-resolution ASTER data (90 m). Quantitative use of the DNB to improve detection of these smaller fires could lead to reduced warning and response times as well as provide more accurate quantification of biomass burning emissions at night.",

            "abstract": "Regional hydrological models are important tools in water resources management, but prediction uncertainties are often high due to non-uniqueness of the hydrostratigraphical model. This model is often based on borehole lithology only. However, a much better resolution can be obtained from large geophysical datasets covering the entire domain. Using boreholes to link between hydrostratigraphical classes and resistivity is efficient and emphasizes the need for an all-inclusive data interpretation procedure that can be integrated in groundwater model calibration.\nWe present an automatic method for parameterization of a 3D model of the subsurface, integrating lithological information from boreholes with resistivity models. The objective is to create a direct input to regional groundwater models for sedimentary areas, where the sand/clay distribution governs the groundwater flow. The resistivity input is all-inclusive in the sense that we include data from a variety of instruments (DC and EM, ground-based and airborne), with a varying spatial density and varying ages and quality. The coupling between hydrological and geophysical parameters is managed using a translator function with spatially variable parameters, which is calibrated against observed lithological data. In other words, the translator function interprets the geophysical resistivities into a 3D clay fraction model and the 3D clay fraction model is then turned into a zonation for the hydrological model by a K-means clustering.\nWe present the methodology by show-casing a study from Denmark were a regional groundwater model is constructed by including lithological information from 3100 boreholes over an 710 sqkm area. The geophysical models spans more than 30 years of data collection and includes approx. 225,000 DC models, and 35,000 EM models, airborne as well as groundbased. The final model was calibrated giving parameters that were comparable with existing models based on thorough and time-consuming manual model construction.",

The boat lowers sensors into the water column to provide depth profiles of temperature and oxygen concentrations. An adaptive path-planning algorithm continuously analyzes the in-situ observations and directs the boat to its next measurement location. This significantly reduces number of samples compared to a gridded sampling approach, while simultaneously improving the certainty with which the hypoxic regions are delineated.

The HRR model covers the SBC-LTER watersheds from just west of the Ventura River to Point Conception; a land area of roughly 800 km2 with 179 watersheds ranging from 0.1 to 123 km2. The downscaled climate conditions have a spatial resolution of 6 km by 6 km. Here, we use the Penman-Monteith method with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) limited climate data approximations and land surface conditions (albedo, leaf area index, land cover) measured from NASA’s Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on the Terra and Aqua satellites to estimate potential evapotranspiration (PET). The HRR model is calibrated for the period 2000 to 2014 using USGS and LTER streamflow. An automated calibration technique is used. For future climate scenarios, we use mean 8-day land cover conditions. Future streamflow, ET and soil moisture statistics are presented and based on downscaled P and T from ten climate model projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5).",

            "abstract": "Watersheds have been shown to demonstrate a range of both chemostatic and chemodynamic responses to changes in discharge based on land use, solute species, and hydrologic regime as well as the presence or absence of large solute mass stores within the watershed. The dynamics of solute export, as captured by concentration-discharge patterns, can be described mathematically based on a power-law concentration-discharge relationship of the form , where a purely chemostatic system is characterized by a b value equal to 0. In practice, catchments across a range of land uses and geologic conditions may exhibit a distribution of solute export behaviors, and such dynamics can be grouped into different regimes as a function of differences in b values. It is our hypothesis that different solute export regimes are created primarily as a function of solute mass stores in different compartments of the landscape, e.g. the vadose zone or groundwater, and that these regimes may vary temporally based on the triggering of these compartments as a function of stochastic forcing within and between years.\nIn the present work, we synthesize both high and low temporal resolution concentration data for a range of geogenic and anthropogenic solutes to better our understanding of the variations in concentration-discharge relationships as a function of land use, climate and solute type. We then develop a parsimonious model to explain these patterns as a function not only of solute mass stores, but also of the triggering of fast and slow transport pathways across a range of precipitation dynamics. Specifically, we have developed a modeling framework to address the following questions: (1) How do C-Q relationships vary across climate and land-use gradients? (2) Is there any seasonality to C-Q patterns? (3) Can C-Q patterns be explained as a function of the activation of fast and slow hydrologic pathways in response to stochastic, hydro-climatic forcing? (4) How do these interactions lead to the development of hot spots and hot moments in catchment biogeochemical processing?",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic emissions of carbonaceous aerosols are a major component of fine air particulate matter (PM2.5) in polluted metropolitan areas and in the global atmosphere. Elemental (EC) and organic carbon (OC) aerosols influence Earth’s energy balance by means of direct and indirect pathways and EC has been suggested as a better indicator of public health impacts from combustion-related sources than PM mass. Quantifying the contribution of fossil fuel and biomass combustion to the EC and OC emissions and their temporal and spatial variations is critical for developing efficient legislative air pollution control measures and successful climate mitigation strategies.\nIn this study, we used radiocarbon (14C) to separate and quantify fossil and biomass contributions to a time series of EC and OC collected at 3 locations in Salt Lake City (SLC). Aerosol samples were collected on quartz fiber filters and a modified OC/EC analyzer was used with the Swiss_4S protocol to isolate and trap the EC fraction. Together with the total carbon (TC) content of the samples, the EC was analyzed for its 14C content with accelerator mass spectrometry. The 14C of OC was derived as a mass balance difference between TC and EC.\nEC had an annual average fraction modern of 0.13±0.06 and did not vary significantly across seasons. OC had an annual average FM of 0.49±0.13, with the winter mean (0.43±0.11) lower than the summer mean (0.64±0.13) at the 5% significance level. While the 3 stations were chosen to represent a variety of environmental conditions within SLC, no major differences in this source partitioning were observed between stations. During winter, the major sources of air pollutants in SLC are motor vehicles and wood stove combustion and determining their relative contributions has been the subject of debate. Our results indicated that fossil fuels were the dominant source of carbonaceous aerosols during winter, contributing 87% or more of the total EC mass and 40-75% of the OC. This suggests that fossil fuel-derived emissions should be a target for improving air quality during winter in SLC.",

            "abstract": "It is commonly held that land cover and land use changes from agriculture and urbanization impact the terrestrial water cycle primarily through changes in the land surface and canopy energy balance. Another, and in some cases more important factor is the role that landuse changes have on soil structure, compaction, and loss of carbon on hydrologic performance. The consequential change on soil properties, such as aggregation of soil particles, reduction of voids, impacts on matrix conductivity and macropore fractions, alter the hydrological processes in a watershed.\nMacropores promote rapid water and gas movement under wet conditions while the soil matrix preserves the water-holding capacity necessary for plant growth. The physically-based Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model (PIHM) simulates water movement in soil with Richard’s equation using an effective matrix-macropore conductivity. The model is able to capture the preferential flow and soil water storage in vertical and horizontal directions. Soil degradation leads to a reduction of the macropore fraction with dramatic changes in overall hydrologic performance under urban development and agricultural landuse practices. The effects on the terrestrial water cycle in the catchment reduce infiltration, soil water availability, recharge and subsurface baseflow to streams, while increasing heavy surface runoff and erosion.\n The Lancaster area and surrounding watershed in eastern Pennsylvania, USA is a benchmark watershed comprised of urban (24%), agricultural (58%) and forest lands (18%) respectively. After parameter estimation from national geospatial soils, landuse and historical climate reanalysis, three landuse scenarios were developed. 1) Pre-development forest landuse (<1700 AD), (2) deforestation for agriculture and light urban landuse (1700-1900), (3) urban-suburban development (1900-pres.). The watershed model was used to evaluate hydrologic changes due to landuse change and soil degradation. The effects of macropore reduction and compaction on hydrologic performance were found to be of the same order or greater magnitude than for changes in landuse practices alone. The research, funded by the US EPA, illustrates the complex interaction of landuse and soil changes on the terrestrial water cycle.",

The rates are derived by examining the flux of rock debris on and within Khumbu Glacier, the volume of stored debris in Khumbu Basin, and the rate of evacuation of suspended sediment through field studies and remote sensing. We find that contemporary and Holocene basin-averaged erosion rates range from 0.3 to 0.8 mm/yr, suggesting that erosion of Khumbu Basin has, on average, maintained a steady pace over time intervals ranging from 102 to 104 years. Contemporary suspended sediment evacuation is, however, 50 times slower than the Holocene-averaged sediment production indicating that the bulk of the material eroded resides within the basin, consistent with geomorphic evidence of substantial accumulation of debris within the basin. Curiously, the basin-averaged erosion rates are similar to published long-term (O ~ 107 yr) exhumation rates derived from thermochronometric data in the region, which reflect both erosional and tectonic exhumation. This similarity may be a coincidence, and it is surprising in view of likely changes in climate, structural development, and relief evolution. Regardless, these erosion and exhumation data provide valuable clues about the evolution of the highest topography on the planet.",

Results show that utilizing the CFSR precipitation and temperature data to force a watershed model provides stream discharge simulations that are as good as or better than models forced using traditional weather gauging stations available from GHCN, especially when stations are more than 10-km from the watershed.

            "abstract": "Surface deformation in the Mojave Desert in the last two decades has been dominated by the effects of the 1992 Landers and 1999 Hector Mine earthquakes. In the post-seismic periods following these events, broad scale patterns were interpreted as afterslip on deep parts of the faults or viscoelastic relaxation in the lower crust and upper mantle. In the near-field of the faults, smaller size features of the displacement field were interpreted as poro-elastic relaxation of crustal fluid pressure gradients produced by the co-seismic stress change. We reanalyze the entire archive of the European Space Agency ERS-1/2 and ENVISAT radar data to define the spatial and temporal characteristics of the near-field deformation following the two events, achieving coverage during the 1992-2010 time period. The raw data are processed into interferograms using the JPL ISCE software. The interferograms are corrected for the tropospheric phase delay using the ECMWF GCM and orbit errors are estimated in the data network over entire scenes. Time-series of surface displacement maps of sub-regions near the faults are then constructed using the full resolution of the radar images (~20 m).\nDeformation features within and near the earthquake faults are characterized by a fast LOS velocity exponentially decaying with time over 1-2 years, followed by a steady deformation corresponding to the long-term strain in the Mojave. Shorter relaxation times are generally observed in regions where the crust sustained extension during the preceding earthquakes suggesting that crustal tension increases the diffusivity of fluids in the shallow crust. In the Johnson Valley-Homestead Valley pull-apart we estimate a relaxation time of ~400 days. Along the northern section of the HME fault rupture, the narrow zone of subsidence has a relaxation time of ~240 days, which can be explained by intensely damaged rocks within the fault zone.",

            "abstract": "Mesozoic ocean anoxic events have long been a focus of intense study because they appear to reflect a large-scale oscillation of the marine redox state from oxic to anoxic, and at least locally sulfidic. The consensus view on the cause of these events has changed over the past 39 years, since they were first defined. A global net increase in primary production is now widely accepted as the key driver, and the evidence for a volcanic trigger of this process is strong. However, the exact pathway from volcanism to OAE is less certain. Some authors favor the direct role of a massive load of reduced compounds in LIP hydrothermal fluxes for consuming available marine oxygen. Others prefer the indirect pathway of oxygen consumption by enhanced organic matter flux, which requires a major increase in nutrient budgets. Metallic micronutrients in the hydrothermal fluxes have been hypothesized, as have increases in riverine phosphorus fluxes due to enhanced weathering that would result from volcanic CO2 driven warming. Our recent work on the OAE2 interval has led to some new ideas about these hypothesized drivers. In particular, refinement of the Late Cenomanian time scale, and comparison of the geochemical records of d13C, d34S, Osi, P phases, and d44Ca between selected sections in North America and Europe has suggested the following sequence of events: 1) Osi data indicate that the onset of a major volcanic event precedes the positive shift in C-isotopes by at least 40 to possibly 180 kyr; 2) a positive shift in d44Ca data interpreted to indicate ocean acidification is coincident with the volcanic event; 3) the positive shift in C-isotopes is interpreted to reflect the accumulated burial of marine organic matter sufficient to shift the C-reservoir to heavier values; thus, our data suggest that up to 180 kyr was required for the shift in nutrient supply, productivity increase, and organic matter burial. Two mechanisms that conceivably match the lagged character of the event are benthic phosphorus release due to increased microbial sulfate reduction and removal of the iron-oxyhydroxide trap for carbonate fluorapatite (Adams et al., 2010), and/or increased benthic phosphorus release due to acidification of carbonate surface sediments.",

            "abstract": "The formation and fate of peroxy radicals (RO2) plays a key role in constraining the atmospheric oxidative capacity. RO2 H-shift chemistry, or autoxidation, has been implicated in sustaining the radical pool as the removal of species requires fewer oxidative steps. Recent studies have suggested that autoxidation plays a role in the chemistry of isoprene and terpenes, in many cases forming highly oxidized multifunctional compounds with low vapor pressures. A fundamental understanding of the mechanism and products is needed for models to accurately characterize the effect of autoxidation. A laboratory kinetics study of autoxidation in a model system of alkyl nitrites is presented. The nitrites (1-hexylnitrite, 2-hexylnitrite, and 2-methyl-2-hexylnitrite) possess varying structural properties which influence the H-shift kinetics. The compounds were photolyzed in an environmental chamber to produce RO2 following an alkoxy H-shift and CF3O- chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) was employed in the detection of products. The RO2 isomerization coefficients were derived at 296 and 313 K, and relied on the relative production yields of the alkyl nitrate and isomerization product. Our results support a quantitative ranking of these substituent effects. This knowledge will aid both laboratory and simulation work in evaluating the importance of autoxidation in relevant atmospheric systems.",

            "abstract": "Some studies about formation and propagation of atmospheric waves suggest that the Ross Sea may be a key area to analyze low frequency variability in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) atmospheric flow. The objective of this study is to investigate atmospheric circulation patterns during extreme events of sea ice in the Ross Sea in Antarctic on interannual time scale. During periods of minimum sea ice the SST anomalies showed a pattern very similar to the warm phase of ENSO, with an anomalous convective activity over the center-east Pacific warm pool. With this warming in the South Pacific, there is a weakening of western zonal flow across the troposphere. In this region the polar jet is weakened while the subtropical jet is strengthened and shifted to southeast between southern South America and the South Atlantic. This pattern favors a smaller cyclonic activity and a greater atmospheric blocking frequency. Thus, in the southern South Pacific there is an anomalous ridge at middle levels, while in the central South Pacific (around 50° S) there is an anomalous trough, which extends to the southern tip of South America and southern South Atlantic. The same pattern of anomalies is observed at low and high levels. This pattern is very similar to PSA1, which is the second EOF pattern of seasonal mean 500-hPa height anomalies for the SH. Thus, the poleward warm advection is weakened in the Bellingshausen Sea and western Weddell Sea, which results in cooling south of 30° S of the South America. The pattern of cold anomalies extending northward over the Andes mountains to near the equator is an indicative of cold outbreaks. While there is convection in the southern tip of South America, there is suppression in the northeastern of Brazil. On the other hand, during periods of maximum sea ice cover in the Ross Sea the interannual anomalies of atmospheric and surface fields are nearly in opposite phase to periods of minimum coverage.",

The redistribution of energy within the troposphere has implications for climate prediction, as it impacts the large-scale circulation, the convection and precipitation. In this study, we take advantage of two modeling experiments and A-train satellite observations to characterize and evaluate the vertical distribution of clouds in eight GCMs and their link with their radiative heating rate profiles.\nWhile the overall pattern of modeled zonal cloud profiles is quite good (r=0.92 for the multi-model mean), we show two main systematic biases: a positive bias in cloud frequency above 8 km (up to 10%), particularly in the tropics; and a negative bias in cloud frequency below 3 km (up to -10%), with a maximum over the stratocumulus cloud regions. Both biases are persistent regardless of the cloud regime.\nUsing satellite-based estimates of observed radiative heating rate profiles, we show that the global net cooling rate between 50°S and 50°N is too warm in the models (-0.81 K.d-1 in models vs. -1.01 K.d-1 in observations). The excess cloudiness in the high troposphere increases the absorption of solar radiation and absorbs more infrared radiation in the atmospheric column. On the other hand, the lack of clouds in the lower troposphere reduces its infrared cooling and increases the absorption of solar radiation by water vapor.\nThe representation of clouds in GCMs remains challenging. Yet, reducing the cloud biases would lead to an improvement of the heating rate profiles, which in turn, would help improving other aspects of the simulations such as the dynamics.",

We are developing a new method for extracting biogenic barite and fish teeth from deep-sea sediments and calibrating the fluxes of both components to satellite-derived ocean productivity. Both fish teeth and barite capture major components of biological production in the ocean. Teeth capture dynamics of high trophic level communities who depend upon lower level production in mostly short food chains. Barite reflects export flux of marine particulate carbon, and hence records the major producers of marine snow. Our methods digest sediments to remove carbonates, and concentrate teeth with heavy liquid separation. Barite is also concentrated by acid dissolution of carbonate, but then we dissolve barite, collect the sulfate in solution, and re-precipitate barite rather than use the time consuming and dangerous methods that are currently the industry standard. Counting the number of fish teeth present in the sample and extracting the amount of biogenic barium will discover two different proxies of productivity. The sample sites range throughout the Pacific Ocean, giving a wide scope of variability along with satellite productivity levels. The results between the amount of fish teeth as well as the biogenic barite levels will hopefully be at a similar level, indicating that this method is a new tried and true proxy for productivity in the future.",

            "abstract": "Nightside Time Domain Electromagnetic Sounding was performed during the Apollo era using transient discontinuities within the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF) occurring when the Lunar Surface Magnetometer was well within the wake cavity. This analysis assumes that induced fields, generated by conducting layers within the interior of the Moon, respond as an undisturbed spherically symmetric dipole in vacuum. In actuality, the magnetohydrodynamic plasma environment interacts with the induced field. On the dayside, the induced field is confined to the surface by the dynamic pressure of the solar wind. On the nightside, Apollo era theories predicted the induced field would expand into the diamagnetic wake cavity. We present the first hybrid model studying the interaction of the wake fields with an induced dipole field at the Moon. Contrary to the assumptions during the Apollo soundings, we have found that the nightside dipole fields at the Moon are not confined within the wake cavity. The induced fields penetrate out of the rarefraction regions of the wake boundary. Furthermore, within the deep wake, near-vacuum region, distortion of the induced dipole fields due to the interaction with the wake varies between a few percent to more than 15% at the surface depending on the magnitude of the induced field, the geometry of the upstream fields, and the upstream plasma parameters. Thus, our results indicate that under cer tain conditions the assumption of a vacuum dipolar response is reasonable. For the application of this method, a two point measurement is required with altitudes below approximately 400km. Future Electromagnetic Sounding of the interior structure of the Moon with ARTEMIS will provide further insights into the lunar interior structure. These results are applicable to any airless body with a conducting interior, interacting directly with the solar wind in the absence of a parent body magnetic field.",

Public participation can provide important perspectives and knowledge that cannot be obtained through traditional scientific methods alone. Citizen engagement can also provide increased efficiencies to USGS science and additional benefits to society including enhanced understanding, appreciation, and interest in geospatial information and its use in decision making.\nThe USGS guidance addresses several fundamental issues by:\n1. Developing an operational definition of citizen or participatory science.\n2. Identifying the circumstances under which citizen science is appropriate for use and when its use is not recommended.\n3. Describing structured processes for effective use of citizen science.\n4. Defining the successful application of citizen science and identifying useful success metrics.\nThe guidance is coordinated by the USGS Science and Decisions Center and developed by a multidisciplinary team of USGS scientists and managers. External perspectives will also be incorporated, as appropriate to align with other efforts such as the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) Citizen Science and Crowdsourcing Toolkit for the Federal government. The guidance will include the development of an economic framework to assess the benefits and costs of geospatial information developed through participatory processes.

            "abstract": "The impact of nitrogen deposition on forest ecosystems depends in large part on its fate: uptake by trees can stimulate growth, while gaseous or leaching losses contribute to air and water pollution and represent the loss of a limiting nutrient. Past tracer studies have shown that soils dominate the short-term fate of added 15N, but its longer-term term fate remains uncertain. This study examined how much 15N tracer moved plant or soil pools or was lost over 5-6 years. In 2007, a 15N tracer (0.21 kg/ha as 99% enriched 15N-KNO3) was added to 0.25 ha mixed hardwood forest in central NY. All of the tracer was recovered in the days after its addition, but recovery fell to 78% by the end of this year (25% surface litter, 48% 0-10 cm soil, 5% roots). One year later, recovery in these pools fell (to 51%), with losses from surface litter (-11%) and the 0-10 cm soils (-15%), including losses from the “heavy” soil fraction. Additional tracer moved to other plant pools (+5%) and to deeper soil (+13%; up to 30 cm), for a total recovery of 69% of the added tracer. Between years 1 and 5-6, only total tracer recovery decreased by only 1.4%. Recovery decreased in foliage (-0.2%), all roots (-3.5%), and surface litter (-9.8%), while increasing in woody biomass (+0.9%), 0-10 cm soil (+8.9%), and deep soil (+2.3%; up to 50 cm). Tracer recovery in live and dead plant N pools (11%) did not change, as 3% moved from roots into aboveground plant tissues and 3% moved from live plant pools into leaf litter; these results imply no net transfer of 15N from soil to plants during this period. Over all 5-6 years, only 1.6% of the tracer moved into bark or wood, a small but important sink because of its high C:N ratio; however, roughly one-third of this total was in wood formed prior to the start of the tracer addition. Tree species differed in their recovery of 15N: the six species with ectomycorrhizal associations showed more enrichment than the four species with arbuscular mycorrhizae. It is not yet apparent whether ectomycorrhizal species were more effective at scavenging 15N at the time of tracer addition, or if they were better at acquiring 15N from its initial fate in litter and soil. Only continued long-term resampling can distinguish between these alternatives, and to what extent 15N initially retained in soil eventually moves into plants over decadal timescales.",

The coastal temperate rainforests of British Columbia contain extensive freshwater networks that export significant amounts of water and DOM to the ocean, representing significant cross-system hydrologic and biogeochemical linkages. To better understand the importance of these linkages and implications for ecosystem structure and function, we used an experimental approach to investigate the role of microbial and photodegradation transformations of DOM exported from small coastal catchments to the marine environment. At two time periods (August 2014, March 2015), stream water from the outlets of two coastal watersheds was filtered (<0.2 μm), and treated with microbial inoculums from across a salinity gradient (i.e., freshwater, estuarine, and marine). Treatments were incubated in the ocean under light and dark conditions for 8 days. At 0, 3 and 8 days, samples were analyzed for DOC, TDN, DIN, and DON. Changes in DOM composition were determined with optical characterization techniques such as absorbance (SUVA, S, Sr) and fluorescence (EEM). Microbial community response was measured using cell counts and DNA/RNA amplicon sequencing to determine changes in bacterial abundance and community composition. General patterns indicated that microbial communities from the high salinity treatment (i.e. most marine) were the most effective at utilizing freshwater DOM, especially under light conditions. In some treatments, DOM appeared as a potential source of inorganic nitrogen with corresponding shifts in microbial community composition. Incubations using inoculum from low and mid salinity levels demonstrated smaller changes, indicating that DOM exported from these streams may not be extensively utilized until exposed to higher salinity environments further from stream outlets. These results suggest a role for terrestrial sourced-DOM as a subsidy for microbial communities within the near shore marine environment, and emphasize that changes in DOM exports due to land development or climate change may have implications for coastal food web processes and biogeochemical cycling.",

However, deficiencies in our understanding of the limited size of the largest RTF earthquakes are due, in part, to not considering the effect of short intra-transform spreading centers (ITSCs) on fault thermal structure. We use COMSOL Multiphysics to run a series of 3D finite element simulations of segmented RTFs with visco-plastic rheology. The models test a range of RTF segment lengths (L = 10-150 km), ITSC offset lengths (O = 1-30 km), and spreading rates (V = 2-14 cm/yr). The lithosphere and upper mantle are approximated as steady-state, incompressible flow. Coulomb failure incorporates brittle processes in the lithosphere, and a temperature-dependent flow law for dislocation creep of olivine activates ductile deformation in the mantle. ITSC offsets as small as 2 km affect the thermal structure underlying many segmented RTFs, reducing the area above the 600˚C isotherm, A600, and thus the size of the largest expected earthquakes, Mc. We develop a scaling relation for the critical ITSC offset length, OC, which significantly reduces the thermal affect of adjacent fault segments of length L1 and L2. OC is defined as the ITSC offset that results in an area loss ratio of R = (Aunbroken – Acombined)/Aunbroken – Adecoupled) = 63%, where Aunbroken = C600(L1+L2)1.5V-0.6 is A600 for an RTF of length L1 + L2; Adecoupled = C600(L11.5+L21.5)V-0.6 is the combined A600 of RTFs of lengths L1 and L2, respectively; and Acombined = Aunbroken exp(-O/ OC) + Adecoupled (1-exp(-O/ OC)). C600 is a constant. We use OC and kinematic fault parameters (L1, L2, O, and V) to develop a scaling relation for the approximate seismogenic area, Aseg, for each segment of a RTF system composed of two fault segments. Finally, we estimate the size of Mc on a fault segment based on Aseg. We show that small (<1 km) offsets in the fault trace observed between M­W6 rupture patches on Gofar and Discovery transform faults, located at ~4S on the East Pacific Rise, are not sufficient to thermally decouple adjacent fault patches. Thus additional factors, possibly including changes in fault zone material properties, must limit the size of Mc on these faults.",

            "abstract": "One major challenge to modeling Earth’s climate system is the proliferation of complex feedbacks that can both dampen and amplify the effects of forcing mechanisms acting on it. While these types of feedbacks are regularly addressed in general climate studies, they are often neglected in climate-dependent studies where feedback impacts are potentially similarly significant. A primary example of this is found in studies involving glacier mass balances, where numerous temperature and albedo feedbacks (in particular) are recognized, yet remain poorly quantified in many glacier mass balance studies. This study develops a robust, fully distributed surface- and energy-mass balance model to quantify the influence of glacier mass balance feedbacks across High Mountain Asia (HMA), and thereby provides a quantitative estimate for the variability of mass balance feedbacks under differing climate settings. HMA is chosen here primarily because it is a region whose climate is especially heterogeneous, largely due to its complex topography. The surface- and energy-mass balance model follows well-known methods described in previous mass balance studies, but allows individual feedback mechanisms to be independently switched on or off. The sensitivity of glacier mass balance to each feedback is then independently tested by comparing the model-predicted mass balance when only a single feedback is included, to that of a control in which no feedbacks are included. By this means, the magnitude of the contribution of each individual feedback is directly comparable one to another, as is the variability in glacier sensitivity to these feedbacks from one region to another. In addition, the interdependence of feedbacks is assessed. The results provide a self-consistent assessment of the impact of feedbacks on glacier surface mass balance, highlight which regions of HMA are most sensitive to feedback processes, and identify which feedbacks are likely to have the biggest impacts on glacier response to future climate scenarios.",

Instrumental records, typically only reaching back to the 1940s or later, show that temperatures in central Asia have been increasing rapidly, particularly since the mid 1990’s, and are currently warmer then at any other time in recorded history. We develop a millennium length (931-2005 C.E.) tree-ring width chronology from larch trees (Larix sibirica) growing at elevational treeline (2400 meters) sites in Mongolia, where the dominant limiting factor for growth is temperature. The chronology and reconstruction, from a site named Ondor Zuun Nuruu (OZN; meaning 'High East Ridge'), has a large sample depth (> 200 samples) and can be calibrated and validated using regionalized meteorological data from Mongolia and Russia. The reconstruction allows us to evaluate temperature variability and extremes over the past millennium in Central Asia, a region that is warming faster then many places on Earth. It also places recent warming trends into a long-term context, contributes to our understanding of spatial patterns of the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age across Asia, and provides evidence of significant volcanic influence on Central Asia temperature. We also present preliminary results from novel Blue Light Intensity methods that demonstrate that blue intensity reflectance significantly improves the climate signal of temperature sensitive tree-ring width chronologies from Central Asia and will lead to additional millennial length reconstructions from several sites that were not previously possible using ring-width alone.",

Here, we show seismological data that reveal a complex asthenosphere beneath the Juan de Fuca (JdF) and Gorda plates. We present mantle tomographic images using teleseismic S phases and shear-wave splitting measurements of SKS phases using OBS data recorded during the Cascadia Initiative (CI) and Blanco Experiment. Beneath the JdF plate, Vs in the upper 200 km of the mantle is ~5% faster beneath ~10 Myr lithosphere than near the ridge. In the Jdf plate interior, fast polarization directions from shear-wave splitting broadly correlate with absolute plate motion. Beneath the Gorda plate, in contrast, Vs varies only weakly with lithospheric age. Fast polarization directions are aligned with JdF-Pacific relative plate motion over a broad region and do not vary near the Gorda ridge. We also show that low Vs regions beneath three mid-ocean ridges (JdF, Gorda, and southern East Pacific Rise) are asymmetric with respect to the ridge axis. These results indicate that the evolution of the asthenosphere differs beneath the JdF and the Gorda plates. The large increase of Vs beneath the JdF plate is much greater than the predicted ~2% change due to conductive cooling of the lithosphere, and we explore possible explanations for this large degree of heterogeneity. The weak variations in Vs near the Gorda ridge are also not well explained by conductive cooling. The broad region of low Vs could be due to melt retention or to grain size reduction in a shear-zone. Finally, models of mantle upwelling suggest that the asymmetries in Vs with respect to the ridge axes likely require an asymmetric region of upwelling in the presence of pre-existing heterogeneity in the asthenosphere. We suggest that interactions with plate boundaries and heterogeneity may create an active and complex asthenosphere.",

A key factor in this control is the mode of connectivity between wetlands and downstream rivers, and temporal distribution thereof.\nThe local Lower Nelson River basin, Manitoba, Canada, has an area of approximately 90,000 km2, of which 25% is estimated to be covered by wetlands. Assessment of a decade of aerial imagery indicates variation in the spatial extent of wetlands of up to 50% of the surface area of individual headwater basins on both an inter- and intra-annual basis. Aerial and ground reconnaissance of selected areas indicates that using generalised aerial-based reflectance imagery for land cover classification is hampered by the presence of a number of types of wetlands (treed, shrubby, grassed, open) and shallow groundwater in this flat landscape. The large, remote, catchment area renders detailed ground-truthing impractical. As an alternative, five headwater basins and the main stem of the river are gauged and monitored for stable isotopes of water. In this study linear regression is used to assess linkages between isotopic and wetland extent variation and dominant environmental variables. Mass balance modelling is used to assess the relative merits of a detailed re-analysis of wetland delineation using refined reflectance analysis, soil and isotopic data, and simply assigning wetland extent as a calibration variable. Results indicate that aerial imagery provides a useful tool to assess surface connectivity, but that explicit identification and representation of temporal variation in surface and subsurface connectivity is necessary to adequately estimate timing of streamflow in this flat, wetland-dominated catchment.",

This approach may mask the effect of temperature in controlling in-situ activities as in most ecosystems soil temperature change more gradually than air temperature. We conducted an experiment to test the effects of contrasting warming rates on the kinetics of C, N, and P degradation enzymes in subtropical peat soils. We also wanted to evaluate if the stoichiometry of enzyme kinetics shifts under contrasting warming rates and if so, how does it relate to the stoichiometry in microbial biomass. Contrasting warming rates altered microbial biomass stoichiometry leading to differing patterns of enzyme expression and microbial nutrient limitation. Activity (higher Vmax) and efficiency (lower Km) of C acquisition enzymes were greater in the step treatment; however, expressions of nutrient (N and P) acquiring enzymes were enhanced in the ramp treatment at the end of the experiment. In the step treatment, there was a typical pattern of an initial peak in the Vmax and drop in the Km for all enzyme groups followed by later adjustments. On the other hand, a consistent increase in Vmax and decline in Km of all enzyme groups were observed in the slow warming treatment. These changes were sufficient to alter microbial identity (as indicated by enzyme Km and biomass stoichiometry) with two apparently stable endpoints under contrasting warming rates. This observation resembles the concept of alternate stable states and highlights a need for improved representation of warming in models.",

            "abstract": "Bacteria play an important role in Hg transformation reactions. The production of cyanide (HCN) and other secondary metabolites seems to be key elements involved in these transformations. Current hypotheses link the role of HCN production to growth inhibition of nonHCN producing competitor organisms (role of an antimicrobial agent). Our past investigations showed that HCN production did not correlate with antimicrobial activity and since pK value of HCN is very high (pK = 9,21), it can be expected that most of the produced HCN is removed from the microenvironment. This way, the expected inhibitory concentrations can hardly be reached. Accordingly, we proposed a new concept, where the ability of complexation of transient metals by HCN served as a regulation process for the accessibility of micro-elements. In our study, we focused on the presence of HCN producing bacteria and carried it out in the Hg contaminated environment connected to the Idrija Mercury Mine, Slovenia. We characterised the isolates according to the presence of Hg resistance (HgR), level of HCN production and genetic similarities. In laboratory setups, using our merR whole cell based biosensor, we determined the transformation of low bioavailable Hg0 and HgS forms into bioavailable Hg by these HCN producing bacteria. We observed that HgR strains producing HCN had the highest impact on increased Hg bioavailability. In the proposed ecological strategy HgR HCN producing bacteria increase their competitive edge over non-HgR competitors through the increase of Hg toxicity. Due to their activity, Hg is made available to other organisms as well and thus enters into the ecosystem. Finally, using some of the characteristics of bacteria (e.g. Hg resistance genetic elements), we developed a fully automated sensing approach, combining biosensorics and mechatronics, to measure the bioavailability of Hg in situ.",

The Whillans Ice Stream (WIS) represents an extreme example of rapid variations in velocity, with motions near the grounding line consisting almost entirely of once or twice-daily stick–slip events with a displacement of up to 0.7 m (Winberry et al, 2014). Here we report observations of compressional waves from the WIS slip events propagating hundreds of kilometers across the Ross Ice Shelf (RIS) detected by broadband seismographs deployed on the ice shelf. The WIS slip events consist of rapid basal slip concentrated at three high friction regions (often termed sticky-spots or asperities) within a period of about 25 minutes (Pratt et al, 2014). Compressional displacement pulses from the second and third sticky spots are detected across the entire RIS up to about 600 km away from the source. The largest pulse results from the third sticky spot, located along the northwestern grounding line of the WIS. Propagation velocities across the ice shelf are significantly slower than the P wave velocity in ice, as the long period displacement pulse is also sensitive to velocities of the water and sediments beneath the ice shelf. Particle motions are, to the limit of resolution, entirely within the horizontal plane and roughly radial with respect to the WIS sticky-spots, but show significant complexity, presumably due to differences in ice velocity, thickness, and the thickness of water and sediment beneath. Study of this phenomenon should lead to greater understanding of how the ice shelf responds to sudden forcing around the periphery.",

            "abstract": "Ethics education since classical times has involved the consideration of stories, parables, myths, fables, allegories and histories. These are the ancient equivalents of case studies. Modern case studies are used in applied-ethics courses in law, engineering, business, and science. When used in a geoscience course, geoethical case studies can enrich a student's understanding of the relationships between issues of geoscience, engineering, sociology, business, public policy and law – all with an ethical dimension. Perhaps more importantly, real cases affected real people. Students develop a strong empathetic connection to the people involved, enhancing students' drive to understand the interconnected layers of the cases. Students might begin to appreciate that geoscientists can help to avoid or alleviate human suffering -- that their careers can have meaning and purpose beyond simply earning a paycheck.\nGeologic disasters in which losses could have been predicted, avoided or minimized are quite effective as cases. Coupling a \"disaster\" case with a comparable \"hazard\" case is particularly effective. For example, there are many places along the San Andreas Fault in California where [1] significant coseismic displacement has occurred during historical times, [2] structures that are still inhabited were built along or across active traces prior to the Alquist-Priolo Earthquake Fault Zoning Act in 1971, and [3] inhabited structures have been built legally since 1971 within a few tens of feet of active traces. The question students confront is whether society ought to allow habitable structures to be built very near to a major active fault. This topic allows students to work with issues of law, history, seismology, seismic site response, crustal deformation adjacent to active faults, building codes and, ultimately, ethics. Similar progressions can be developed for other major geologic hazards, both natural and man-made, such as floods, landslides, erosion along rivers and coastlines, subsidence caused by fluid/gas withdrawal, induced seismicity, and pollution due to extractive industries. Case study sources are available via http://CroninProjects.org/Vince/GeoEthics/ and SERC has a growing collection of useful case studies (e.g., http://serc.carleton.edu/geoethics/case_studies.html).",

Accurate modeling of these components is essential to identify the disaster risk exposures effectively, which would be crucial for insurance industry as well as policy makers to have tsunami resistant design of structures and evacuation planning (FEMA, 2008). In this study, the sensitivity and variability of tsunami coastal inundation due to Cascadia megathrust subduction earthquake are studied by considering the different approaches for seabed displacement model. The first approach is the analytical expressions that were proposed by Okada (1985, 1992) for the surface displacements and strains of rectangular sources. The second approach was introduced by Meade (2006) who introduced analytical solutions for calculating displacements, strains, and stresses on triangular sources.\nIn this study, the seabed displacement using triangular representation of geometrically complex fault surfaces is compared with the Okada rectangular representations for the Cascadia subduction zone. In the triangular dislocation algorithm, the displacement is calculated using superposition of two angular dislocations for each of the three triangle legs. The triangular elements could give a better and gap-free representation of the fault surfaces. In addition, the rectangular representation gives large unphysical vertical displacement along the shallow-depth fault edge that generates unrealistic short-wavelength waves. To study the impact of these two different algorithms on the final tsunami inundation, the initial tsunami wave as well as wave propagation and the coastal inundation are simulated. To model the propagation of tsunami waves and coastal inundation, 2D shallow water equations are modeled using the seabed displacement as the initial condition for the numerical model.

As of August 2015, there have reportedly been 765 floats equipped with oxygen sensors with 363 currently active. Although new insights into oceanic biogeochemical processes have come from these data, the profiling oxygen data set has not been fully utilized because the dissolved oxygen data does not undergo QC procedures at the Argo data centers. The oxygen sensors on profiling floats have been demonstrated to produce highly stable and precise data over many months and years but only a small percentage have been verified with discrete samples taken at deployment to determine the sensor accuracy. Takeshita et al (2013) presented a climatology based quality control procedure utilizing the World Ocean Atlas 2009 (WOA09). We used a straightforward approach mentioned in their paper to calculate the sensor gain by comparing the surface %Sat(float) to the surface %Sat(WOA09) using > 1 year of data. We have developed Python scripts to provide QC’d data that are freely available and easily shared using IPython Notebooks hosted on GitHub. We will examine the consistency of the corrected oxygen data set, relative to existing climatologies, and its use in oceanographic studies.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic inputs of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) have increased in many watersheds throughout the world; these inputs have been linked to the eutrophication of inland and coastal waters worldwide. We selected and surveyed 20, third-order streams that supported a range of water column biogeochemical conditions (conductivity, nutrient concentrations) located in the mid-Atlantic region, USA. Biofilm biomass, algal taxonomic composition, and nutrient stoichiometry (C, N, P, and poly-P) were measured at all stream sites. Pulse-amplitude modulation fluorometry (PAM) was used to estimate photosynthetic parameters for stream biofilms (e.g., alpha, Pmax), while microbiology techniques were used to verify poly-P storage by pro- and eukaryotic components of the biofilm (e.g., epi-fluorescent staining). As anticipated, chlorophyll ranged over 2 orders of magnitude among the streams (range 10-1,000 mg/m2). Biofilm chlorophyll and algal biovolume levels increased with water column nutrient contents, while the C:P ratio within the biofilm decreased. Both pro and eukaryotic organisms were present in resident biofilms and actively stored intracellular poly-P. Finally, the rate of photosynthetic within the biofilms appeared to be driven the nutritional condition of the biofilms; pmax and alpha values increased with significantly with stream biofilm poly-P content (r2 = 0.35 and 0.44, respectively). These results indicated that where nutrients are plentiful, biofilms P storage is favored, and this is likely a key regulator of stream biofilm biomass and productivity.",

The recent deployment of the USArray network of seismometers rolling from the west coast to the east coast of United States during 2004 to 2015 afford an extraordinary data set to investigate such mantle seismic heterogeneities. Here we first explored the D” structure beneath Caribbean region and found an east-to-west asymmetrical undulation of the D” discontinuity with a V-shaped depression of ~80-150 km over a lateral distance of 600 km, coinciding with a similar trend of shear wave velocity showing the most profound reduction of ~5% at the bottom of the thinnest D” layer. The strong correlation between the D” topography and velocity variations indicates lateral fluctuation in the D” temperature modulated by the reheated slab material has perturbed the phase transition boundary significantly and may reflect a transitional period of the proposed mega-plume scenario. Secondly, these emerging data not only shed light on the lowermost mantle structures but provide new constraints on the mid and upper mantle seismic velocity heterogeneities beneath the United States. We found that frequency-dependent traveltime residuals and amplitudes of S waves from South America events display considerable scatter patterns recorded by USArray stations which can be attributed to upper mantle heterogeneities beneath the U.S. and mid or lower mantle seismic anomalies along the raypaths. The analysis of waveform complexity is utilized in this work and gives complementary constraints on the location and geometry of these mantle heterogeneities such as possible slab remnants below Central and Eastern United States. We further exploited the newly developed 2D finite-difference method with various mantle heterogeneity models to better understand the possible geophysical features producing these anomalies. ",

In response, the polar-optimized version of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (Polar WRF) is used to simulate the meteorology, boundary layer, and Arctic clouds during the September-October 2014 Arctic Radiation- IceBridge Sea and Ice Experiment (ARISE) project. Polar WRF was developed with several adjustments to the sea ice thermodynamics in WRF. ARISE was based out of Eielson Air Force Base near Fairbanks, Alaska and included multiple instrumented C-130 aircraft flights over open water and sea ice of the Beaufort Sea. Arctic boundary layer clouds were frequently observed within cold northeasterly flow over the open ocean and ice. Preliminary results indicate these clouds were primarily liquid water, with characteristics differing between open water and sea ice surfaces. Simulated clouds are compared to ARISE observations. Furthermore, Polar WRF simulations are run for the August-September 2008 Arctic Summer Cloud Ocean Study (ASCOS) for comparison to the ARISE. Preliminary analysis shows that simulated low-level water clouds over the sea ice are too extensive during the the second half of the ASCOS field program. Alternatives and improvements to the Polar WRF cloud schemes are considered. The goal is to use the ARISE and ASCOS observations to achieve an improved polar supplement to the WRF code for open water and sea ice that can be provided to the Polar WRF community.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_pdf.pdf\nSurface water (pluvial) flooding occurs due to intense precipitation events where rainfall cannot infiltrate into the sub-surface or drain via storm water systems. The perceived risk appears to have increased in recent years with pluvial flood events seeming more severe and frequent within the UK. Surface water flood risk currently accounts for one third of all UK flood risk, with approximately two million people living in urban areas being at risk of a 1 in 200 year flood event. Surface water flooding research often focuses upon using 1D, 2D or 1D-2D coupled numerical modelling techniques to understand the extent, depth and severity of actual or hypothetical flood scenarios. Although much research has been conducted using numerical modelling, field data available for model calibration and validation is limited due to the complexities associated with data collection in surface water flood conditions. Ultimately, the data which numerical models are based upon is often erroneous and inconclusive. Physical models offer an alternative and innovative environment to collect data within. A controlled, closed system allows independent variables to be altered individually to investigate cause and effect relationships. Despite this, physical modelling approaches are seldom used in surface water flooding research. Scaled laboratory experiments using a 9m2, two-tiered physical model consisting of: (i) a mist nozzle type rainfall simulator able to simulate a range of rainfall intensities similar to those observed within the United Kingdom, and; (ii) a fully interchangeable, scaled plot surface have been conducted to investigate and quantify the influence of factors such as slope, impermeability, building density/configuration and storm dynamics on overland flow and rainfall-runoff patterns within a range of terrestrial surface conditions. Results obtained within the physical modelling environment will be compared with numerical modelling results using FloodMap (Yu & Lane, 2006) to evaluate the extent to which data collected can be used to inform and support current flood modelling strategies.",

The overarching goal of this research is to monitor the development of a proglacial slope of the Gepatschferner in the Tryol region of Austria. The Gepatschferner, the second largest glacier in Austria, has been retreating since the maximum of the Little Ice Age in 1850. The constant retreat continually exposes large quantities of glacial till which is then susceptible to hillslope and fluvial transport processes. Typically, data resolution and collection time are proportional; to obtain high resolution spatial datasets require significant fieldwork as well as additional data processing time. While utilization of either terrestrial or airborne LiDAR is one of the most common methods used to determine erosion and deposition of sediment at high resolution, several studies have shown that Structure from Motion photogrammetry is another tool available to generate similar quality data with significantly reduced fieldwork. The objective of this study is to determine the suitability and accuracy of using SfM to increase frequency of observation by comparing to terrestrial laser scanning data to determine the best data collection method to obtain both detailed spatial resolution as well as high temporal resolution for data in a proglacial environment. This study is part of the PROSA (High-resolution measurements of morphodynamics in rapidly changing PROglacial Systems of the Alps) research project.",

Black carbon (BC) is a significant climate warming agent, while light-absorbing organic carbon (brown carbon, BrC), also impacts the atmospheric radiative balance. The optical properties of ambient aerosols can be affected by biogenic SOA through the lensing effect (coating of BC cores by semivolatile SOA), and by the potential formation of BrC from biogenic sources influenced by anthropogenic sources. To evaluate these effects, measurements of ambient aerosol optical properties and BC concentrations were made in rural Centreville, AL (a remote site with little anthropogenic influence) in summer 2013 and at Duke Forest in Chapel Hill, NC (a site close to high density vehicular traffic and industrial sources), during summer 2015. Photoacoustic extinctiometers (PAX, 405 nm and 532 nm) measured particulate light absorption and a single particle soot photometer (SP2) measured BC mass at both locations. A seven-wavelength Aethalometer and a three-wavelength nephelometer were also deployed at Duke Forest. A third PAX (870 nm) was deployed at Centreville. For absorption and BC measurements, the sample was cycled between a dry line and a dry/thermally-denuded line. Hourly samples were collected with a steam jet aerosol collector (SJAC) for online (2013) and offline (2015) chemical composition analysis. BC concentrations were generally higher at Duke Forest compared to the rural Centreville site. The Aethalometer readings at Duke Forest show greater absorption at the shorter wavelengths (370 nm and 470 nm) than expected from the absorption at 880 nm coupled with an inverse wavelength dependence, suggesting the presence of brown carbon. This presentation will examine the evidence for brown carbon at the two sites, as well as the effect of non-BC coatings on BC light absorption (the lensing effect.)",

The transition time between a period of repose and unrest, or vice versa for an open system, can occur within a matter of hours or days. Because of this short time scale, real-time seismic and geodetic (e.g. tiltmeter, GPS) monitoring networks are crucial for characterizing the state of activity of a volcano. In the Ecuadorean Andes, 5 volcanoes demonstrate long-term (Tungurahua, Reventador, and Guagua Pichincha) or recently reactivated (Cotopaxi, Chiles-Cerro Negro) seismic and geodetic activity. The Instituto Geofisico regularly characterizes volcano seismicity into long period, very long period, volcano-tectonic, and tremor events. Significant recent changes at these volcanoes include: rigorous reactivation of glacier-capped Cotopaxi, drumbeat seismicity absent a dome extrusion at Tungurahua, and regularly reoccurring (~7 day recurrence interval), shallow seismic swarms at Guagua Pichincha. These volcanoes locate along both the Western and Eastern Cordillera of the Ecuadorean Andes and, where data are available, manifest important variations in chemical composition, daily gas flux, and surficial deformation. We summarize the long-term geophysical parameters measured at each volcano and place recent changes in each parameter in a larger magmatic and hydrothermal context. All of the studied volcanoes present significant societal hazards to local and regional communities.",

Shifting of these atmospheric systems around the end of the AHP dramatically rearranged spatial rainfall patterns in the Turkana Basin catchment, causing changes in relative runoff contributions from the different sub-catchments in the Turkana Basin.\nWe here present a Holocene Turkana lake water Sr-isotope reconstruction, based on the analysis of well-dated lacustrine ostracods and shells. This reconstruction reveals consistently high Sr isotope values for the early Holocene, followed by a remarkable drop of Sr isotope ratios around the AHP termination. We interpret this pattern to represent a westward shift in the location of the CAB, leading to the reduction and eventual shutdown of runoff contribution from the Chew Bahir Basin to the Turkana Basin at the end of the AHP.\nThe record demonstrates the exceptional suitability of Sr isotope data for this type of paleohydrological reconstructions. This is mainly due to the chemically conservative Sr-isotope mass balance in EARS lake systems, which is insensitive to environmental change at seasonal timescales that so often overprints the longer term climate signal in stable (oxygen and carbon) isotope records of these lakes. Furthermore, when Sr-isotope signatures of the contributing sub-catchments are known, the observed Sr isotope trends can be interpreted in terms of spatial shifts in climate driven runoff contribution to the lake.",

Measuring rates of wind erosion and dust emission across land use and land cover types is important for quantifying the impacts and identifying and testing practical management options. This process can be assisted by the application of predictive models, which can be a powerful tool for land management agencies. The Aeolian EROsion (AERO) model, a wind erosion and dust emission model interface provides access by non-expert land managers to a sophisticated wind erosion decision-support tool. AERO incorporates land surface processes and sediment transport equations from existing wind erosion models and was designed for application with available national long-term monitoring datasets (e.g. USDI BLM Assessment, Inventory and Monitoring, USDA NRCS Natural Resources Inventory) and monitoring protocols. Ongoing AERO model calibration and validation are supported by geographically diverse data on wind erosion rates and land surface conditions collected by the new National Wind Erosion Research Network. Here we present the new AERO interface, describe parameterization of the underpinning wind erosion model, and provide a summary of the model applications across agricultural lands and rangelands in the United States.",

            "abstract": "The hydration and carbonation of olivine results in an up to ~44% increase in solid molar volume, which may choke off of fluid supply and passivate reactive surfaces, thus preventing further carbonation reactions. The carbonation of olivine has ben studied extensively in the laboratory. To date, observations from these experimental studies indicate that carbonation reaction rates generally decrease with time and the extent of carbonation is limited in olivine rocks. Field studies, however, show that 100% hydration and carbonation occur naturally in ultramafic rocks. The disagreement between the laboratory results under controlled conditions and the field observations underlines the lack of understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the self-sustaining carbonation interaction in nature.\nWe developed a state-of-the-art pressurized hydrothermal cell that is transparent to X-rays to characterize the real-time evolution of pore geometry during fluid-rock interaction using in-situ synchrotron-based X-ray microtomography. Through a time series of high-resolution 3-dimensional images, we document the microstructural evolution of a porous olivine aggregate reacting with a sodium bicarbonate solution at elevated pressure and temperature conditions. We observed porosity increases, near constant rate of crystal growth, and pervasive reaction-induced fractures. Based on the nanometer scale tomography data, we propose that shrinkage cracking is the mechanism responsible for producing new reactive surface and keep the carbonation reaction self-sustaining in our experiment. Shrinkage cracks are commonly observed in drying mud ponds, cooling lava flows and ice wedge fields. Stretching of a contracting surface bonded to a substrate of nearly constant dimensions leads to a stress buildup in the surface layer. When the stress exceeds the tensile strength, polygonal cracks develop in the surface layer. In our experiments, the stretching mismatch between the surface and interior of the sintered olivine aggregate is instigated by rapid dissolution and non-uniform precipitation. Our results provide new insight into the weathering of ultramafic rocks in nature and guidance to experimental designs for more efficient carbonation.",

The CSM is part of the world’s largest downdrift sand system. It contains three of the world’s largest sand islands, several National Parks, a UNESCO World Heritage Site and covers 500 km of the eastern Australian coastline in northern New South Wales and southern Queensland. The large (>200 m) composite dunes of the CSM exhibit multiple activation phases, coastally eroding bluffs and dune development is not obvious from surficial exposures. This provides an ideal environment for ground penetrating radar. The dune sequences have been provisionally dated to the mid Quaternary through present and represent the potential for a large palaeo-environmental proxy dataset.\nGPR imagery was collected using a MALA GeoSciences Ground Explorer (GX) system with 160 and 450 MHz antennae from the numerous physiographic and ecological provinces as well as mapped surficial soil units at the CSM. These data were used to determine the subsurface architecture, identify radar facies and develop environmental interpretations. In the clean, aeolian quartz-rich sands, radar wave penetration exceeded 30 m (radar velocity = 0.07 m/ns) with the 160 MHz antenna. From the interpreted environmental units including palaeosol, dune slip face, dune stoss face, sand blow, beach, estuarine and fluvial, we are developing maps to relate the units and focus a detailed sampling regime that includes OSL, sediment geochemistry and sedimentology, The interpreted units, stratigraphic correlation and spatial distribution of the facies is the first step in a broader project to unravel the Quaternary environmental and climate records that are archived within the sediments of the CSM.",

            "abstract": "Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are the primary drivers of global climate change and hence there is a crucial need to quantify their sources and sinks. A general technique to help constrain source and sink strengths in GHG exchange processes is the analysis of the relative proportions of isotopic variants of GHG's. Very high precision measurements of isotopologue ratios are necessary in order to identify sources and sinks because the characteristic changes are small. The standard method of isotopologue measurement has been mass spectrometry, but this technique typically requires significant sample preparation and relatively high instrument maintenance. Laser spectroscopy has the potential to ease these burdens and also to allow easy separation and analysis of interfering isobars such as 13C-CO2 and 17O-CO2.\nWe present recent results demonstrating ultra-high precision measurements of carbon dioxide isotope ratios which rival the accuracy of mass spectrometric measurements. These measurements were performed using Tunable Infrared Laser Direct Absorption Spectroscopy (TILDAS). We have developed a method for analyzing air samples from canisters by alternately and rapidly trapping sample gas and working reference gas in the optical cell. Using this technique, we have obtained isotopic measurement precisions of ~7 per meg for both 13C-CO2 and 18O-CO2 while measuring trapped ambient air samples with volumes as small as 200 ml with a 16 minute measurement duration. The figure shows a histogram of 2 minute measurements. Our current measurement precision for 17O-CO2 is 30 per meg, but we expect to reduce this to 10 per meg by working in a better spectral region. Our ultimate goal is to create an automated, ultra-high accuracy carbon dioxide isotope monitor able to quantify 13C-, 18O-, and 17O-CO2at the 10 per meg level using small (~100 standard ml), discreet air samples.\nWe will also discuss recent progress in the measurement of the clumped isotopes of carbon dioxide in ambient air samples. Simultaneous measurements of the clumped isotopic abundances of 13C16O18O and 13C16O17O in ambient air samples will be presented.",

Surprisingly little quantitative research has been done to constrain the evolution of this ductile detachment system, despite the reputation of this area as a prime example of a metamorphic core complex. This study presents new evidence for the formation of a shallow ductile detachment system during the latest Oligocene (~25 Ma). Hornblende thermobarometry results were obtained from electron microprobe analysis of hornblende-plagioclase pairs in 6 samples collected from the 26 Ma Catalina Granite pluton in the Northwest Catalina mountains and the Tortolita mountains. Maximum depth estimates for the emplacement of the Catalina Granite range from an average of 8.2 km in the Tortolita mountains, to 6.4 km in the Northwest Catalina mountains. Average temperature of emplacement of the pluton from the plagioclase-hornblende thermometer was calculated to be 680oC, with some samples indicating much higher temperatures. These preliminary results suggest that the ductile detachment system formed at a shallow depth no greater than 8 km, and was either the result of, or influenced by, the thermal incursion during the emplacement of the Catalina Granite pluton. Furthermore, this study sheds some light on the development of metamorphic core complexes; while some may be very deep and long lived, others, such as the Catalina core complex, are shallow and short lived.",

Polarization analysis is a widely accepted method for studying the orientation and directional characteristics of seismic phases via. computed attributes, but similarity is ordinarily discussed using qualitative comparisons with reference values. Here we introduce a technique for quantitative polarization similarity that uses weighted histograms computed in short, overlapping time windows, drawing on methods adapted from the image processing and computer vision literature. Our method accounts for ambiguity in azimuth and incidence angle and variations in signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. Using records of the Mw=8.3 Sea of Okhotsk earthquake from CNSN broadband sensors in British Columbia and Yukon Territory, Canada, and vertical borehole array data from a monitoring experiment at Hoadley gas field, central Alberta, Canada, we demonstrate that our method is robust to station spacing. Discrete wavelet analysis extends polarization similarity to the time-frequency domain in a straightforward way. Because histogram distance metrics are bounded by [0 1], clustering allows empirical time-frequency separation of seismic phase arrivals on single-station three-component records. Array processing for automatic seismic phase classification may be possible using subspace clustering of polarization similarity, but efficient algorithms are required to reduce the dimensionality.",

We examined 207 well preserved craters in this diameter range distributed across the moon using high resolution Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera Wide Angle Camera Mosaic (WAC) and Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) data. A map of the distribution of the 207 craters on the Moon using the global LROC WAC mosaic has been attahced with the abstract. By examining craters of similar diameter, impact energy is nearly constant, so differences in shape and morphology must be due to either target (e.g., porosity, density, coherence, layering) or impactor (e.g., velocity, density) properties. On the basis of the crater morphology, topographic profiles and depth-diameter ratio, the craters were classified into simple, craters with slumped walls, craters with both slumping and terracing, those containing a central uplift only, those with a central uplift and slumping, and the craters with a central uplift accompanied by both slumping and terracing, as shown in the image. It was observed that simple craters and craters with slumped walls occur predominately on the lunar highlands. The majority of the craters with terraced walls and all classes of central uplifts were observed predominately on the mare. In short, in this size range craters in the highlands were generally simple craters with occasionally some slumped material in the center, and the more developed features (terracing, central peak) were associated with mare craters. This is somewhat counterintuitive, as we expect the highlands to be generally weaker and less consolidated than the mare. We hypothesize that the presence of rheologic layering in the mare may be the cause of the more complex features that we observe. Relatively weak layers in the mare could develop through regolith formation between individual flows, or perhaps by variations within or between the flows themselves.",

To adequately estimate and counteract upon their risk, sound global scientific information on hazards due to storm surges and tides is required. Recently, a first global tide and storm surge reanalysis (GTSR) has been prepared (Muis et al., 2015) that provides a 36 year time series of sea levels, along with extreme value statistics. The GTSR is established using a physically based model, forced by meteorological reanalysis data.\nValidation of GTSR showed that tropical storms are underrepresented, firstly, due to the fact that they occur rarely and then only affect a limited area, and secondly, because the spatio-temporal resolution of reanalysis wind and pressure fields is too low to accurately represent the strong spatio-temporal variability of tropical storms.\nIn this contribution, we are improving GTSR by contributing a large amount of historical tropical storm tracks into the analysis as a first step to accommodate tropical storms in the reanalysis. We estimate how the statistics of the meteorological extremes in pressure and wind are changing, and consequently, how this translates into new statistics of storm surge extremes.",

Previous studies of climate controls on flows have primarily focused on perennial streams, and few studies have examined the effect of climate variability on intermittent streams. Our objectives in this study were to (1) identify regions showing similar patterns of intermittency, and (2) evaluate the sensitivity of intermittent streams to historical variability in climate in the United States. This study was carried out at 265 intermittent streams by evaluating: (1) correlations among time series of flow metrics (number of zero-flow events, the average of the central 50% and largest 10% of flows) with precipitation (magnitudes, durations and intensity) and temperature, and (2) decadal changes in the seasonality and long-term trends of these flow metrics. Results identified five distinct seasonal patterns of flow intermittency: fall, fall-to-winter, non-seasonal, summer, and summer-to-winter intermittent streams. In addition, strong associations between the low-flow metrics and historical climate variability were found. However, the lack of trends in historical variations in precipitation results in no significant seasonal shifts or decade-to-decade trends in the low-flow metrics over the period of record (1950 to 2013).",

The political and ideological polarization of this doubt led Vandenbergh, Raimi, and Gilligan [1] to propose that prediction markets for climate change might influence the opinions of those who mistrust the scientific community but do trust the power of markets.\nWe have developed an agent-based simulation of a climate prediction market in which traders buy and sell future contracts that will pay off at some future year with a value that depends on the global average temperature at that time. The traders form a heterogeneous population with different ideological positions, different beliefs about anthropogenic global warming, and different degrees of risk aversion. We also vary characteristics of the market, including the topology of social networks among the traders, the number of traders, and the completeness of the market. Traders adjust their beliefs about climate according to the gains and losses they and other traders in their social network experience.\nThis model predicts that if global temperature is predominantly driven by greenhouse gas concentrations, prediction markets will cause traders' beliefs to converge toward correctly accepting anthropogenic warming as real. This convergence is largely independent of the structure of the market and the characteristics of the population of traders. However, it may take considerable time for beliefs to converge. Conversely, if temperature does not depend on greenhouse gases, the model predicts that traders' beliefs will not converge.\nWe will discuss the policy-relevance of these results and more generally, the use of agent-based market simulations for policy analysis regarding climate change, seasonal agricultural weather forecasts, and other applications.\n[1] MP Vandenbergh, KT Raimi, & JM Gilligan.

Magnetic minerals change their magnetic properties with temperature [3]. Heating (during a fire, laboratory, with the purpose of manufacturing a product, etc.) can modify a number of sediment properties [4, 5].\nHeat-induced sediment mineralogical changes may cause irreversible changes in the sediment mineral structure and composition, and they occur at a wide range of temperature [6]. We provided measurements of magnetic susceptibility on samples from the Stara Jimka (SJ) paleo lacustrine site in the Bohemian Forest using magnetic susceptibility meter MS-30.\nSediment samples of approximately 0.2 cm thickness were weighed and put into plastic containers. First, measurements of magnetic susceptibility were taken on wet samples. Then the containers were put into the oven and sediment was dried at temperature of 110°C. After drying and cooling to room temperature, measurements of magnetic susceptibility were repeated. Dry samples were also weighed.\nComparison of magnetic susceptibility of dry versus wet samples showed higher values of magnetic susceptibility of dry samples. This enhancement was probably caused during oven-drying, when constituents of sediment (mainly clays) underwent heat-induced changes. We also compared volume normalized values of magnetic susceptibility with mass normalized values. Mass normalized magnetic susceptibility was burdened by greater noise.\n",

This record covers the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) to Little Ice Age (LIA) and the Current Warm Period (CWP) at centennial to sub-decadal resolution. The aim of the study is to reconstruct the patterns of aeolian sedimentation as well as the most important processes that control the input of this material to understand how these components reflect atmospheric climate variability during the last millennium. Assuming that the mineral fraction of the sediment is composed of several lognormally distributed particle populations, we applied an iterative least-square fitting routine to determine the number and the characteristics of the individual particles populations. This allows inferring the spatial and temporal variation of particles populations and thus transport mechanisms involved. Two components with grain size modes at 54±11 µm and 90±11 µm related with local aeolian erosion over the Pisco region were found. Our results showed active aeolian erosion during the second half of the MCA and rapid decrease from the MCA to the LIA. During the LIA the aeolian deposition exhibited a decreasing activity. During the CWP the aeolian deposition increased progressively. Comparison with others South American records indicates that those changes are linked to change in the meridional position of the Intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and South Pacific Subtropical High (SPSH) at the centennial time resolution. Finally the CWP period showed an increase in the aeolian deposition and thus in the wind intensity over the past two centuries. This likely represents the result of the modern position of the ITCZ–SPSH system and the associated intensification of the local and regional winds. Nevertheless, the aeolian deposition and in consequence the wind intensity and variability of the last 100 yr are stronger than during the second sequence of the MCA under similar position of the ITZC-SPSH. This trend suggests an additional forcing in the intensification of the atmospheric circulation, consistent with the pattern of climate change.",

Thus, there is a growing need to understand what would be required to achieve deep decarbonization (DD) in different economies. We examined the technical and economic feasibility of such a transition in the United States, evaluating the infrastructure and technology changes required to reduce U.S. GHG emissions in 2050 by 80% below 1990 levels. Using the PATHWAYS and GCAM models, we found that this level of decarbonization in the U.S. can be accomplished with existing commercial or near-commercial technologies, while providing the same level of energy services and economic growth as a reference case based on the U.S. DOE Annual Energy Outlook. Reductions are achieved through high levels of energy efficiency, decarbonization of electric generation, electrification of most end uses, and switching the remaining end uses to lower carbon fuels. Incremental energy system cost would be equivalent to roughly 1% of gross domestic product, not including potential non-energy benefits such as avoided human and infrastructure costs of climate change. Starting now on the deep decarbonization path would allow infrastructure stock turnover to follow natural replacement rates, which reduces costs, eases demand on manufacturing, and allows gradual consumer adoption. Energy system changes must be accompanied by reductions in non-energy and non-CO2 GHG emissions.",

            "abstract": "From sol 810 through to 950 the MSL Curiosity Rover carried out detailed investigations at Pahrump, which likely represents the lowest strata of Mount Sharp. The bulk chemistry is very different compared to previously encountered formations like Sheepbed at Yellowknifebay, which resembled an average Mars composition. The bedrock is significantly depleted in Mg and Ca, elevated in Al and Si and enriched in Zn (~2000 ppm), Se (~50 ppm) and Pb(~100 ppm). The composition varies only slightly over the ~10 meter elevation explored at Pahrump and is chemically homogenous on a 10 cm scale. However, some clear trends uphill are present. Zn and Se decrease with elevation, the Fe/Mn ratio, a possible indicator for the Fe3+ content, increases from 50 to 100. Elevated 2.5% P2O5 were encountered at higher elevations. SO3 ranges from 5 to 8% in the drill samples, higher abundances were found in Ca-sulfate veins and diagenetic features that contain ~15% (Mg,Ni)-sulfates.\nThe Pahrump bedrock may be traced ~500m to the north and south. Bonanza King (sol 755, Hidden Valley) and Spokane (sol 989) share the same major chemistry, including similar trends in minor and trace elements. Most recently the rover approached a contact between Pahrump-like bedrock and an overlying, more resistant unit identified from orbit at Marias Pass. High SiO2, ranging from 63 to 72%, was found close to the contact, above which the sandstone composition changes abruptly to that of average Mars.\nIncreased Si is correlated with elevated P and Ti, lower Al and Fe, and a dramatic decrease in Zn, Ni and Cr to very low values of a few 100 ppm and less. The elevated silica and associated elemental trends observed at Marias Pass share characteristics with the high silica bedrock examined at HomePlate in Gusev Crater, where acidic leaching or silica mobilization has been proposed. The stratigraphy together with data from 4 drill samples for SAM and Chemin might shed light on the formation history of this extensive facies at the base of Mount Sharp.",

            "abstract": "Urbanization alters watershed hydrological processes; impervious surfaces increase runoff generation, while storm sewer networks increase connectivity between runoff sources and streams. Stormwater control measures (SCMs) that enhance stormwater infiltration have been proposed to mitigate these effects by functioning as stormwater sinks. Regenerative stormwater conveyances structures (RSCs) are an example of infiltration-based SCMs that are placed between storm sewer outfalls and perennial stream networks. Given their location, RSCs act as critical nodes that regulate stormwater-stream connectivity. Therefore, the storage capacity of a RSC structure may exert a major control on the frequency, duration, and magnitude of these connections. This project examined both hydrogeological and hydro-climatic factors that could influence storage capacity of RSC structures. We selected three headwater (5-48 ha) urban watersheds near Annapolis, Maryland, USA. Each watershed is drained by first-order perennial streams and has been implemented with a RSC structure. We conducted high-frequency precipitation and stream stage monitoring below the outlet of each RSC structure for a 1-year period. We also instrumented one of the RSC structures with groundwater wells to monitor changes in subsurface storage over time. Using these data, we 1) identified rainfall thresholds for RSC storage capacity exceedance; 2) quantified the frequency and duration of connectivity when the storage capacity of each RSC was exceeded; and 3) evaluated both event-scale and seasonal changes in groundwater levels within the RSC structure. Precipitation characteristics and antecedent precipitation indices influenced the frequency and duration of stormwater-stream connections. We hypothesize both infiltration limitations and storage limitations of the RSCs contributed to the temporal patterns we observed in stormwater-stream connectivity. We also observed reduced storage potential as contributing area and percent impervious cover increased. Overall, the efficacy of urban SCMs for mitigating the impacts of urbanization and reducing stormwater-stream connectivity is dependent on both climate and the landscape context in which they are placed.",

Bioremediation of AMD relies on microbial communities to oxidize and thus remove iron from the system. Iron-oxidation rates in AMD environments are highly variable across sites. At Scalp Level Run in Summerset County PA, iron-oxidation rates are five to eight times faster than other coal-associated AMD sites. We examined the microbial community at Scalp Level Run to determine whether a unique microbial community may be responsible for the observed rapid iron-oxidation rates. Using MiSeq sequence tags, 16S rRNA gene clone libraries, and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we found that Scalp Level Run sediments host microbial populations closely related to the betaproteobacterium Ferritrophicum radicicola, an iron-oxidizing species isolated from an acid mine drainage wetland in Virginia. Ferritrophicum spp. was not found at the four other coal-associated AMD sites in the study and is uncommon in the published literature. The influence of Ferritrophicum spp. populations in biogeochemical cycling, specifically their role in determining the iron-oxidation rate at Scalp Level Run is unknown.

However, these studies do not have sufficient temporal or spatial resolution to determine the rate and extent of these uplift events. The presence of a complicated uplift history on a ‘stable’ passive continental margin is surprising, and many different mechanisms have been proposed to explain it.\nWe quantify the late Quaternary rate and wavelength of uplift relative to sea-level from suites of coastal terraces along the coastline of Angola. Automated extraction and correlation of terrace remnants from digital topography uncovers a symmetrical uplift, with diameter ~1000 km, and centred near Benguela at latitude 13°S. We perform OSL and radiocarbon dating on sediments overlying a coastal terrace at 30 m at Benguela and show that it formed ~40-45 ka. At this time the sea surface was ~50 m lower than today, implying an uplift rate of ~2.3 mm/yr. This is an order of magnitude higher than previously obtained uplift rates (which are averaged over a longer period).\nThe ~1000 km wavelength and observed rapid uplift rates strongly suggest that the uplift is the surface expression of dynamic mantle processes. This rapid uplift rate cannot have persisted continuously over million year timescales, and we therefore suggest that the topography may be modulated by relatively short-lived pulses of uplift, possibly driven by the pulsing of an underlying plume.",

Despite their importance in controlling volume and timing of runoff, snowpack albedo and SWE are still largely unquantified in the US and not at all in most of the globe, leaving runoff models poorly constrained. NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, in partnership with the California Department of Water Resources, has developed the Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO), an imaging spectrometer and scanning LiDAR system, to quantify SWE and snow albedo, generate unprecedented knowledge of snow properties for cutting edge cryospheric science, and provide complete, robust inputs to water management models and systems of the future.\nThis poster will describe the NASA Airborne Snow Observatory, its outputs and their uses and applications, along with recent advancements to the system and plans for the project’s future. Specifically, we will look at how ASO uses its imaging spectrometer to quantify spectral albedo, broadband albedo, and radiative forcing by dust and black carbon in snow. Additionally, we’ll see how the scanning LiDAR is used to determine snow depth against snow-free acquisitions and to quantify snow water equivalent when combined with in-situ constrained modeling of snow density.",

Recent advances in the theory of optimal resource allocation provide a path through which to test hypotheses regarding the governing controls of various plant traits. Here, we propose an optimal theoretical underpinning, based on the coordination hypothesis, for spatial and temporal variations in the maximum rate of carboxylation, Vcmax, and test the theory using observations from 1500 species at 300 sites worldwide.

            "abstract": "The causes of the rapid warming of West Antarctica in recent decades are not yet fully understood. Thus far, investigations of the phenomenon have emphasized the role of tropospheric teleconnections originating from the Tropics in austral winter, but have had less success in explaining the strong warming in austral spring (SON). Here, we further explore the mechanisms behind the SON warming by focusing on September, the month during which atmospheric temperature and circulation trends in and around West Antarctica largely account for the 3-month average SON trends. We show that the tropospheric trends toward lower pressures/heights (more cyclonic) over the South Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean previously reported extend vertically well into the stratosphere. In the lower troposphere, these circulation changes, by steering more warm air toward West Antarctica, have likely contributed to the warming of the region. In the stratosphere, we provide evidence that the cyclonic trends are associated with a very prominent stratospheric warming in the Australian sector, believed to be the result of increased tropically-forced planetary wave activity and wave breaking. Through thermal wind balance, this regional stratospheric warming has led to a poleward displacement of the polar-night jet south of Australia, leading to enhanced cyclonic motion and potential vorticity (PV) downwind over the Amundsen Sea region. Finally, we establish, through the PV inversion framework, a causal link between stratospheric and tropospheric changes, whereby large PV anomalies in the stratosphere induce consistent geopotential height anomalies down in the troposphere. Our results highlight not only the important and largely overlooked role played by the stratosphere in recent West Antarctic climate change, but also a new pathway for tropical climate variability to influence Antarctic climate.",

            "abstract": "In many delta’s of the world salinity intrusion imposes limits to fresh water availability. With increasing population and industry, the need for fresh water increases. But also salinity intrusion is expected to increase due to changes in river discharge, sea level and storm characteristics. In the Rhine-Meuse delta salt intrusion is impacted by human activities as well, like deepening of waterways and opening of delta-branches closed earlier. All these developments call for increasing the understanding of the system, but also for means for policy makers, coastal planners and engineers to assess effects of changes and to explore and design measures.\nIn our presentation we present the developments in interactive modelling of salinity intrusion in the Rhine-Meuse delta. In traditional process-based numerical modelling, impacts are investigated by researchers and engineers by following the steps of pre-defining scenario’s, running the model and post-processing the results. Interactive modelling lets users adjust simulations while running. Users can for instance change river discharges or bed levels, and can add measures like changes to geometry. The model will take the adjustments into account immediately, and will directly compute the effect. In this way, a tool becomes available with which coastal planners, policy makers and engineers together can develop and evaluate ideas and designs by interacting with the numerical model.\nWhen developing interactive numerical engines, one of the challenges is to optimize the exchange of variables as e.g. salt concentration. In our case we exchange variables on a 3D grid every time step. For this, the numerical model adheres to the Basic Model Interface (http://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki), which allows external control and the exchange of variables through pointers while the model is running.\nIn our presentation we further explain our method and show examples of interactive design of salinity intrusion measures in the Rhine-Meuse delta.",

Resource management in a changing climate is challenging because future climate change and resource responses cannot be precisely predicted. Scenario planning is a tool to assess the range of plausible future conditions. However, selecting, acquiring, synthesizing, and scaling climate information for scenario planning requires significant time and skills. This project, which was recently selected for funding by the NC CSC, has three goals: 1) synthesize climate data into 3-5 distinctly different but plausible climate summaries for the northern Great Plains region; 2) craft summaries of these climate futures that are relevant to local land management units; and 3) apply these local summaries to further develop quantitative climate-resource-management scenarios through participatory workshops and simulation models. We will engage multiple stakeholders in two focal areas within the region: southwestern South Dakota in the vicinity of Badlands National Park, and central North Dakota in the vicinity of Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site. This effort will increase climate change planning efficiency in the region; promote collaborations across jurisdictions; and develop a prototype for a novel, efficient, and replicable form of scenario planning that could serve additional management units.",

            "abstract": "Ice nucleation is an important process in the climate system as it influences global precipitation processes, and can affect the vertical distribution of clouds with effects that both cool and warm the atmosphere. Of the pathways to ice nucleation, immersion mode, which occurs when ice nuclei (IN) particles are surrounded by an aqueous phase that subsequently freezes, dominates primary ice production in mixed-phase clouds. A simple but effective method to study immersion freezing is to utilize a droplet freezing assay (DFA) that consists of an aluminum plate, precisely cooled by a continuous flow of an ethylene glycol-water mixture. Using such a system we study the immersion IN characteristics of bacterial isolates (for temperatures ranging from -15oC to 0oC) isolated from rainwater and air collected in Atlanta, GA and Puerto Rico, over storms throughout the year. Despite their relatively large size and the presence of hydrophilic groups on the outer membranes of many bacteria, it is unclear if bacteria possess an inherent ability to nucleate an aqueous phase (a requirement for immersion freezing) for the wide range of supersaturations found in clouds. For this, we measure the cloud condensation nucleation (CCN) activity of each isolate (over the 0.05% to 0.6% supersaturation range) using a Continuous Flow Streamwise Thermal Gradient CCN Counter. Initial results have shown certain isolates to be very efficient CCN, allowing them to form droplets even for the very low supersaturations found in radiation fogs. In combination, these experiments provide insight into the potential dual-ability of some bacteria, isolated from the southeastern United States and Puerto Rico, to act as both efficient CCN and IN.",

Inconsistencies persist between offshore records (suggesting the instability of WAIS) and McMurdo Dry Valley (MDV) terrestrial datasets (indicating long-term ice sheet stability). Here we use a high-resolution regional scale climate model (RegCM3_Polar) to reconstruct paleoclimate during MIS 31 (warm orbit, 400 ppm CO2) and assess changes in precipitation and winds (including katabatic) with WAIS present versus WAIS absent. The MIS 31 scenario with WAIS present resulted in minimal changes in wind magnitude compared with current climate conditions. With WAIS absent, the model predicts a decrease in coastal and highland monthly mean average wind velocities. The greatest rates of snowfall remain along the coast but shift towards higher latitudes with the interior continent remaining dry when WAIS is removed. Focusing on the Ross Embayment, this decreased monthly mean wind velocity and shift of winds to the east indicate a greater influence of offshore winds from the Ross Sea, enabling the increase of precipitation southward along the Transantarctic Mountains (TAM) (i.e. MDV). The apparent decrease of katabatic winds with no WAIS implies that offshore winds may be responsible for bringing the warmer, wetter air into the TAM. The change in wind and precipitation in the Ross Embayment and specifically the MDV highlights the impact of WAIS on Antarctic climate and its subsequent influence on the mass balance of peripheral EAIS domes (i.e. Taylor Dome). Modeling suggests that if WAIS was absent during MIS 31, we would expect (1) greater accumulation at such domes and (2) MDV terrestrial records that reflect a wetter climate, and (3) weaker winds suggesting possibly lower ablation/erosion rates compared to if WAIS was present.",

In the Northeastern United States, vector transmission is maintained in a horizontal transmission cycle between the vector, the black-legged ticks, and the vertebrate reservoir hosts, which include white-tailed deer, rodents and other medium to large sized mammals. Predicting how vector populations change with future climate change is critical to understanding disease spread in the future, and for developing suitable regional adaptation strategies. For the United States, these predictions have mostly been made using regressions based on field and lab studies, or using spatial suitability studies. However, the relation between tick populations at various life-cycle stages and climate variables are complex, necessitating a mechanistic approach. In this study, we present a framework for driving a mechanistic tick population model with high-resolution regional climate modeling projections. The goal is to estimate changes in black-legged tick populations in New England for the 21st century. The tick population model used is based on the mechanistic approach of Ogden et al., (2005) developed for Canada. Dynamically downscaled climate projections at a 3-kms resolution using the Weather and Research Forecasting Model (WRF) are used to drive the tick population model. ",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_poster_RKChu_2015-print.pdf\nSoil organic matter (SOM) is a complex mixture of above and belowground plant litter and microbial residues, and is a key reservoir for carbon (C) and nutrient biogeochemical cycling in different ecosystems. A limited understanding of the molecular composition of SOM prohibits the ability to routinely decipher chemical processes within soil and predict how terrestrial C fluxes will response to changing climatic conditions. Here, we present that the choice of solvent can be used to selectively extract different compositional fractions from SOM to either target a specific class of compounds or gain a better understanding of the entire composition of the soil sample using 12T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. Specifically, we found that hexane and chloroform were selective for lipid-like compounds with very low O:C ratios; water was selective for carbohydrates with high O:C ratios; acetonitrile preferentially extracts lignin, condensed structures, and tannin polyphenolic compounds with O:C > 0.5; methanol has higher selectivity towards lignin and lipid compounds characterized with relatively low O:C < 0.5. Hexane, chloroform, methanol, acetonitrile and water increase the number and types of organic molecules extracted from soil for a broader range of chemically diverse soil types. Since each solvent extracts a selective group of compounds, using a suite of solvents with varying polarity for analysis results in more comprehensive representation of the diversity of organic molecules present in soil and a better representation of the whole spectrum of available substrates for microorganisms. Moreover, we have developed a sequential extraction protocol that permits sampling diverse classes of organic compounds while minimizing ionization competition during ESI while increasing sample throughput and decreasing sample volume. This allowed us to hypothesize about possible chemical reactions relating classes of organic molecules that reflect abiotic and biotic processes impacting SOM composition.",

            "abstract": "Hydrometeorological monitoring networks are often limited for basins located in the developing world such as the transboundary Mara Basin. The advent of earth observing systems have brought satellite rainfall and evapotranspiration products, which can be used to force hydrological models in data scarce basins. The objective of this study is to develop improved hydrologic simulations using distributed satellite rainfall products (CMORPH and TMPA) with a bias-correction, and compare the performance with different input data and models. The bias correction approach for the satellite-products (CMORPH and TMPA) involves the use of a distributed reference dataset (CHIRPS) and historical ground gauge records. We have applied the bias-corrected satellite products to force the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model for the Mara Basin. Firstly, we calibrate the SWAT parameters related to ET simulation using ET from remote sensing. Then, the SWAT parameters that control surface processes are calibrated using the available limited flow. From the analysis, we noted that not only the bias-corrected satellite rainfall but also augmenting limited flow data with monthly remote sensing ET improves the model simulation skill and reduces the parameter uncertainty to some extent. We have planned to compare these results from a lumped model forced by the same input satellite rainfall. This will shed light on the potential of satellite rainfall and remote sensing ET along with in situ data for hydrological processes modeling and the inherent uncertainty in a data scarce basin.",

            "abstract": "For a large population around the globe, the accurate assessment of snow water equivalent (SWE) is crucial in estimating spring runoff as it relates to water resource management, flood hazard mitigation, drought monitoring, and climate change impacts. Despite some success in focused studies over a single watershed, a reliable cost effective remote sensing method to estimate SWE over large geographic areas still eludes the snow hydrology community. Investigations into using interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) to estimate snow water equivalent have yielded promising results. The InSAR method leverages the fact that at relatively low frequencies (L- and C-Band) differences in snow microstructure and layering do not significantly affect the radar backscatter of dry snow. At these frequencies, the main contribution of the radar backscatter is the snow/ground interface, and the difference in the timing of the radar propagation through the snowpack is related to the interferometric phase shift between acquisitions. Moreover, sensitivity of the InSAR SWE technique to density and number of layers appears to be low. Existing and future platforms both from air and space show potential of multi-temporal interferometric collections to track the evolution of the snowpack over an entire winter season. In the past, availability of InSAR data has been difficult for regions around the globe and during the winter seasons where the technique can be explored. Results from existing InSAR platforms will be presented as well as (and perhaps of more interest) the planned missions that hold the possibility of a dedicated InSAR platform with regular repeat coverage and no limitation on data distribution. Current airborne platforms with interferometric capabilities but with previous focus on glaciological, seismic, and soil moisture studies may also be considered for the application of InSAR estimation of SWE.",

Although wildfires have been widely recognized to be associated with drought events, the combined impacts of droughts and fires on carbon and water cycles in terrestrial ecosystems have not yet been investigated well. To fill this knowledge gap, we examined the interactive impacts of drought and fire disturbances on the terrestrial ecosystem carbon and water cycles by synthesizing climate datasets, fire disturbance datasets, satellite observations, and ecosystem model simulations at both regional and global levels. Our results show that extreme droughts substantially reduced global ecosystem productivity, evapotranspiration, and river discharge. Meanwhile, fire events exacerbate the reductions in ecosystem productivity and carbon storage. Our preliminary results show that global fires reduced global net primary productivity of 4.14 Pg C year-1 during 1901-2010. Our study further indicates that climate warming in the recent decades induced more extreme drought and fire events, which have threatened the ecosystem capacities for sequestering carbon as well as providing freshwater over many regions of the world.",

In this study, a new high-resolution moulin map is created from WorldView-1/2 imagery acquired during the 2012 record melt year for a 12,500 km2 area near Russell Glacier in southwest Greenland. A total of 1,236 moulins are mapped and categorized as being located: in crevasse fields, along a single ice fracture, within drained lake basins, or having no visible formation mechanism. We find the presence of moulins up to 1787 m elevation, with 11% of moulins found above 1600 m elevation: higher than previously mapped moulins and where glaciological theory suggests few moulins should form. Our study observes moulins in both extensional and compressional ice flow regimes (28% of moulins are found in areas of high extensional strain rate >0.005 yr-1), suggesting that strain rates are not a strong indicator of the likelihood for moulin formation. Overall, moulin density tends to increase with higher bed elevation, thinner ice, lower surface slope, higher velocity, and higher strain rate. In sum, moulins are most common in crevassed, thinner ice near the ice sheet edge, but significant quantities also develop at high elevations. This indicates that future inland expansion of melting may create hydrologic connections between the surface and the bed at higher elevations than previously thought.",

The summer warming episodes are defined as the above normal (1983-2012) June-August 2-m temperature anomalies, and are referred to as heat waves in this study. Two contrasting cases, the summers of 2006 and 2012, are explored in detail to illustrate the distinct roles of SSTs, and atmospheric and land initial conditions in driving U.S. summer heat waves. For 2012, simulations with the GFDL atmospheric general circulation model reveal that SSTs play a critical role. Further sensitivity experiments reveal the contributions of global SST warming and SSTs in individual ocean basins to the geographic distribution and magnitudes of warm temperature anomalies. In contrast to 2012, for 2006, the atmospheric and land initial conditions are key drivers. The atmospheric (land) initial conditions play a key (minor) role in the central and northwestern (north and east) of U.S..\nDue to changes in radiative forcing, the probability of areal averaged U.S. summer temperature anomalies exceeding the observed 2012 temperature anomaly increases with time over the early 21st century. La Nina (El Nino) events tend to increase (reduce) the occurrence of heat waves. The temperatures over the great central U.S. are mostly influenced by El Nino/La Nina. And, the central/western tropical Pacific plays a more important role than the eastern tropical Pacific. Thus, atmospheric and land initial conditions, SSTs and radiative forcing are all important drivers of, and sources of predictability for U.S. summer heat waves.",

Laguna Lejia (23°30'0\" S 67°42'0\" E ~4,300m asl), Chile is a small alkaline paleolake located in the central Altiplano. The volcanoes Lascar, Chiliques, Aguas Calientes and Acamarachi surround it. 1-3 mm laminations in calcareous clay sediments deposited on the southern terrace of Lejia record high-resolution chemical variability in the lake. Preliminary U-Th ages range from 19,567 +739/- 734 yr to 4208 +431/-429 yr, indicating that the Lejia terrace deposits span both CAPE I and the Younger Dryas, periods of rapid global climate change. Changes in the major and trace element composition, δ18O and δ13 C isotopic ratios, and the amount of Li, Mg, Ca, and Sr that can be readily leached from high magnesium smectite clays provide a direct proxy for hydrologic fluctuations. A climate signal can be detected through reoccurring trends in the chemical variability of these sediments; however, the detection of this signal is complicated by interaction with surrounding volcanic edifices. Statistical methods such as PCA analyses using R have been implemented to separate groupings of volcanic controlled elemental fluctuations (Fe, Zr, Nd, Ti, and Al) from ones under the influence of climate. Spectral analyses have been applied to high-resolution major element data collected on Lejia’s paleoshores tufa deposits. Data was collected on Ca, Mg and As at .5 um intervals using a Jeol JXA- 8230 Electron Microprobe at the University of Iowa, Earth and Environmental Sciences. These analyses provided statistical evidence for cyclisity at intervals of 5-15 um and 75-150 um in the banding of the tufas. While previous literature attributes the larger bands to annual chemical cycles the origin of the smaller bands is currently under investigation.",

The combination of sun-tracking and sky-scanning capability enables retrievals of wavelength-dependent aerosol optical depth (AOD), mode-resolved aerosol size distribution (SD), asphericity, and complex refractive index, and thus also the scattering phase function, asymmetry parameter, single-scattering albedo (SSA), and absorption aerosol optical thickness (AAOT).\nFrom 2012 to 2014 4STAR participated in four major field campaigns: the U.S. Dept. of Energy’s TCAP I & II campaigns, and NASA’s SEAC4RS and ARISE campaigns. Establishing a strong performance record, 4STAR operated successfully on all flights conducted during each of these campaigns. Sky radiance spectra from scans in either constant azimuth (principal plane) or constant zenith angle (almucantar) were interspersed with direct beam measurements during level legs. During SEAC4RS and ARISE, 4STAR airborne measurements were augmented with flight-level albedo from the collocated Shortwave Spectral Flux Radiometer (SSFR) providing improved specification of below-aircraft radiative conditions for the retrieval.\nCalibrated radiances and retrieved products will be presented with particular emphasis on detailed comparisons of ambient SSA retrievals and measurements during SEAC4RS from 4STAR, AERONET, HSRL2, and from in situ measurements.",

On Earth, most (water) precipitation falls in low latitudes, and more falls in the hemisphere with summer perihelion. On Titan, most (methane) precipitation falls in high latitudes, and more falls in the hemisphere with summer aphelion. We use a Titan general circulation model to elucidate the dynamical reasons for these different responses to orbital precession. They arise primarily because of the different rotation rates of Titan and Earth. The slower rotation rate of Titan leads to wider Hadley cells that transport moisture into polar regions. Variations in the length of summer near the poles, rather than in the intensity of summer insolation as in Earth's tropics, then dominate the precession response of the hydrologic cycle. We also investigate the generation, propagation and dissipation of the methane storms in the climates with different rotation rates. ",

            "abstract": "The Indian Rivers Inter-link project is a proposal by the Indian government to link several of India's major rivers via a network of reservoirs and canals. Variations of the IRI have been discussed since 1980, but the current plan has recently received increased support from the Indian government. Construction on three canals has controversially begun. If the Inter-link project moves forward, fourteen canals will divert water from tributaries of the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers to areas in the west, where fresh water is needed for irrigation. Additional canals would transport Himalayan sediments 500 km south to the Mahanadi delta and more than 1000 km south to the Godavari and Krishna deltas.\nWe investigate the impacts of the proposed diversions on sediment transport to the Mahanadi/Brahmani, Godavari, and Krishna deltas in India and the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta in Bangladesh. We map the entire river network and the proposed new nodes and connections. Changing watersheds are delineated using the Terrain Analysis Using Digital Elevation Models (TauDEM) Suite. Climate data comes from interpolation between observed precipitation stations located in China, Nepal, India, Bhutan and Bangladesh. Changes in water discharge due to the proposed canals are simulated using HydroTrend, a climate-driven hydrological water balance and transport model that incorporates drainage area, discharge, relief, temperature, basin-average lithology, and anthropogenic influences. Simulated river discharge is validated against observations from gauging stations archived by the Global Runoff Data Center (GRDC). HydroTrend is then used to investigate sediment transport changes that may result from the proposed canals. We also quantify changes in contributing areas for the outlets of nine major Indian rivers, showing that more than 50% of the land in India will contribute a portion of its runoff to a new outlet should the entire canal system be constructed.",

OpenGGCM has been modularized using the libMRC framework, so that components can easily be exchanged. For example, the MHD solver can be replaced by using a coupled version of the multi-fluid moment code Gkeyll, that handles multiple species and integrates kinetic effects, e.g., a full pressure tensor. We have also added the option to couple OpenGGCM to the widely used ATHENA code. Similarly, there are options for inner magnetosphere and ionosphere models.\nMesh refinement is available in the new version, enabling the use of a computational grid that puts very high resolution at the reconnection current sheets at the dayside magnetopause and in the magnetotail while saving computational effort using a coarser resolution in regions that have no small-scale dynamics. Mesh refinement is implemented as a number of sparse-matrix multiplications to fill ghost cells, and to correct fluxes and electric fields. It supports exact flux conservation for the cell-centered fluid quantities and the staggered Yee grid for the electromagnetic fields, maintaining the magnetic field divergence-free to machine precision.\nWe will present computational tests and show applications of the next-generation OpenGGCM to simulations of reconnection at Ganymede and at Earth's dayside magnetopause.",

            "abstract": "We assess the magnitude and variability of glacier and snow melt input to rivers draining the major glacierized and snow covered river basins of High Asia. The water budget provides a basic framework for hydrological analysis. Measurements of all components of the water budget allow the accuracy of estimates of each component to be checked. In glacierized catchments, the water budget is the balance between runoff, precipitation inputs (as rain or snow), loss by evaporation, and the release or uptake of water by soil moisture and ground water stores, snow cover, glaciers and permafrost, as well as by engineered reservoirs and lakes.\nIn this paper, we estimate these components of the water budgets of the Syr Darya, Amu Darya, Indus, Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers using a combination of station observations, satellite remote sensing and reanalysis output, mass balance measurements, and simple snow cover and glacier models. We estimate the errors for each of these terms with a view to answering the question; how well can we assess glacier and snow melt contributions. Monthly changes in land surface moisture storage are estimated from the difference between runoff and net precipitation (P-E) and also from GRACE. Net precipitation (P-E) is estimated from upper air fields from the NASA MERRA reanalysis using the aerological method and from observations and reanalysis fields of precipitation and evaporation. The challenge is to separate land surface moisture storage into the component reservoirs. Estimates of glacier mass balance in each basin are based on in situ measurements, satellite altimetry, and DEM differencing. Changes in snow storage and contributions from ice melt are estimated using simple accumulation and melt models. Estimates of soil moisture, groundwater and permafrost storage are taken from the literature.",

Another goal of this effort is updating the systematically relocated HVO catalog since 2009, when earthquake cataloging at HVO was migrated to the USGS Advanced National Seismic System Quake Management Software (AQMS) systems. To complement the relocation analyses of the catalogs generated from traditional STA/LTA event-triggered and analyst-reviewed approaches, we are also experimenting with subspace detection of events at Kilauea as a means to augment AQMS procedures for cataloging seismicity to lower magnitudes and during episodes of elevated volcanic activity. Our earlier catalog relocations have demonstrated the ability to define correlated or repeating families of earthquakes and provide more detailed definition of seismogenic structures, as well as the capability for improved automatic identification of diverse volcanic seismic sources. Subspace detectors have been successfully applied to cataloging seismicity in situations of low seismic signal-to-noise and have significantly increased catalog sensitivity to lower magnitude thresholds. We anticipate similar improvements using event subspace detections and cataloging of volcanic seismicity that include improved discrimination among not only evolving earthquake sequences but also diverse volcanic seismic source processes.\nMatoza et al., 2013, Systematic relocation of seismicity on Hawai`i Island from 1992 to 2009 using waveform cross correlation and cluster analysis, J.

Terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) are extremely bright bursts of gamma rays originating from thunderstorms. X-ray stepped leaders are bursts of x-rays coming from the lightning channel. It is known that the attenuation of these high-energy photons is a function of distance, losing energy and intensity at larger distances. To complement gamma-ray detectors on the ground it would be useful to measure the distance to the flash. Knowing the distance would allow for the true source fluence of gamma rays or x-rays to be modeled. A flash-bang detector, which uses a micro-controller, a photodiode, a microphone and temperature sensor will be able to detect the times at which lightning and thunder occurs. Knowing the speed of sound as function of temperature and the time difference between the flash and the thunder, the range to the lightning can be calculated.

            "abstract": "ePoster - untitled.pdf\nThe least-squares finite element method (LSFEM) is one of many ways in which one can discretize and express a set of first ordered partial differential equations as a mixed formulation. However, the standard LSFEM is not locally conservative by design. The absence of this physical property can have serious implications in the numerical simulation of subsurface flow and transport. Two commonly employed ways to circumvent this issue is through the Lagrange multiplier method, which explicitly satisfies the element-wise divergence by introducing new unknowns, or through appending a penalty factor to the continuity constraint, which reduces the violation in the mass balance. However, these methodologies have some well-known drawbacks. Herein, we propose a new approach to improve the local balance of species/mass balance. The approach augments constraints to a least-square function by a novel mathematical construction of the local species/mass balance, which is different from the conventional ways. The resulting constrained optimization problem is solved using the augmented Lagrangian, which corrects the balance errors in an iterative fashion. The advantages of this methodology are that the problem size is not increased (thus preserving the symmetry and positive definite-ness) and that one need not provide an accurate guess for the initial penalty to reach a prescribed mass balance tolerance. We derive the least-squares weighting needed to ensure accurate solutions. We also demonstrate the robustness of the weighted LSFEM coupled with the augmented Lagrangian by solving large-scale heterogenous and variably saturated flow through porous media problems. The performance of the iterative solvers with respect to various user-defined augmented Lagrangian parameters will be documented. ",

            "abstract": "The meteorological forcing on the inner shelf of Long Bay, South Carolina (USA) has been analyzed using wind records extending over a period of 10 years. This analysis identified three synoptic systems classified as cold fronts, warm fronts and tropical storms. The typical temporal evolution of each system has been fully characterized statistically; the associated temporal evolution of the offshore, directional, spectral wave conditions have also been identified for the duration of each event. These typical wind and wave conditions are used to numerically investigate the response of the inner shelf. In addition, the influence of the curved coastline is examined. The numerical experiments were carried out using the ROMS and SWAN models of the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment-Transport (COAWST) modeling system and the results are presented.\nThe results to-date suggest that, within the inner shelf a variability in the alongshore pressure gradient that is related to the alongshore variability of the relative angle between the wind forcing and the coastline. This coastline variability seems to affect the relative importance of the cross-shore / alongshore forcings creating different vertical structures of current at locations with different relative angle between wind forcing and coastline. Finally, the inclusion of the waves enhances the spatial differences observed for each case. These differences are explained in terms of momentum balance analysis.",

            "abstract": "Uncertainty in the quantity and timing of precipitation in a changing climate, combined with an increased demand for non-grain ethanol feedstock, may necessitate expanding the production of more water-use-efficient and less drought sensitive crops for biofuel applications. Research suggests that biomass sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is more drought tolerant and can produce more biomass than maize in water-limiting environments; however, sorghum water use data are scarce for the rain-fed Midwestern US. To address this gap, a replicated (n=3) side-by-side trial was established in Ames, Iowa to determine cumulative water use and water-use-efficiency of maize and biomass sorghum throughout the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons. Latent heat flux was estimated using the residual in the energy balance technique. Continuous micrometeorological measurements were supplemented by periodic measurements of leaf area index (LAI) and above-ground biomass. Water use (WU), aboveground biomass, and water-use-efficiency (WUE) were found to be similar for both crop types in 2014; data from the 2015 growing season are currently being processed. In 2015, leaf gas exchange measurements were made with a portable photosynthesis instrument. Photosynthetic parameters from gas exchange measurements will be implemented in a semi-mechanistic crop model (BioCro) as a method for scaling WUE estimates across the rain-fed Midwestern US driven with future climate projections. This research highlights the importance of understanding the potential effects of expanding biomass sorghum production on the hydrologic cycle of the Midwestern, US.",

The approach taken uses reduced order models so that systems simulations occur rapidly, even for simulations times of hundreds to thousands of years. In that way, uncertainties of the entire system can be probed in a reasonable time period, using a Monte Carlo approach. The model presented here uses third generation NRAP ROMs that are able to realistically represent several key properties of reservoirs, wells, seals, and groundwater aquifers. Results from the NRAP-IAM-CS model are used to quantify risk profiles for selected parameter distributions of reservoir properties, seal properties, numbers of wells, well properties, thief zones, and groundwater aquifer properties. A series of risk profiles show how the risk under different storage conditions evolves over time, both during injection, in the near-term post injection period, and over the long term. In this study, the NRAP-IAM-CS was also used to investigate the importance of different parameters across the system on risk of leakage and risk of groundwater contamination, under different storage conditions.",

            "abstract": "We explore the effects of fault zone nonlinearity on peak ground velocities (PGVs) by simulating a suite of surface rupturing earthquakes in a visco-plastic medium. Our simulations, performed with the AWP-ODC 3D finite difference code, cover magnitudes from 6.5 to 8.0, with several realizations of the stochastic stress drop for a given magnitude. We test three different models of rock strength, with friction angles and cohesions based on criteria which are frequently applied to fractured rock masses in civil engineering and mining. We use a minimum shear-wave velocity of 500 m/s and a maximum frequency of 1 Hz. In rupture scenarios with average stress drop (~3.5 MPa), plastic yielding reduces near-fault PGVs by 15 to 30% in pre-fractured, low-strength rock, but less than 1% in massive, high quality rock. These reductions are almost insensitive to the scenario earthquake magnitude. In the case of high stress drop (~7 MPa), however, plasticity reduces near-fault PGVs by 38 to 45% in rocks of low strength and by 5 to 15% in rocks of high strength. Because plasticity reduces slip rates and static slip near the surface, these effects can partially be captured by defining a shallow velocity-strengthening layer.\nWe also perform a dynamic nonlinear simulation of a high stress drop M 7.8 earthquake rupturing the southern San Andreas fault along 250 km from Indio to Lake Hughes. With respect to the viscoelastic solution (a), nonlinearity in the fault damage zone and in near-surface deposits would reduce long-period (> 1 s) peak ground velocities in the Los Angeles basin by 15-50% (b), depending on the strength of crustal rocks and shallow sediments. These simulation results suggest that nonlinear effects may be relevant even at long periods, especially for earthquakes with high stress drop.",

            "abstract": "Lithospheric strength models based on experimental data indicate that the behavior of the lower crust depends strongly on the availability of water. Similarly, geologic studies illustrate a correlation between a high proportion of amphibole and intense strain localization. Getsinger et al. (2013) showed that small changes in the activity of water in such a system can greatly affect the formation of amphibole which then impacts the strength, fabric evolution, and strain localization of the rock. Textures from these natural systems were reproduced in experiments on dynamically hydrated basalt (Getsinger and Hirth, 2014). We ran experiments to further investigate the role of amphibole-forming hydration reactions on the strength of mafic rocks and to quantify how rock strength varies as a function of water content. General shear experiments were conducted in a Griggs apparatus on powdered basalt (≤5 µm starting grain size) at lower crustal conditions where amphibole is stable (800 °C, 1 GPa) with added water contents from 0.1 to 1.5 wt%. X-ray diffraction data on the deformed samples demonstrated a strong correlation between the amount of added water and the abundance of amphibole; amphibole abundance increased from 11 wt% to 49 wt% (while pyroxene content decreased) over the range of water contents tested. Furthermore, we observed a strong linear correlation between the sample strength and the amphibole content. Previous experimental work indicates that amphibole and clinopyroxene have similar strengths. Thus, our results indicate that the variations in strength correlated with changes in water activity. These results highlight how petrological and microstructural constraints can be combined to infer the effective viscosity of lower crustal rocks and the role of water activity on strain localization.",

Indeed, the number lightning flashes in the umbrella and convective regions of the plume seems to correlate with lower, ice-forming temperatures. As in conventional thunderstorms, electric charge accumulation and separation in cold plumes may arise from the interplay between ice grains and graupel. However, charging may also be driven by triboelectrification (frictional charging), resulting from collisions between ice and ash grains. Decades of research have shown that fluidized granular materials comprising species of distinct composition often produce more efficient electrification than the interaction of chemically identical particles under similar hydrodynamic regime [e.g. Forward et al., 2009]. Thus, tribocharging in a combined ice and silicate granular flow is likely to yield grains with higher charges than those encountered in a flow composed solely of silicate grains, facilitating the generation of lightning [Méndez Harper and Dufek, 2015, submitted]. To indagate this hypothesis, we have developed a novel methodology to measure the time-dependent charging of individual micron-sized particles in both dry, silicate flows and silicate plus ice flows. Pure ash runs are conducted in a dry (<1 % humidity) environment with a temperature variation of -40o to 25o C. Runs involving ice are performed between -40o and 2o C, permitting us to quantify charging in the mixture as water transmogrifies from solid ice to a more mush-like substance. Additionally, we report on how collisional energy and rates influence electrification in these granular materials. We show that, although the variations in ash composition (basalt to rhyolite) tend to be of little consequence for charging, the presence of a water phase can importantly tune the electrostatic behavior of the flow.",

            "abstract": "The resolution of operational numerical prediction models is typically of the order of a few kilometres meaning that small-scale features of precipitation can not be resolved explicitly. This creates the need for representative parametrizations of microphysical processes whose properties should be carefully analysed. In this study we will focus on the COSMO model which is a non-hydrostatic limited-area model, initially developed as the Lokal Model and used operationally in Switzerland and Germany. In its operational version, cloud microphysical processes are simulated with a one-moment bulk scheme where five hydrometeor classes are considered: cloud droplets, rain, ice crystals, snow, and graupel. A more sophisticated two-moment scheme is also available. The study will focus on two case studies: one in Payerne in western Switzerland in a relatively flat region and one in Davos in the eastern Swiss Alps in a more complex terrain.\nThe objective of this work is to characterize the ability of the COSMO NWP model to reproduce the microphysics of precipitation across temporal and spatial scales as well as scaling variability. The characterization of COSMO outputs will rely on the Universal Multifractals framework, which allows to analyse and simulate geophysical fields extremely variabile over a wide range of scales with the help of a reduced number of parameters.\nFirst COSMO outputs are analysed; spatial multifractal analysis of 2D maps at various altitudes for each time steps are carried out for simulated solid, liquid, vapour and total water content. In general the fields exhibit a good quality of scaling on the whole range of available scales (2 km - 250 km), but some loss of scaling quality corresponding to the emergence of a scaling break are sometimes visible. This behaviour is not found at the same time or at the same altitude according to the water state and does not necessarily spread to the total water content. It is interpreted with the help of the underlying physical process at stake during the events.\nSecond Multifractal comparisons of model outputs will also be made with radar data provided by the Meteo Swiss, both indirectly in terms of precipitation intensities and directly using a polarimetric forward radar operator which is able to simulate radar observations from model outputs.",

We intend to conduct repeated circular airgun shooting around the seafloor borehole observatory with an interval of a year, aiming at detection (or evaluation) of temporal change of the P-wave anisotropy due possibly to change in the stress or pore-fluid pressure in the crust around the seismogenic fault preparing for the next large earthquake. So far, three airgun shooting experiments by JAMSTEC R/V Kairei has been conducted in Nov. 2013, Mar. 2015, and Jun. 2015, each with circular shootings 3 km away from the C0002G borehole. From each circular shooting data around the C0002G borehole seismometer, we obtained anisotropic P-wave velocity of the sediment around the borehole. The fast axis direction and magnitude of the anisotropy was more or less consistent and are 60 degrees and 2-3%, but reduction of P-wave velocity of approximately 1 % was identified between the first experiment and the second experiment. During the term between two experiments, an event of significant pore-fluid pressure increase due to nearby drilling by D/V Chikyu IODP Exp. 348, was observed in the borehole. Observed change in P-wave velocity may be associated with possible weakening of the sediment caused by the high fluid pressure during the drilling. The airgun shot data in the third experiment may be used to clarify if the observed change is persistent, but the observed P-wave velocity in the third experiment was significantly influenced by complex ocean sound velocity structure due to strong ocean current (Kuroshio) stayed above the observatory during the third experiment.",

ESA’s Sentinel-1 SAR mission employs the TOPS mode as the standard mode for acquiring InSAR data. It provides a continuous and large coverage at conventional resolution. The idea is to have a wide-area PSI for mapping countries and continents. Although PSI has been successfully demonstrated and validated in the past for various applications, there are some limitations for processing a large-scale dataset. First, PSI is most effective in urban areas which have a large number of stable scatterers. For large-scale PSI, even non-urban areas need to be processed; and this requires robust algorithms for scatterer selection, network construction and inversion, and atmospheric phase removal. Second, the computational load can be very high, due to which, the processing is usually divided into overlapping blocks and merged later. This can however lead to spatial error propagation. This paper presents algorithms which have been developed for a robust PSI reference network estimation, while mitigating error propagation. Instead of dividing the scene into overlapping blocks, a single network (i.e. arcs connecting the scatterers) is created for the full scene. The relative deformation and residual DEM are estimated for the arcs using the LAMBDA estimator. The relative measurements of the network are finally integrated via least-squares inversion. Here, the sparsity of the system of linear equations is exploited to deal with big data (e.g. 10,000,000 arcs for 500,000 scatterers is a typical configuration for Sentinel-1). A QR or LU parallelizable solver is used for fast inversion. Also, variances of the estimates are calculated using a selected parallel inversion method based on LDL decomposition. Demonstration of the algorithms for large-scale deformation monitoring is provided using available Sentinel-1 data for Germany.",

We aimed to provide a semantic infrastructure capable of representing data initially related to one large aquatic ecosystem research effort – the Jefferson project at Lake George. This effort includes significant historical observational data, extensive sensor-based monitoring data, experimental data, as well as model and simulation data covering topics including lake circulation, watershed runoff, lake biome food webs, etc. The initial measurement representation has been centered on monitoring data and related provenance. We developed a human-aware sensor network ontology (HASNetO) that leverages existing ontologies (PROV-O, OBOE, VSTO*) in support of measurement annotations. We explicitly support the human-aware aspects of human sensor deployment and collection activity to help capture key provenance that often is lacking. Our foundational ontology has since been generalized into a family of ontologies and used to create our human-aware data collection infrastructure that now supports the integration of measurement data along with simulation data. Interestingly, we have also utilized the same infrastructure to work with partners who have some more specific needs for specifying the environmental conditions where measurements occur, for example, knowing that an air temperature is not an external air temperature, but of the air temperature when windows are shut and curtains are open. We have also leveraged the same infrastructure to work with partners more interested in modeling smart cities with data feeds more related to people, mobility, environment, and living.\nWe will introduce our human-aware data collection infrastructure, and demonstrate how it uses HASNetO and its supporting SOLR-based search platform to support data integration and semantic browsing. Further we will present learnings from its use in three relatively diverse large ecosystem research efforts and highlight some benefits and challenges related to our semantically-enhanced foundation.",

Therefore, the study of the evolution of natural systems along with the investigation of the interactions between hydrology, geochemistry and geophysics can be highly beneficial for improving hydrologic predictions. In this study, a combined hydrologic, geophysical and geochemical approach is proposed to investigate the incipient heterogeneity in a small hydrologic system subject to intensive flux of water through a period of one year. The Mini-LEO is a sloping metallic lysimeter containing 1 m3 of granular basalt, constructed as a smaller scale version of Landscape Evolution Observatory (LEO) artificial hillslopes. The initially pristine soil inside the Mini-LEO had undergone several cycles of irrigation, which might have changed the internal structure of this system, as observed by both hydrometric data and corroborated by studies pointing out to a rapid weathering of the basaltic soil. A forensic approach was proposed, where the Mini-LEO was systematically excavated for the investigation of its initial signs of hydrologic co-evolution.\nThe lysimeter was sub-divided in voxels, for which 100 undisturbed soil samples and fragmented subsamples were collected for further analysis of soil hydraulic properties (saturated hydraulic conductivity and characteristic curve) as well as geochemical composition (elemental dissolution/accumulations and mineralogical transformations). Additionally, electrical resistivity (ER) measurements at different water content were measured for each sample. The results of this study are manifold: The expected geochemical signature will be used for validating current hydro-geochemical models of the Mini-LEO, and the superposition of the geochemical and hydraulic analysis will serve as discriminatory data for the results of geophysical investigation.",

            "abstract": "Integrated provenance and subsidence analysis of forearc and retroarc foreland basin strata were used to reconstruct the evolution of the southern margin of Eurasia during the Early to Late Cretaceous. The Cretaceous-Eocene Xigaze forearc basin, preserved along ~600 km of the southern Lhasa terrane, formed between the Gangdese magmatic arc and accretionary complex as subduction of Neo-Tethyan oceanic lithosphere accommodated the northward motion and subsequent collision of the Indian plate. Petrographic similarities between Xigaze forearc basin strata and Cretaceous-Eocene sedimentary rocks of the northern Lhasa terrane, interpreted as a retroarc foreland basin, were previously interpreted to record N-S trending river systems connecting the retro- and forearc regions during Cretaceous time. New sandstone petrographic and U-Pb detrital zircon provenance analysis of Xigaze forearc basin strata support this hypothesis. Qualitative and statistical provenance analysis using cumulative distribution functions and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests show that the forearc basin was derived from either the same source region as or recycled from the foreland basin. Quartz-rich sandstones with abundant carbonate sedimentary lithic grains and rounded, cobble limestone clasts suggests a more distal source than the proximal Gangdese arc. Therefore, we interpret that the northern Lhasa terrane was a significant source of Xigaze forearc detritus and track spatial and temporal variability in the connection between the retro- and forearc basin systems during the Late Cretaceous.\nA tectonic subsidence curve for the Xigaze forearc basin shows a steep and “kinked” shape similar to other ancient and active forearc basins. Initial subsidence was likely driven by thermal relaxation of the forearc ophiolite after emplacement while additional periods of rapid subsidence likely result from periods of high flux magmatism in the Gangdese arc and changes in plate convergence rate. Comparison of the subsidence history of the Xigaze forearc basin with the Cretaceous-Eocene retroarc foreland basin reveals coeval periods of rapid subsidence, specifically during the Aptian-Turonian, suggesting that the upper-plate was in an overall state of extension.",

            "abstract": "Like many large rivers draining from forested uplands, the South Fork of the Eel River is characterized by a warm main stem fed by small cold water tributaries along its length. The confluences of the tributaries with the main stem form localized zones of cold water which provide habitat for anadromous fish species such as salmon. These cold water refugia are likely to be increasingly important for fish as temperatures warm and rainfall becomes more erratic due to projected climate change. These sites are protected from drying out over summer (unlike the tributaries, which can fragment if flows become too low), and they are accessible to migrating fish (as tributaries may not be if winter flows are too low to submerge in-channel obstacles). The overall significance of these refugia, however, is controlled by their spatial extent and temporal persistence. The factors that determine the shape, persistence, and stability of these refugia (as a function of varying flow and temperature regimes) remain poorly understood. A combination of scaling arguments and a 2D model is used to estimate the effects of varying flow and thermal regimes on the spatial extent of the cold water zones in the main stem. The stability of the cold water zones is also assessed in light of diurnal flow and temperature variations. The results are compared to in situ temperature data collected at the confluence of the South Fork of the Eel River and Elder Creek, and are used to project the likely significance of tributary confluences for generating cold-water habitat throughout the South Fork of the Eel River.",

            "abstract": "In Scandinavia large earthquakes up to M~8.2 occurred 9500 yBP due to rapid deglaciation leaving fault scarps with lengths up to 160km and vertical offsets of at least 10 m. Today a lion share of local earthquakes are located to the vicinity of the faults. I show here from Coulomb failure stress modeling a physical connection between clustering of recent earthquakes and high Coulomb failure stresses around the faults. This can be interpreted In such a fashion that the location of the current earthquakes resembles locations of aftershock sequences. The explanation is that when these faults where formed it was due to state of stress in the crust at time of deglaciation, different from today's conditions. The crust was heavily depressed at deglaciation about 250 m in the region and due of the receding icesheet the crust was subjected to high stresses resulting in fault motion. This fault motion occurred in order to minimize state of stress at deglaciation. However, this state of stress has since changed with the regional postglacial uplift and thus today these faults remain as perturbations in the crust with concentrations of high stresses. I elaborate on this mechanism. I also advocate that this correlation between high stressed fault areas and locations of earthquakes indicates that seismicity within stable continental regions like Scandinavia might be caused by previous crustal disturbances that show local perturbations of the stress field. Therefore if faults are favorably oriented in the present stress field they can be released by brittle earthquake faulting . Thus past transient tectonic events can explain part of the stable continental region's seismicity. This may be of large importance to assessment of seismic hazard within stable continental regions particularly for critical structures like e.g., nuclear waste deposits and hydroelectric dams.",

The national assessment is conducted at a regional scale, covers all 50 states, and incorporates data from remote sensing, land change studies, aquatic and wetland data, hydrological and biogeochemical modeling, and wildfire mapping to estimate baseline and future potential carbon storage and greenhouse gas fluxes. The LandCarbon web application is a geospatial portal that allows for a sophisticated data delivery system as well as a suite of engaging tools that showcase the LandCarbon data using interactive web based maps and charts. The web application was designed to be flexible and accessible to meet the needs of a variety of users. Casual users can explore the input data and results of the assessment for a particular area of interest in an intuitive and interactive map, without the need for specialized software. Users can view and interact with maps, charts, and statistics that summarize the baseline and future potential carbon storage and fluxes for U.S. Level 2 Ecoregions for 3 IPCC emissions scenarios. The application allows users to access the primary data sources and assessment results for viewing and download, and also to learn more about the assessment’s objectives, methods, and uncertainties through published reports and documentation. The LandCarbon web application is built on free and open source libraries including Django and D3. The GIF has developed the Django-Spillway package, which facilitates interactive visualization and serialization of complex geospatial raster data. The underlying LandCarbon data is available through an open application programming interface (API), which will allow other organizations to build their own custom applications and tools. New features such as finer scale aggregation and an online carbon calculator are being added to the LandCarbon web application to continue to make the site interactive, visually compelling, and useful for a wide range of users.",

            "abstract": "A major weakness of forest ecosystem models is their inability to capture the diversity of responses to changes in water availability, severely hampering efforts to predict the fate of tropical forests under climate change. Such models often prescribe moisture sensitivity using heuristic response functions that are uniform across all individuals and lack important knowledge about trade-offs in hydraulic traits. We address this weakness by implementing a process representation of plant hydraulics into an individual- and trait-based model (Trait Forest Simulator; TFS) intended for application at discrete sites where community-level distributions of stem and leaf trait spectra (wood density, leaf mass per area, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus content) are known. The model represents a trade-off in the safety and efficiency of water conduction in xylem tissue through hydraulic traits, while accounting for the counteracting effects of increasing hydraulic path length and xylem conduit taper on whole-plant hydraulic resistance with increasing tree size. Using existing trait databases and additional meta-analyses from the rich literature on tropical tree ecophysiology, we obtained all necessary hydraulic parameters associated with xylem conductivity, vulnerability curves, pressure-volume curves, and hydraulic architecture (e.g., leaf-to-sapwood area ratios) as a function of the aforementioned traits and tree size. Incorporating these relationships in the model greatly improved the diversity of tree response to seasonal changes in water availability as well as in response to drought, as determined by comparison with field observations and experiments. Importantly, this individual- and trait-based framework provides a testbed for identifying both critical processes and functional traits needed for inclusion in coarse-scale Dynamic Global Vegetation Models, which will lead to reduced uncertainty in the future state of tropical forests.",

Thickness of surface warm water as well as SST is expected to have an influence on regulating global climate because of its potential to provide heat to atmosphere. A number of paleoceanographic studies have reconstructed SST in this region and revealed that changes in SST is very similar to atmospheric CO2 in glacial-interglacial timescale. However, little is known about changes surface warm water thickness, i.e. thermocline depth, in the past. For better understanding the heat content of ocean surface, changes in depth of thermocline is investigated. Here, we reconstruct sub-surface water temperature in the western tropical Pacific for the last 380 kyr. The sub-surface temperature reconstruction is done by Mg/Ca-thermometry of thermocline dweller planktonic foraminifer, Pulleniatina obliquiloculata. This species dwells around the depth of thermocline, and its temperature record is expected to reflect vertical migration of thermocline. The glacial-interglacial amplitude of sub-surface temperature is larger than that of SST. The precessional cycle is dominant in the sub-surface temperature variability. Such features are well consistent with model output by EMIC LOVECLIM although amplitudes are much smaller in model. Concomitant changes of sub-surface temperature and terrestrial input suggests that thermocline change is closely related to precessional controlled ITCZ movement. The high frequent variability during the MIS3 implies D-O oscillation related thermocline change in the millennial timescale.",

            "abstract": "Accurate measurements of vegetation structure are critical for reducing uncertainties in carbon science and biodiversity studies. In recent years, Lidar has emerged as a state-of-the-art technology for characterizing vegetation structure at various spatial scales. Single photon lidar (SPL) is one of the latest developments with much greater data acquisition efficiency than conventional lidar. SPL requires only one photon to record a detection for each ranging measurement as against thousands in the case of other lidar systems. In this study, we present results from an experimental SPL instrument- the High Resolution Quantum Lidar System (HRQLS). HRQLS was flown over an entire county in western Maryland, USA in September 2013 to acquire a dataset with a mean density of 13 pts/m2. We developed a multistage filtering method to remove solar noise in the raw HRQLS data, and derived a county-wide high-resolution Canopy Height (1m) and Digital Elevation Model (2 m) from the de-noised dataset. Next, we assessed the accuracy of HRQLS CHM and DEM with existing field data, National Geodetic Survey data, and an existing discrete return lidar (DRL) dataset. A comparison of canopy heights between SPL, DRL and field data showed similar results with much higher detail from SPL data. There was also a good agreement between ground elevations from SPL, DRL and geological survey data. Our results demonstrate SPL capabilities in acquiring accurate canopy structure and topographic measurements over large areas, which can greatly benefit forest carbon monitoring and habitat assessments.",

            "abstract": "Ecohydrological processes governing the dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems and its response and feedback to climate change occur at diverse spatial and temporal scales. To accurately capture the dynamics of ecohydrological processes in the model, its critically important to capture the subgrid scale heterogeneity of the landscape and develop scale aware process representation and parameterization. This study focused on the Arctic tundra landscape at Seward Peninsula of Alaska. Ecohydrological processes in this sensitive landscape are strongly governed by the physical and structural properties (like topography, soil, permafrost, geomorphology etc.) of the landscape, environmental conditions (like temperature, precipitation, light, radiation) and biotic conditions (vegetation, above/below biomass and organic matter, disturbance history etc.). From site to watershed to regional (scale at which models often operate), landscape is a complex mosaic of a range of biotic and abiotic properties. We have developed and applied a hierarchical characterization and classification approach to segment the landscape in distinct units which can be used to develop and parameterize process models at local scale. We also analyze how the distribution and organization of the landscape units as building blocks influence and interact with ecosystem processes across scales. Our goals is understand the landscape organization principles and their roles to inform and improve process based models of ecohydrological processes in Arctic tundra landscape.",

These resources address practices that support the whole student, both in the classroom and as a part of the co-curriculum as well as information on geoscience careers, guidance for developing coherent degree programs, practical advice for mentoring and advising, and many others.\nIn addition to developing web resources, InTeGrate has also undertaken an effort to profile successful program practices at a variety of institutions. An analysis of these data shows several common themes (e.g. proactive marketing, community building, research experiences) that align well with the existing literature on what works to support student success. But there are also indications of different approaches and emphases between Minority Serving Institutions (MSIs) and Primarily White Institutions (PWIs) as well as between different kinds of MSIs.

            "abstract": "The validation of footprint scale soil moisture is severely limited because of the scale discrepancy between footprint scale soil moisture and observed ground based data that is typically used to validate soil moisture products. Scale discrepancy poses a problem in validation because of the difference in land-surface heterogeneity encompassed between the two scales. In this study, we propose a data-driven, scale appropriate scheme that can be used to validate footprint scale soil moisture. The designed scheme generates the spatial variance structure of footprint scale moisture redistribution as a function of a scale appropriate dominant physical factor on which soil moisture redistribution depends. The scheme was developed for a variety of heterogeneous conditions found in 3 regions (Arizona, Iowa and Oklahoma) with different hydro-climates and 3 footprint scales (0.8 km, 1.6 km and 3.2 km). Our results indicate that the spatial variance of moisture redistribution can be effectively modelled as a function of the most dominant physical control (linking parameter- α’, Figure 1) with minimum mean R2 = 0.8 and maximum mean RMSE = 0.119 in each case. In order to make the validation scheme potentially transferrable to regions with heterogeneity that is different from the data used, the validation scheme was extended by exploiting the relationship between soil moisture, scale and heterogeneity through a conceptualized ‘Scale-Wetness-Heterogeneity (SWHET) cuboid’ (Figure 1). The SWHET cuboid is described by a scale index, wetness index, and a newly defined heterogeneity index which can adequately quantify the land-surface heterogeneity across scales. The proposed SWHET cuboid can potentially serve as a look-up graph to model the spatial variance of footprint scale moisture redistribution as a function of the dominant physical controls. The within region validation of SWHET resulted in rmse values <0.002 in all three regions. The SWHET generated from this study is season and location specific for now but has the potential to be temporally and spatially (across different hydro-climates) transferable.",

            "abstract": "Venus Express completed its nearly 9 year campaign at Earth’s sister planet in late 2014. During this period the onboard fluxgate magnetometer collected data up to 64 Hz in frequency near periapsis. This is the expected frequency range for lightning-generated whistler-mode waves at Venus, between the local electron (~100 Hz) and ion gyrofrequencies (~1 Hz). These waves are right-hand circularly polarized and are guided by the local magnetic field. When the Venusian ionopause is low enough to reside in the collisional region, the interplanetary magnetic field can get carried down with the ions and magnetize the lower ionosphere. As the field travels towards terminator it gains a radial component, enabling whistlers to reach higher altitudes and be detected by the spacecraft.\nThe mission covered almost an entire solar cycle and frequently observed a magnetized ionosphere during the solar minimum phase when the ionosphere was weak due to reduced incident EUV. In addition, the detection rate of whistler-mode signals varied with the solar cycle. Here, we examine the changes in the ionospheric properties associated with the evolution of the solar cycle and the rate of detection of these lightning-generated signals.",

            "abstract": "The structural analysis of amorphous materials, glasses and liquids at extreme conditions using X-ray diffraction is a very challenging endeavor. The samples are typically very small and surrounded by pressure vessels, which result in a huge background signal which may be orders of magnitude stronger than the actual sample signal. Furthermore, the background signal changes during compression in diamond anvil cells (DAC), making analysis of the diffraction data impossible at large pressures (>60 GPa). A key factor for obtaining high quality structural data is the maximum obtainable Q of the data collection. While at ambient conditions a maximum Q of more than 20 Å-1 has become standard, at high pressures data have been reported and analyzed with a maximum Q as low as 7 Å-1, which significantly reduces the resolution of the obtained real space data for multicomponent systems.\nIn order to overcome those challenges, we have successfully installed a multichannel collimator (MCC) for the DAC setup at APS/GSECARS 13-IDD and for the Paris Edinburgh Press (PEP) at 13-IDC. The MCC leads to a significant increase in signal to background ratio and the background remains almost constant during compression in a DAC and removes the additional diffraction signal from the pressure media in the PEP.\nThe combination of MCC and the high-energy X-ray optics of the 13ID beamline enables data collection of melts, glasses and amorphous materials up to 10 GPa in the PEP with a maximum Q of about 16 Å-1 and the collection of amorphous materials and glasses up to pressures above 150 GPa with a maximum Q of about 13 Å-1, thus, enabling the structural investigation of amorphous materials at much larger pressures than previously achievable.\nFurther, we have developed several new user-friendly software packages for the analysis of X-ray diffraction data with specific data reduction and optimization algorithms for the analysis of amorphous materials at high-pressure.\nIn order to show the capabilities of the new setups we will present results on the structure of selected melts up to 6 GPa measured in the PEP and on the structure of SiO2 glass up to 180 GPa.",

            "abstract": "Predominant forms of food and energy systems pose multiple challenges to the environment as current configurations tend to be structured around centralized one-way through-put of materials and energy. One proposed form of system transformation involves locally integrating “unclosed” material and energy loops from food and energy systems. Such systems, which have been termed integrated food-energy systems (IFES), have existed in diverse niche forms but have not been systematically studied with respect to technological, governance, and environmental differences. This is likely because IFES can have widely different configurations, from co-located renewable energy production on cropland to agroforestry.\nAs a first step in creating a synthesis of IFES, our research team constructed a taxonomy using exploratory data analysis of diverse IFES cases (Gerst et al., 2015, ES&T 49:734-741). It was found that IFES may be categorized by type of primary product produced (plant- or animal-based food or energy) and the degree and direction of vertical supply chain coordination.\nTo further explore these implications, we have begun a study of a highly-coordinated, animal-driven IFES: dairy farms with biogas production from anaerobic digestion of manure. The objectives of the research are to understand the barriers to adoption and the potential benefits to the farms financial resilience and to the environment. To address these objectives, we are interviewing 50 farms across New York and Vermont, collecting information on farmer decision-making and farm operation. These results will be used to calibrate biophysical and economic models of the farm in order understand the future conditions under which adoption of an IFES is beneficial.",

By collecting and analyzing injection heights and their relationships with other factors, we aim to understand how much of an effect the eruptions have on climate, wind systems, energy budget and the water cycle. The study collected emission height of SO2 from major volcanic eruptions from 2002-2012 estimated with several different techniques, including the empirical relationships between the volcanic eruption magnitude and injection height, the retrieval of plume height from MISR stereo imaging, the spectral linear fitting using SO2 column amount from OMI, and the back trajectory analysis. From these comparisons and observations of volcanic plume transport patterns, we construct a database of \"volcanic source function\" that contains our optimal estimation of volcanic injection heights for major volcanoes together with the total SO2 amount from OMI. This database will be implemented into the GEOS-5 model to study the environmental effects of volcanic eruptions.",

            "abstract": "The Radio Occultation and Heavy Precipitation experiment aboard the PAZ Low Earth Orbiter (ROHP-PAZ) will test, for the first time, the new polarimetric radio occultation (RO) concept. This is a mission of opportunity: The Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MICINN) approved in 2009 a proposal to include a polarimetric Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) RO payload on board of the Spanish Earth Observation satellite PAZ. The launch of the satellite is scheduled for October 2015, and it will be followed by a 6-month commissioning phase period and has an expected life of 7 years, with a goal of 10 years.\nThe concept is similar to that used in some polarimetric weather radars: to measure the differential phase shift between the two polarimetric components of the received signal, although in this case we will use the forward scattering geometry instead of the backscattering one. It will allow us to retrieve precipitation and other hydrometeors information, and simultaneous thermodynamic vertical profiles which will help to the understanding of the thermodynamic processes beyond heavy rain events. \nA sensitivity analysis has been performed, showing that the rain-induced effect is above PAZ detectability threshold in 90% of the events with along-ray averaged rain rate higher than 5 mm/h. Also, a ground field campaign has been conducted prior to the launch of the satellite. The measurements from the campaign have shown the first experimental evidences that precipitation and frozen hydrometeors induce a noticeable effect into the polarimetric RO observables. \nWe will present here the actual status of the mission and the results from the field campaign. We will also discuss the results of the theoretical study of the thermodynamics and the effects of rain and frozen hydrometeors into standard and polarimetric RO, based on a large collocation exercise of COSMIC and TerrasSar-X with TRMM, GPM and CloudSat.",

            "abstract": "Geomaterials containing nano-pores (e.g., shales and carbonate rocks) have become increasingly important for emerging problems such as unconventional gas and oil resources, enhanced oil recovery, and geologic storage of CO2. Accurate prediction of coupled geophysical and chemical processes at the pore scale requires realistic representation of pore structure and topology. This is especially true for chalk materials, where pore networks are small and complex, and require characterization at sub-micron scale. In this work, we apply laser scanning confocal microscopy with various filters to characterize pore structures and microlithofacies at a thin-section scale (micron resolution) and dual focused ion beam-scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) for 3D imaging of nanometer-to-micron scale microcracks and pore distributions. With imaging techniques advanced for nano-pore characterization, it is critical to define representative sampling of FIB-SEM images and apply it to the thin-section or larger scale. In this work, several texture characterization techniques are applied for segmentation clusters represented by a couple of 3-D FIB-SEM image stacks per each cluster. Pore structure evolution is characterized based on geometric and topological properties from a set of FIB-SEM images and lattice-Boltzmann method (LBM) is used to obtain permeability at several different scales. Upscaling of permeability to the Darcy scale (e.g., the thin-section scale) with image dataset will be discussed with emphasis on understanding microfracture-matrix interaction, representative volume for FIB-SEM sampling, and multiphase flow and reactive transport.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.",

Robust interpretation of the paleoenvironmental contexts requires detailed facies analysis of these rocks including analysis and interpretation of sedimentary structures and sediment body geometries. Here, we describe some of the detailed sedimentary structures and sedimentary geometries observed by Curiosity between the Pahrump_Hills field site and its current location at Marias Pass.\nThe Pahrump Hills sedimentary section comprises a succession dominated by finely laminated mudstones of the Murray formation that are interpreted to have been deposited in an ancient lake within Gale crater. Toward the top of the Pahump Hills succession, we observe the appearance of coarser-grained sandstones that are interstratified within the lacustrine mudstones. These sandstones that include Whale Rock and Newspaper Rock show lenticular geometries, and are pervasively cross-stratified. These features indicate that currents eroded shallow scours in the lake beds that were then infilled by deposition from migrating subaqueous dunes. The paleoenvironmental setting may represent either a gullied delta front setting or one in which lake level fall caused fluvial erosion and infilling of the shallow scours.\nSince leaving Pahrump_Hills, Curiosity has imaged extensive exposures of strata that are partly correlative with and stratigraphically overlie the uppermost part of the Pahrump section. Isolated cross-bedded sandstones and possible interstratified conglomerates beds occur within Murray formation mudstones. Capping sandstones with a likely variety of environmental contexts overlie mudstones. Where imaged in detail, sedimentary structures, such as trough-cross bedding and possible eolian pinstriping, provide constraints on plausible sedimentary processes and bounds on depositional setting.",

We show results of numeric models (the advection-diffusion equation solver Tephra2, and particle-tracking models) informed by NOMADS atmospheric data used to model this fallout. Models show strong winds (up to 25 m/s) toward the east and southeast concentrating the narrow deposit in those directions, and the vertical variation of wind direction predicts particle sorting along the wind-transverse direction. Both of these were observed in the field. We discuss the challenges faced by fallout models of scoria: because of its irregular shapes, high and variable porosity, and propensity to break apart on impact, aerodynamic properties are difficult to assess by physical observations. This introduces ambiguity when comparing models to observations. Finally, we demonstrate how short-term hazard predictions can benefit from the integration of fallout models with weather forecasts up to several days in advance, and how hazard communication to the public can benefit from snapshots and animations showing zones subject to tephra fall and time delays from eruption to impact.",

A microstructural study is undertaken on inherited sub-continental mantle at some distance to the continent. We sampled peridotite containing discrete mylonitic shear-zones away (~400 m) from the exhumation surface and mylonitic peridotite found as clasts in a cataclasite at the top of the exhumed mantle exposed at the paleo-seafloor.\nThe mylonitic blocks in the cataclasite are formed by unmixed areas of olivine (ol) - orthopyroxene (opx) or clinopyroxene (cpx) - amphibole (amph). The amph has all crystallographic axes parallel to cpx axes with [001] axes perpendicular to the foliation plane suggesting epitaxial growth without stress. However, in the ol – opx areas, olivine has [001] axes parallel to the lineation and [010] axes perpendicular to the foliation plane suggesting [001] slip. This mylonite is probably the record of a deep and early deformation before fluid percolation.\nThe peridotite is amph bearing spinel lherzolite and displays a pervasive high temperature foliation. The peridotite contains ultra-mylonitic zones formed by elongated cpx and ol grains (1:10 aspect ratio) forming ribbons and sliding planes. Olivine [100] axes are parallel to the lineation and [010] axes perpendicular to the foliation plane suggesting [100] slip. However, [100]cpx axes are parallel to the lineation and [100]ol axes, while [010]cpxaxes are perpendicular to the foliation plane. The shape, size and crystallographic preferred orientations of ol and cpx suggest the interplay between diffusion creep, grain boundary sliding and mineral precipitation. The discrete mylonitic shear zones cutting the peridotite are 1cm to 10cm-thick and represent an extreme localization of the deformation. They contain a mixed matrix of ol, pyroxenes, spinel and amph with grains up to 15 µm in size with round shapes. The ol shows a strong concentration of [010] axes perpendicular to foliation plane with other axes forming girdles within the foliation plane suggesting axial [010] deformation.\nDuring mantle exhumation the mineral distribution and proportion, the fluid percolation and the mineralogical reaction lead to the activation of variable deformation mechanisms at mm or cm scale.",

Hydrological models are useful tool in water and land resource development and decision-making for watershed management. Moreover, simulation of hydrological processes improves understanding of the environmental dynamics and helps to manage and protect water resources and the environment. MIKE SHE, an advanced integrated modeling system is used to simulate the hydrological processes of the Tim Branch watershed with the objective of developing an integrated modeling system to improve understanding of the physical, chemical and biological processes within the Tims Branch watershed. MIKE SHE simulates water flow in the entire land based phase of the hydrological cycle from rainfall to river flow, via various flow processes such as, overland flow, infiltration, evapotranspiration, and groundwater flow. In this study a MIKE SHE model is developed and applied to the Tim branch watershed to study the watershed response to storm events and understand the water balance of the watershed under different climatic and catchment characteristics. The preliminary result of the integrated model indicated that variation in the depth of overland flow highly depend on the amount and distribution of rainfall in the watershed. The ultimate goal of this project is to couple the MIKE SHE and MIKE 11 models to integrate the hydrological component in the land phase of hydrological cycle and stream flow process. The coupled MIKE SHE/MIKE 11 model will further be integrated with an Ecolab module to represent a range of water quality, contaminant transport, and ecological processes with respect to the stream, surface water and groundwater in the Tims Branch watershed at Savannah River Site.",

The glaciated regions of the Canadian Archipelago and the Gulf of Alaska are the next largest ice mass loss contributors outside of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. Here we estimate the ice mass change of these regions since 2003 using time-variable gravity data from the GRACE mission. We employ an estimation technique based on spherical Slepian localization functions. These Slepian functions form a sparse set of orthogonal basis functions for a specific region and maximize the signal-to-noise levels of the gravity fields, making them excellent candidates to analyze regional data on the sphere.\nBetween 2003 and 2012 Ellesmere Island lost mass (-38 Gt/yr) at an accelerating rate (-8 Gt/yr2), while Baffin Island lost mass at a lower rate (-22 Gt/yr) with very low acceleration. During this time, interannual variations were well described by an average seasonal cycle. Since 2013 ice mass in Ellesmere and Baffin islands, as well as Greenland, have diverged from their long term mass change trends. During the summer of 2013 these areas had the lowest recorded melt since the start of the GRACE mission. Through the end of 2014, the difference between the observed mass and the extrapolated long term trend for Greenland grew to over 500 gigatons. In contrast to the Canadian Archipelago, the Gulf of Alaska region has average seasonal mass variations four times larger per unit area and greater variability from year to year. Recent years of below average mass loss have lowered the average mass loss rate from previous estimates.",

            "abstract": "As an effective method of extracting land cover fractions based on spectral endmembers, spectral mixture analysis (SMA) has been applied using remotely sensed imagery in different spatial, temporal, and spectral resolutions. A number of studies focused on arid/semiarid ecosystem have used SMA to obtain the land cover fractions of GV, NPV/litter, and bare soil (BS) using MODIS reflectance products to understand ecosystem phenology, track vegetation dynamics, and evaluate the impact of major disturbances. However, several challenges remain in the application of SMA in studying ecosystem phenology, including obtaining high quality endmembers and increasing computational efficiency when considering to long time series that cover a broad spatial extent.\nOkin (2007) proposes a variation of SMA, named as relative spectra mixture analysis (RSMA) to address the latter challenge by calculating the relative change of fraction of GV, NPV/litter, and BS compared with a baseline date. This approach assumes that the baseline image contains the spectral information of the bare soil that can be used as an endmember for spectral mixture analysis though it is mixed with the spectral reflectance of other non-soil land cover types. Using the baseline image, one can obtain the change of fractions of GV, NPV/litter, BS, and snow compared with the baseline image. However, RSMA results depend on the selection of baseline date and the fractional components during this date. In this study, we modified the strategy of implementing RSMA by introducing a step of obtaining a soil map as the baseline image using multiple-endmember SMA (MESMA) before applying RSMA. The fractions of land cover components from this modified RSMA are also validated using the field observations from two study area in semiarid savanna and grassland of Queensland, Australia.",

            "abstract": "The dynamic mechanism of the formation of South China Sea (SCS) has been debated for decades. The anisotropic structure can provide useful insight into the complex evolution of SCS by indicating its mantle flow direction and strength. In this study, we employ shear wave splitting methods on two half-year seismic data collected from 10 and 6 passive source Ocean Bottom Seismometers (OBS) respectively. These OBSs were deployed along both sides of the extinct ridge in the central basin of SCS by Tongji University in 2012 and 2013 respectively, which were then successfully recovered in 2013 and 2015 respectively. Through processing and inspecting the global and regional earthquakes (with local events being processing) of the 2012 dataset, measurements are made for 2 global events and 24 regional events at 5 OBSs using the tangential energy minimization, the smallest eigenvalue minimization, as well as the correlation methods. We also implement cluster analysis on the splitting results obtained for different time windows as well as filtered at different frequency bands. For teleseismic core phases like SKS and PKS, we find the fast polarization direction beneath the central basin is approximately NE-SW, nearly parallel to the extinct ridge in the central basin of SCS. Whereas for regional events, the splitting analysis on S, PS and ScS phases shows much more complicated fast directions as the ray path varies for different phases. The fast directions observed can be divided into three groups: (1) for the events from the Eurasia plate, a gradual rotation of the fast polarization direction from NNE-SSW to NEE-SWW along the path from the inner Eurasia plate to the central SCS is observed, implying the mantle flow is controlled by the India-Eurasia collision; (2) for the events located at the junction of Pacific plate and Philippine plate, the dominant fast direction is NW-SE, almost perpendicular to Ryukyu Trench as well as sub-parallel to the absolute direction of Philippine plate; (3) for the events occurred in the SE direction near the Philippine Fault zone, the observed NE-SW fast direction is sub-parallel to the subduction direction of the Philippine plate.",

While climate changes relatively slowly, compared to a tsunami, the increasing variance in weather over time and warming must also be considered in terms of civil impacts. A simple example is the decreasing resilience of coastal communities to severe weather as sea level increases. The integration of these data for modeling and response activities in near-real-time must be pursued to make data collection practical. We present an approach to data and metadata integration that has occurred over the past 10-20 years in Earth and Ocean sciences that provide a model for the future. The NSF Data Federation Consortium (DFC) is working to integrate data and metadata from a number of fields using iRODS (Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System). iRODS is open source software for building distributed data collections. In particular, the SCION (SCIence Observatory Network) funded by the NSF provides Python-based software for data and metadata access from a variety of near-real-time data sets relevant to climate studies including weather and hazards from other observational systems. As an example, we are working on the integration of data on shore and offshore in southern California using resources from the High Performance Wireless Research and Education Network (HPWREN) and the Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing System (SCCOOS). National and International integration of near-real-time earthquake data through the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS) and the International Federation of Digital Seismic Networks (FDSN) provide a well-integrated data and metadata system for both research and civil uses. ObsPy, written in Python, has proved to be a highly successful methodology for accessing global data from thousands of stations with well-developed metadata. The persistence of the data and metadata, in turn, provides long-term provenance particularly important for climate data. We discuss these various tools and the current state of efforts in broader integration of Earth data.",

Interpreted LULC maps were produced for three points in time (1975, 2000, 2013), and LULC change statistics extracted from them. (2) The MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used as a proxy for bioproductivity and temporal trends of annual mean, maximum and minimum NDVI extracted at the sampling dots of known LULC for the period 2000-2013. The trends were analyzed with respect to the most prominent LULC classes and transitions, in particular from agriculture to natural vegetation and vice versa, and stratified by regions of similar mean annual precipitation.\nThe most important LULC change over the almost 40-year period is a progressive expansion of agricultural lands, which has been responsible for major incursions into the region's remaining savannas and woodlands. To a lesser extent, abandonment of agriculture has given rise to long term fallow and eventually reversion to steppe or savanna. Another important change observed is the expansion of open steppe at the expense of savanna in the Sahel region.\nIn terms of bioproductivity, while no significant trends in NDVI predominate overall, there are more instances of positive than of negative significant trends across the region. Contrary to our initial expectations, preliminary results show little systematic association between LULC change and direction and magnitude of trends in NDVI over the same time period 2000-2013. Though drastically altering vegetation composition and biodiversity, the expansion of agriculture into savanna is not found to be associated with a widespread loss of bioproductivity.",

However, details of the geometry and the depth that the plate penetrates werelargely unknown. Since 2004, temporary experiments and the expansion of the permanent network of the Servicio Sismológico Nacional (SSN, Mexican National Seismological Service) have improved resolution of the plate geometry and have helped to map its descent into the upper mantle.\nGoing from northwest to southeast, the Cocos plate appears to be fragmenting into north and south segments. The north segment subducts with an angle of ~30º and the south with an angle of ~10-15º. The transition is smooth near the trench and progresses to a tear at depth; this coincides with the projection of the Orozco Fracture Zone to depth. Also, this transition marks the limit of the presence to the south of an ultra slow velocity layer (USL) on top of the slab.South of this transition, the Cocos plate subducts horizontally , underplating the North American plate for a distance of ~140 to ~300 km from the trench. Along this horizontal region, silent slow events (SSE) and tectonic tremor (TT) have been observed. At a distance of 300 km from the trench (beneath central Mexico), the plate dives into the mantle with an angle of 76º to a depth of 500 km. This geometry changes abruptly to the south, marking the eastern limit of the USL. This change seems to be also characterized by a tear on the slab. Finally to the south, the Cocos plate subducts with a constant angle of 26º.\nThis presentation summarizes the work of many contributors including A. Arciniega-Ceballos, M. Brudzinski, E.

Simultaneously, our societies transform towards urbanized, highly educated, service-based culture, where a decreasing population will gain its livelihood from primary production. We study various ecosystem interactions in a changing climate and integrate these with reindeer husbandry and the indigenous Sámi culture dependent on it1. Potential climate impacts include the transformation of arctic-alpine tundra to dense scrubland with conceivable consequences to reindeer husbandry, but also global warming due to decreasing albedo. The social-ecological system (SES) of reindeer husbandry includes administrative and ecological processes that do not always correspond (Figure 1). Consequently, management priorities and administration may conflict with local social and ecological processes, bringing about risks of environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity and defeat of traditional livelihoods. We hypothesize the plausibility to support the indigenous reindeer herding livelihood against rapid external changes by utilizing the migratory reindeer grazing system of the Sámi as a management tool for sustaining the high-albedo tundra and mitigating global warming. Our first-of-a-kind satellite-based high resolution vegetation map covering Northern Fennoscandia allows detailed management plans. Our ecological research demonstrates the important role of herbivory on arctic vegetation communities. Interactive workshops with reindeer herders offer indigenous knowledge of state and changes of the ecosystems, and reflect the threats and expectations of the herders. We are currently building models of the complex social-ecological system of Northern Fennoscandia and will report the first findings of the exercise.\n1 www.ncoetundra.utu.fi\nFigure 1.

A shallow sand and gravel aquifer provides abundant water for agricultural irrigation but also supplies critical base flow to cold-water trout streams. These needs compete with one another, and stakeholders from various perspectives are collaborating to seek solutions. Stakeholders were engaged in providing and verifying data to guide construction of a groundwater flow model which was used with linear and sequential linear programming to evaluate optimal tradeoffs between agricultural pumping and ecologically based minimum base flow values. The connection between individual irrigation wells as well as industrial and municipal supply and streamflow depletion can be evaluated using the model. Rather than addressing 1000s of wells individually, a variety of well management groups were established through k-means clustering. These groups are based on location, potential impact, water-use categories, depletion potential, and other factors. Through optimization, pumping rates were reduced to attain mandated minimum base flows. This formalization enables exploration of possible solutions for the stakeholders, and provides a tool which is transparent and forms a basis for discussion and negotiation.",

            "abstract": "The Source Physics Experiments (SPE) is a project funded by the U.S. Department of Energy at the National Nuclear Security Site. The project consists of a series of underground explosive tests designed to gain more insight on the generation and propagation of seismic energy from underground explosions in hard rock media, granite. Until now, four tests (SPE-1, SPE-2, SPE-3 and SPE-4Prime) with yields ranging from 87 kg to 1000 kg have been conducted in the same borehole. The generation and propagation of seismic waves is heavily influenced by the different damage mechanisms occurring at different ranges from the explosive source. These damage mechanisms include pore crushing, compressive (shear) damage, joint damage, spallation and fracture and fragmentation, etc. Understanding these mechanisms and how they interact with each other is essential to the interpretation of the characteristics of close-in seismic observables. Recent observations demonstrate that, for relatively small and shallow chemical explosions in granite, such as SPE-1, -2 and -3, the formation of a cavity around the working point is not the main mechanism responsible for the release of seismic moment. Shear dilatancy (bulking occurring as a consequence of compressive damage) of the medium around the source has been proposed as an alternative damage mechanism that explains the seismic moment release observed in the experiments. In this work, the interaction between cavity formation and bulking is investigated via a series of computer simulations for the SPE-2 event. The simulations are conducted using a newly developed material model, called AZ_Frac. AZ_Frac is a continuum-based-visco-plastic strain-rate-dependent material model. One of its key features is its ability to describe continuum fracture processes, while properly handling anisotropic material characteristics. The implications of the near source numerical results on the close-in seismic quantities, such as reduced displacement potentials and source spectra are presented.",

            "abstract": "Dust variability in the climate system has been studied for several decades, yet there remains an incomplete understanding of the dynamical mechanisms controlling interannual and decadal variations in dust transport. The sparseness of multi-year observational datasets has limited our understanding of the relationship between climate variations and atmospheric dust. We use available in situ and satellite observations of dust and a century-length fully coupled Community Earth System Model (CESM) simulation to show that the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) exerts a control on North African dust transport during boreal summer. In CESM, this relationship is stronger over the dusty tropical North Atlantic than near Barbados, one of the few sites having a multi-decadal observed record. During strong La Niña summers in CESM, a statistically significant increase in lower tropospheric easterly wind is associated with an increase in North African dust transport over the Atlantic. Barbados dust and Pacific SST variability are only weakly correlated in both observations and CESM, suggesting that other processes are controlling the cross-basin variability of dust. We also use our CESM simulation to show that the relationship between downstream North African dust transport and ENSO fluctuates on multidecadal timescales and is associated with a phase shift in the North Atlantic Oscillation. Our findings indicate that existing observations of dust over the tropical North Atlantic are not extensive enough to completely describe the variability of dust and dust transport, and demonstrate the importance of global models to supplement and interpret observational records.",

The hypothesis is that each satellite AOD product or CTM has its unique strengths and weaknesses, and a combination of them can yield a better estimation of surface PM2.5. We conduct an experiment study for a one-year (i.e., 2012) period to test this hypothesis. First, two sets of model-based surface PM2.5 are obtained from WRF-Chem and GEOS-Chem. Second, four sets of satellite-estimated surface PM2.5 are generated from MODIS (Aqua) and VIIRS AODs by multiplying the ratio of each model's collocated PM2.5 to AODs; these are MODIS/GEOS-Chem, MODIS/WRF-Chem, VIIRS/GEOS-Chem and VIIRS/WRF-Chem. We evaluate the satellite-estimated PM2.5 of each set and their ensemble averages against EPA’s hourly in-situ measurements at 650 sites within the contiguous United States. The results show that the ensemble averages are overall in better agreement with the EPA’s measurements, although some ensemble members could perform better in some regions.",

            "abstract": "Soils are among the largest emission sources of nitrous oxide (N2O), which is a strong greenhouse gas and is the leading stratospheric ozone depleting substance. Thus, there is a rising concern for mitigating N2O emissions from soils. And yet, our understanding of the global magnitude and the impacts of soil N2O emissions on the climate and the stratospheric ozone layer is still limited, and our ability to mitigate N2O emissions thus remains a challenge. One approach to assess the global magnitude and impacts of N2O emissions is to use global biogeochemical models. Currently, most of these models use a simple or a conceptual framework to simulate soil N2O emissions. However, if we are to reduce the uncertainty in determining the N2O budget, a better representation of the soil N2O emissions process is essential. In our attempts to fulfill this objective, we have further improved the parameterization of soil N2O emissions in the Community Land Model with coupled Carbon and Nitrogen (CLM-CN) by implementing the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model and validated our model results to existing measurements. We saw a general improvement in simulated N2O emissions with the updated parameterization and further improvements for specific sites when the model was nudged with measured soil temperature and moisture data of the respective site. We present the latest updates and changes made to CLM-CN with one-way coupled DNDC model (CLMCN-N2O) and compare the results between model versions and against other global biogeochemical models.",

The solutions are obtained applying a consistent numerical framework for dis- crete integrations of the various nonhydrostatic flow equations. Moist extension of the baroclinic instability benchmark is formulated as an analog of the dry case. Flow patterns, surface vertical vorticity and pressure, total kinetic energy, power spectra, and total amount of condensed water are analyzed. The climate bench- mark extends the baroclinic instability study by addressing long-term statistics of an idealized planetary equilibrium and associated meridional transports. Short-term deterministic anelastic and compressible so- lutions differ significantly. In particular, anelastic baroclinic eddies propagate faster and develop slower owing to, respectively, modified dispersion relation and abbreviated baroclinic vorticity production. These eddies also carry less kinetic energy, and the onset of their rapid growth occurs later than for the compressible solutions. The observed differences between the two solutions are sensitive to initial conditions as they di- minish for large-amplitude excitations of the instability. In particular, on the climatic time scales, the anelastic and compressible solutions evince similar zonally averaged flow patterns with the matching meridional transports of entropy, momentum, and moisture.",

Snow metamorphism, then, affects the strength of surface albedo feedback and changes the radiative energy budget of the planet. The Near-Infrared Emitting Reflectance Dome (NERD) is an instrument in development designed to measure snow effective radius from in situ bidirectional reflectance factors (BRFs) by illuminating a surface with nadir positioned light emitting diodes centered around 1.30 and 1.55 microns. Better understanding the dependences of BRFs on snow grain shape and size is imperative to constraining measurements taken by the NERD. Here, we use the Monte Carlo method for photon transport to explore BRFs of snow surfaces of different shapes and sizes. In addition to assuming spherical grains and using Mie theory, we incorporate into the model the scattering phase functions and other single scattering properties of the following nine aspherical grain shapes: hexagonal columns, plates, hollow columns, droxtals, hollow bullet rosettes, solid bullet rosettes, 8-element column aggregates, 5-element plate aggregates, and 10-element plate aggregates. We present the simulated BRFs of homogeneous snow surfaces for these ten shape habits and show their spectral variability for a wide range of effective radii. Initial findings using Mie theory indicate that surfaces of spherical particles exhibit rather Lambertian reflectance for the two incident wavelengths used in the NERD and show a monotonically decreasing trend in black-sky albedo with increasing effective radius. These results are consistent with previous studies and also demonstrate good agreement with models using the two-stream approximation.",

There are concerns that climate change will cause changes in the intensity and frequency of tropical cyclones. Therefore, the quantification of the water and energy fluxes that occur during a tropical cyclone's life cycle are important for anticipating the magnitude of damages that are likely to occur. This study used HURDAT2 storm track information and data from the satellite-derived SeaFlux and TRMM products to determine changes in precipitation, wind, and latent and sensible heat throughout the life cycle of Hurricane Katrina. The variables were examined along and around the storm track, taking averages both at stationary 5x5 degree boxes and within the instantaneous hurricane domain. Analysis focused on contributions of convergence and latent heat to the storm evolution and examined how the total flux was related to the storm intensity. Certain features, such as the eye, were not resolved due to the data resolution, but the data captures the general trend of enhanced flux levels that are due to the storm's presence. Analysis also included examination of the water and energy budgets as related to convergence and the sensible and latent heat fluxes.",

A failure to recognize the importance of bioavailability factors on metal toxicity can result in criteria that are over- or under-protective. USEPA addresses the tendency of the national Water Quality Criterion (WQC) for regulation of copper in marine waters to underestimate the natural attenuation of copper toxicity in harbors by the application of site-specific Water Quality Standards (WQS). Which provides the level of protection intended by the WQC, and establishes realistic regulatory objectives. However, development of site-specific WQS involves a long-term effort, and does not account for temporal variation. The toxicity model seawater-Biotic Ligand Model (BLM) was developed and integrated with the existing Curvilinear Hydrodynamics in 3 Dimensions (CH3D) transport & fate model to create an efficient tool for development of site-specific WQS in harbors. The integrated model was demonstrated at a harbor-wide scale in San Diego Bay and Pearl Harbor, and accounted for the natural physical, chemical, biological and toxicological characteristics of the harbor to achieve more scientifically based compliance. In both harbors the spatial and temporal distributions of copper species, toxic effects, and Water Effect Ratio predicted by the integrated model are comparable to previous data. The model was further demonstrated in Shelter Island Yacht Basin (SIYB) marina in San Diego Bay. The integrated model agreed with toxicological and chemical approaches by indicating negligible bioavailability as well as no toxicity; but for a single event, even though an increasing gradient in Cu was observed both horizontally and vertically, with concentrations that reached levels well above current regulatory thresholds. These results support the incorporation by USEPA of the seawater-BLM in a full-strength seawater criterion.",

Hence, soil moisture conditions virtually effect on all aspects of engineering / military engineering activities such as operational mobility, detection of landmines and unexploded ordinance, natural material penetration/excavation, peaking factor analysis in dam design etc. Like other natural systems, soil moisture pattern can vary from completely disorganized (disordered, random) to highly organized. To understand this varying soil moisture pattern, this research utilized topographic wetness index from digital elevation models (DEM) along with vegetation index from remotely sensed measurements in red and near-infrared bands, as well as land surface temperature (LST) in the thermal infrared bands. This research developed a methodology to relate a combined index from DEM, LST and vegetation index with the physical soil moisture properties of soil types and the degree of saturation. The advantage in using this relationship is twofold: first it retrieves soil moisture content at the scale of soil data resolution even though the derived indexes are in a coarse resolution, and secondly the derived soil moisture distribution represents both organized and disorganized patterns of actual soil moisture. The derived soil moisture is used in driving the hydrological model simulations of runoff, sediment and nutrients.",

Desert shrubs dominate the lower two thirds of the watershed and grasses the upper third. Spatial variation in precipitation is measured with a network of 88 weighing-type recording rain gauges. Surface runoff is quantified over a range of scales (0.002 to 0.06 km2) to characterize interactions between rainfall intensity, soils and vegetation at nine sub-watersheds. Channel network processes and rainfall spatial variability are studied using 11 nested watersheds (2 to 150 km2). Sediment from the small sub-watersheds is sampled. Meteorological, soil moisture and temperature, and energy/water/CO2 flux measurements are made within two vegetation/soil complexes. Parallel investigations dating back to 1974 have also been conducted on eight small experimental watersheds at the Santa Rita Experimental Range (SRER) 80 km west of Walnut Gulch. In contrast to the creosote bush-grass WGEW, the mesquite-grass SRER is publicly owned, which ensures control and consistent reporting of management for research purposes. A key LTAR objective is to contrast a “business as usual” to an alternate management strategy presumed to have the potential of significantly improving forage and livestock production and diversification of ecosystem services. Consequently, a new ARS-U. of Arizona-Arizona State U. partnership will assess the watershed-scale impacts of brush management, a common land use practice typically applied in conjunction with livestock grazing, on a suite of ecosystem services at the SRER including provisioning (forage production, water yield), supporting (ecosystem primary production, soil moisture), and regulating services (C sequestration, peak flows, sediment yield, land surface-atmosphere interactions). Experimental design, management and monitoring being implemented to quantify these ecosystem services will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Solar coronal jets are magnetically channeled narrow eruptions often observed in the solar atmosphere, typically in EUV and X-ray emission, and occurring in various solar environments including active regions and coronal holes. Their driving mechanism is still under discussion, but facts that we know about jets include: (a) they are ejected from or near sites of compact magnetic explosions (compact ejective solar flares), (b) they sometimes carry chromospheric material high into the corona along with coronal-temperature plasma, (c) the cool-material jet velocities can reach 100 km s-1 or more, and (d) some active-region jets produce coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Here we investigate characteristics of EUV jets that originated from active region NOAA 12192 and produced CMEs. This active region produced many non-jet major flare eruptions (X and M class) that made no CME. A multitude of jets also occurred in the region, and in contrast to the major-flare eruptions, seven of these jets resulted in CMEs. Our jet observations are from multiple SDO/AIA EUV channels, including 304, 171, 193 and 94 Å, and our CME observations are from SOHO/LASCO C2 images. Each jet-driven CME was relatively slow-moving; had angular width (30° – 70°) comparable to that of the streamer base; and was of the “streamer-puff” variety, whereby a preexisting streamer was transiently inflated but not removed (blown out) by the passage of the CME. Much of the chromospheric-temperature plasma of the jets producing the CMEs escaped from the Sun, whereas relatively more of the chromospheric plasma in the non-CME-producing jets fell back to the solar surface. We also found that the CME-producing jets tended to be faster in speed and longer in duration than the non-CME-producing jets. This research was supported by funding from NASA's LWS program.",

The Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 (ETM2, ELMO, or H1) represents a hyperthermal event that occurred approximately 2 million years after the PETM and just prior to the C24r – C24n magnetic reversal (≈ 53.9 Ma) in the Ypresian. While the ETM2 event has been located in offshore samples, it has been more difficult to locate in a terrestrial section. This project attempts to locate the ETM2 magnetostratigraphically by finding the paleomagnetic reversal at C24r-C24n.3n, provide geochronological framework, and assess sedimentation rate changes during this time. This area is known to have had a high rate of deposition (16.8 cm/kyr ) during the PETM, which is found lower in the section. We collected 36 new samples from a 13.44m section spanning stratigraphy thought to cover the ETM2 along with 31 previous samples spanning the PETM, and prepared them for paleomagnetic and paleontological analysis. We analyzed samples using standard paleomagnetic methods including low-temperature and thermal demagnetization. Preliminary results suggest that the magnetostratigraphy spans the C24r–C24n boundary, while the micropaleontology shows the NP10–NP11 boundary, which occurs near the ETM2 as well as the NP11–NP12 boundary. The data indicate an order-of-magnitude drop in sedimentation rate in the lower Eocene at this site, concomitant with a drop in grain size, compared with the PETM.",

Observed horizontal motions are towards former ice mass centers in West Antarctica, opposite to the expected and modelled pattern of deformation due to GIA. The disagreement between observed and predicted surface deformation suggests modification to one or both primary GIA model inputs, ice history and earth properties models, is needed. 1D GIA models for Antarctica utilize radial earth models, yet mantle viscosity mapped by seismology indicates a strong boundary in earth properties between East and West Antarctica. GPS-derived horizontal crustal motions are consistently near-perpendicular to the boundary and a gradient in the magnitude of motion across the boundary is observed, with velocities increasing from the stronger, East Antarctic side, to the weaker, West Antarctic side. The spatial correlation between horizontal crustal displacements and modeled viscosity values suggests a causal relationship, and offers an explanation for the mismatch with 1D GIA models that do not incorporate lateral variation. Alternatively, we investigate the possibility of East Antarctic ice mass loss as an explanation for the discrepancy between observed and predicted surface deformation. Ice history scenarios invoking removal of ice mass from the Wilkes Subglacial Basin are coupled with a range of 1D earth models, and a comparison between predicted and observed motions made. Results suggest that East Antarctic unloading may explain both the magnitude and direction of observed motions for some regions. Perhaps more significantly, surface displacements located within an “interference zone” between the West Antarctica ice mass center and our postulated Wilkes ice mass center are strongly matched for a variety of earth model combinations, supporting the case for ice unloading from the Wilkes Subglacial Basin since the Last Glacial Maximum.",

The resulting craters and basins are the dominant topographic features on the planet. Although visible basins contain some of the most interesting tectonic features, plains, and evidence of vertical stratigraphy, they fall far short of saturating the surface. Nevertheless, Mercury has a greater spatial density of peak-ring basins and protobasins than any other Solar System body, partly because these morphologies begin at smaller sizes than on most bodies. Cratering at approximately three times the cratering rate on the Moon, combined with likely plains-forming volcanism, prevents recognition of surface features older than 4.0 to 4.1 Ga. Severe losses of craters <50 km in diameter (<20 km in some places) are ascribed to extensive formation of intercrater plains. Estimates of the cratering chronology of Mercury suggest that most plains formation ended about 3.6 to 3.7 Ga, though activity has continued in a few small regions until much more recently (e.g., inside the Rachmaninoff basin). Mercury, compared with other terrestrial bodies, is struck by projectiles impacting at much higher velocities, which is probably responsible for the formation of abundant secondary craters that dominate the numbers of craters <10 km diameter on older plains surfaces. The history of high-velocity bombardment has resulted in the production of abundant impact melts and has churned and processed the regolith, and eroded older topography, more thoroughly than on other Solar System bodies. Although the possible role of Mercury-specific impactors (“vulcanoids”) cannot be excluded, imaging searches by MESSENGER have revealed no remaining vulcanoids and no other evidence suggests that Mercury has been bombarded by anything other than the same populations of asteroids and comets that have impacted the Moon and other terrestrial planets from the end of the period of heavy bombardment 3.8 to 3.9 Ga to the present.",

However, accurate representations of these emissions at the scale of urban areas remains a difficult challenge. Quantifying emissions at the scale of local streets and highways is critical to provide policymakers with the information needed to develop appropriate mitigation strategies and to guide research into the underlying process that drive mobile emissions.\nQuantification of vehicle ffCO2 emissions at high spatial and temporal resolutions requires a detailed synthesis of data on traffic activity, roadway attributes, fleet characteristics and vehicle speeds. To accurately characterize criteria air pollutant emissions, information on local meteorology is also critical, as the temperature and relative humidity can affect emissions rates of these pollutants by as much as 400%. As the health impacts of air pollutants are more severe for residents living in close proximity (<500m) to road sources, it is critical that inventories of these emissions rely on highly resolved source data to locate potential hot-spots of exposure.\nIn this study we utilize real-time GPS estimates of vehicle speeds to estimate ffCO2 and criteria air pollutant emissions at multiple spatial and temporal scales across a large metropolitan area. We observe large variations in emissions associated with diurnal activity patterns, congestion, sporting and civic events, and weather anomalies. We discuss the advantages and challenges of using highly-resolved source data to quantify emissions at a roadway scale, and the potential of this methodology for forecasting the air quality impacts of changes in infrastructure, urban planning policies, and regional climate.",

            "abstract": "Human settlement locations are determined by heterogeneous landscape factors together with varied socio-economic conditions. Among these influencing factors, river networks hold an important historical role in affecting human population distribution. Classic scaling relations, Horton’s laws, have been described for stream order and various river network geomorphological variables (e.g. stream number, stream length, and river basin areas). However, it is still an open question on how human population distribution is related with river network topological structure. In this study, we focus on the human population distribution in the river basins of the USA and test the following hypotheses: 1) Human population distribution shows a scaling law with stream order within river basins; 2) Equivalent-order basins become more attractive for humans as adjacency to higher order streams increases; 3) Such scaling relationships are universal across space. We used 2010 Landscan human population distribution data and extracted river sub-basins from DEMs in the USA. Our results show that: 1) the human population distribution shows a fractal structure, with power-law scaling between human population and stream order. This relationship is robust in sub-regions throughout the USA. However, area also shows a similar power-law scaling so population alone is not sufficiently informative. Because the exponents on the area relationship are consistently greater than for population, population density is negatively associated with stream order. This result is consistent with basin length:width ratios and the observed relationship of human distance to water. Populations in equivalent-order basins show large variation, with higher population density emergent in the basins connected with high-order rivers. Such scaling laws between human population distribution and stream order were found universally among hydrological units above a threshold size. The observed reciprocal coupling between human population density and river basin order may reflect an optimum arrangement for humans to better utilize the water resource, ecological assets, and geographic advantage in river basins. The scaling relationships found here underline the controlling influence of river networks on landscape processes.",

We examine three-dimensional pore structure and connectivity of sandstone samples from the Farnsworth Unit, Texas, the site of a combined EOR-CO2 storage project by the Southwest Regional Partnership on Carbon Sequestration (SWP). We employ a unique set of methods, including: robotic serial polishing and reflected-light imaging for digital pore-structure reconstruction; electron microscopy; laser scanning confocal microscopy; mercury intrusion-extrusion porosimetry; and relative permeability and capillary pressure measurements using CO2 and synthetic formation fluid.

            "abstract": "Molecular biomarkers are the most direct biosignatures of life on early Earth and a key target in the search for life on Mars. Lipid biomarkers are of particular interest given their ability to survive oxidative degradation and record microbial presence and activity of microorganisms that occurred billions of years ago (Eigenbrode, 2008). Environmental conditions that suspend biotic and abiotic degradative processes prior to lithification can lead to enhanced biomolecular preservation over geological time-scales. The hyperarid core of the Atacama Desert in northern Chile offers a unique environment to investigate lipid biomarker taphonomy under extreme and prolonged dryness.\nWe investigated the accumulation and degree of preservation of lipid biomarkers in million-year-old hyperarid soils where primarily abiotic conditions influence their taphonomy. Soils were extracted and free and membrane bound lipids were analyzed across a vertical profile of 2.5 meters in the Yungay hyper-arid core of the Atacama Desert. Due to the extremely low inventory of biomass in Atacama soils, samples were collected by scientists wearing cleanroom suits to minimize anthropogenic contamination during sampling.\nFatty acids were found to be well preserved in Yungay soils, and were most abundant in the clay-rich soils at ~2 m depth (~750 ng of fatty acid methyl ester/g of soil). These buried clays layers were fluvially deposited approximately 2 million years ago, and have been excluded from exposure to rainwater and modern surficial processes since their emplacement (Ewing et al., 2008).\nMonocarboxylic fatty acid, monohydroxy fatty acid, glycerol tetraether, and n-alkane hydrocarbon content was found to change with depth. Lipid biomarker content in deeper soil layers is suggestive of soils having been formed at a time when environmental conditions were capable of supporting active microbial communities and plants.\nIn short, total lipid extracts reveal a remarkable degree of lipid biomarker preservation even in the oldest soils analyzed (ca. 2 Myr) indicating that typical diagenetic processes of lipid destruction are arrested under extreme dryness. This result has implications for the search for molecular biomarkers on Mars, which could have experienced millions to billions of years of extreme hyperaridity.",

Search engines first focused on text and its rate of occurrence; then focused on the notion of link analysis and citation then on interactivity and guided search; and now on the use of social media – who we interact with, what we comment on, and who we follow (and who follows us). The next stage, referred to as “deep search,” requires solutions that can bring together text, images, video, importance, interactivity, and social media to solve this challenging problem.\nThe Apache Nutch project provides an open framework for large-scale, targeted, vertical search with capabilities to support all past and potential future search engine foci. Nutch is a flexible infrastructure allowing open access to ranking; URL selection and filtering approaches, to the link graph generated from search, and Nutch has spawned entire sub communities including Apache Hadoop and Apache Tika. It addresses many current needs with the capability to support new technologies such as image and video.\nOn the DARPA Memex project, we are creating create specific extensions to Nutch that will directly improve its overall technological superiority for search and that will directly allow us to address complex search problems including human trafficking. We are integrating state-of-the-art algorithms developed by Kitware for IARPA Aladdin combined with work by Harvard to provide image and video understanding support allowing automatic detection of people and things and massive deployment via Nutch. We are expanding Apache Tika for scene understanding, object/person detection and classification in images/video.\nWe are delivering an interactive and visual interface for initiating Nutch crawls. The interface uses Python technologies to expose Nutch data and to provide a domain specific language for crawls. With the Bokeh visualization library the interface we are delivering simple interactive crawl visualization and plotting techniques for exploring crawled information. The platform classifies, identify, and thwart predators, help to find victims and to identify buyers in human trafficking and will deliver technological superiority in search engines for DARPA.\nWe are already transitioning the technologies into Geo and Planetary Science, and Bioinformatics.",

We use yield data collected over three decades for more than ten food crops grown in India along with a variety of statistical approaches to answer the above questions.\nThe ability of climate variables to explain yield variation varies greatly by crop and season, which is expected. Equally important, the ability of models to predict crop yields as well as their coefficients varies greatly by district even for districts which are relatively close to each other and similar in their agricultural practices. We believe these results encourage caution and nuance when making projections about climate impacts on crop yields in the future. Most studies about climate impacts on crop yields focus on a handful of major food crops. By extending our analysis to all the crops with long-term district level data in India as well as two growing seasons we gain a more comprehensive picture. Our results indicate that there is a great deal of variability even at relatively small scales, and that this must be taken into account if projections are to be made useful to policymakers.",

            "abstract": "Deltas can subside very fast, yet many deltas remain emergent over geologic time. A large sediment input is often enough to compensate for subsidence and rising sea level to keep many deltas at sea level. This implies a balance between subsidence and sedimentation, both of which may, however, be controlled by independent factors such as sediment supply, tectonic loads and sea-level change. We here examine the subsidence of the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta (GBD). Located in the NE boundary of the Indian-Eurasian collision zone, the GBD is surrounded by active uplifts (Indo-Burma Fold Belt and the Shillong Massif). The pattern of subsidence from these tectonic loads can strongly vary depending on both loads and lithospheric flexural rigidity, both of which can vary in space and time. Sediment cover changes both the lithostatic pressure and the thermal properties and thus the rigidity of the lithosphere. While sediments are deposited cold, they also insulate the lithosphere, acting as a thermal blanket to increase lower crustal temperatures. These effects are a function of sedimentation rates and may be more important where the lithosphere is thin. At the massive GBD the impact of sedimentation should be considered for properly constraining flexural subsidence. The flexural rigidity of the lithosphere is here modeled by using a yield-stress envelope based on a thermomechanic model that includes geothermal changes associated with sedimentation. Models are constrained by using two different data sets, multichannel seismic data correlated to borehole stratigraphy, and gravity data. This approach allows us to determine the Holocene regional distribution of subsidence from the Hinge Zone to the Bengal Fan and the mass-anomalies associated with the flexural loading. Different end-member scenarios are explored for reproducing the observed land tilting and gravity anomalies. For all scenarios considered, data can be reproduced only if we consider an extremely weak lithosphere and we will quantify the extent that this weakness is influenced by the extreme sediment thickness of the delta. While the distribution of the present-day subsidence suggests that sediment compaction plays a major role on the current subsidence over the delta, its role over a geological time frame is probably minor.",

An ongoing study in the Peanut Basin, Senegal has shown a vast improvement in crop yields when annual food crops are planted with the shrub Guiera senegalensis, especially in years of low or irregular precipitation. Shrubs in field plots established in 2003 where a rotation of peanuts and millet are grown are planted at a much higher density of 1500-1830 individuals per hectare. In order to increase the density of shrubs on the landscape, the shrubs must be cultivated. We monitored soil moisture, soil temperature, and growth of recently transplanted individuals at a field station in Thies, Senegal.This study seeks to determine the growth characteristics and water use of young shrubs in order to inform possible future plantations of the shrubs in a more intensely managed agroecosystem. If this technique of intercropping is to be expanded we must not exceed the carrying capacity of the landscape. In vulnerable ecosystems where natural resources are scarce and farming inputs are low, we must work to determine ways of exploiting the adaptation of local agroecosystems to increase the sustainability of agriculture in the region.",

            "abstract": "To evaluate the utility of riverside seismic monitoring for constraining temporal and spatial variations in coarse bedload transport in gravel-bed rivers we collected seismic data during a dam-controlled flood of the Trinity River in northern California in May 2015. This field area was chosen because the Trinity River Restoration Project conducts extensive monitoring of water and sediment transport, and riverbed morphology to guide management of the river with the goal of improving salmon habitat. Four three component broadband seismometers were collocated with water discharge and bedload physical sampling sites along a ~30 km reach of the Trinity River downstream of the Lewiston Dam. Arrays with 10–80 cable-free vertical component geophones were also deployed at each of the four sites in order to constrain spatial variability and amplitude decay of seismic signals emanating from the river. Nominal inter-station spacing within the geophone arrays was ~30 m. The largest geophone array consisted of 83 nodes along a 700 m reach of the Trinity River with a gravel augmentation site at its upstream end. Initial analyses of the seismic data show that ground velocity power from averaged from ~7 – 90 Hz is correlated with discharge at all sites. The array at the gravel injection site shows greater high frequency (>30 Hz) power at the upstream end where gravel was injected during the release compared to ~300 m downstream, consistent with bedload transport providing a significant source of seismic energy in addition to water discharge. Declining seismic power during a ~3 day plateau at peak discharge when physical sampler data shows decreasing bedload flux provides a further indication that the seismic data are sensitive to bedload transport. We will use the array data to back-project the seismic signals in multiple frequency bands into the channel to create maps of the time-varying spatial intensity of seismic energy production. We hypothesize that the greatest seismic energy production will be correlated with times of greatest bedload flux constrained by physical sampler data and with locations where repeat sonar scans identify the greatest changes in riverbed bathymetry.",

            "abstract": "Quantification of the black carbon (BC) and brown carbon (BrC) components of source emissions is critical to understanding the impact combustion aerosols have on atmospheric light absorption. Multiple-wavelength absorption of particulate matter emissions was measured from combustion of wood, agricultural biomass, coals, leaf litter, and petroleum distillates in controlled combustion settings. Aethalometer corrected BC absorption was segregated mathematically from the total light extinction to estimate the BrC absorption from individual sources. Results were compared to elemental carbon (EC)/organic carbon (OC) concentrations to determine composition’s impact on light absorption. The bulk carbonaceous aerosol and BrC Mass absorption cross section (MAC) were variable across source types and light wavelengths. Sources such as incense and peat emissions showed ultraviolet wavelength (370nm) BrC absorption over 175 and 80 times (respectively) the BC absorption but only 21 and 11 times (respectively) at 520nm wavelength. The bulk EC MACEC, λ (average at 520nm=9.0±3.7 m2 g-1; with OC fraction <0.85 = ~7.5 m2 g-1) and the BrC OC mass absorption cross sections (MACBrC,OC,λ) were calculated; at 370 nm ultraviolet wavelengths; the MACBrC,OC,λ ranged from 0.8 m2 g-1 to 2.29 m2 g-1 (lowest peat, highest kerosene), while at 520nm wavelength MACBrC,OC,λ ranged from 0.07 m2 g-1 to 0.37 m2 g-1 (lowest peat, highest kerosene/incense mixture).\nSamples from the same combustions sources were water and organic solvent extracted, filtered to physically remove BC, and the extracts were re-aerosolized in a controlled suspension chamber. The MACBrC,OC,λ derived from the re-suspended OC were compared to the mathematically derived MACBrC,OC,λ and were shown to have similar absorption spectra, however variability between the methods were observed, likely due to variations in particle size distributions, particle mixing state, and uncertainty associated with the OC quantification. The results show that BrC can be an important contributor to aerosol light absorption when OC is present in significant quantities (>0.9 OC/TC). However, this absorption is only becomes significant near and/or below 520 nm wavelength.",

The aim was to link the concerns and priorities of relevant stakeholders with the integrated biophysical and poverty models used in the project. A 2-stage process was used to facilitate the connection between stakeholders concerns and available modelling capacity: the first to qualitatively describe what the future might look like in 2050; the second to translate these qualitative descriptions into the quantitative form required by the numerical models. An extended, modified SSP approach was adopted, with stakeholders downscaling issues identified through interviews as being priorities for the southwest of Bangladesh. Detailed qualitative futures were produced, before modellable elements were quantified in conjunction with an expert stakeholder cadre. Stakeholder input, using the methods adopted here, allows the top-down focus of the RCPs to be aligned with the bottom-up approach needed to make the SSPs appropriate at the more local scale, and also facilitates the translation of qualitative narrative scenarios into a quantitative form that lends itself to incorporation of biophysical and socio-economic indicators. The presentation will describe the downscaling process in detail, and conclude with findings regarding the importance of stakeholder involvement (and logistical considerations), balancing model capacity with expectations and recommendations on SSP refinement at local levels.",

Ecological forecasting presents many significant challenges within each of the aspects of data capture, assimilation, and modeling. High space-time resolution sampling is required to address the challenges of scaling from the site level to the continent. Determining the uncertainty of data used for model input and parameterization is critical for constraining the model for accurate representation. The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is poised to greatly expand the scale and availability of biogeochemical and aquatic ecological data. NEON is a continental-scale facility designed to collect and disseminate data that addresses the impacts of climate change, land-use, and invasive species on ecosystem structure and function. Using a combination of standardized observational sampling and sensor measurements, NEON will provide a rich source of biogeochemical and biophysical data from 34 aquatic and 47 terrestrial sites spatially distributed across the US, including Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico for 30 years. Sites were selected to be representative of major ecosystems and maximize scalability. In addition to standardizing measurements, NEON is determining the quantitative uncertainty of each data product making them well suited to constrain models. NEON aquatic data will not only serve to baseline aquatic ecology in major ecosystems but also presents opportunities to bolster Hydrologic Models as well as incorporate aquatic biogeochemical cycling into Land Surface Models.

In addition to the sampling experiments, the mission will include instruments capable of characterizing the local context of the samples at geological time scales, studying the current environment, and demonstrating oxygen generation from the Martian atmosphere (MOXIE), an important human exploration goal. The Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer (MEDA) was selected as part of the Mars 2020 payload, in particular, to address future human exploration objectives, including characterization of dust size and morphology and understanding surface weather. In addition to its scientific importance, dust sizes and shapes are critical for proper design of in-situ resource elements such as filters for a MOXIE-type experiment.\nMEDA comprises a suite of sensors that will measure dust particle size distribution and phase function to attain particle shape, optical depth, surface pressure, air and surface temperature, down-wellling and up-welling radiation to provide net radiative forcing from UV through IR, horizontal and vertical wind, and humidity. MEDA has high heritage from the REMS package operating on Curiosity and the TWINS package in development for InSight. The current objectives and instrument descriptions will be presented.",

By increasing the geographic area of contact as well as by changing the mean stratification and overturning circulation future reductions of sea ice cover offers the potential to enhance and alter these interactions. This study begins with a comparison of simulated and historical interannual/decadal variability in the Arctic Ocean, and the relative importance of local atmospheric heating and ocean heat convergence, as they appear in a collection of CMIP5 model simulations. This analysis reveals that the models can be classified into two groups depending on their responses. Then we examine the changes in this variability over the coming centuries as simulated by the models, which reveal dramatic changes to the strength and frequency of the variability as the sea ice retreats. The connections to interannual/decadal variations of the overturning circulation and to atmospheric weather patterns will be discussed.",

This map reveals that there are about 500 faults can generate earthquakes.In order to understand the earthquake potential of these faults, it is needed to determine the slip rates. Although many regional and local studies were performed in the past, the slip rates of the active faults in Turkey have not been determined.\nIn this study, the block modelling, which is the most common method to produce slip rates, will be done. GPS velocities required for block modeling is being compiled from the published studies and the raw data provided then velocity field is combined. To form a homogeneous velocity field, different stochastic models will be used and the optimal velocity field will be achieved. In literature, GPS site velocities, which are computed for different purposes and published, are combined globally and this combined velocity field are used in the analysis of strain accumulation. It is also aimed to develop optimal stochastic models to combine the velocity data.\nReal time, survey mode and published GPS observations is being combined in this study. We also perform new GPS observations. Furthermore, micro blocks and main fault zones from Active Fault Map Turkey will be determined and homogeneous velocity field will be used to infer slip rates of these active faults.\nHere, we present the result of first year of the study.\nThis study is being supported by THE SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF TURKEY (TUBITAK)-CAYDAG with grant no. 113Y430.",

            "abstract": "Volcano seismicity is often attributed to subsurface fluid movement; however the type of fluid (i.e. magma, volatiles, or hydrothermal waters) cannot be uniquely identified using seismic data alone. The chemical composition of volcanic gases released from active volcanoes can be used to distinguish magmatic from hydrothermal degassing, and to identify magma recharge from depth. In this project we use complementary geochemical and seismic datasets from three hydrothermally and seismically active volcanoes within the Katmai Volcanic Cluster, Alaska, in an effort to constrain seismic signatures of subsurface fluid movement. We combine new data collected in July and August 2013 from Mount Martin Volcano, with previously presented gas and seismic data from the nearby volcanoes of Mount Mageik and Trident. High temporal resolution (~1 Hz) major-species (e.g. H2O, CO2, SO2, H2S) gas composition measurements were collected over four ~30 minute sample periods each day for 2-4 week periods from the target volcanoes using campaign MultiGas instruments located adjacent to the primary degassing sources. These instruments were complemented by co-located broadband seismometers on the crater rims of Mount Martin and Mount Mageik, as well as by the Alaska Volcano Observatory Katmai seismic network, which consists of nine short-period and two broadband seismometers located within 30 km of the target volcanoes. Here we apply template-matching techniques to identify repeating earthquakes, and compare changes in shallow seismicity with changes in gas composition. Preliminary results from Trident suggest a potential link between an ~5 day SO2 gas pulse, presumed to reflect magma degassing, and shallow repeating earthquakes. In this study, we present analysis of ~4 weeks of new gas and seismic data from Mount Martin and expand on the analyses at Trident in an effort to provide robust correlations between potential geochemical and geophysical signals of subsurface fluid movement.",

Extraction of waveform features, such as total waveform energy, canopy energy distribution, and foliage penetration metrics are computed along the laser line-of-sight and along the vertical axis of synthesized “pseudowaveforms.” The pseudowaveform technique is a novel method that allows for direct comparisons between green (532nm) and near IR (1064nm) waveforms, despite variations in sampling. Comparisons between wavelengths allows for detailed characterization of vegetation structure and distribution not possible with single-wavelength LIDAR.

            "abstract": "Currently, there are several methods to determine geoid models. They can be based on terrestrial gravity data, geopotential coefficients, astro-geodetic data or a combination of them. Among the techniques to compute a precise geoid model, the Remove-Compute-Restore (RCR) has been widely applied. It considers short, medium and long wavelengths derived from altitude data provided by Digital Terrain Models (DTM), terrestrial gravity data and global geopotential coefficients, respectively. In order to apply this technique, it is necessary to create procedures that compute gravity anomalies and geoid models, by the integration of different wavelengths, and that adjust these models to one local vertical datum. This research presents a developed package called GRAVTool based on MATLAB software to compute local geoid models by RCR technique and its application in a study area. The studied area comprehends the federal district of Brazil, with ~6000 km², wavy relief, heights varying from 600 m to 1340 m, located between the coordinates 48.25ºW, 15.45ºS and 47.33ºW, 16.06ºS. The results of the numerical example on the studied area show the local geoid model computed by the GRAVTool package (Figure), using 1377 terrestrial gravity data, SRTM data with 3 arc second of resolution, and geopotential coefficients of the EIGEN-6C4 model to degree 360. The accuracy of the computed model (σ = ± 0.071 m, RMS = 0.069 m, maximum = 0.178 m and minimum = -0.123 m) matches the uncertainty (σ =± 0.073) of 21 points randomly spaced where the geoid was computed by geometrical leveling technique supported by positioning GNSS. The results were also better than those achieved by Brazilian official regional geoid model (σ = ± 0.099 m, RMS = 0.208 m, maximum = 0.419 m and minimum = -0.040 m).",

Using perturbed-parameter ensembles and uncertainty quantification methodology, we have identified input parameters at each resolution level that minimize discrepancies of key output quantities simulated by CAM5 with respect to satellite data.

Since then, a number of seismological data centers have implemented FDSN service interfaces, with more implementations in development. We have developed a new system called the IRIS Federator which leverages this standardization and provides the scientific community with a service for easy discovery and access of seismological data across FDSN data centers. These centers are located throughout the world and this work represents one model of a system for data collection across geographic and political boundaries.\nThe main components of the IRIS Federator are a catalog of time series metadata holdings at each data center and a web service interface for searching the catalog. The service interface is designed to support client­-side federated data access, a model in which the client (software run by the user) queries the catalog and then collects the data from each identified center. By default the results are returned in a format suitable for direct submission to those web services, but could also be formatted in a simple text format for general data discovery purposes. The interface will remove any duplication of time series channels between data centers according to a set of business rules by default, however a user may request results with all duplicate time series entries included. We will demonstrate how client­-side federation is being incorporated into some of the DMC’s data access tools. We anticipate further enhancement of the IRIS Federator to improve data discovery in various scenarios and to improve usefulness to communities beyond seismology.\nData centers with FDSN web services: http://www.fdsn.org/webservices/\nThe IRIS Federator query interface: http://service.iris.edu/irisws/fedcatalog/1/",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in optical remote sensing of photosynthesis offer great promise for estimating gross primary productivity (GPP) at leaf, canopy and even global scale. These methods –including solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) emission, fluorescence spectra, and hyperspectral features such as the red edge and the photochemical reflectance index (PRI) – can be used to greatly enhance the predictive power of global circulation models (GCMs) by providing better constraints on GPP. The way to use measured optical data to parameterize existing models such as SCOPE (Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy fluxes) is not trivial, however. We have therefore extended a biochemical model to include fluorescence and other parameters in a coupled treatment. To help parameterize the model, we then use nonlinear curve-fitting routines to determine the parameter set that enables model results to best fit leaf-level gas exchange and optical data measurements. To make the tool more accessible to all practitioners, we have further designed a graphical user interface (GUI) based front-end to allow researchers to analyze data with a minimum of effort while, at the same time, allowing them to change parameters interactively to visualize how variation in model parameters affect predicted outcomes such as photosynthetic rates, electron transport, and chlorophyll fluorescence. Here we discuss the tool and its effectiveness, using recently-gathered leaf-level data.",

There has also been commensurate growth in human and physical development as indicated by macro-economic indices such as Human Development Index and Fixed Capital Formation. A significant proportion of the accumulated wealth is invested in buildings and infrastructure which are highly susceptible to strong ground motion since the region is located along an active plate boundary. In the case of Trinidad and Tobago, Fixed Capital Formation accumulation since 1980 is almost US$200 billion dollars. Recent studies have indicated that this twin island state is at significant risk from several seismic sources, both on land and offshore. To effectively mitigate the risk it is necessary to prescribe long-term measures such as the development and implementation of building code and standards, structural retrofitting, land use planning, preparedness planning and risk transfer mechanisms. The record has shown that Trinidad and Tobago has been been slow in the prescribing such measures which has consequently compounded it vulnerability to large earthquakes. This assessment reveals that the losses from a large (magnitude 7+) on land or an extreme (magnitude 8+) event could result in losses of up to US$28B and that current risk transfer measures will only cater for less than ten percent of such losses.",

            "abstract": "Anthropogenic activities contribute to increased levels of nitrogen deposition and elevated CO2 concentrations in terrestrial ecosystems. The role that soils play in biogeochemical cycles is an important area of uncertainty in ecosystem ecology. One of the main reasons for this uncertainty is that we have limited understanding of belowground microbial activity and how this activity is linked to soil processes. In particular, elevated CO2 may influence soil nitrogen processes that regulate nitrogen availability to plants. Warming and nitrogen fertilization may both contribute to loss of stored carbon from mountain ecosystems, because they contribute to microbial decomposition of organic matter.\nTo study the effects of long-term nitrogen fertilization on soil respiration, we analyzed results from a 25-year field experiment in Rocky Mountain National Park. Field treatments are in old growth Engelmann spruce forests. Soil respiration responses to the effects of nitrogen fertilization on soil carbon cycling, via respiration, were investigated during the 2013 growing season. Soil moisture, temperature, and respiration rates were measured in six 30 x 30 m plots, of the six plots three are fertilized with 25 kg N ha-1 yr-1 as ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) pellets and three receives ambient atmospheric nitrogen deposition (1-6 kg N/ha/yr) in Rocky Mountain National Park. We found that respirations rates in the fertilized plots were not significantly higher than respiration rates in the unfertilized plots. We speculate that acclimation to long-term fertilization and relatively high levels of nitrogen deposition in the control plots both contribute to the insensitivity of soil respiration to fertilization at this site.",

            "abstract": "Near three fourths of the Earth crust, and the majority of all past subducted crust have been formed at oceanic spreading centers. Seismic experiments carried out to define the structure of the oceanic crust that underlies most of the world ocean basins have systematically defined a ubiquitous three-velocity-layers seismic structure.\nLayer 1 is established to be made of sediment, but the nature of layers 2 and 3 has remained a matter of interpretation and of intense research for more than half century. The nature of oceanic crust under basins has been mainly inferred from indirect geophysical measurements and rocks sampled at the seafloor because sampling of the deep crust has been restricted to a handful of sites. Current accepted models propose that the formation of oceanic crust at mid ocean ridges (MOR) –far from hotspot anomalies- is fundamentally controlled by the rate of plate separation, with oceanic crustal types classified as ultraslow, slow, intermediate, and fast spreading crust.\nWe present a seismic study of oceanic crust across an extensive back-arc area providing constrains on accretion processes. The depth-velocity distribution of back-arc crust resembles MOR layered structure, but velocities are systematically different to MOR crust formed at any spreading rate. In particular, Layer 2 displays a considerable variability of P-wave velocities over short distances, and Layer 3 displays lower seismic velocities. These distinct characteristics indicate either a considerable different rock composition or deformation process. The integration of our observations with data from other back-arc basins indicates an unexpected variety of crustal velocities that does not appear controlled by spreading rate. We interpret that the seismic structure of the crust indicates that back-arc spreading represents a class of spreading in its own.",

The focus of the investigation is to assess the sensitivity of simulated extreme periods, dry and wet, to soil moisture initialization in different climatic regions over Europe and to establish the necessary spin up time within the framework of decadal predictions for these regions.\nSensitivity experiments consisted of a reference simulation from 1968 to 1999 and 5 simulations from 1972 to 1983. The Effective Drought Index (EDI) is used to select and quantify drought status in the reference run to establish the simulation time period for the sensitivity experiments. Different soil initialization procedures are investigated. The sensitivity of the decadal predictions to soil moisture initial conditions is investigated through the analysis of water cycle components’ (WCC) variability. In an episodic time scale the local effects of soil moisture on the boundary-layer and the propagated effects on the large-scale dynamics are analysed.\nThe results show: (a) COSMO-CLM reproduces the observed features of the drought index. (b) Soil moisture initialization exerts a relevant impact on WCC, e.g., precipitation distribution and intensity. (c) Regional characteristics strongly impact the response of the WCC. Precipitation and evapotranspiration deviations are larger for humid regions. (d) The initial soil conditions (wet/dry), the regional characteristics (humid/dry) and the annual period (wet/dry) play a key role in the time that soil needs to restore quasi-equilibrium and the impact on the atmospheric conditions. Humid areas, and for all regions, a humid initialization, exhibit shorter spin up times, also soil reacts more sensitive when initialised during dry periods. (e) The initial soil perturbation may markedly modify atmospheric pressure field, wind circulation systems and atmospheric water vapour distribution affecting atmospheric stability conditions, thus modifying precipitation intensity and distribution even several years after the initialization.",

We use model-based, observation-driven soil moisture climatology in a high maize production region in the United States to develop bounds on high temperature sensitivity through its dependence on available water. For the portion of the region with relatively long growing season, yield reduction per degree-C is 10% for high water availability and 32.5% for low water availability. Where the growing season is shorter, yield reduction per degree-C is 6% for high water availability and 27% for low water availability. High temperature sensitivity is indeterminate where extreme temperature yield effect does not yet exceed excessive water yield effect.\nWe suggest new soil moisture climatology from reanalysis datasets could be used to develop community-based estimates of high temperature sensitivity that would significantly improve the accuracy of maize temperature sensitivity bounds, their regional variability, and their importance relative to other weather yield shocks. A community-based estimate would substantially improve evaluation of crop system simulation models and provide baseline information for evaluation of adaptation options. For instance, since process models are needed for evaluation of crop system adaptation response under climate projections, a community-developed estimate would provide a clear target for process model evaluation. Furthermore, the range of extreme temperature sensitivity from empirical models would provide a lower bound on variability that could be achieved from process models. If the process models achieved this bound, it would mean the uncertainty among their simulations would be primarily from observational limitations than differences in model response. While we demonstrate the potential in the context of maize, the concept could be implemented within any crop production system.",

PERSIANN-CCS extracts features from infrared cloud image segmentation from three brightness temperature thresholds (220K, 235K, and 253K). Warm raining clouds with brightness temperature higher than 253K are not covered from the current algorithm. To improve rain detection from warm rain, in this study, the cloud image segmentation threshold to cover warmer clouds is extended from 253K to 300K. Several other temperature thresholds between 253K and 300K were also examined. K-means cluster algorithm was used to classify extracted image features to 400 groups. Rainfall rates from each cluster were retrained using radar rainfall measurements. Case studies were carried out over CONUS to investigate the ability to improve detection of warm rainfall from segmentation and image classification using warmer temperature thresholds. Satellite image and radar rainfall data in both summer and winter seasons were used in the experiments in year 2012 as a training data. Overall results show that rain detection from warm clouds is significantly improved. However, it also shows that the false rain detection is also relatively increased when the segmentation temperature is increased.",

Upon landfall, ARs can be associated with 30-50% of annual precipitation in some regions, while also causing the largest flooding events in places such as coastal California. Little discussed is the role secondary frontal waves play in modulating precipitation during a landfalling AR. Secondary frontal waves develop along an existing cold front in response to baroclinic frontogenesis, often coinciding with a strong upper-tropospheric jet. If the secondary wave develops along a front associated with a landfalling AR, the resulting precipitation may be much greater or much less than originally forecasted – especially in regions where orographic uplift of horizontally transported water vapor is responsible for a large portion of precipitation.\nIn this study, we present several cases of secondary frontal waves that have occurred in conjunction with a landfalling AR on the US West Coast. We put the impact of these cases in historical perspective using quantitative precipitation forecasts, satellite data, reanalyses, and estimates of damage related to flooding. We also discuss the dynamical mechanisms behind secondary frontal wave development and relate these mechanisms to the high spatiotemporal variability in precipitation observed during ARs with secondary frontal waves. Finally, we demonstrate that even at lead times less than 24 hours, current quantitative precipitation forecasting methods have difficulty accurately predicting the rainfall in the area near the secondary wave landfall, in some cases leading to missed or false alarm flood warnings, and suggest methods which may improve quantitative precipitation forecasts for this type of system in the future.",

While there is a long record of passive microwave satellite measurements, passive microwave rainfall retrievals often fail to detect light precipitation or have light rain intensity biases because they cannot differentiate between emission from cloud and rain water. Previous studies have shown that AMSR-E significantly underestimates rainfall occurrence and volume compared to CloudSat. This underestimation totals just below 0.6 mm/day quasi-globally (60S-60N), but there are larger regional variations related to the dominant cloud regime. This study aims to use Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the 94-GHz CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR), which has a high sensitivity to light rain, with the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) observations, to help better characterize the properties of clouds that lead to passive microwave rainfall detection biases. CPR cloud and precipitation retrievals. AMSR-E Level-2B Goddard Profiling 2010 Algorithm (GPROF 2010) rainfall retrievals, and MODIS cloud properties were collocated and analyzed for 2008. Results are consistent with past studies and show large passive microwave precipitation detection biases compared to CloudSat in stratocumulus and shallow cumulus regimes. A preliminary examination of cases where AMSR-E failed to detect precipitation detected by CloudSat shows that over 50% of missed warm precipitation occurs in clouds with top heights below 2 km. MODIS cloud microphysical and macrophysical properties, such as optical thickness, particle effective radius, and liquid water path will be analyzed when precipitation is detected by CloudSat and missed by AMSR-E. The overall goal is to understand how cloud morphology relates to detection biases.",

Methods to estimate gas exchange rates include empirical relations to hydraulics, and direct injection of a tracer gas such as propane or SF6. Empirical relations are inconsistent and inaccurate, particularly for lower order, high-roughness streams. Gas injections are labor-intensive, and measured gas exchange rates are difficult to extrapolate in time since they change with discharge and stream geometry. We propose a novel method for calculation of gas exchange rates utilizing O2, pCO2, pH, and temperature data. Measurements, which can be automated using data loggers and probes, are made on the upstream and downstream end of the study reach. Gas exchange rates are then calculated from a solution to the transport equations for oxygen and dissolved inorganic carbon. Field tests in steep, low order, high roughness streams of the HJ Andrews Experimental Forest indicate the method to be viable along stream reaches with high downstream gas concentration gradients and high rates of gas transfer velocity. Automated and continuous collection of oxygen and carbonate chemistry data is increasingly common, thus the method may be used to estimate gas exchange rates through time, and is well suited for interactivity with databases.",

We present a paleoclimate record that is primarily influenced by the strength and latitudinal position of the Southern Hemisphere Westerly Winds from a late Holocene lake sediment core and a peat core that spans the last 13,000 years, both obtained from New Zealand’s subantarctic Auckland Islands (50°S, 166°E). Several proxy indicators contribute to our reconstruction. Hydrogen isotope ratios of specific organic molecules allow us to reconstruct the hydrogen isotope ratios of precipitation. Using macrofossil counts and the abundances of leaf wax biomarkers, we are able to estimate the moisture balance at our sites. Model simulations of the Westerlies and the rate and isotope ratios of precipitation allow us to interpret our proxy data as changes in the strength and position of the Westerly Winds. In our lacustrine sediment, we found that the Westerlies have been shifting southward since the Little Ice Age, consistent with modern observations of a southward shift. In the peatland sediment, we found a multi-millennial northward shift in the Westerlies during the middle Holocene. We will present further ongoing work that strengthens the chronology of Auckland Islands environmental change and integrates these results with vegetation shifts identified in pollen and macrofossil data.",

            "abstract": "Oxygenic photosynthetic (OP) cyanobacteria were responsible for the production of O2 during the Proterozoic. However, the extent and degree of oxygenation of the atmosphere and oceans varied for over 2 Ga after OP cyanobacteria first appeared in the geologic record. Cyanobacteria capable of anoxygenic photosynthesis (AP) may have altered the trajectory of oxygenation, yet the scope of their role in the Proterozoic is not well known. Modern cyanobacterial populations from Middle Island Sinkhole (MIS), Michigan and a handful of cultured cyanobacterial strains, are capable of OP and AP. With their metabolic versatility, these microbes may approximate ancient cyanobacterial assemblages that mediated Earth’s oxygenation. To better characterize the taxonomic and genetic signatures of these modern AP/OP cyanobacteria, we sequenced 16S rRNA genes and conducted ‘omics analyses on cultured strains, lab mesocosms, and MIS cyanobacterial mat samples collected over multiple years from May to September. Diversity in the MIS cyanobacterial mat is low, with one member of Oscillatoriales dominating at all times. However, Planktothrix members are more abundant in the cyanobacterial community in late summer and fall. The shift in cyanobacterial community composition may be linked to seasonally changing light intensity. In lab mesocosms of MIS microbial mat, we observed a shift in dominant cyanobacterial groups as well as the emergence of Chlorobium, bacteria that specialize in AP. These shifts in microbial community composition and metabolism are likely in response to changing environmental parameters such as the availability of light and sulfide. Further research is needed to understand the impacts of the changing photosynthetic community on oxygen production and the entire microbial consortium. Our study connects genes and genomes of AP cyanobacteria to their environment, and improves understanding of cyanobacterial metabolic strategies that may have shaped Earth’s redox evolution.",

            "abstract": "Methane (CH4), a potent greenhouse gas, and the primary component of natural gas, is emitted from areas of high fossil fuel production and processing. Recently, persistent and large methane emissions (~0.59 Tg yr-1) from the four corners area of the United States have been identified using satellite (SCIAMACHY) observations taken over the years 2003 to 2009. These emissions appear to be the largest CH4 anomaly (positive deviation above background values) in the contiguous U.S., and exceed bottom-up inventory estimates for the area by 1.8 to 3.5 times. The majority of emissions sources expected to contribute to this anomalous CH4 signal are located in the San Juan basin of New Mexico, and include harvesting and processing of natural gas, coal, and coalbed CH4. The magnitude of CH4 emissions from the San Juan basin have not yet been directly quantified using airborne measurements. Additionally, changing fossil fuel-related activities in the basin may have altered the magnitude of CH4 emissions compared to estimates derived from 2003-2009 satellite measurements. Here, we present in-situ airborne observations of CH4 over the San Juan basin, which allow tight quantification of CH4 fluxes using the mass balance method. Observations over the basin were taken for multiple wind directions on multiple days in April, 2015 to obtain a robust estimate of CH4 emissions. The flux of ethane (C2H6), the second most abundant component of natural gas and a tracer species indicative of fossil-derived CH4, was also quantified. Substantial C2H6 emissions may affect regional air quality and chemistry through its influence on tropospheric ozone production.",

            "abstract": "Earth System Models (ESMs) have problems simulating climate in the Arctic region. For instance, there continues to be a wide spread in the simulations of the interannual variability and long-term trends of sea ice in the 20th century in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) models. Thus, there is also a wide spread in the trends in sea ice decline projected for the 21st century in the CMIP5 models. Recently, the Regional Arctic System Model version 1.0 (RASM1.0) has been developed to provide improved high-resolution simulations of the Arctic atmosphere-ocean-sea ice-land system. A major baseline for the performance of RASM is its comparison with reanalysis (that provides the lateral boundary condition to drive RASM) and with the coarser-resolution ESMs.\nIn this presentation, we will provide such a baseline with respect to the land-atmosphere-ocean-sea ice interface processes by comparing RASM with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and three reanalysis products. First, 2-m air temperature, surface radiative and turbulent fluxes, and precipitation are compared to global datasets to assess the representation of these quantities in the models and reanalyses regionally. It is found that these quantities are generally better represented over land than over the oceans and sea ice. Then, we will further compare RASM, CESM, and reanalysis products with surface observations made at land flux towers, during northern high-latitude ship cruises over the oceans, and during the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) experiment over sea ice. In these comparisons, we will focus on both the annual and diurnal cycles. For instance, the snow versus snow-free period over land will be emphasized, because the land-atmosphere coupling mechanism differs between the two periods. The impact of radiative fluxes on the diurnal temperature errors will also be emphasized. Furthermore, our newly-developed snow depth and snow water equivalent data over several 2deg X 2deg areas will be used to evaluate RASM, CESM, and reanalyses.",

            "abstract": "Evapotranspiration (ET) is a key component of the energy and water balances in permafrost tundra, establishing hydrological conditions for the next year and controlling several aspects of the carbon cycle. Both the energy balance and hydrological conditions of the landscape surface are important drivers of how Arctic climate change will impact landscape processes, including the carbon feedback. The accurate measurement of evapotranspiration within an energy balance context therefore provides crucial information on ecosystem functioning and raises our predictive capacity for estimating the impact of climate change.\nIn this study we report field measurements from 13 summers (2002-14) using the eddy covariance method in a lowland ice-wedge polygon landscape within Russia’s Lena River Delta. These time-series are gap-filled and extrapolated with both statistical and process-based models to generate estimates of growing season ET. We find that interannual differences – including two August periods with high ET and two with low ET – are locally driven more by changes in air temperature and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) than in land surface characteristics or radiation. Except for periods of high VPD, aerodynamic resistance was greater than canopy surface resistance. We explore predictive relationships between various land surface indicators (e.g., NDVI, LAI, LST, Growing season length) derived from remote sensing products (MODIS) to quantify local mechanisms necessary for upscaling to the Delta region. Nighttime land surface temperature (MODIS) is found to be a strong predictor of evaporative flux at weekly to monthly time scales. Contrary to expectations resulting from climate change studies, we do not see evidence of a sustained interannual trend in ET or sensible heat flux. We conclude with implications for the local energy balance and responses to changes in sea ice extent and a warming climate.",

            "abstract": "Assessing climate models & their predictions requires observations that determine the state of the real climate system precisely and unambiguously, independently from models. For this purpose, we have been developing a new orbiting remote sensing system called the Active Temperature, Ozone & Moisture Microwave Spectrometer (ATOMMS) which is a cross between GPS RO and the Microwave Limb Sounder. ATOMMS actively probes water vapor, ozone & other absorption lines at cm & mm wavelengths in a satellite to satellite occultation geometry to simultaneously profile temperature, pressure, water vapor and ozone as well as other important constituents.\nIndividual profiles of water vapor, temperature & pressure heights will extend from near the surface into the mesosphere with ~1%, 0.4K and 10 m precision respectively and still better accuracy, with 100 m vertical resolution. Ozone profiles will extend upward from the upper troposphere. Line of sight wind profiles will extend upwards from the mid-stratosphere.\nATOMMS is a doubly differential absorption system which eliminates drift and both sees clouds and sees thru them, to deliver performance in clouds within a factor of 2 of the performance in clear skies. This all-weather sampling combined with insensitivity to surface emissivity avoids sampling biases that limit most existing satellite records. ATOMMS will profile slant liquid water in clouds & rain and as well as turbulence via scintillations (“twinkling of a star”).\nUsing prototype ATOMMS instrumentation that we developed with funding from NSF, several ATOMMS ground field campaigns precisely measured water vapor, cloud amount, rainfall, turbulence and absorption line spectroscopy. ATOMMS’s dynamic range was demonstrated as water vapor was derived to 1% precision in optical depths up to 17.\nWe are developing high altitude aircraft to aircraft instrumentation to further demonstrate ATOMMS performance, refine spectroscopy & support future field campaigns. Our vision is a constellation of microsatellites carrying ATOMMS to provide radiosonde-like profiles for weather prediction, an unprecedented characterization of present climate, a continuous global field campaign to constrain critical processes to improve models, and a long term record quantifying trends in climatic behavior.",

            "abstract": "Since the late 17th century the San Andreas Fault (SAF) in southern California has produced three large (M7.3-7.8) earthquakes that did not break through San Gorgonio Pass (SGP). This pass-as-a-barrier behavior can be explained by the complexity of the SAF system. Here the fault splays and rotates into a series of en-echelon, oblique-dextral thrusts. In the center of SGP two sub-parallel thrusts are 1.5 km apart (the northern (NF) and southern (SF) splays), and form well-preserved fault scarps (up to 15 m high) in at least 3 alluvial fan terraces formed on the Millard Canyon fan. New, 10Be cosmogenic depth profiles and boulder exposure ages constrain the ages of the two oldest Holocene fan surfaces (Qt4, Qt3) to 8900 (range: 7300-11600) and 8300 (range: 6800-10300) y.b.p.. Radiocarbon ages constrain the younger surface (Qt2) at ~1500 y.b.p.. Qt4 contains a 10.5-15.1 m high scarp along the SF and has an uplift rate of 0.9-2.1 mm/yr. Qt3 is inset 1.5 m within Qt4, and contains a 3.6-6.2 m high scarp on the SF and 2.9-5.3 m high scarp on the NF with 0.4-0.9 mm/yr and 0.3-0.8 mm/yr uplift rates, respectively. Qt2 is inset ~4 m within Qt3, and contains a 1.0-2.9 m high scarp on the NF with a 0.9-2.4 mm/yr uplift rate. Using measured fault dips of 45 (NF) and 20-30 (SF) degrees combined with a slip vector inferred from regional GPS data and 2:1 lateral to thrust offset markers, we calculate the net oblique slip rate on these faults at Millard Canyon at 2.1-4.8 mm/yr for Qt4 and 1.0-2.7 mm/yr for Qt3 (SF), and 0.8-2.2 mm/yr for Qt3 and 1.9-6.8 mm/yr for Qt2 (NF). The cumulative slip rate across Millard Canyon (SF+NF) is therefore 1.8-11.6 mm/yr, or more narrowly constrained at 4.0-5.9 mm/yr by using only the overlapping slip rates along each fault strand. An average slip rate of ~5 mm/yr is ~30-70% of the slip rates outside of SGP. This ‘slip deficit’ may reflect some combination of slip carried by faults within in the San Bernardino Mountains to the north, transferred onto the Eastern California Shear Zone or San Jacinto Fault, or accommodated by off-fault deformation through the SGP.

Through the support and collaboration of federal agencies- NASA, NSF, and NOAA- the community-driven GLOBE database has more than 130 million Earth science measurements (atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and pedosphere) that align with the USGCRP’s indicators of climate change, such as air and surface temperature (Indicator: Global Surface Temperature), land cover (Indicators: 1) Forest Cover; 2) Grassland, Shrubland, and Pasture Cover), and plant phenology (Indicator: Start of Spring). GLOBE contributes to climate literacy while encouraging community members of all ages to enrich their scientific understanding, define issues of local relevance, and engage in broader action, such as regional and global science campaigns. In this session, we will present case studies of how GLOBE data has been used to inspire “homegrown” research campaigns such as the GLOBE Surface Temperature Campaign and European Aerosols Campaign, as well as solution-based action in response to environmental changes, including the development of a mosquito protocol in Thailand and across Africa and a toad service project in the Czech Republic. We will also discuss some of the initiatives we have led as a program in order to promote and share local and regional community-led efforts with our worldwide GLOBE community, as well as some of the challenges and opportunities presented by supporting climate research.",

            "abstract": "Regionally continuous Cenozoic rocks in the Basin and Range that predate the onset of major mid-Miocene extension provide valuable insight into the sequence of faulting and magnitude of extension. An exceptional example of this is Caetano caldera, located in north-central Nevada, that formed during the eruption of the Caetano Tuff at the Eocene-Oligocene transition. The caldera and associated deposits, as well as conformable caldera-filling sedimentary and volcanic units allow for the reconstruction of post Oligocene extensional faulting. Extensive mapping and geochronologic, geochemical and paleomagnetic analyses have been conducted over the last decade to help further constrain the eruptive and extensional history of the Caetano caldera and associated deposits.\nGravity and magnetic data, that highlight contrasts in density and magnetic properties (susceptibility and remanence), respectively, are useful for mapping and modeling structural and lithic discontinuities. By combining existing gravity and aeromagnetic data with newly collected high-resolution gravity data, we are performing detailed potential field modeling to better characterize the subsurface within and surrounding the caldera. Modeling is constrained by published geologic map and cross sections and by new rock properties for these units determined from oriented drill core and hand samples collected from outcrops that span all of the major rock units in the study area. These models will enable us to better map the margins of the caldera and more accurately determine subsurface lithic boundaries and complex fault geometries, as well as aid in refining estimates of the magnitude of extension across the caldera. This work highlights the value in combining geologic and geophysical data to build an integrated structural model to help characterize the subsurface and better constrain the extensional tectonic history if this part of the Great Basin.",

Therefore understanding uncertainties in GCMs is a fundamental necessity if the scientific community is to provide useful and reliable future climate change information that can be utilized by end users and decision makers.\nTwo different assessments of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) GCM ensemble were conducted for the south-central United States. The first was a performance evaluation over the historical period for metrics of near surface meteorological variables (e.g., temperature, precipitation) and system-based phenomena, which include large-scale processes that can influence the region (e.g., low-level jet, ENSO). These metrics were used to identify a subset of models of higher performance across the region which were then used to constrain future climate change projections. A second assessment explored climate scenario development where all model climate change projections were assumed equally likely and future projections with the highest impact were identified (e.g., temperature and precipitation combinations of hottest/driest, hottest/wettest, and highest variability).\nEach of these assessments identify a subset of models that may prove useful to regional downscaling and impacts researchers who may be restricted by the total number of GCMs they can utilize. Results from these assessments will be provided as well as a discussion on when each would be useful and appropriate to use.",

This is due to several poorly understood processes including the microphysics of how particles nucleate ice, the number of effective heterogeneous ice nuclei and their atmospheric distribution, the role of anthropogenic activities in producing or changing the behavior of ice forming particles and the interplay between effective heterogeneous ice nuclei and homogeneous ice formation.\nOur team recently completed a three-part international workshop to improve our understanding of atmospheric ice formation. Termed the Fifth International Ice Nucleation (FIN) Workshops, our motivation was the limited number of measurements and a lack of understanding of how to compare data acquired by different groups. The first activity, termed FIN1, addressed the characterization of ice nucleating particle size, number and chemical composition. FIN2 addressed the determination of ice nucleating particle number density. Groups modeling ice nucleation joined FIN2 to provide insight on measurements critically needed to model atmospheric ice nucleation and to understand the performance of ice chambers. FIN1 and FIN2 took place at the Aerosol Interaction and Dynamics in the Atmosphere (AIDA) chamber at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. A particular emphasis of FIN1 and FIN2 was the use of ‘blind’ intercomparisons using a highly characterized, but unknown to the instrument operators, aerosol sample. The third activity, FIN3, took place at the Desert Research Institute’s Storm Peak Laboratory (SPL). A high elevation site not subject to local emissions, SPL allowed for a comparison of ice chambers and subsequent analysis of the ice residuals under the challenging conditions of low particle loading, temperature and pressure found in the atmosphere.\nThe presentation focuses on the improvement in understanding how mass spectra from different instruments can be compared from FIN1 and FIN3. The complementary nature of different ice chamber to access the diverse regimes of temperature and relative humidity space will also be discussed. As a result of the FIN Workshops we believe the performance of instruments in the field can now be quantified and compared.",

In the middle and outer regions, the convected kappa distribution function, with isotropy in the rest (subcorotating with the planet) frame, has been found to fit hot ion particle distributions well and has been useful for extracting physical plasma parameters including the vector bulk velocity and the characteristic energy (temperature) of the distribution. The kappa model of the plasma distribution function using hydrogen and oxygen ions (Saturn) and hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur ions (Jupiter) applied to observations generally indicates the presence of a hot ion population, energized in inner regions and adiabatically transported to the outer regions, but with significant exceptions. Higher mass species generally have a higher temperature. From the anisotropy of the distribution in the spacecraft frame, vector bulk velocity may be determined. From this analysis rotation curves for the plasma disks at Jupiter and Saturn reveal a plasma with significant subcorotation with a fraction that falls with increasing distance from the planet. There are local time asymmetries observed in the radial convection pattern. The plasma azimuthal convection patterns at Jupiter and Saturn and the characteristic temperature profiles are remarkably similar when scaled by the magnetopause distance and radial size of the planets.",

The magnetometer on the Galileo mission to Jupiter found compelling evidence for subsurface oceans on Europa, Ganymede and Callisto; however, the single induction frequency measured did not allow characteristics of the ocean to be discerned. The Interior Characterization of Europa using MAGnetometry (ICEMAG) instrument, selected for NASA’s Europa mission payload in May 2015, is designed to measure Europa’s induction response at multiple frequencies with high accuracy. ICEMAG definitively assesses the ice shell thickness, and the conductivity and thickness of the subsurface ocean. This knowledge informs models of Europa’s thermal evolution and allows evaluation of processes that have cycled material between the depths and the surface. Magnetic field measurements also determine the electrical currents associated with coupling of plumes to the corotating magnetospheric plasma and coupling of Europa to the Jovian ionosphere. ICEMAG utilizes UCLA fluxgate magnetic field sensors as well as JPL helium sensors in an integrated magnetic measurement system. The advent of laser-pumped helium sensors and advances in digital signal sampling enables an innovative multi-sensor magnetometer to be flown that is able to monitor spacecraft fields and maintain absolute accuracy of the measurement at a level of ~1 nT over time scales of years, without special maneuvers such as spacecraft rolls.",

Recent work has defined tall convection as regions with precipitation structures observed with spaceborne radar echo extending into the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere. While these climatological regions are known for these tall convective structures (subtropical South America, equatorial Africa, southcentral USA, South Asia), not all observed convective eventsin these regions contain strong structures, and the characteristics of the meteorological environments, including sounding profiles, that dictate the strength of the spectrum of convective systems are poorly constrained. In this study, precipitation radar (PR) data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and dual-frequency precipitation radar (DPR) from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellites will be examined alongside composites of atmospheric reanalysis data to examine the structural and meteorological environments surrounding observed tall convective systems. Environments of convective systems of various vertical extents will be contrasted with less extreme convection to infer physical causal mechanisms and to examine issues of predictability of these events.",

            "abstract": "While it is well known that organo-mineral complexes can protect organic matter (OM) from degradation, its impact on soil mineral weathering is not clear. Strong evidence has shown that the adsorption of OM to mineral surface accelerates the dissolution of some minerals, but these observations are limited to bench-scale experiments that focus on specific OM and minerals. In this study, soil samples prepared from an undisturbed forest site were used to determine mineral weathering rates under differing OM sorption on minerals. Soil samples from two depths, 0-6cm and 84-100cm, were chosen to represent different soil OM content and soil mineralogy. Soil OM was removed stepwise by heating samples to 350℃ for different durations (0-6cm: 100% removed, ~50% removed, and no removal; 84-100cm: 100% removed and no removal). Pretreated soil samples were subjected to flow-through, saturated column experiments using 0.01M LiCl and 5%CO2/95%air gas saturated (pH = 4.5) influent solution. Each column treatment was run in duplicate under a constant flow rate (Darcy velocity ≈ 8cm/hr). All columns reached a steady state after 600~700 pore volumes at which effluent pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and element concentrations were constant. At the 95% significance level, the DOC from OM-present columns was significantly higher, as expected. Correspondingly, effluent pH was lower in higher OM content columns. The chemical denudation rates were calculated from the effluent concentrations of the elements of interest. For the soil columns from both depths, silicon (Si) leaching rate showed that dissolution of silicate minerals was 2-3 times higher in OM-removed columns, suggesting that organo-mineral complexes suppress mineral dissolution. The N2-BET specific surface area (SSA) measurement also showed that the removal of OM increased SSA, which supported the idea that OM adsorption had decreased mineral exposure and thus decreased mineral dissolution. The leaching rates of some trace elements, including Mn, Ni, and Sr, were also significantly higher in OM-removed columns, reaffirming soil OM reduced mineral dissolution rates. Therefore, mineral chemical weathering, while widely considered facilitated by biological activities, may also suffer reduction when mineral surface is occluded by OM.",

            "abstract": "Extreme precipitation events across the Western US commonly associated with atmospheric rivers (ARs), whereby extensive fluxes of moisture are transported from the subtropics, can result in major damage and are projected by most climate models to increase in frequency and severity. However, they are difficult to project beyond ~ten days and the location of landfall and topographically induced precipitation is even more uncertain. Water isotopes, often used to reconstruct past rainfall variability, are useful natural tracers of atmospheric hydrologic processes. Because of the typical tropical and sub-tropical origins, ARs can carry unique water isotope (δ18O and δ2H, d-excess) signatures that can be utilized to provide source and process information that can lead to improving AR predictions. Recent analysis of the top 10 weekly precipitation total samples from Sequoia National Park, CA, of which 9 contained AR events, shows a high variability in the isotopic values. NOAA Hysplit back trajectory analyses reveals a variety of trajectories and varying latitudinal source regions contributed to moisture delivered to this site, which may explain part of the high variability (δ2H = -150.03 to -49.52 ‰, δ18O = -19.27 to -7.20 ‰, d-excess = 4.1 to 25.8). Here we examine the top precipitation totals occurring during AR events and the associated isotopic composition of precipitation samples from several sites across the Western US. We utilize IsoGSM, an isotope-enabled atmospheric general circulation model, to characterize the hydrologic processes and physical dynamics contributing to the observed isotopic variations. We investigate isotopic influences from moisture source location, AR speed, condensation height, and associated temperature. We explore the dominant controls on spatial and temporal variations of the isotopic composition of AR precipitation which highlights different physical processes for different AR events.",

Flux variance (FV) certainly has a few limitations and constraints but may be an interesting and competitive method in low-cost and power limited wireless sensor networks (WSN) with the advantage of providing spatio-temporal sensible heat flux over the domain of the network. In a first step, parameters such as sampling frequency, sensor response time, and averaging interval are investigated. Then we explore the applicability and the potential of the FV method for use in WSN in a field experiment. Low-cost sensor systems are tested and compared against reference instruments (3D sonic anemometers) to evaluate the performance and limitations of the sensors as well as the method with respect to the standard calculations. Comparison experiments were carried out at several sites to gauge the flux measurements over different surface types (gravel, grass, water) from the low-cost systems. This study should also serve as an example of spatially distributed sensible heat flux measurements.",

            "abstract": "Although it is recognized that catchment characteristics, such as topography, soils and vegetation, influence rainfall-runoff responses, the detailed knowledge on the variability of the responses and their controls remains limited, especially in the boreal region. Runoff responses have been shown to be highly variable across space and time, and can be seen as a result of interaction between many complex hydrological processes. Analysis of spatiotemporal variability in streamflow responses and threshold behaviour can lead to improved understanding of landscape hydrology, underlying controls and emergent properties.\nHere we investigate how rainfall-runoff responses and thresholds for runoff generation vary in space and time for 14 nested subcatchments in the 68 km2 boreal Krycklan catchment. By comparing streamflow responses and threshold behaviour for catchments with both similar and contrasting characteristics, we identify controls on the spatiotemporal streamflow variability in the landscape under different hydro-climatic conditions. We hypothesise that catchment characteristics such as vegetation, soils, topography and scale have a marked influence on streamflow responses, and that their influence varies with season and antecedent water storage in the landscape.",

This study examined the sensitivity of AAO to future warming by analyzing the outputs of 34 state-of-the-art climate models participating in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparion Project (CMIP5). The model simulations include the stabilized (RCP4.5) and business as usual (RCP8.5) scenarios as well as the idealized 1% per year increase in atmospheric CO2 to quadrupling (1pctCO2) and an instantaneous quadrupling of CO2 (abrupt4xCO2). We show that the CMIP5 models on average simulate increases in the AAO in every season by 2100 under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. However, due to the impacts of ozone, aerosol and land use changes, the amplitudes of the projected changes in AAO to future climate scenarios are quit different on different seasons. After the impact of ozone, aerosol and land use changes were removed; it was found that the impact of greenhouse gases (GHGs) on AAO is similar on all seasons. The increases of AAO are accelerating following the increase of GHGs. Our results are also consistent with the simulations of 1pctCO2 and abrupt4xCO2.",

SMART cables will: contribute to the understanding of ocean dynamics and climate; improve knowledge of earthquakes and forecasting of tsunamis; and complement and enhance existing satellite and in-situ observing systems. SMART cables will be a first order addition to the ocean observing system, with unique contributions, strengthening and complementing satellite and in situ systems. Cables spanning the ocean basins with repeaters every ~50 km will host sensors/mini-observatories, providing power and real-time communications. The current global infrastructure of commercial submarine telecommunications cable systems consists of 1 Gm of cable with ~20,000 repeaters (to boost optical signals); the overall system is refreshed and expanded on time scales of 10 – 20 years and individual systems have lifetimes in excess of 25 years. Initial instrumentation of the cables with bottom temperature, pressure and acceleration sensors will provide unique information for monitoring and studying climate change and for improved tsunami and earthquake warning. These systems will be a new highly reliable, long-lived component of the ocean observing system, complementing satellite, float and other in situ platforms and measurements. Several UN agencies, the International Telecommunication Union, the World Meteorological Organization, and the UNESCO Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission have formed a Joint Task Force to move this concept to fruition (ITU/WMO/IOC JTF;\nhttp://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/climatechange/task-force-sc)\n.

Specifically, these pyroclasts may record several episodes of crystal and bubble growth, as well as bubble coalescence and collapse. Furthermore, bombs retrieved from sequential eruptions provide valuable insight into the unobservable evolution of a volcanic conduit over time. We present results from a morphological and textural study of vesicle size distributions in ballistic bombs from six Vulcanian eruptions from the 2004-2012 period of activity of Galeras volcano, Colombia. These violent eruptions cyclically destroyed and ejected a stalled, degassed and crystal-rich plug and a limited amount of underlying magma. They were followed by resumption of the slow rise of magma in the shallow conduit, accompanied by redevelopment of a plug and the perpetuation of a hazardous cycle. We find that bombs from these eruptions fall into three morphological classes including dense bombs, breadcrusted bombs and vesicular bombs based on the existence or absence of a primary quenched rind and comparison of the interior and exterior vesicularities. We study vesicle populations using image analysis of SEM images followed by stereological conversion to reconstruct the degassing history of each pyroclast. The results of this study will be used to produce a quantitative model of the evolution of porosity, permeability and degassing in the upper conduit of Galeras volcano during the 2004-2012 eruptive episode.",

Estimating the amount and distribution of soil carbon in these regions is challenging due to their high degree of spatial heterogeneity. We aim to develop a total soil carbon model using tangential curvature, total mobile regolith depth, and aspect in order to predict the distribution of soil carbon in complex terrain within a semi-arid environment. We excavated 45 randomly selected soil pits down to saprolite in a first order watershed within the Reynolds Creek Critical Zone Observatory located in Southwestern Idaho. Total mobile regolith depth was measured vertically and plotted against tangential curvature to produce an inverse linear relationship function, predicting soil depth to an r2 value of 0.86. Soil depths were plotted against total soil carbon for both the north and south-facing aspects. A quadratic polynomial function fit well with r2 values of 0.90 and 0.89, respectively. Across the watershed, total soil carbon on the north-facing aspect was 8.02 x1011 Kg C or ~38% of the total soil carbon, despite comprising only ~33% of the total land area. South-facing aspect totaled 9.87 x1011 Kg C, or ~46% of the total soil carbon. East and west aspects were excluded. If samples were collected to a maximum depth of 1 m, total soil carbon would be underestimated by ~1.6 times the amount that we predict (1.31 x1012 to 2.12 x1012 Kg C, respectively). By sampling down to saprolite, our model has the potential to provide more accurate total carbon pools than other models, which focus only on the upper 1 m of soil. Our findings indicate that a significant amount of carbon is stored deep in critical zone that may be less sensitive to loss and that estimates of soil carbon significantly underestimate total soil carbon stores on complex terrain.",

The LOFS is a regional-scale shear zone, which accommodates part of the oblique component of the convergence vector. In the LOFS southern end, an extensional strike-slip duplex arises from the connection between two NNE-striking master faults, where two damaging earthquakes (6.1-6.2 Mw) occurred in 2007. In order to understand the nature and origin of the stress field within the duplex area, we calculate the ellipticity of the stress tensor field by means of a 3D finite element model. The model represents the brittle-plastic transition in the mid crust, within which the fault zone is mechanically distinguished from the host rock in a continuum fashion. The fault zone is modeled by using an elastic-plastic constitutive relation, which is built on the basis of a range of width and orientation of mylonitic bands, representing the fault zone as seen in the field. Boundary conditions reproduce the convergence velocity between Nazca and South-America plates. Results are broadly consistent with structural data and seismicity recorded in the region. Extensional-to-transtensional stress regimes match spatially with a seismic swarm recorded in the region in 2007, and with the spatial distribution of quaternary volcanic centers. The model also shows a transpressive state of stress in the western branch of the LOFS, whereas in the eastern branch, pure strike-slip is obtained. We propose that the current duplex kinematics can be explained by convergence obliquity, duplex geometry and the occurrence of plastic deformation, which are sufficient enough to deliver the current stress configuration. Sources of discrepancy between structural data and model results might be explained by other factors not considered by the model, such as the timing of deformation or the current activity of blind faults.",

When a source is connected to the well casing, the well casing acts to distribute the current along the casing and into the formations adjacent to the well. The currents leaving the casing can be modelled as a distribution of smaller sources along the well path. In this study we show through modelling both synthetic and field data that using a well casing to draw current deeper into the earth offers the ability to image electrical resistivity structure at depths deeper than surface transmitters allow.\nElectric field data have been collected at a future CO2 sequestration site in Montana, where a steel-cased well drilled to about 1.4 km below the surface was utilized for the source. Electric field measurements were made in two scenarios, 1) while current was transmitted between surface electrodes, and 2) while current was transmitted from the wellhead to a surface return electrode. Modelling has indicated that the electric fields measured during the wellhead transmission result in sensitivity to deeper structure than the surface measurements. 3D Inversion of surface and casing electrode data provided results consistent with the data and knowledge of background structure.\nThis particular survey was completed prior to CO2 injection into the reservoir layer, and has provided the baseline for a time lapse field experiment. The model produced by this baseline survey will be used as a starting model for the inversion of data collected after CO2 has been injected.",

For example, solar energetic particles are accelerated at the shock and storm sudden commencements are produced by the impingement of the Earth by the shocks. Here, we study shocks associated with two major CME events – the Halloween 2003 and the 23 July 2012 CME events, using a three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamics model (H3DMHD). The H3DMHD (Wu et al. 2007, JGR) combines the kinematic solar wind model (HAF) for regions near the solar surface (2.5–18 Rs) and a 3D magnetohydrodynamics model (Han et al. 1988), which takes output from HAF at 18 Rs and propagates outward up to 1.7 AU. The H3DMHD code has been fully tested and is capable of simulating disturbances propagating in the solar wind. We will focus on the temporal and spatial structure of the CME-driven shocks, including the shock type and strength.",

            "abstract": "Widespread deforestation from the 1960s through 1980s, blamed for catastrophic flooding in the lower Yangtze in 1998, prompted bans on logging and agriculture on steep slopes in western China. However, despite reports of extensive erosion resulting from the deforestation, sediment yield data show no corresponding increase during this time. Prior work suggested that if the deforestation increased erosion, the sediment is stored in floodplains, terraces, and alluvial fans throughout the region. In order to test this hypothesis, we sampled in-channel and overbank sediments at 38 locations, 19 of which are co-located with Chinese hydrology stations with at least five years of daily sediment yield data. Sediments were analyzed for meteoric and in situ 10-Be, unsupported 210-Pb, and 137-Cs. Unsupported 210-Pb activity is uniformly low throughout the study area and 137-Cs was found only in a few high-altitude, low-relief watersheds. Modern sediment yields, determined from Chinese data, are higher than long term in situ 10-Be-derived erosion rates in all but four watersheds, where we hypothesize sediment is being stored in alluvial features and agricultural terraces or that stochastic events such as landslides were not captured in the sediment yield data. Overall there is no relationship between topographic or climatic metrics, including slope, relief, or mean annual rainfall for any of the four isotopes except for a weak but statistically significant negative relationship between in situ 10-Be derived erosion rate and rainfall. Although paired in-channel and overbank samples are statistically indistinguishable for meteoric and in situ 10-Be, the overbank samples have lower unsupported 210-Pb activity, suggesting deeper sediment sourcing during the monsoon. In summary, in addition to suggesting differences between wet- and dry-season sediment sources, preliminary results support previous hypotheses regarding increased contemporary erosion and low hillslope-channel connectivity.",

Multiple avenues of research coalesced in the 1960’s to foment the development of chemical hydrogeology as a distinct field. In the intervening 50 years, chemical hydrogeology principles have been applied to innumerable issues and problems, and concomitantly, the field has continually experienced advances, breakthroughs, and innovations in theory, analysis, and application. An overarching theme to chemical hydrogeology in both theory and application is integration--- integration of disciplines (interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary), integration of approaches (theoretical, experimental, analytical), and integration of scales (spatial, temporal). Chemical hydrogeology has never been more relevant and more challenged as today, as we face critical issues related to for example water scarcity and availability of clean water, impacts of energy development, production and storage, and human interactions with ecosystem services. This presentation will illustrate recent advances in chemical hydrogeology, ranging from application of advanced imaging for characterization of pore-scale multiphase systems to integrated physical and biogeochemical assessments of field-scale contaminant transport.",

            "abstract": "Natural wetlands are the world's largest methane (CH4) source, and their distribution and CH4 fluxes are sensitive to interannual and longer-term climate variations. Wetland distributions used in wetland-CH4 models diverge widely, and these geographic differences contribute substantially to large variations in magnitude, seasonality and distribution of modeled methane fluxes. Modeling wetland type and distribution—closely tied to simulating CH4 emissions—is a high priority, particularly for studies of wetlands and CH4 dynamics under past and future climates.\nMethane-wetland models either prescribe or simulate methane-producing areas (aka wetlands) and both approaches result in predictable over- and under-estimates. 1) Monthly satellite-derived inundation data include flooded areas that are not wetlands (e.g., lakes, reservoirs, and rivers), and do not identify non-flooded wetlands. 2) Models simulating methane-producing areas overwhelmingly rely on modeled soil moisture, systematically over-estimating total global area, with regional over- and under-estimates, while schemes to model soil-moisture typically cannot account for positive water tables (i.e., flooding). Interestingly, while these distinct hydrological approaches to identify wetlands are complementary, merging them does not provide critical data needed to model wetlands for methane studies.\nWe present a new integrated framework for modeling wetlands, and ultimately their methane emissions, that exploits the extensive body of data and information on wetlands. The foundation of the approach is an existing global gridded data set comprising all and only wetlands, including vegetation information. This data set is augmented with data inter alia on climate, inundation dynamics, soil type and soil carbon, permafrost, active-layer depth, growth form, and species composition. We investigate this enhanced wetland data set to identify which variables best explain occurrence and characteristics of observed wetland ecosystems. The novelty of the new approach is that it starts from what we know about wetlands, builds ecosystem-specific models from these observations, and avoids known biases in current hydrology-based approaches to wetland definition in methane models.",

Despite many developments in the field, the direct measurement of fine sediment erosion (entrainment) rates in immobile coarse beds remains challenging. We developed a new approach for measurement of fine sediment erosion rate in coarse immobile bed in laboratory experiment. The method uses single laser line, a video camera and a reflective mirror. It allows a non-intrusive, fast and accurate measurement of fine sediment erosion rate in running water and non-equilibrium transport conditions. The measurement method was conducted for flow depth that ranges from 3.0 cm to 8.0 cm. We present procedures developed to extract laser lines from series of images captured at high temporal resolution and to estimate rapid evolution of fine sediment erosion depth within the roughness layer of the immobile gravel bed. With the use of a reflective mirror the depth of erosion can be measured with sub-millimeter (350µm) resolution. The results of the measurements are used to describe vertical profile of fine sediment erosion rate in the gravel roughness layer and its spatial heterogeneity. The spatial pattern of erosion rates shows good agreement with gravel bed turbulent flow structures.",

Understanding fast-flowing glaciers and accelerations in ice flow, of which surging is one type, is critical to understanding changes in the cryosphere and ultimately changes in sea level. It is important to distinguish between types of accelerations and their consequences, especially between reversible or quasi-cyclic and irreversible forms of glacial acceleration, but current icesheet models treat all accelerating ice identically. Additionally, the surge provides an exceptional opportunity to study the influence of surface roughness and water content on return signals of altimeter systems. In this presentation, we analyze radar and laser altimeter data from CryoSat-2, NASA's Operation IceBridge (OIB), the ICESat Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS), ICESat-2's predecessor the Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar (MABEL), and airborne laser altimeter and imagery campaigns by our research group. These measurements are used to study elevation, elevation change and crevassing throughout the glacier system. Analysis of the imagery from our airborne campaigns provides comprehensive characterizations of the BBGS surface over the course of the surge.

            "abstract": "Early to Late Cretaceous lasting to Paleocene alkaline magmatism from southern Brazil is found associated with major extensional structural features in and around the Paraná Basin and grouped into various provinces on the basis of several data. Magmatism is variable in size, mode of occurrence and composition. The alkaline rocks are dominantly potassic, a few occurrences showing sodic affinity. The more abundant silicate rocks are evolved undersaturated to saturated in silica syenites, displaying large variation in igneous forms. Less evolved types are restricted to subvolcanic environments and outcrops of effusive suites occur rarely. Cumulatic mafic and ultramafic rock types are very common, particularly in the alkali-carbonatitic complexes. Carbonatite bodies are represented by Ca-carbonatites and Mg-carbonatites and more scarcely by Fe-carbonatites. Available radiometric ages for the alkaline rocks fit on three main chronological groups: around 130 Ma, subcoveal with the Early Cretaceous flood tholeiites of the Paraná Basin, 100-110 Ma and 80-90 Ma (Late Cretaceous). The alkaline magmatism also extends into Paleocene times, as indicated by ages from some volcanic lavas. Geochemically, alkaline potassic and sodic rock types are distinguished by their negative and positive Nb-Ta anomalies, respectively. Negative spikes in Nb-Ta are also a feature common to the associated tholeiitic rocks. Sr-Nd-Pb systematics confirm the contribution of both HIMU and EMI mantle components in the formation of the alkaline rocks. Notably, Early and Late Cretaceous carbonatites have the same isotopic Sr-Nd initial ratios of the associated alkaline rocks. C-O isotopic Sr-Nd isotopic ratios indicate typical mantle signature for some carbonatites and the influence of post-magmatic processes in others. Immiscibility of liquids of phonolitic composition, derived from mafic alkaline parental magmas, has been responsible for the origin of the carbonatites. Close association of alkaline and tholeiitic rocks requires that their parental magmas resulted from small subcontinental mantle masses, vertical and laterally heterogeneous in composition and variously enriched in incompatible elements. Isotopically distinct magmas were generated following mantle metasomatic events at Middle and Late Proterozoic.",

We report on a comprehensive mapping effort, utilizing feature tracking in Landsat 8 imagery, that is producing a spatial and temporal picture of ice flow variations across southern and southeastern Alaska for glaciers half a kilometer in width and larger. We show that coverage and image characteristics for Landsat 8 enable sampling that is sufficient to track seasonal variations in flow speed for tidewater outlets; surge termination, initiation, and surge front propagation; and summer/winter flow variations for other land-terminating systems. Using the example of the 2014-15 surge of Walsh Glacier, seasonal changes on Columbia glacier, and comprehensive mosaics of ice flow across southern Alaska on a quarterly basis, we will demonstrate that we have entered an era when flow variations can be tracked in near real time, over large areas, with coverage suitable to follow evolving seasonal patterns even in frequently cloudy areas. As the Landsat 8 record continues to grow, it becomes possible to delimit surging and non-surging systems based on their flow speed history, rather than incomplete records of past flow and appearance.",

            "abstract": "Tsunami deposits on coastal plains are commonly observed to gradually thin inland and contain upward fining sand units. These characteristics help validate the assumptions (steady and uniform onshore flow and sediment settling from suspension) that are employed by inverse sediment transport models, which predict flow speed from thickness and grain size data. On Sedanka Island in the eastern Aleutian Islands, a sequence of 6 tsunami deposits from the last 1700 years have been described that extend across an 800 m strandplain and reach elevations up to 15 m. The youngest deposit is attributed to the 1957 Andreanof Island earthquake (Mw 8.6) and is 1-13 cm thick. The older deposits are thicker (6-50 cm) and all of the layers contain upward fining sand units. Although the total volume of sediment varies among deposits, they all thicken landward, toward the back of the valley. We developed a Delft3D forward tsunami sediment transport model to better understand the conditions that resulted in this spatial pattern of deposit thickening. Results from a profile model suggest that sediment eroded from the beach and berm is transported to the back of the valley during uprush. Significant deposition does not occur until the initial wave reflects off the steep topography at the back of the valley and the local flow velocity drops, with the highest rate of deposition occurring during slow return flow as sediment settles out of the water column. A 3D model will be used to determine if the funnel-shape of the valley produces convergences that can explain the observed deposit thickening, and to see if a majority of the deposition still occurs during return flow. Finally, we will use flow depths from the forward model to constrain a TSUSEDMOD inverse model and see if it can reproduce the observed deposit grading and modeled flow velocities. If so, the inverse model may be applied to deposits in other locations where similar hydrodynamic conditions are suspected occur.",

We estimate the relationship between emissions and ambient air concentrations of BC using the Community Atmosphere Model to create source-receptor that allow reconstruction of ambient, time-varying concentrations. We adjust this matrix to account for errors in modeled mixing height with observations. We also apply Heating Degree Days (HDD) data to estimate seasonal variation in emissions. However, HDDs do not fully explain the seasonal variation trend of the measurement.\nThe emission inventory used in this work is based on U.S. Energy Information Administration fuel use data published in 2010. We calculate BC emissions with Speciated Pollutant Emissions Wizard (SPEW). Modifications to previous work include use of the SPEW-Trend vehicle fleet model to compute vehicle emissions, incorporating parameters of vehicle type, age, retirement rate, and the number of superemitters.\nAnalyzing the discrepancy between reconstructed and measured BC concentrations of California and New Jersey identifies potential errors in historical emissions. Acknowledging the resolution difference between the reconstructed concentrations based on global model simulation and the urban measurements, we rely more on the discrepancies in trends than in absolute discrepancies. Although the observations decreased throughout this time period, the reconstructed concentrations peaked in the 1980s. Fuel use and emission factors for specific technologies and sectors in the BC emission inventory are analyzed to isolate those sectors most likely to cause the discrepancy. The modified emission inventory for the period 1960-2000 is presented.",

            "abstract": "In the marine environment, sediments in the gas hydrate stability zone often correspond to slope and basin settings. These settings are dominantly composed of fine-grained silt and clay lithofacies with typically low vertical permeability, and pore fluids frequently under-saturated with respect to methane. As a result, the pressure-temperature conditions requisite for a GHSZ to be present occur widely worldwide across marine settings, however, the distribution of gas hydrate in these settings is neither ubiquitous nor uniform. This study uses sediment core and borehole related data recovered by drilling at Site 17 in the Andaman Sea during the Indian National Gas Hydrate Program Expedition 1 in 2006, to investigate reservoir-scale controls on gas hydrate distribution. In particular, this study finds that conditions beyond reservoir pressure, temperature, salinity, and gas concentration, appear to influence the concentration of gas hydrate in host sediments. Using field-generated datasets along with newly acquired sedimentology, physical property, imaging and geochemical data with mineral saturation and ion activity products of key mineral phases such as amorphous silica and calcite, we document the presence and nature of secondary precipitates that contributed to anomalous porosity preservation at Site 17 in the Andaman Sea. This study demonstrates the importance of grain-scale subsurface heterogeneities in controlling the occurrence and distribution of concentrated gas hydrate accumulations in marine sediments, and document the importance that increased permeability and enhanced porosity play in supporting gas concentrations sufficient to support gas hydrate formation. This illustrates the complex balance and lithology-driven controls on hydrate accumulations of higher concentrations and offers insights into what may control the occurrence and distribution of gas hydrate in other sedimentary settings.",

In both regions, DMA exhibits a unimodal mass size distribution with a dominant peak between 0.18 – 0.56 μm. Aminium salt formation is likely the dominant path for DMA into particles, but DMA can partition to coarse particle (e.g., dust, sea salt) surfaces too. The ratio of DMA to ammonium for bulk aerosol reaches up to 8% and 15% for Tucson and NiCE, respectively. Marine biogenic emissions are shown to be a significant source of DMA, with DMA being over three times as high during NiCE versus at Tucson. Wildfires during NiCE did not impact the mass size distribution of particulate DMA; conversely, significant DMA concentration enhancements were observed in cloud water due to dissolution. It is likely that DMA, similar to nitrate, volatilizes after drop evaporation, which is why enhancements were not observed in surface or airborne aerosol measurements. PM1.0 data in Tucson show the following: (i) year-long DMA concentrations are positively correlated with factors that enhance sulfate formation, biogenic volatile organic compound emissions, and aerosol-phase water; and (ii) DMA concentrations exhibit positive correlations with various trace elements, most especially vanadium, which warrants additional investigation.",

In coastal wetlands, one indicator of restoration of ecosystem function can be seen with organic matter (specifically carbon) accretion. SL-15, a spoil island in Fort Pierce, Fl was restored in 2005, and has been monitored for return to natural condition over the last 10 years.. To assess sediment carbon accretion, sediment cores were collected in a set of eight plots, located on the SL-15 mangrove island and the surrounding seagrass recruitment area. These were analyzed for organic carbon, microbial biomass carbon, extractable carbon, and total nitrogen. The biogeochemical data collected in the previous year was compared to data collected in 2005-2007. Vegetation surveys were also completed to show the build-up of organic material in accordance with vegetation shift over the 9-year period. From this information, a trajectory has been formulated on organic carbon accretion and vegetation shift from the time of orginal restoration activities. By comparison to control sites nearby, realistic estimates of time required to reach natural levels of carbon and vegetation community structure can be calculated..",

In this study, we analyze the zonal wavenumber spectrum of atmospheric wave forcing in the lower stratosphere to understand the annual cycle of upwelling at the tropical tropopause. Tropopause upwelling is derived based on the wave forcing computed from ERA-Interim reanalysis using the momentum and mass conservation equations in the transformed Eulerian-mean framework. The calculated upwelling agrees well with other upwelling estimates and successfully captures the annual cycle, with a maximum during Northern Hemisphere (NH) winter. The spectrum of wave forcing reveals that zonal wavenumber-3 component drives a large portion of the annual cycle in upwelling with a secondary contribution from wavenumber-4 component. The wave activity flux (Eliassen-Palm flux) shows that both tropical and extratropical waves are equally important for the annual cycle. The quasi-geostrophic refractive index suggests that the NH extratropical wavenumber-3 component can enhance tropopause upwelling because these planetary-scale waves are largely trapped in the vertical, while being refracted towards the subtropical upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. Regression analysis based on interannual variability suggests that the wavenumber-3 waves are related to tropical convection and wave breaking along the subtropical jet in the NH extratropics.",

            "abstract": "Detailed studies of surface processes and landforms in periglacial environments have proven successful in unraveling the timing and duration of small-scale temperature shifts. Here, we use alluvial fans in the high elevations of the McMurdo Dry Valleys (MDV) of Antarctica as a novel proxy for climate change in the MDV. Alluvial fan depositional events require sufficient melting of the alcove snow (or ice) to enable sediment transport. Under current climate conditions the alluvial fans appear inactive, as there exists insufficient energy for adequate snowmelt. Hence, fan activation suggests times when climate conditions favor meltwater production (i.e. elevated temperatures). Our study reconstructs the depositional history of five high-elevation alluvial fans in the MDV by dating individual sedimentary units using optically stimulated luminescence (OSL). Ages of deposition appear clustered with two groupings in the Holocene and one cluster of deposits slightly older (~14-16ka). We identified high-elevation alluvial fan deposition is sensitive to long duration, low intense summers consistent with previous studies showing increase in cumulative positive degree days to be the primary driver for the terrestrial ice sheets and a warmer Antarctica. Alluvial fan deposition also occurs with short, high insolation summers; a forcing that is secondary or possibly lost in ice sheet or MDV alpine glacier fluctuation. The discovery of repeated high-elevation inland warming evident by meltwater events in the Holocene is unexpected when compared with the nearby geomorphic features including buried ice, rectilinear slopes, and paleosols that appear unmodified for millions of years. We are hopeful the inland alluvial fans will provide controls into the precise climatic conditions required to support surficial melting of the nearby East Antarctic Ice Sheet during times of high insolation or Quaternary interglacials.",

            "abstract": "New York City’s coastlines are a mosaic of remnant natural habitat, man-made wetlands, manicured parkland, public beaches, housing, and industrial centers, all of which are extremely vulnerable to flooding, storm surge, and damaging wave action. Risks are projected to increase overtime as sea levels rise, population grows, and the frequency and severity of extreme events increases. In order to protect its citizens and infrastructure, New York City is planning to invest $20 billion into a coastal protection plan, including $200 million towards wetlands creation and restoration.\nFocusing on the role of wetlands and parkland in reducing damages during Hurricane Sandy, our study seeks to identify the primary causes of coastal vulnerability and to provide guidelines for the design of coastal protection measures. Our findings show that most of the small, fragmented NYC's wetlands did not provide significant protection from the violence of the hurricane. Large stretches of wetlands and parkland, on the other hand, were found to exacerbate storm surge along the coast, but did reduce surge penetration further inland. Much of the protection provided by wetlands and coastal green sites was in the form of cost avoidance. Wetlands existed in the most heavily hit areas and so averted damages that would have occurred if those areas had been developed. Our results suggest that, when positioned in the highest risk areas, coastal green infrastructure such as wetlands and parklands can reduce coastal flood risks associated with extreme events like Hurricane Sandy. Policy would ideally prioritize conservation, restoration, and enhancement of large contiguous areas of wetlands in the lowest elevation areas of the city. Where low-lying coastal development cannot be relocated, the risk of damage from storm surges is best reduced by elevating critical infrastructure.",

            "abstract": "Estimating groundwater recharge in cold climates, during periods of dynamic seasonality such as winter and spring freshets is challenging due to subsurface heterogeneities and the complexity of vadose zone processes under partially frozen conditions. In order to obtain robust recharge estimates, numerical models simulating these complex processes need to be based on reliable parameter estimates and closely calibrated to field observations. This study focuses on quantifying recharge under an ephemeral stream that develops in the vicinity of a municipal well field during spring and winter freshets at a site in Southern Ontario. Temperature and moisture content profiles in the vadose zone were obtained during the 2015 spring melt at three different locations, using a variety of hydrogeological instruments. Temperature thermisters and Tid-Bit transducers were both installed at 15-30 cm spacings to the depth of the water table in order to compare and calibrate the results. Similarly, Time Domain Reflectometry probes were placed to the depth of the water table and the results were calibrated to daily moisture content readings taken with a Neutron Probe. Water table fluctuations were monitored and regular water samples were taken for analysis of geochemistry and isotope fractionation. This data provided the boundary conditions for the numerical model (Hydrus 1D) and allowed for its calibration and validation. Regions of rapid infiltration were observed at the site, as well as steep temperature gradients that could be used as a tracer for estimating recharge in cold climates. The geochemistry and isotope fractionation results provided support of surface water groundwater interaction within event based time periods predicted by the numerical models. Furthermore, the surface water samples were found to have high concentrations of microbial indicator species, and therefore the intense recharge phenomena observed at the site has significant implications to groundwater vulnerability. The results of this study are important in managing the sustainability of groundwater resources from surface contaminants such as pathogens and for informing source water protection strategies in response to dynamic seasonality.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU poster v5.pdf\nDecision making in disaster recovery involves both rapid scaling up of resources and personnel from external sources, to rebuild a damaged community, and consequent scaling down of this influx of new actors, organizations, and resources as the community returns to daily operations. How to integrate new concepts, technologies, and resources into communities to rebuild the social, economic, and political infrastructure in stronger, more sustainable ways, as well to reconstruct the damaged technical infrastructure represents a challenging set of problems for any community. This problem is critical in environments exposed to recurring risk of interacting hazards that characterize metropolitan regions today. This analysis will examine the process of decision making that is being initiated at national, regional, district, and municipal levels in Nepal following the April 25 and May 12, 2015 Earthquakes as a field study of this process in action. We will build on an initial brief reconnaissance trip to Nepal, June 30 – July 10, 2015, just as response operations were ending and the transition to recovery was beginning. It will capture this transition process to identify the organizational structure through which it operates and the communication and coordination processes that enhance or impede the development of sustainable, disaster-resilient communities as they recover from disaster. We will collect three types of data from different sources, and use appropriate methods of analysis for each type of data. For documentary analysis, we will trace the logic of governmental action for managing risk and recovering from disaster that is stated in public laws, policies, and documents. For electronic media, we will use content analysis to identify key actors, organizations, transactions, and interactions among actors, and conduct a network analysis, using standard measures of centrality, distance, closeness, and clustering. We will use expert interviews and satellite maps to validate findings from other methods of analysis. We anticipate developing a Bayesian Influence Diagram to identify strategies of action and points where the process can be strengthened to achieve the intended results of rebuilding sustainable, disaster resilient communities at different scales of operation in a complex, national system.",

            "abstract": "Lake ecosystems face a multitude of environmental threats including: eutrophication, overfishing, and heavy metal pollution. Tools to identify lakes impacted by human activity and quantify that impact are needed to combat their environmental degradation. One such promising tool has been the comparison between living communities and associated time-averaged death assemblages of mollusks in marine environments. Here we extend the reach of such live/dead comparisons using ostracodes in temperate lakes. We sampled six lakes in Wisconsin for living communities and associated death assemblages of ostracodes: two lakes impacted by human activity, two relatively “pristine” lakes, and two remediated lakes. We took sixteen grab samples of the upper centimeter of sediment in each lake, capturing simultaneously living benthic ostracodes and discarded valves of dead ostracodes. We found that impacted lakes had lower live/dead fidelity in taxonomic composition and rank-order abundance distributions and greater within-lake variation in death assemblages than “pristine” lakes. Additionally, the living communities in the impacted lakes tended to be lower in species richness and have lower evenness than “pristine” lakes. Remediated lakes displayed similar live/dead fidelity in taxonomic composition and rank-abundance distributions to “pristine” lakes and had lower within-lake variation in death assemblages than impacted lakes. Remediated lakes also contained living communities that tended to be richer and more even than impacted lakes. The lower live/dead fidelity of ostracodes in impacted lakes indicate live/dead ostracode comparisons can provide a tool to identify lake ecosystems impacted by humans. The similar results of remediated and “pristine” lakes indicate remediation efforts in these lakes have been successful in alleviating environmental impact detrimental to ostracode communities. This result indicates live/dead comparisons of ostracodes can be a useful tool to monitor the progress of remediation efforts already underway. Further work will focus on dating the upper centimeter of sediment in these lakes to provide an estimate of how long it takes for death assemblages to accumulate and thus how long it will take to regain high live/dead fidelity in impacted lakes undergoing remediation.",

            "abstract": "DEEPWAVE is an international program designed to quantify gravity wave (GW) dynamics and effects from the ground to the upper mesosphere in unprecedented detail utilizing a range of airborne and ground-based measurements. DEEPWAVE was based on the South Island, New Zealand, to provide access to well-documented, but little understood, New Zealand and Tasmania “hotspots” as identified in satellite stratospheric measurements. Deep orographic GWs over New Zealand were a primary target, but multiple flights were also conducted over the Southern Ocean and Tasman Sea to quantify deep GW arising from convection, jet streams, and frontal systems.\nThis presentation highlights new airborne and ground-based results obtained using an Advanced OH Mesospheric Temperature Mapper (AMTM) which creates high-quality intensity and temperature maps of a broad spectrum of mesospheric GWs. Two AMTM’s were employed, one sited at the NIWA Observatory, Lauder (45°S), on the South Island, and one on the NSF GV Gulfstream aircraft which was supplemented by two side viewing IR OH imagers providing large field, ~900 km cross-track, GW maps. These instruments formed part of a comprehensive measurements capability including airborne Rayleigh and Na lidars, dropsondes, ground-based Rayleigh lidar, all-sky imagers and wind measurements. A total of 25 long duration (typically 7-8 hours) nighttime flights were conducted creating an exceptionally rich data set. Here we focus on two key initial findings (a) discovery of large amplitude, mesospheric mountain waves and their intermittent wave breaking signatures, and (b) first measurements of large-field open-ocean mesospheric GW and their near-identical stratospheric wave signatures using AIRS satellite and model forecasting data.",

            "abstract": "A major (>M6) earthquake on the Hayward fault would be catastrophic, resulting in wide-ranging structural damage and potential loss of life. California State University, East Bay (CSUEB), in Hayward lies within the Hayward fault zone and is home to student residents. The campus is bound to the west by the Hayward and on the east by Chabot (CF) fault and is pervasively cut by anastomosing secondary splay faults. In June 2015 three exploratory trenches were opened on CSUEB campus to evaluate faulting within the proposed construction area of new student housing. Previous work by Dibblee found minor faulting in this area that we consider to be splays of the CF. We took the opportunity to conduct an active seismic survey, coincident with two of these three trenches. The purpose of our survey was to compare the results of these two methods, to further assess seismic hazard on campus, and to contribute to the ongoing effort to create a 3D model of the campus area. P-waves were generated by plate and 3.5kg sledgehammer, recorded on a 48-channel single component array for P-wave tomography and multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW). Line 1 was 141m long with 3m receiver spacing and 9m shot spacing, and Line 2 was 188m long with 4m receivers spacing and 12m spacing. Initial P-wave tomography models show two velocity structures. To a depth of 25m, velocities ranged from 750–3000 m/s. At depths below 25m, we recorded P-wave velocities up to 6500 m/s, flanked by lower velocities, suggesting a bedrock unit bound by tectonically sheared material. Trench results indicate that faults and shears are indeed present in the top 2m. Additional near-surface seismic surveys are planned for the fall of 2015 to extend the trace of these faults, as they appear to cut across the entire campus. Furthermore, additional analysis of current and future seismic surveys will provide data on strong ground motion and offer insight into seismic hazards on the CSUEB campus. These new data will be integrated into an ongoing effort to create a 3D model of the geologic and tectonic setting of the CSUEB campus.",

Accurate discrimination of earthquakes from blast events is crucial for evaluating\nrecent seismicity with respect to the historical catalog and for assessing seismic hazards associated with\nnaturally occurring or induced seismicity. In general, blast events are discriminated from earthquakes based on\ntheir proximity to active mines and quarries in addition to day-of-week and time-of-day timing patterns. In some\nparts of western Alberta, however, seismicity originates in regions with active mines, historical earthquake\nseismicity, and hydraulic fracturing operations. Based on timing patterns or event locations alone, natural or\ninduced seismicity may be misidentified as mining activity. Several studies report that relative differences in\nFourier or response spectra can be used to discriminate blast and earthquake events. Other studies report that\nthe relative timing and amplitude of seismic phases may provide useful metrics for classifying blast events.\nHere we propose an alternative method that accounts for both differences in phase spectra and phase timing\nand amplitude. In particular, we evaluate the normalized time integral for characteristic functions of particle\nmotion from confirmed blast and earthquake events recorded by regional Alberta seismic networks. We\nthen use these time-integral profiles to re-classify events that are initially categorized as suspected blasts\nbased on timing pattern and event location indicators.",

Geological influences vary widely from subglacial hydrochemistry to deformable till rheology, which may be governed by the mineralogy and grain size distribution within the till. In an investigation of borehole and proglacial water at an unnamed glacier in the Donjek Range of the St. Elias Mountains, Yukon, Canada, we find that subglacial mineral precipitation exerts a significant control on the proglacial hydrochemistry and suspended sediment flux. To understand if this process is common to glaciers across the range, we collected proglacial water samples from 20 glaciers in and around the Donjek Range. From each sample, we analyzed the hydrochemistry, measured the grain size distribution (GSD) using a Mastersizer laser diffraction particle size analyzer, and analyzed the mineralogy of the suspended sediments using X-ray diffraction. We also analyzed thin sections from bedrock samples collected at the glacier margins to constrain the mineralogical input to the system. This suite of measurements permits us to investigate the discrepancies between the secondary minerals predicted by the proglacial hydrochemistry and the observed mineralogy. Given that glaciers in the sample set exhibit a range of dynamic behaviour (including surging), we investigate how the mineralogy, GSDs, and hydrochemistry vary as a function of glacier dynamics. Where we have identified correlations between surging glaciers and proglacial GSDs, we investigate the possible controls of hydrochemistry and/or mineralogy on the GSDs and thus on subglacial dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Uranium isotopes (δ238U values) are an emerging paleoredox proxy that can help to better understand the redox evolution of Earth’s surface environment. Recently, uranium isotopes have been used to reconstruct ocean and atmospheric redox conditions (Montoya-Pino et al., 2010; Brennecka et al., 2011; Kendall et al., 2013; Dahl et al., 2014). However, to date, there have not been studies on paleosols, despite that paleosols are, arguably better suited to directly tracking the redox conditions of the atmosphere. Sedimentary δ238U variability requires the formation of the soluble, oxidized form of U, U(VI). The formation of U(VI) is generally thought to require oxygen levels orders of magnitude higher than prebiotic levels. Without significant U mobility, it would have been impossible to develop isotopically distinct pools of uranium in ancient Earth environments. Conversely, an active U redox cycle leads to significant variability in δ238U values. Here we present a temporally and geographically expansive uranium isotope record from paleosols and modern soils to better constrain atmospheric oxygen levels during the Precambrian. Preliminary U isotope measurements of paleosols are unfractionated (relative to igneous rocks), possibly because of limited fractionation during oxidation (e.g., {Wang, 2015 #478}) or insufficient atmospheric oxygen levels to oxidize U(IV)-bearing minerals in the bedrock. Further U isotope measurements of paleosols with comparison to modern soils will resolve this issue.",

            "abstract": "Aqueous Fe(II) is known to catalyze the abiotic transformation of ferrihydrite to more stable Fe minerals. While ferrihydrite within most natural environments contains high contents of adsorbed or coprecipitated organic matter (OM), little is known regarding the impact of OM on Fe(II)-catalyzed transformation of ferrihydrite and its consequences for C and metal(oid) dynamics. In this study, we investigated the impacts of adsorbed and coprecipitated OM on the extent and the secondary mineral profiles of Fe(II)-induced ferrihydrite transformation and subsequent C dynamics and As(III) oxidation. The effects of OM types (dissolved organic matter (DOM) vs. polysaccharides) were also compared. Regardless of OM types, both adsorbed and coprecipitated OM resulted in a linear decrease in ferrihydrite transformation with increasing C/Fe ratios. At similar C/Fe ratios, a greater degree of ferrihydrite transformation was observed for the presence of EPS than DOM. Regardless of OM types, the difference in the Fe(II)-catalyzed ferrihydrite was small between adsorbed and coprecipitated OM. DOM impeded goethite and magnetite formation and stimulated lepidocrocite formation, whereas EPS did not alter the secondary Fe minerals formed from transformation of ferrihydrite and goethite was the major secondary Fe minerals in the presence of EPS. Adsorption of As(III) impeded goethite formation and increased the formation of lepidocrcote. The solid-phase C content remained unchanged after reaction, suggesting that OM remains associated with Fe minerals following ferrihydrite transformation to more stable Fe minerals. However, C desorbability by H2PO4- from the resulting Fe minerals following reaction was enhanced implying that Fe(II)-catalyzed transformation of ferrihydrite may decrease the stability of OM in natural environments under moderately reducing conditions. In addition, regardless of DOM or EPS, the presence of OM decreased the degree of As(III) oxidation following Fe(II)-catalyzed transformation of ferrihydrite .",

To date, there have been no definitive detections of exoplanets in the radio regime. We present the framework for, and initial results from, a blind radio survey of the nearest star systems for exoplanetary radio emission. The goal of this survey is to obtain meaningful upper limits on radio emission from (or modulated by) substellar companions of the nearest stars. The very closest stars were chosen to minimize the dilution of potential radio signals by distance. The target selection criteria for this survey are restricted to distance, observability for LOFAR and the VLA, and data quality metrics only. Stellar properties are not considered because preconceptions about the types of systems most likely to exhibit radio emission have not been observationally confirmed and may be incorrect.\nTwo survey targets, GJ 411 and GJ 725A/B, have been observed with the LOFAR telescope LBA (30-75 MHz) system. A series of 4 2-hour integrations and 1 3-hour integration were made for each target of a period of approximately 2 weeks. Additional observations are planned with LOFAR as well as the VLA. Preliminary results from the LOFAR observations of GJ 411 are presented.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU2015-Chadima-Chadimova.pdf\nIn some geological and environmental processes, such as diagenesis, very low grade metamorphism, pedogenesis, anthropogenic pollution, new ultra-fine magnetic minerals may be formed. The variation in content of these minerals has been routinely investigated by frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility. Although being quite reliable for most rocks, frequency-dependent susceptibility reaches its limit when applied to very weakly magnetic rock types, e.g. carbonates. Assuming a broad size distribution of the ultra-fine magnetic particles spanning across the SP/SSD boundary we suggest assessing their content by quantification of time-decay of viscous remanent magnetization. Using artificially-imparted magnetization we usually obtain much stronger signal compared to that of magnetic susceptibility. For that purpose we employed a LDA5/PAM1 Pulse Magnetizer coupled with a JR6 Spinner Magnetometer (both manufactured by Agico, Inc.). Both instruments are simultaneously controlled thus they work in the same time frame. Magnetic remanence is measured repeatedly as a function of time and exponential decay curves are fitted on the acquired data and the relative ratio of viscous and non-viscous particles is estimated. The proposed method is tested on two sets of samples representing biostratigraphically well-established sections across Silurian shallow-water limestone facies in the Prague Synform (Czech Republic). Sampling interval comprises so-called Lau Event which belongs to one of the major environmental and biological perturbances in the Phanerozoic Ocean. This level is also associated with very strong geochemical changes, so-called global Middle Ludfordian Carbon Isotope Excursion, recognized in numerous areas worldwide. Other geophysical methods applied include high-resolution magnetic susceptibility measurements and gamma-ray spectrometry, supplemented by rock magnetic measurements (ARM/IRM) and frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility.",

            "abstract": "The South Central Andes at 30°S represent a key area to understand the Andes geodynamics as it corresponds to the flat slab segment, characterized by a subhorizontal subduction angle, absence of Neogene magmatism and a highly compressive tectonic regime. Under these settings, crustal shortening is believed to be the principal mechanism responsible for the rise of the Andes. However, the sequence of uplift of the different morphoestructural units composing the orogen is not fully understood; neither do the location and time of activity of intracrustal detachments and their connection with shallower structures. We attempt to develop a multidisciplinary analysis that allow us to characterize the timing, magnitude and activity of the principal structures involved in the construction of the Andes at 30°S trough the Coastal Range, the Frontal Cordillera and the Precordillera.\nThe main phase of deformation in the Coastal Range occurred between 60 and 40Ma, based on published thermochronological and structural data. Our structural analyses constrain the Frontal Cordillera uplift between 18 and 13Ma. In the Precordillera area, in turn, we carried out structural, sedimentological and U-Pb provenience studies. Provenience studies and the 12 and 9Ma ages obtained for the youngest zircons indicated that the main thrusts uplifting the western sector of the Precordillera thrust system were activated since 13Ma at this latitude, and not before that time as it was previously suggested.\nIn order to better constrain the exhumation and thermal history of Frontal Cordillera, a thermochronological study is being conducted. Twenty samples for apatite fission tracks (AFT) and apatite (U-Th)/He (AHe) were collected from two vertical profiles located at western sector (Guanta granitoid) and eastern sector (Colanguil granitoid) of the Frontal Cordillera system. Samples are currently being processed, and they are partially reseted, which will allow us to obtain a cooling age. The aim is to combine this new thermochronologic data with field observations of the geological structures and kinematic analysis of the principal features, and develop an exhumation/uplift model for the Frontal Cordillera at 30°S, which will improve our understanding of the structural evolution of this area.",

            "abstract": "Good instructors know that lessons and courses change over time. Limitations in time and data often prevent instructors from making changes that will most benefit their students. For example, in traditional in-person classrooms an instructor may only have access to the final product of a student's thought processes (such as a term paper, homework assignment, or exam). The thought processes that lead to a given answer are opaque to the instructor, making future modifications to course content an exercise in trial-and-error and instinct. Modern online intelligent tutoring systems can provide insight into a student's behavior, providing transparency to a previously opaque process and providing the instructor with better information for course modification.\nHabitable Worlds is an introductory level online-only astrobiology lab course that has been offered at Arizona State University since Fall 2011. The course is built and offered through an intelligent tutoring system, Smart Sparrow's Adaptive eLearning Platform, which provides in-depth analytics that allow the instructor to investigate detailed student behavior, from time spent on question to number of attempts to patterns of answers.\nWe will detail the process we employ of informed modification of course content, including time and trial comparisons between semesters, analysis of submitted answers, analysis of alternative learning pathways taken, and A/B testing.",

            "abstract": "Rock-slope failures during the 2010/11 Canterbury (Christchurch), New Zealand Earthquake Sequence resulted in 5 fatalities and caused an estimated US$400 million of damage to buildings and infrastructure. Reducing losses from rock-slope failures requires consideration of both hazard (i.e. likelihood of occurrence) and risk (i.e. likelihood of losses given an occurrence). Risk assessment thus requires information on the vulnerability of structures to rock or boulder impacts. Here we present 32 case histories of structures impacted by boulders triggered during the 2010/11 Canterbury earthquake sequence, in the Port Hills region of Christchurch, New Zealand. The consequences of rock fall impacts on structures, taken as penetration distance into structures, are shown to follow a power-law distribution with impact energy. Detailed mapping of rock fall sources and paths from field mapping, aerial lidar digital elevation model (DEM) data, and high-resolution aerial imagery produced 32 well-constrained runout paths of boulders that impacted structures. Impact velocities used for structural analysis were developed using lumped mass 2-D rock fall runout models using 1-m resolution lidar elevation data. Model inputs were based on calibrated surface parameters from mapped runout paths of 198 additional boulder runouts. Terrestrial lidar scans and structure from motion (SfM) imagery generated 3-D point cloud data used to measure structural damage and impacting boulders. Combining velocity distributions from 2-D analysis and high-precision boulder dimensions, kinetic energy distributions were calculated for all impacts. Calculated impact energy versus penetration distance for all cases suggests a power-law relationship between damage and impact energy. These case histories and resulting fragility curve should serve as a foundation for future risk analysis of rock fall hazards by linking vulnerability data to the predicted energy distributions from the hazard analysis.",

            "abstract": "It is hypothesized that the pressure changes caused by sea level variations during glacial cycles can influence long-term rates of magmatism in ocean basins. This proposed coupling between oceanic magmatism and climate has important implications for temporal trends in rates of mid-ocean ridge (MOR) volcanism, the structure of the oceanic crust and the composition of oceanic magmas, including the flux of volatile elements from the mantle. Testing the extent to which climate cycles may or may not modulate the compositions of oceanic magmas is difficult, as it requires compositional records that stretch over timescales comparable to those of glacial cycles (i.e. 10s of kyrs), which do not currently exist. In this study we use fragments of volcanic glass found in sediment cores to construct compositional time-series for lavas erupted at the Juan de Fuca ridge, NW Pacific. These provide continuous records of magmatism over several 10s kyrs, with a temporal resolution of a few kyrs. The longest record in our current dataset spans ~80 kyrs and records two significant step-wise changes in the average compositions of the erupted magmas, linked to both variations in the extent of crustal fractionation (i.e. MgO) and also the composition of primary mantle melts (i.e. K2O/TiO2). These changes occur rapidly and are decoupled in time, with the MgO shift happening around ~20 kyrs before the change in K2O/TiO2.  Compositional variations such as these, and the temporal offset between them, are generally consistent with models of the effect of sea-level variation on magma chemistry, which can modulate the melt flux to the ridge and the extent of mantle melting. To place our results in a chronological and climatic context we will compare our data to oxygen-isotope records collected from the same sediment horizons and chemical analysis of the host sediments. Our study demonstrates the potential of this method for investigating the magmatic behaviour of ridges over long timescales.",

A core platform for BIFoR to study the ten-year response of a mature temperate deciduous forest ecosystem to against a large step-change in atmospheric [CO2] is the BIFoR Free-Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment (FACE) experiment.\nBIFoR FACE is being established in Mill Haft, a mature (~150 year-old) oak (Quercus robur) and hazel (Corylus avellana) coppice-with-standards woodland in central England. The facility will enable elevated CO2 (eCO2) treatments to be introduced in 30 m diameter rings (3 treatment and 6 control plots), commencing in spring 2016. Under eCO2 conditions primary research questions will investigate carbon uptake and storage, corresponding nutrient limitations, and biodiversity and ecosystem responses.\nAs well as describing the facility and experimental design, we present baseline data collected throughout 2015, prior to fumigation. These data include: biophysical tree properties; atmospheric CO2/H2O fluxes; airborne and ground laser scatterometry; leaf area index; geophysical survey data; phenology camera derivatives; soil and water chemical and physical properties; and invertebrate surveys.\nData from an intensive campaign conducted during august 2015 are also shown, including in- and above- canopy characterisation of biogenic VOCs using a Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometer, aerosol loading including bioaerosols, and enhanced atmospheric chemistry. Further campaign results are presented from leaf level photosynthetic carbon-dioxide response curve (A/Ci) performed at different canopy heights on oak trees, and on the dominant understory species – hazel and sycamore (Acer pseudoplatinus) across the site.\nBIFoR FACE is an exciting new international facility for forest science - ideas for collaborations are encouraged.

Due to depleting surface water and untimely distribution of precipitation, the demand to use groundwater has increased considerably. Further recent studies have shown that the groundwater stress is more in developing countries like India. This study focuses on understanding the impacts of three major factors (i.e., rainfall, land-cover and population growth) effecting the groundwater levels. For this purpose, the correlation between the trends in groundwater time series is compared with trends in rainfall, land-cover and population growth. To detect the trends in time series, two statistical methods namely, least square method and Mann-Kendall method, are adopted. The results were analyzed based on the measurements from 1800 observation wells in the Karnataka state, India. The data is obtained for a total of 9 year time period ranging from 2005 to 2013. A gridded precipitation data of 0.5o× 0.5o over the entire region is used. The change in land-cover and population data was approximately obtained from the local governing bodies. The early results show significant correlation between rainfall and groundwater time series trends. The outcomes will assess the vulnerability of groundwater levels under changing physical and hydroclimatic conditions, especially under climate change.",

            "abstract": "Charred plant residues are more resistant to decomposition in soil than fresh biomass, rendering biochar a promising technology for increasing soil C content and mitigating climate change. Due to its persistence in soils and its surface properties, biochar is also considered as a tool for managing soil fertility in the long term. Biochar properties change with degree of carbonization and the feedstock material it is produced from. With large differences existing among biochar products, characterizing these materials is the first step in devising a biochar technology plan. We therefore measured various chemical and structural properties of a series of biochars prepared from corncob and miscanthus grass at 250 to 800 ˚C pyrolysis temperatures. We also measured the persistence of biochar in soil and devised an incubation method that eliminates likely errors in measuring natural abundance 13C isotopes. In our search for reliable estimators of biochar properties, we focused on the identification of structural properties responsible for the unique inherent stability of biochar, including the presence of molecular markers of benzene polycarboxylic acids (BPCAs) and aromaticity from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).\nWe found that the increased residence time of biochars, which were on average 60 times that of fresh plant residues, is mostly developed at pyrolysis temperatures up to 370 ˚C and does not appear to significantly increase with pyrolysis beyond this temperature threshold. Aromatic structural components were formed to a much greater extent above 370 ˚C, which can explain resistance to decomposition in soil. The fraction of C that is BPCA C correlated well with estimated biochar half-lives. However, aromatic condensation degree developed above 500 ˚C, and biochars produced at the highest production temperatures having the highest aromatic condensation degree were not found to be the most stable forms of biochar. This is an indication that the formation of aromatic structures and not necessarily their condensation into larger sheets determines the persistence of biochar in soil. This work helps our understanding of the origin of biochar stability and provides an aid for the development of a useful indicator for biochar stability.",

            "abstract": "The status of the world’s 19 subpopulations of polar bears (Ursus maritimus) varies as a function of sea-ice conditions, ecology, management, and other factors. Previous methods to project the response of polar bears to loss of Arctic sea ice—the primary threat to the species—include expert opinion surveys, Bayesian Networks providing qualitative stressor assessments, and subpopulations-specific demographic analyses. Here, we evaluated the global conservation status of polar bears using a data-based sensitivity analysis. First, we estimated generation length for subpopulations with available data (n=11). Second, we developed standardized sea-ice metrics representing habitat availability. Third, we projected global population size under alternative assumptions for relationships between sea ice and subpopulation abundance. Estimated generation length (median = 11.4 years; 95%CI = 9.8 to 13.6) and sea-ice change (median = loss of 1.26 ice-covered days per year; 95%CI = 0.70 to 3.37) varied across subpopulations. Assuming a one-to-one proportional relationship between sea ice and abundance, the median percent change in global population size over three polar bear generations was -30% (95%CI = -35% to -25%). Assuming a linear relationship between sea ice and normalized estimates of subpopulation abundance, median percent change was -4% (95% CI = -62% to +50%) or -43% (95% CI = -76% to -20%), depending on how subpopulations were grouped and how inference was extended from relatively well-studied subpopulations (n=7) to those with little or no data. Our findings suggest the potential for large reductions in polar bear numbers over the next three polar bear generations if sea-ice loss due to climate change continues as forecasted.",

            "abstract": "Cloud variability serves as the principal modulator of incoming solar radiation. These cloud effects are particularly important in mountain settings such as the Sierra Nevada in California, because the solar irradiance is a primary input to the snowpack energy balance. An important, unanswered question is whether the mountain clouds over the Sierra Nevada are only one part of a larger-scale system or whether they vary distinctly from cloud patterns upstream over the Central Valley and coastal areas. To address this question we investigate cloud variability over California using 19 years (1996-2014) of GOES visible albedo product with 4-km spatial and 30-minute temporal resolutions. Two domains are considered: high elevations in which only higher (>800m) elevations are included, thus excluding the coast and valley clouds, and all elevations which includes all elevations from the offshore North Pacific to Nevada. Our focus is on the spring and early summer period, which is crucial because it includes much of the snowmelt runoff from the Sierra Nevada. Inter-annual variation of cloudiness, represented by the coefficient of variation of cloud albedo, reveals the highest relative variability from California coasts and lowlands in the winter and spring to highlands and mountains in the summer and autumn. This pattern also occurs across shorter to longer time-scales, with coefficient of variation ranging from 30-180% on daily scale to 5-40% on seasonal scale. Considering the spatial structure of anomalous cloudiness, rotated EOF (REOF) analyses of de-seasonalized daily cloud albedo in the high elevation domain yields patterns and temporal variations that are well correlated with those from the all elevation domain. This indicates that, to a large degree, the mountain clouds co-vary with those over the Central Valley and the California coast, even though the valley and coastal clouds include low stratus clouds. The monthly standard deviations of the amplitudes of the time varying patterns represented by the REOFs reveal strong variability in the winter and spring.",

            "abstract": "Observations of seismicity and seismic tomography provide constraints on the geometry of slabs within mantle, while compression/tension axis derived from moment tensor solutions provide constraints on the internal deformation of slabs. However, since these observations provide only a somewhat blurred or incomplete snapshot of the slab in time, it is difficult to directly relate these observations to the evolution of the slab geometry and the forces acting on and within the slab. In contrast, plate tectonic reconstructions provide time-dependent constraints on the surface motion of plates and the trench at subduction zones, which are related to the dynamical evolution of the slab. We use 2D geodynamical simulations of subduction to explore the relationship between dynamical process within the deforming slab and the observations of surface plate motion and the state-of-stress in slabs. Specifically we utilize models that include the extended Boussinesq approximation (shear heating and latent heat terms in the energy equation), a layered lithosphere with pyrolite, harzburgite and basalt/eclogite, compositionally-dependent phase transitions, and a composite rheology with yielding. The models employ a weak crustal layer that decouples the overriding and subducting plates and allows for dynamically determined trench motion. Here we show that, 1) multiple phase transitions increase slab folding, 2) ridge push significantly increases trench retreat, and 3) strength of the weak crustal layer influences slab detachment. Compared to past studies a more realistic treatment of the phase transitions makes trench retreat more difficult to generate: a weaker plate may encourage slab retreat but detaches once the slab tip crosses into the transition zone due to the rapid increase in slab density. As suggested by previous studies, slab folding within the transition zone changes the direction of forces on the slab and causes periodic changes from trench retreat to trench advance. We also present results comparing the observations of slab seismicity, strain-rate and stress-orientation to time-dependent model predictions. These analyses provide links between the observations and the physical processes active in the deforming slab, and facilitate a more in-depth understanding of the observed variations among slabs.",

In many locations, a basal layer of disturbed ice is observed. At the NEEM, Greenland site this folding occurs at the boundary between the Eemian and glacial ice regimes, indicating that differences in physical properties of the ice play a role in the disturbance. Past work in metallurgy and ice suggests that impurity content controls grain evolution and therefore deformation. We hypothesize that the differences in ice flow seen deep in the NEEM ice core are controlled by differences in the impurity content of the ice layers.

On average it requires about 2-4 million gallons of freshwater to complete one oil well in the Bakken field and the number of oil well completions (i.e., hydraulic fracturing) in the Bakken field increased from 500 in 2008 to 2085 in 2013. A large quantity of freshwater used for hydraulic fracturing renders a significant impact on water resource management in the semi-arid region. A novel water allocation system – water depots – was spontaneously created to distribute surface and ground water for industrial uses. A GIS-based multi-agent model is developed to simulate the emergent patterns and dynamics of the water depot-based water allocation system and to explore its economic and environmental consequences. Four different types of water depot are defined as agents and water price, climate condition, water source, geology, and other physical and economic constraints are considered in the model. Decentralized optimization algorithm will be used to determine the agents’ behaviors. The agent-based model for water depots will be coupled with hydrological models to improve the region’s water resources management.",

There is increasing interest in developing paleoenvironmental proxies from mollusk shell organic components. Numerous studies have focused on how the δ15N obtained from bivalve tissues can be used to trace present-day wastewater input into estuaries. However, comparatively little attention has been paid to tracing the impact of anthropogenic nitrogen loading into estuaries over time. By measuring historic levels of δ15N in the organic fraction of oyster shells (Crassostrea virginica) from archaeological sites around Charleston Harbor and comparing those levels to the δ15N content of modern shells, it is possible to assess how nitrogen has fluctuated historically in the area. Whole-shell samples from the Late Archaic Period (~3000-4000 BP, Late Woodland Period (~1400-800 BP), 18th and 19th centuries, and modern controls were measured for %N and d15N. Evidence of increased anthropogenic input of N is expected to begin in the early historic period based on similar analysis in Chesapeake Bay. More ancient samples may give insight into baseline conditions prior to recent population growth and industrialization. This information could help understand how large-scale anthropogenic nitrogen loading has affected coastal ecosystems over time and guide future remediation. Furthermore, this project will help refine and improve this novel proxy of past environmental conditions.",

The Diversity and Innovation in Geosciences (DIG) Texas Blueprints project addresses this need for quality, aligned curricula with educator-vetted, freely available resources carefully selected and compiled into three week thematic units that have been aligned with the Earth Science Literacy Principles and the NGSS. These units can then be packaged into customized blueprints for a year-long Earth & Space Science course that engages students in the relevant disciplinary core ideas, crosscutting concepts and science and engineering practices.\nAs part of supporting NGSS-congruent instruction, each unit has extensive scaffolding notes for the learning activities selected for that unit. Designed with both the new and veteran teacher in mind, these scaffolding notes yield information regarding advanced teacher preparation, student prerequisite skills, and potential challenges that might arise during classroom implementation. Feedback from Texas high school teachers implementing the DIG Texas Blueprints in the classroom, in addition to that of university secondary education majors in a preparation course utilizing the blueprints, instigated the most recent revisions to these scaffolding notes. The DIG Texas Blueprints Educator Intern Team charged with these revisions then determined which learning activities became candidates for either inclusion in the refined units, retention as an additional resource, or elimination from the blueprints.\nThis presentation will focus on the development of these scaffolding notes and their role in supporting congruence with the NGSS. A review of the second year of implementation of the blueprints and the feedback that generated the final revisions will be shared, as well as the current accessibility status of the DIG Texas Blueprints resources",

We also test the relative efficiency of different metrics in predicting shocks, acknowledging that both spatial resolution and temporal frequency are likely to be limiting factors in the objective measures.\nTo support this analysis we draw on surveys from the Living Standards Measurement Study Integrated Surveys on Agriculture (LSMS-ISA) project. The LSMS-ISA surveys are georeferenced, multi-topic panel surveys with a strong focus on agriculture, conducted in 7 African countries. We combine the LSMS-ISA data on production and agricultural shocks with objective measures (rainfall deficit/surplus, phenological variables, water requirements satisfaction index) derived from various data sources (CHIRPS, MODIS Land Cover Dynamics, NDVI3g). Objective measures will be considered in both absolute terms as well as deviation from mean in the survey season.",

The educational model is designed to wrap around the student, including classroom instruction, field science, after-school programs and engagement with the student’s community. Its pillars include: a teacher training fellowship at Pace University, student curriculum, a digital platform, afterschool and summer mentoring, and community exhibits. The digital platform includes a tablet app tailored to the project’s field protocols and linked to a database shared across schools and partnering institutions. Through the digital platform, data is integrated into a single citizen-science monitoring project, teachers share curriculum and best practices, and students link directly to their peers at other schools. Curriculum development has been collaborative between scientists, science education specialists, and secondary school teachers. The CCE-RS is rooted in project-based learning: the New York Harbor School has engaged high school students in environmental monitoring and oyster restoration in the Harbor for about the last decade. The science partners (U. of Maryland and Columbia) have been working with students and other citizen scientists in outdoor science over about the last decade. Local partners in outside-the-classroom education include the New York Academy of Sciences, The River Project, which will provide field education services, and Good Shepherd Services, which provides after-school programming in schools serving primarily poor families. Scientists on the project engage directly with teachers and informal educators in curriculum development and citizen-science outreach. We present the lessons learned from our first cohort of Fellows, the pedagogical model, and the digital platform, which is extensible to other ecological restoration settings.",

            "abstract": "In-situ measurement systems are used to monitor the atmosphere whereby instruments are located in the area of interest and are in direct contact with what is being measured. Dropsondes and radiosondes are instruments used to collect high-vertical-resolution profiles of the atmosphere. The dropsondes are deployed from aircraft and, as they descend, they collect pressure, temperature and humidity data at a half-second rate, and GPS wind data at a quarter-second rate. Radiosondes are used to collect high-resolution measurements of the atmosphere, from the ground to approximately 30 kilometers. Carried by a large helium-filled balloon, they ascend upward through the atmosphere measuring pressure, temperature, relative humidity, and GPS winds at a one-second rate.\nAdvancements in atmospheric research, technology and data assimilation techniques have contributed to driving the need for higher quality, higher resolution radiosonde and dropsonde data at an increasingly rapid rate. These data most notably represent a valuable resource for initializing numerical prediction models, calibrating and validating satellite retrieval techniques for atmospheric profiles, and for climatological research. The In-Situ Sensing Facility, at NCAR, has developed an extensive, multi-step process of quality control (QC). Traditionally, QC has been a time intensive process that involves evaluating data products using a variety of visualization tools and statistical methods. With a greater need for real-time data in the field and a reduced turn-around time for final quality controlled data, new and improved procedures for streamlining statistical analysis and QC are being implemented.\nImprovements have also been made on two fronts regarding implementation of a comprehensive data management plan. The first was ensuring ease of data accessibility through an intuitive centralized data archive system, that both keeps a record of data users and assigns digital object identifiers to each unique data set. The second improvement was to define appropriate criteria needed for documentation and metadata so that data users have all of the relevant information needed to properly use and understand the complexities of these measurements.",

            "abstract": "Physics-based numerical coma models are desirable whether to interpret the spacecraft observations of the inner coma or to compare with the ground-based observations of the outer coma. One example is Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, which has been successfully adopted to simulate the coma under various complex conditions. However, for bright comets with large production rates, the time step in DSMC model has to be tiny to accommodate the small mean free path and the high collision frequency. In addition a truly time-variable 3D DSMC model would still be computationally difficult or even impossible under most circumstances. In this work, we develop a multi-neutral-fluid model based on BATS-R-US in the University of Michigan's SWMF (Space Weather Modeling Framework), which can serve as a useful alternative to DSMC methods to compute both the inner and the outer coma and to treat time-variable phenomena. This model treats H2O, OH, H2, O, H and CO2 as separate fluids and each fluid has its own velocity and temperature. But collisional interactions can also couple all fluids together. Collisional interactions tend to decrease the velocity differences and are also able to re-distribute the excess energy deposited by chemical reactions among all species. To compute the momentum and energy transfer caused by such interactions self-consistently, collisions between fluids, whose efficiency is proportional to the densities, are included as well as heating from various chemical reactions. By applying the model to comets with different production rates (i.e. 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, 1P/Halley, etc.), we are able to study how the heating efficiency varies with cometocentric distances and production rates. The preliminary results and comparison are presented and discussed.

Accurate hydraulic conductivity values are essential for understanding the flow of water, and are a key component in understanding and modeling the effects of sea level rise on salt water intrusion in coastal aquifers. Large discrepancies exist among reported values of hydraulic conductivity based on different test methods for the Biscayne Aquifer, and attest to a need for reevaluation of test methods when applied to highly permeable systems. To determine the validity of slug tests that display underdamped oscillations in highly permeable aquifers, development of two models for cases with oscillating responses are considered and applied to actual well tests, and to an end-member (aquifer-free) laboratory case. Preliminary results of the models show that the proposed Poiseuille-equation-based models agree well with data from one real slug test and from an end-member laboratory test. However the Darcy-Weisbach-based model does not agree as well in both the well tests and end-member case, necessitating further examination of the parameters, the force balance equations that define the models, and the experimental design. The resulting models should demonstrate if the behavior of some slug tests in highly permeable material can be predicted by a damped spring mass model, and thus help to determine when the estimation of true hydraulic conductivity values in highly permeable aquifers is possible with slug tests.",

How physical terrain and forest cover separately and interactively influence spatial patterns of snow accumulation and ablation largely shapes the hydrologic response to land cover disturbances. Analysis of water isotopes in snowpack provides a powerful tool for examining integrated effects of water vapor exchange, selective redistribution, and melt. Snow water equivalence (SWE), δ2H, δ18O and deuterium excess (D-excess) of snowpack were examined throughout winter 2013-2014 across two headwater catchments impacted by bark beetle induced tree mortality. A USGS 10m DEM and a derived land cover product from 1m NAIP imagery were used to examine the effects of terrain features (e.g., elevation, slope, aspect) and canopy disturbance (e.g., live, bark-beetle killed) as predictors of D-excess, an expression of kinetic isotope effects, in snowpack. A weighting of Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) values from multiple spatially lagged regression models describing D-excess variation for peak snowpack revealed strong effects of elevation and canopy mortality, and weaker, but significant effects of aspect and slope. Snowpack D-excess was lower in beetle-killed canopy patches compared to live green canopy patches, and at lower compared to high elevation locations, suggesting that integrated isotopic effects of vapor exchange, vertical advection of melted snow, and selective accumulation and redistribution varied systematically across the two catchments. The observed patterns illustrate the potential for using D-excess to identify origins and timing of snowmelt runoff in streams and assessing the relative magnitude of different accumulation and ablation processes in snowpack evolution.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Scholl NEON Poster.pdf\nSpatial and temporal monitoring of vegetation structure is important to the ecological community. Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems are used to efficiently survey large forested areas. From LiDAR data, three-dimensional models of forests called canopy height models (CHMs) are generated and used to estimate tree height. A common problem associated with CHMs is data pits, where LiDAR pulses penetrate the top of the canopy, leading to an underestimation of vegetation height. The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) currently implements an algorithm to reduce data pit frequency, which requires two height threshold parameters, increment size and range ceiling. CHMs are produced at a series of height increments up to a height range ceiling and combined to produce a CHM with reduced pits (referred to as a “pit-free” CHM). The current implementation uses static values for the height increment and ceiling (5 and 15 meters, respectively). To facilitate the generation of accurate pit-free CHMs across diverse NEON sites with varying vegetation structure, the impacts of adjusting the height threshold parameters were investigated through development of an algorithm which dynamically selects the height increment and ceiling. A series of pit-free CHMs were generated using three height range ceilings and four height increment values for three ecologically different sites. Height threshold parameters were found to change CHM-derived tree heights up to 36% compared to original CHMs. The extent of the parameters’ influence on modelled tree heights was greater than expected, which will be considered during future CHM data product development at NEON.\n(A) Aerial image of Harvard National Forest, (B) standard CHM containing pits, appearing as black speckles, (C) a pit-free CHM created with the static algorithm implementation, and (D) a pit-free CHM created through varying the height threshold ceiling up to 82 m and the increment to 1 m.",

In addition to increasing salinity, considerable increases of nitrate (NO3), up to ~50 mg/L, have been previously observed in the Rio Grande between Las Cruces, New Mexico and El Paso, Texas. This is particularly a problem during non-irrigation season when little surface water is released from upstream reservoirs, substantially reducing stream flows in the Rio Grande. While both irrigation runoff and municipal waste effluents are likely important NO3 contributors, there are no quantitative studies assessing NO3 fluxes to the Rio Grande from these two sources. Therefore, in this study we used 𝛿15N and 𝛿18O values of NO3 as environmental tracers to characterize major NO3 sources in the Rio Grande and its agricultural drains between Las Cruces and El Paso. Surface water of the semi-arid Rio Grande, drains and major wastewater treatment plants were collected in October 2014 (non-irrigation season) and August 2015 (irrigation season). The water samples from the 2014 sampling campaign showed that the 𝛿15N and 𝛿18O values of NO3 in the Rio Grande and two agricultural drains located south of El Paso varied in relatively narrow range from +9.8 to +15.7‰ and -5.9 to -0.2‰, respectively. These ranges were similar to 𝛿15N and 𝛿18O values of local wastewater treatment plants in Las Cruces and El Paso, from +8.2 to +10.2‰ and -9.7 to -2.5‰ respectively. Municipal wastewater effluents are important tributaries to the semi-arid Rio Grande in the studied area, particularly during non-irrigation season. Furthermore, irrigation of agricultural fields south of El Paso is to a large extent supported by reclaimed municipal wastewater. Consequently, these explain the observed higher contributions of NO3 from urban sources in the investigated area.",

Under the combined threats of multiyear drought and excess drawdown, this region's aquifers face numerous sustainability challenges, including seawater intrusion, chronic overdraft, increased contamination, and subsidence. This study addresses the supply side of this resource issue by increasing our knowledge of the spatial and temporal dynamics of runoff that could provide water for MAR.\nEnsuring the effectiveness of MAR using stormwater requires a thorough understanding of runoff distribution and site-specific surface and subsurface aquifer conditions. In this study we use a geographic information system (GIS) and a 3-m digital elevation model (DEM) to divide the region's four primary watersheds into Hydrologic Response Units (HRUs), or topographic sub-basins, that serve as discretized input cells for PRMS. We then assign vegetation, soil, land use, slope, aspect, and other characteristics to these HRUs, from a variety of data sources, and analyze runoff spatially using PRMS under varying precipitation conditions. We are exploring methods of linking spatially continuous and high-temporal-resolution precipitation datasets to generate input precipitation catalogs, facilitating analyses of a variety of regimes. To gain an understanding of how surface hydrology has responded to land development, we will also modify our input data to represent pre-development conditions. Coupled with a concurrent MAR suitability analysis, our model results will help screen for locations of future MAR projects and will improve our understanding of how changes in land use and climate impact hydrologic runoff and aquifer recharge.",

            "abstract": "One of the main obstacles to a fully enabled web GIS platform is the access to raster data. This is because the rasters used in GIS tend to be much larger than the common image rasters. Compressed raster formats that support tiling, as well as web access to tiled data are common technologies that address these issues. The NASA originated open source OnEarth tile server and the Meta Raster Format (MRF) are steps in the right direction, a basis for both local and web based rasters. Esri has taken this technology even further, making MRF a low level raster caching format and adding a very fast data compression mechanism called Limited Error Raster Compression (LERC). The on-demand Landsat 8 and NAIP mosaic services have served as real world implementation prototypes and have shown the value of this approach to the GIS community. While continuously in service for more than two years, the Landsat 8 service has been re-implemented multiple times, adapting to the changing cloudscape. The initial architecture converted every incoming scene from GeoTiff to MRF with LERC, reducing the average response time from about eight seconds to less than two. Recently, it was re-implemented to use the Landsat on Amazon Web Services (AWS), and to use MRF with LERC as a local dynamic cache. Recently, a python application called OptimizeRasters has been developed, which can convert and copy the data to and from cloud storage, while at the same time applying these technologies.",

            "abstract": "Aftershocks from the El Mayor-Cucapah (EMC), MW7.2, April 4, 2010, Baja California, Mexico, earthquake, were recorded over two months by a 31 station local array (Reftek RT130 seismographs loaned from IRIS-PASSCAL), complemented by regional data from SCSN, and CICESE. The resulting data base includes 518 aftershocks with ML ≥ 3.0, plus 181 smaller events. Reliable hypocenters were determined using HYPODD and a velocity structure determined from refraction data for a mesa located to the west of the Mexicali-Imperial Valley.\nAftershock hypocenters show that the El Mayor-Cucapah earthquake was a multiple event comprising two or three different ruptures of which the last one constituted the main event. The main event rupture, which extends in a roughly N45°W direction, is complex with well-defined segments having different characteristics. The main event central segment, located close to the first event epicenter is roughly vertical, the northwest segment dips ~68°NE, while the two southeast segments dip ~60°SW and ~52°SW, respectively, which agrees with results of previous studies based on teleseismic long periods and on GPS-INSAR.\nAll main rupture aftershock hypocenters have depths above 10-11km and, except for the central segment, they delineate the edges of zones with largest coseismic displacement. The two southern segments show seismicity concentrated below 5km and 3.5km, respectively; the paucity of shallow seismicity may be caused by the thick layer of non-consolidated sediments in this region. The ruptures delineated by aftershocks in the southern regions correspond to the Indiviso fault, unidentified until the occurrence of the EMC earthquake.\nThe first event was relocated together with the aftershocks; the epicenter lies slightly westwards of published locations, but it definitely does not lie on, or close to, the main rupture. The focal mechanism of the first event, based on first arrival polarities, is predominantly strike-slip; the focal plane coinciding with neighboring aftershocks has N13°E and left-lateral slip. From the above, we conclude that the EMC earthquake consisted of a first event that triggered the main right-lateral strike-slip rupture and probably another rupture indicated by a NS trending aftershock alignment.",

            "abstract": "Flood is a highly complex natural hazard that accounts for major losses to human societies worldwide. Dams built with the aim of mitigating the flood risk significantly modify river flow regimes but unavailability and/or inaccessibility of proper information about reservoir operational rules impose a big hurdle to global flood modeling. This is specifically critical for flood-prone regions where lack of proper representation of reservoir operation can lead to significant under- or overestimation of the flood magnitude, risk, and losses. With the availability of longer in-situ observational data records, as well as advancements in satellite altimetry techniques for measuring reservoir levels, operational rules can be indirectly deduced. In this study, the observed reservoir levels as well as the historical and forecast time series of inflows are incorporated into a stochastic autoregressive moving average statistical modeling scheme to simulate the releases from the dam at each time step. The resulting operational rule curve is used in a reservoir simulation model to simulate the outflows from the reservoirs. The efficiency of the model is examined for three case studies in the United States, including John Martin Reservoir (CO), Coralville Lake (IA, and specifically for the devastating 2008 flood in the state), and Boca Reservoir (CA). Statistical measures are derived and tested to evaluate the accuracy of the simulated hydrographs against USGS streamflow gauge observations. The results prove the capability of the developed model in simulating reasonably accurate outflows from dams and will be presented at the meeting.",

Fifteen years into this century flows of the Colorado are already declining due mostly to unprecedented temperatures, and as warming proceeds, declines in river flow will grow larger. Temperature-driven droughts, some lasting decades and much more severe than the current 15-year drought, will also become more commonplace if climate change continues unabated. Current projections of future water availability almost universally understate the risk of large Colorado flow reductions under business-as-usual warming. Betting on highly uncertain projections of increased precipitation to overcome even part of the flow reductions due to virtually certain warming is a poor risk management strategy. Many of the existing water policy arrangements in the Colorado River Basin will fail in the 21st century unless innovative new solutions are developed under leadership from the federal government and its basin state partners.",

            "abstract": "Chemical dispersants can be a useful tool to mitigate oil spills, but the potential risks to sensitive estuarine species should be carefully considered. To improve the decision making process, more information is needed regarding the effects of oil spill dispersants on the health of coastal ecosystems under variable environmental conditions such as salinity. The two oil dispersants used in this study were Corexit ® 9500 and Finasol ® OSR 52. Corexit ® 9500 was the primary dispersant used during the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill event, while Finasol® OSR 52 is another dispersant approved for oil spill response in the U.S., yet considerably less is known regarding its toxicity to estuarine species. The grass shrimp, Palaemonetes pugio, was used as a model estuarine species. It is a euryhaline species that tolerates salinities from brackish to full strength seawater. Adult and larval life stages were tested with each dispersant at three salinities, 5ppt, 20ppt, and 30ppt. Median acute lethal toxicity thresholds were calculated. Lipid peroxidation assays were conducted on surviving shrimp to investigate sublethal effects. The toxicity of both dispersants was significantly influenced by salinity, with greatest toxicity observed at the lowest salinity tested. Larval shrimp were significantly more sensitive than adult shrimp to both dispersants, and both life stages were significantly more sensitive to Finasol than to Corexit. Furthermore, significant sublethal effects were seen at higher concentrations of both dispersants compared to the control. These data will enable environmental managers to make informed decisions regarding dispersant use in future oil spills.",

The RBSP-ECT science investigation (http://rbsp-ect.sr.unh.edu) measures comprehensively the near-Earth charged particle environment in order to understand the processes that control the acceleration, global distribution, and variability of radiation belt electrons and ions. RBSP-ECT data products derive from the three instrument elements that comprise the suite, which collectively covers the broad energies that define the source and seed populations, the core radiation belts, and also their highest energy ultra-relativistic extensions. These RBSP-ECT instruments include, from lowest to highest energies: the Helium, Oxygen, Proton, and Electron (HOPE) sensor, the Magnetic Electron and Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS), and the Relativistic Electron and Proton Telescope (REPT). We provide a brief overview of their principles of operation, as well as a description of the Level 2-3 data products that the HOPE, MagEIS, and REPT instruments produce, both separately and together. We provide a summary of how to access these RBSP-ECT data products at our Science Operation Center and Science Data Center (http://www.rbsp-ect.lanl.gov/rbsp_ect.php ) as well as caveats for their use. Finally, in the spirit of efficiently and effectively promoting and encouraging new collaborations, we present a summary of past publications, current studies, and opportunities for your future participation in RBSP-ECT extended mission phase science.",

These cabled observatories provide power and high bandwidth internet connectivity to the seafloor, enabling continuous and high resolution real-time data acquisition. This combination serves several important purposes for seismology, geodesy and tectonics: seismograph data from the top of the subduction zone are available in real time to significantly improve the localization in particular of small to intermediate subduction zone earthquakes, typically the precursors of large megathrust events, whose detection was traditionally limited by the sensitivity of land seismographs. In addition, bottom pressure recorders are detecting tsunamis in real-time which helps live updating of tsunami models before far field tsunamis fall on land. Finally, long-term seafloor geodesy experiments can be installed without the need to recover or replace them with fresh batteries but instead bury them deeply such as in boreholes. Most cabled installations on both the Canadian and US observatories are completed and have been streaming live data to shore, readily available to monitoring agencies and researchers (seismometer data is available from\nIRIS\n, the Incorporated Research Institute for Seismology).",

Using 184 lines of two-dimensional seismic data including high resolution records from Oregon State University and deep penetration data from Western Geco archived in USGS/NAMSS, we were able to map the configuration of the Miocene basin along the flanks of the northern core complex on the Santa Cruz-Catalina Ridge. There are distinct early and middle Miocene basins along the flanks of the ridge, which we are using to try to define the initial configuration of the Inner Borderland Rift. Along the hinge, between the uplifted ridge and the sub-horizontal basement in the Santa Monica Basin, lies the thickest part of the sequence. Pliocene to Recent sediments lap on to the tilted and uplifted Miocene basin sequences and constrain timing of uplift when transpression commenced. Segmentation and other distinctive character of the basin along the ridge flank may be correlated with similar features in the Miocene basin on the conjugate margin of the rift. Our working model for oblique rifting in the Borderland resembles of the Gulf of California, where right-stepping echelon transform faults link left-stepping extensional basins. The objective of our project is to reconstruct the configuration of the middle Miocene rift and to further our quest to understand the rifting process and tectonic evolution of the Pacific-North American plate boundary.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU poster2015R2d.pdf\nElectrofracturing is a water-free stimulation method that might be applicable to hydrocarbon reservoirs. This method of dynamic fragmentation uses high-voltage pulses applied to rock via a pair of electrodes. Fragmentation occurs through two general processes (Cho et al, 2006): 1) electrohydraulic shock and 2) internal breakdown inside bulk solid dielectrics. In the first process, electrical current passing through brackish or salty water found naturally in the formation generates a shock wave of sufficient magnitude to crush/fail the rock as the wave travels through it. In the second process, the electric current flows through the rock preferentially along mineral interfaces; tensile and branching cracks are induced at the boundary interfaces either by heating and differential expansion, or by a shock wave induced by the electrical impulse itself. Both processes have been examined experimentally on rocks and on concrete starting in the late 1980’s.\nIn light of the “shale revolution” that has reinvigorated the North American petroleum resource base over the last decade, we developed a laboratory based experimental system to study coupled deformation and gas flow during high-voltage pulse application at elevated confining pressure (to 70 MPa). We deformed twelve samples using 6.5 μs full width at half maximum exponential voltage pulses from 80 to 200 kV. Exponential decay loading was shown to fracture shale at pressure, producing a 5-8 order-of-magnitude increase in permeability (initiating in the nD range) with significant fracturing.\nFractures were documented using CT and SEM. The preponderance of fractures are parallel to bedding with fractures often extending from end to end in the samples, which were up to 9 cm in length. The bedding-parallel fractures are adjacent to, or off centered to, the input pulse location. Fractures oblique to bedding planes are present as well, but are fewer in number. The test system, and experimental and observational methods and results will be discussed.\nSandia National Laboratories is a multi-program laboratory managed and operated by Sandia Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Lockheed Martin Corporation, for the U.S. Dept. of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-AC04-94AL85000.

            "abstract": "Progress in seismic methods offers the possibility to visualize in ever greater detail the structure and composition of middle to lower continental crust. Ideally, the seismic parameters, including compressional (Vp) and shear (Vs) wave velocities, anisotropy and Vp/Vs-ratio, allow the inference of detailed and quantitative information on the deformation conditions, chemical composition, temperature and the amount and geometry of fluids and melts in the crust. However, such inferences regarding the crust should be calibrated with known mineral and rock physical properties. Seismic properties calculated from the crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO) and laboratory measurements on representative core material allow us to quantify the interpretations from seismic data. The challenge of such calibrations lies in the non-unique interpretation of seismic data. A large catalogue of physical rock properties is therefore useful, with as many constraining geophysical parameters as possible (including anisotropy and Vp/Vs ratio). We present new CPO data and modelled seismic properties for amphibolite and greenschist grade rocks representing the orogenic wedge in the Central Scandinavian Caledonides. Samples were collected from outcrops in the field and from a 2.5 km long drill core, which penetrated an amphibolite-grade allochthonous unit composed of meta-sedimentary and meta-igneous rocks, as well as mica and chlorite-rich mylonites. The textural data was acquired using large area electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) maps, and the chemical composition of minerals obtained by energy dispersive x-ray (EDS). Based on the texture data, we compare and evaluate some of the existing methods to calculate texture-based seismic properties of rocks. The suite of samples consists of weakly anisotropic rocks such as felsic gneiss and calc-silicates, and more anisotropic amphibolite, metagabbro, mica-schist. The newly acquired dataset provides a range of seismic properties that improves compositional and structural characterization of deformed middle and lower crust.",

The Highland Lakes also provide for hydroelectric generation and recreation. Subject to extended droughts interrupted by intense rainfall, the region has the nickname of Flash Flood Alley. Recently the Lower Colorado River has experienced a seven year historic drought. While precipitation have been 80% of average, runoff into the Highland lakes have been at historic lows.\nMultiple regression relationships were developed to predict runoff to the LCRA lakes from rainfall and other factors which explain about 2/3 of the variation of observed inflows. This explanation is good considering the inherent error in stream flow measurement and inflow estimation. It is also comparable to the skill of much more complex dynamical models. Review of the residuals from the relationships reveals periods of unfavorable non-stationarity in inflows after accounting for statistically significant climate and seasonality variables. In particular the periods from 1977 to 1987 as well as 2002 to present showed uncharacteristically low runoff as can be seen in the figure below.\nThrough use of dummy variables for the periods of apparent non-stationarity, the effects of climate and non-stationarity can be quantitatively estimated. At a 90% confidence level, the excess losses in run-off from 2002 to 2015 that can be attributed to lower than median rainfall ranges from 101,000 to 137,000 acre-feet. About another 32,200 to 45,300 acre-feet annually of unrealized inflows can be attributed to typical drought processes. Finally, about another 182,000 to 478,000 acre-feet per year of unrealized inflows can be attributed to unexplained factors in this recent period. These losses are in contrast to runoff during the calendar year of 2011 in which low runoff was better described by extreme climatic conditions.\nWhile the statistical significant variables of the exceptional conditions allows estimation of the impacts of non-stationarity, it does not identify a specific cause. Additional research is needed to understand the drivers of these periods of non-stationarity and the return to typical conditions.",

Some recent studies suggest that the intensity of the ambient hyporheic flow, that present without a salmon egg pocket, is a cue for spawning site selection, but others have argued against it. We tested this hypothesis by using a unique dataset of field surveyed spawning site locations and an unprecedented meter-scale resolution bathymetry of a 13.5 km long reach of Bear Valley Creek (Idaho, USA), an important Chinook salmon spawning stream. We used a two-dimensional surface water model to quantify stream hydraulics and a three-dimensional hyporheic model to quantify the hyporheic flows. Our results show that the intensity of ambient hyporheic flows is not a statistically significant variable for spawning site selection. Conversely, the intensity of the water surface curvature and the habitat quality, quantified as a function of stream hydraulics and morphology, are the most important variables for salmonid spawning site selection.\n<span\" roman\"=\"Roman\"\" new=\"New\">KEY WORDS: Salmonid spawning habitat, pool-riffle system, habitat quality, surface water curvature, hyporheic flow",

We differentiate our analysis in terms of solar wind regimes (i.e. solar wind originating from interstream or coronal hole flows, or coronal mass ejecta). Abundances are normalized to the low-FIP ion magnesium to uncover correlations that are not apparent when normalizing to high-FIP ions.\nWe find that relative to magnesium, the other low-FIP elements are measurably fractionated, but the degree of fractionation does not vary significantly over the solar cycle. For the high-FIP ions, variation in fractionation over the solar cycle is significant: greatest for Ne/Mg and C/Mg, less so for O/Mg, and the least for He/Mg. When abundance ratios are examined as a function of solar wind speed, we find a strong correlation, with the remarkable observation that the degree of fractionation follows a mass-dependent trend. We will discuss the implications for correcting the Genesis sample return results to photospheric abundances.",

            "abstract": "Bedrock river downcutting is usually conceptualized in terms of shear-stress dependent erosion processes, such as abrasion and plucking. Many studies of climatic control on erosion have focused on the effect of rainfall rate on discharge. However, the erodibility of bedrock can also be influenced by climate-dependent chemical weathering. We show that this mechanism can not only influence erosion patterns and rates, but also reach-scale bedrock topography. First, we present a new numerical model that describes and explores the feedbacks among chemical weathering, rock strength and erosion rate. Second, we present reach-scale field data demonstrating interactions among chemical weathering, rock strength, abrasion, and channel morphology. Across an extreme rainfall gradient on Kohala Peninsula, Hawai‘i, we demonstrate that bedrock chemical weathering leads to the development of significant asymmetries in rock strength across features that are exposed to abrasion. Using a type-N Schmidt hammer, we measured the in-situ rock strength across 23 morphologic features of bedrock exposed in the stream beds of rivers, and found that upstream faces are consistently stronger, by an average of 38%, than downstream faces. Measured rock strengths suggest that the erodibilty of downstream (lee) faces may be as much as 20 times higher than corresponding upstream faces where weaker weathered material is efficiently abraded away. The asymmetrical pattern of rock strength does not necessarily lead to strongly asymmetrical morphologies, because although sediment impacts may result in more erosion on the weaker downstream face, the frequency of abrasion wear is substantially less frequent. Although the physical evidence for the chemical weathering is more frequently removed from the upstream face, these results demonstrate that, particularly in regions with higher local rainfall and weathering rates, chemical weathering induced strength reduction is a specific mechanism by which climate influences bedrock river downcutting and also reach-scale morphologies. Further, these results stress the need for careful sampling methods of rock strength, as a lack of consideration for the spatial variabilities due to chemical weathering and erosion could significantly influence the interpretations of data.",

            "abstract": "A few previous studies have found surprisingly strong vertical motions in low levels of some tropical cyclones. In this study, all available dropsondes (~12,000) within tropical cyclones from 1997-2013 are examined, in order to create a dataset of the most extreme updrafts (≥ 10 m/s; 169 sondes) and wind speeds (≥ 90 m/s; 64 sondes). It is shown that extreme low-level (0-3 km) updrafts are ubiquitous within intense (Category 4- and -5) tropical cyclones, and that few such updrafts have been observed within weaker storms. These extreme updrafts, which are almost exclusively found within the eyewall just inwards of the radius of maximum winds, sometimes occur in close association with extreme horizontal wind speeds. Consistent with previous studies, it is suggested that both the extremes in vertical velocity and wind speed are associated with small-scale (~1 km) vortices that exist along the eye/eyewall interface. As a substantial number of updrafts are found within a kilometer of the surface, it can be shown that it is implausible for buoyancy to be the primary mechanism for vertical acceleration. The azimuthal distribution of both the extreme updrafts and wind speeds is strongly controlled by the orientation of the vertical wind shear. Some previous studies suggest that extreme near-surface windspeeds should tend to occur within downdrafts. In contrast, the dropsondes indicate that peak windspeeds are found to occur in the presence of an updraft or downdraft with roughly equal frequency.",

            "abstract": "Snowfall is the dominant hydrologic input for many high-elevation ecosystems of the western United States. Many climate models envision changes in California’s Sierra Nevada snow pack characteristics, which would severely impact the storage and release of water for one of the world’s largest economies. Given the importance of snowfall for future carbon cycling in high elevation ecosystems, how will these changes affect seedling recruitment, plant mortality, and community composition? To address this question, experiments utilize snow fences to manipulate snow depth and melt timing at a desert-montane ecotone in eastern California, USA. Long-term April 1 snow pack depth averages 1344 mm (1928-2015) but is highly variable from year to year. Snow fences increased equilibrium drift snow depth by 100%. Long-term changes in snow depth and melt timing are associated with s shift from shurbs to graminoids where snow depth was increased for >50 years. Changes in snow have impacted growth for only three plant species. Moreover, annual growth ring increments of the conifers Pinus jeffreyi and Pi. contorta were not equally sensitive to snow depth. There were over 8000 seedlings of the shrubs Artemisia tridentata and Purshia tridentata found in 6300 m2 in summer 2009, following about 1400 mm of winter snow and spring rain. The frequency of seedlings of A. tridentata and P. tridentata were much lower on increased-depth plots compared to ambient-depth, and reduced-depth plots. Survival of the first year was lowest for A. tridentata. Survival of seedlings from the 2008 cohort was much higher for P. tridentata than A. tridentata during the 2011-2015 drought. Results indicate complex interactions between snow depth and plant community characteristics, and that responses of plants at this ecotone may not respond similarly to increases vs. decreases in snow depth. These changes portend altered carbon uptake in this region under future snowfall scenarios.",

In this work, we focus on the process of microscale mixing and the development of a local volume-averaged advection-dispersion-reaction equation, where the microscale configuration of a reacting mixture (where two components must mix to create reaction) is an important quantity for predicting the effective rate of reaction. Although such a system is simple from the transport perspective, it has a sufficiently rich structure that the mixing and reaction dynamics are still reasonably complex. It also provides a model structure where the influence of microscale configuration can be understood in detail.\nIn this work, we focus on (1) development of the upscaled advection-dispersion-reaction equation (via volume averaging) for a system in which two chemical components must mix to react, and (2) identification of a closure scheme from which the effective rate of reaction can be predicted. In particular, we examine mixing at a simple interface, and construct approximate methods to predict the (generally transient) effectiveness factor. By providing an explicit closure for the advection-dispersion-reaction problem, additional physical content is provided about how the scalar dissipation relates to the effective rate of reaction due to mixing.",

Recent work strongly supports the notion that the Rae developed independently from the Hearne; however, while the Hearne appears to have been affiliated with the Superior craton and related blocks of ‘Superia’, the genealogy of Rae is far less clear. A diagnostic feature of the Rae, setting it apart from both Hearne and Slave, is the high degree of late Neoarchean to early Paleoproterozoic reworking. Indeed, following a widespread 2.62-2.58 Ga granite bloom, the margins of Rae were subjected to seemingly continuous tectonism, with 2.55-2.50 Ga MacQuoid orogenesis in the east superseded by 2.50 to 2.28 Ga Arrowsmith orogenesis in the west. A recent wide-ranging survey of Hf isotopic ratios in detrital and magmatic zircons across Rae has demonstrated significant juvenile, subduction-related crustal production in this period. Following break-up at ca. 2.1 Ga, the Rae later became a tectonic aggregation point as the western and eastern margins transitioned back to convergent plate boundaries (Thelon-Taltson and Snowbird orogens) marking onset of the 2.0-1.8 Ga assembly of Nuna. The distinctive features of Rae, including orogenic imprints of MacQuoid and Arrowsmith vintage have now been identified in about two dozen cratonic blocks world-wide, substantiating the idea that the Rae cratonic family spawned from an independent earliest Paleoproterozoic landmass before its incorportation in Nuna. While critical tests remain to be made, including more reliable ground-truthing of proposed global correlations, these relationships strongly support the notion of supercontinental cyclicity in the Precambrian, including the Archean. They also challenge the idea of a globally quiescent period in the early Paleoproterozoic (2.45-2.2 Ga) in which plate tectonics slowed or shut down.",

However, high latitude gravity wave amplitudes are particularly difficult to obtain due to the challenging experimental and logistical constraints in these regions. In this study, we present gravity wave climatology of high latitudes during austral summer conditions over the Antarctic continent. These data were obtained using high-resolution GPS measurements aboard long duration high altitude balloon flights that were flown as part of the NASA Balloon Array for Radiation-belt Relativistic Electron Losses (BARREL) mission in December 2013-February 2014 and December 2012-February 2013. The results show increased gravity wave activity along the coast of the Antarctic continent, particularly over the Peninsula and Halley Bay, whereas at higher latitudes, particularly over regions near the South Pole, gravity wave amplitudes decrease substantially. Through use of horizontal winds data, we obtained measurements of the vertical transport of horizontal momentum fluxes, which were unusually high for the summer high latitude lower stratosphere. Such unique measurements as these are immediately applicable to understanding of upwelling in the summer middle atmosphere as well as to the formation of overlaying mesospheric clouds formation.",

Deposition amounts of sulfur and nitrogen compounds have been evaluated not only in East Asian region but also worldwide. On the other hand, atmospheric deposition of carbonaceous components including organic carbon (OC), elementary carbon (EC) and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) were monitored only at a few sites in Europe, North America and Africa, which will obscure removal process and atmospheric concentration distribution of those components. In this study, ionic and carbonaceous components in precipitation and aerosol are monitored at remote sites in Japan, and the characteristics of atmospheric deposition amounts were evaluated.Field observations have been implemented at the Noto station since November 2013 and the Sado station since May 2011. Wet deposition samples were collected by rain samplers, and dry deposition samples were collected by high volume or low volume aerosol samplers. Concentrations of Cl-, NO3-, SO42-, NH4+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+ were measured by ion chromatography, EC and OC by the IMPROVE protocol, and PAHs by HPLC with a fluorescence detector. Wet deposition amounts were calculated as the products of aqueous concentration and precipitation amounts, and dry deposition amounts were as the products of aerosol concentrations and deposition velocity estimated by the Inferential Method.Total (wet and dry) annual deposition amounts of carbonaceous components of NO3-, SO42-, EC, water insoluble OC, Fluoranthene at Noto (Nov. 2013 to Oct. 2014) were 4353.81 mg/m2, 7020.50 mg/m2, 149.84 mg/m2, 1191.09 mg/m2, 28.6 μg/m2, respectively. These amounts are comparable total annual deposition amounts of OC and EC at Sado (May 2011 to Feb. 2012), which were 166.04 mg/m2 and 834.0 mg/m2. Higher deposition amounts of ionic and carbonaceous components were observed, which would be attributable to long range transportation of the East Asian continent.",

            "abstract": "Accurate satellite precipitation estimates are essential for understanding the long-term variability in the global hydrologic cycle and for constraining global climate models. Spaceborne precipitation estimates depend heavily on passive microwave remote sensors due to the large spatial coverage and long record of observations available from such sensors; however, light precipitation is frequently undetected or underestimated by passive microwave rainfall retrievals. Observations from the CloudSat Profiling Radar (CPR) and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) provide a unique opportunity for long-term collocated precipitation measurements from passive microwave sensors and an active radar with sensitivity to very light precipitation that can be used to assess the precipitation detection biases. For this study, collocated measurements from AMSR-E and CloudSat during 2008 will be used to identify environments where AMSR-E underestimates precipitation. Environmental variables from the ECMWF Reanalysis (ERA-Interim) will be used to understand the characteristics of the large-scale and thermodynamic environments associated with AMSR-E precipitation biases. A preliminary comparison of CPR rain rates and AMSR-E Level-2B rain rates show a large fraction of rain missed by AMSR-E, with nearly 80% of missed light rain in regions with SSTs below 25°C. This is consistent with prior studies showing large detection biases in regions of large-scale subsidence. The relationship between precipitation biases and other factors such as 2 m air temperature, column water vapor, lower tropospheric stability, and vertical velocity will be explored.",

            "abstract": "Plant species shifts in response to global change will have significant impacts on ecosystem carbon (C) exchange and storage arising from changes in hydrology. Spatial variation in peatland C fluxes have largely been attributed to the spatial distribution of microhabitats that arise from variation in surface topography and water table depth, but little is known about how plant species composition impacts peatland C cycling or how these impacts will be influenced by changing environmental conditions. We quantified the effect of species composition and environmental variables on carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) fluxes over 2 years in a temperate peatland for four plant communities situated along a water table gradient from ombrotrophic bog to beaver pond. We hypothesized that (i) spatial heterogeneity in species composition would drive predictable spatial heterogeneity in C fluxes due to variation in plant traits and ecological tolerances, and (ii) increases in peat temperature would increase C fluxes. Species had different effects on C fluxes primarily due to differences in leaf traits. Differences in ecological tolerances among communities resulted in different rates of CO2 exchange in response to changes in water table depth. There was an overall reduction in ecosystem respiration (ER), gross primary productivity (GPP) and CH4 flux in response to colder peat temperatures in the second year, and the additive effects of a deeper water table in the bog margin and pond sites further reduced flux rates in these areas. These results demonstrate that different plant species can increase or decrease the flux of C into and out of peatlands based on differences in leaf traits and ecological tolerances, and that CO2 and CH4 fluxes are sensitive to changes in soil temperature, especially when coupled with changes in moisture availability.",

            "abstract": "Many studies have noted that there is a positive relationship between temperatures in freshwater systems and methane production by Archaea, but not all freshwater systems are alike. In the Arctic and Subarctic, small, very shallow lakes are a common feature. We hypothesize that such lakes’ sediment temperatures (where methane production occurs) are particularly sensitive and responsive to solar shortwave flux (SW), because direct solar heating of the sediments can partly bypass the need for physical mixing of warm water downwards across stratifications in the water column (such mixing is necessary for heating the bottom sediments in deeper lakes).\nEbullitive (bubble) fluxes of methane are far more varying, and may represent the additional methane production not being diffusively lost. Although trigger events such as air pressure changes are known to transiently produce bubbling, we show a link to SW input on both shorter and longer timescales than previously demonstrated. However, it is difficult to separate SW-driven increases due to autochthonous production leading to increased methane production from SW-driven temperature increases in sediment speeding methane production in the current dataset.\nWe show that in a shallow (ca. 1 m deep) lake (Villasjön, in Stordalen Mire, Sweden), during summer (June-August) methane bubbling is closely tied to available SW input on timescales of a few days. For the study area in northern Sweden, the available SW appears linked to the phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Relationships between the winter NAO and snow cover, which impacts lake ice-out date, and available summer SW are also considered. Linking methane production in shallow lakes to the NAO may allow back-projections of methane production in the Stordalen region to the 1860s. We compare these back-projections to recently published back-projections based on lake ice-out dates for Stordalen dating back to 1916.",

Heat stress is caused by a combination of meteorological factors: temperature, humidity, and radiation. The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) uses Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT)—an empirical metric this is calibrated with temperature, humidity, and radiation—for determining labor capacity during heat stress. Unfortunately, most literature studying global heat stress focuses on extreme temperature events, and a limited number of studies use the combination of temperature and humidity. Recent global assessments use WBGT, yet omit the radiation component without recalibrating the metric.\nHere we explicitly calculate future WBGT within a land surface model, including radiative fluxes as produced by a modeled globe thermometer. We use the Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5), which is a component model of the Community Earth System Model (CESM), and is maintained by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). To drive our CLM4.5 simulations, we use greenhouse gasses Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (business as usual), and atmospheric output from the CMIP5 Archive. Humans work in a variety of environments, and we place the modeled globe thermometer in a variety of environments. We modify CLM4.5 code to calculate solar and thermal radiation fluxes below and above canopy vegetation, and in bare ground. To calculate wet bulb temperature, we implemented the HumanIndexMod into CLM4.5. The temperature, wet bulb temperature, and radiation fields are calculated at every model time step and are outputted 4x Daily. We use these fields to calculate WBGT and labor capacity for two time slices: 2026-2045 and 2081-2100.",

The National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) is designed to limit these impacts, but certain areas in the continental U.S. exceed this standard. Mitigating O3 NAAQS exceedances by designing emissions controls can be complicated in urban areas because of the long-range transport of ozone and its gaseous precursors as well as the complex mix of local emissions sources. Recent growth of unconventional oil and gas development near urban areas in Colorado, Texas, and the northeastern corridor has exacerbated this problem.\nTo estimate the contribution of emissions from oil and gas development to urban O3 issues, we apply the CMAQ adjoint, which efficiently elucidates the relative influence of emissions sources on select concentration-based metrics. Specifically, the adjoint is used to calculate the spatially-specific relative contributions of emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) throughout the continental U.S. to O3 NAAQS exceedances and to ozone-related health risks in select urban areas. By evaluating these influences for different urban areas, including one in California that has been managing air quality with adjacent oil and gas development for a longer period of time, we are able to compare and contrast the emissions control strategies that may be more effective in particular regions. Additionally, the resulting relationships between emissions and concentrations provide a way to project ozone impacts when measurements provide refined estimates of emissions from this sector.",

            "abstract": "A longstanding issue in paleoclimate research is that proxy data indicates greater polar amplification than that simulated by climate models. This is true for periods both colder and warmer than today, such as the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the Pliocene. Resolving this disparity requires a better understanding of climate processes, particularly in the sensitive polar regions.\nClimate records indicate that atmospheric dust load has varied greatly in the past with greater fluxes during the recent glacials compared to the interglacials. Dust fluxes in the Pliocene were reduced compared to the modern, partly due to the northward expansion of vegetation in Africa, which limited the extent of this major dust source.\nMineral dust is an important ice nuclei (IN) in clouds. The presence of dust allows ice-crystals in clouds to form over a wider range of environmental conditions than in its absence. Termed the indirect effect of dust, this process has a considerable impact on the physical and radiative properties of clouds and therefore climate. We investigate the indirect effects of dust on the LGM and Pliocene climates as they represent end member cold / warm climates with a high & low-dust load respectively.\nWe use CAM5 & CESM, state of the art climate models, and a new empirical parameterization for mixed-phase clouds (DeMott et al., 2015) in which dust is able to act as a cloud IN. Cloud ice-formation in our climate model is based on temperature and IN availability as opposed to the overly simple temperature-only parameterization often used. We modify global dustiness and CO2concentrations to create idealized LGM and Pliocene simulations.\nOur results show that the indirect effects of dust have a strong impact on the climate, particularly in the northern hemisphere. Modifying global dustiness impacts cloud physical and radiative properties, which translate into a large influence on global climate & polar amplification over the Arctic. Global temperatures and polar temperature vary by ~ 5°C and > 10°C respectively between our simulations.\nThe indirect effect of dust on the climate is an important forcing which has not previously been included in paleoclimate studies. Changes in dust are intrinsically linked to changes in climate, and this is a plausible mechanism by which model-data agreement can be improved for paleoclimates.",

            "abstract": "We used an RGB camera mounted 50m above an upland forest canopy to quantify leaf phenology during 12 months for 267 upper canopy tree crowns at the Amazon Tall Tower site (59.0005ºW, 2.1433ºS). Daily images under overcast sky were selected and radiometrically intercalibrated to remove any seasonal bias from incoming radiant color balance. Seasonality of crown color was then recovered for each individual crown by plotting its greenness timeline (green chromatic coordinate). We detected rapid large-amplitude positive and negative changes in greenness. Rapid increase was attributed to leaf flush and occurred in 85% of all crowns, with 80% showing a single flush per year. The theory of photoperiod control of equatorial tropical forest leaf phenology predicts two annual peaks of leaf flush, so is not supported. Rapid negative change occurred in 42% of individuals and was caused by massive pre-flush leaf abscission (31% of all trees) or other non-green pre-flushing states (11%). Crown flushing was concentrated in the five driest months (55% of trees) compared to the five wettest months (10%). Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) for each of three crown phenostages was obtained from a single high spatial resolution QuickBird satellite image.These phenostages were identified using only the visible bands of QuickBird so they could be related to the same crown stages seen in the RGB tower camera images. Relative frequencies of the three crown level phenostages were monitored with the tower camera, allowing a monthly estimate of landscape-scale EVI. Free of the seasonal effects on orbital sensors from clouds, cloud shadows, aerosols or solar illumination angle and corrected for seasonal change in light quality, the camera- and QuickBird derived EVI served as an independent verification of MODIS EVI seasonality. Camera-based EVI was highly consistent with view- and solar-angle corrected MAIAC-EVI of a 3x3 km footprint centered on the tower (R = 0.95 between the two monthly curves). Both reached minimum greenness in May (late wet season) and maximum during October to December (late dry to early wet season). We conclude that seasonal variation in EVI of Central Amazon forest is real and is driven by the seasonally changing mix of leaf age detected in crown-level leaf cohorts.",

During a close flyby (~1400 km) in May 2013, Cassini’s RADAR instrument observed the hydrocarbon sea Ligeia Mare using its altimetry mode. In addition to observing the sea, these observations also covered a sequence of channels pertaining to the Vid Flumina drainage basin. While radar images have been used to identify fluvial valleys in networks that extend for hundreds of kilometers, these images do not directly probe the existence or extent of any liquid-filled channels in the valleys. Herein, we use the Cassini altimetry over Vid Flumina to, for the first time, directly detect the presence of liquid-filled channels on Titan and characterize their width and geomorphologic context. Our discovery confirms that Titan does indeed have liquid filled channels in the present epoch. Steep-sided channels extend hundreds of meters below the surrounding terrain and in some cases exhibit canyon morphology. Liquid elevations in Vid Flumina and its lower tributaries are at the same level of Ligeia Mare to within the instrument vertical accuracy (~15m). We also find higher order tributaries that occur several hundred meters above the level of Ligeia Mare, consistent with drainage feeding into the main channel system.",

            "abstract": "The mean transit time (MTT) is a fundamental property of a groundwater flow system that is related to recharge rate and storage volume. However, estimating the MTT using environmental tracers is problematic as flow-weighted samples over the full spectrum of transit times are needed and computed MTTs depend on the transit time distribution (TTD) that is not usually determined directly. We studied the TTD and MTT in the baseflow of a gaining stream (West Bear Creek) and in the surrounding shallow aquifer in the North Carolina Coastal Plain. Groundwater seepage to the stream was quantified using the dilution of an injected Br tracer, velocity-area flow measurements, seepage meters, and Darcy calculations from discrete point measurements of vertical K and gradient. Environmental tracers concentrations (CFCs, SF6, 3H-3He) were measured in multi-level monitoring wells, in streambed piezometers, seepage meters, and stream samples. Apparent (piston flow) ages from monitoring wells are generally consistent with an exponential TTD. Discrete samples from streambed piezometers have concentrations from multiple age-dating tracers suggesting that mixing of a wide range of groundwater ages was not occurring as groundwater converged below the streambed and that piston flow apparent ages were reasonable estimates of the transit time of groundwater. Stream water samples that are corrected for exchange with the atmosphere yield SF6 concentrations that are similar to flow weighted values from streambed piezometers. The MTT of 25-30 years derived from well samples is similar to that based on streambed piezometer samples and the exchange-corrected stream samples. The flow-weighted cumulative distribution of apparent ages from streambed samples can be modeled with a gamma distribution having a shape factor (α) that is greater than 1. Numerical modeling of some ideal cases indicates that spatial variations in recharge might be discerned from the cumulative TTD with α >1 for recharge concentrated away from a stream and α < 1 for recharge concentrated near the stream. West Bear Creek appears to act as a flow weighted integrator of transit times and samples from the stream and streambed can provide fundamental information regarding properties of the contributing aquifer.",

            "abstract": "Accurate measurements of precipitation are of great importance in hydrologic predictions especially for floods, which are a pervasive natural hazard. One of the primary objectives of Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) mission is to provide a basis for hydrologic predictions using satellite sensors. A major advance in GPM relative to the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) is that it observes atmospheric river (AR) events, most of which have landfall too far north to be tracked by TRMM. These events are responsible for most major floods along the U.S. West Coast. We address the question of whether, for hydrologic modeling purposes, it is better to use precipitation products derived directly from GPM and/or other precipitation fields from weather models that have assimilated satellite data. Our overall strategy is to compare different methods for prediction of flood and/or high flow events by different forcings on the hydrologic model. We examine four different configurations of the Distroibute Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) over the Chehalis River Basin that use a) precipitation forcings based on gridded station data; b) precipitation forcings based on NWS WSR-88D data, c) forcings based from short-term precipitation forecasts using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) mesoscale atmospheric model, and d) satellite-based precipitation estimates (TMPA and IMERG). We find that in general, biases in the radar and satellite products result in much larger errors than with either gridded station data or WRF forcings, but if these biases are removed, comparable performance in flood predictions can be achieved by Satellite-based precipitation estimates (TMPA and IMERG).",

The dependence across the weather variables can be nonlinear, and each variable may follow a different probability model. The dimension of the problem can be relatively large to be represented through a parametric modeling framework. We introduce a new space-time simulator for multiple variables and spatial locations and demonstrate its application for modeling floods in two different river basins with different climatologies. Given multiple variables, each of which can be simulated from its marginal or conditional distribution, and a historical data set for these variables, the method appropriately preserves multivariate and the temporal dependence across the variables. We use the VIC hydrologic model, which is physically based, to show the necessity of preserving both the spatial and temporal patterns in flood modeling. We demonstrate that the spatial structure is not needed for small basin areas, but as one moves to larger river basins, it becomes increasingly important. This research bridges the divide between stochastic weather simulators and flood models, demonstrating that merging the two approaches can produce more robust estimates of flood distributions and return period estimation.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the factors controlling the release of volatiles from the downgoing slab, the subsequent generation of melt in the overlying mantle wedge, the migration of melt to the crust, and its evolution and emplacement within the crust are important for advancing our understanding of arc magmatism and crustal genesis. Because melt and aqueous fluids are a few orders of magnitude more electrically conductive than unmelted peridotite, the conductivity-mapping magnetotelluric (MT) method is well-suited to imaging fluids and melt beneath arc volcanoes. Here we present conductivity results from an amphibious MT profile crossing Okmok volcano in the central Aleutian arc.\nThe Aleutian arc is one of the most volcanically active regions in North America, making it an ideal location for studying arc magnetism. Okmok volcano, located on the northeastern portion of Umnak Island, is among the most active volcanoes in the Aleutian chain. In addition to two caldera-forming events in the Holocene, numerous eruptions in the past century indicate a robust magmatic supply. Previous coarse resolution seismic studies have inferred a crustal magma reservoir.\nIn order to investigate the role fluids play in melting the mantle wedge, how melts ascend through the corner flow regime of the mantle wedge, how melt migrates and is stored within the upper mantle and crust, and how this impacts explosive caldera forming eruptions, we carried out an amphibious geophysical survey across the arc in June-July 2015. Twenty-nine onshore MT stations and 10 offshore stations were collected in a 3D array covering Okmok, and 43 additional offshore MT stations completed a 300 km amphibious profile starting at the trench, crossing the forearc, arc and backarc. Thirteen onshore passive seismic stations were also installed and will remain in place for one year to supplement the twelve permanent stations on the island. Data collected by this project will be used to map seismic velocity and electrical conductivity variations within the arc, providing unique constraints on temperature, mineralogy and fluid content.\nThis abstract covers preliminary MT constraints on the mantle and deep crust as inferred from the 300 km long amphibious profile. A companion abstract (Bennington et al.) considers the crustal magma chamber imaged by the 3D array.",

Norway spruce is one of the dominant boreal forest species in northern Europe, which has been considered to be high monoterpene (MT) emitters [3, 4]. BVOC emissions and compound composition vary considerably under different temperature and light conditions through growing season [5, 6]. Information of vertical profile emission patterns is indispensible for understanding chemical processes and oxidation sinks within canopy and for modelling evaluation.\nWe characterize the in-canopy BVOC emissions from a 120 years old Norway spruce in Central Sweden (Norunda, 60°05'N, 17°29'E). Air samples were taken during the growing season (June to September 2013 & 2014) from transparent dynamic branch chambers set up in a vertical profile with 4 levels (20 m, 15 m, 11 m and 3 m agl.) on the spruce. Samples were collected every hour from the chamber with Tenax-TA adsorbent tubes and a pocket pump, and analyzed later by gas chromatography and a mass selective detector (GC-MS) to quantify each trapped terpenoid compound. The emission spectrum of Norway spruce at 20 m canopy height was found to be more complex than the emissions spectra at lower canopy levels, and included isoprene, MT and SQT from June to September, while MT was the dominating terpenoid species. The emission spectra of July and August (isoprene, 14 MT and 3 SQT) were much more complex compared to June and September at the 20 m canopy level, and mainly caused by an increase of MT species during peak season. Similarly, isoprene showed a distinctive seasonal pattern, and was detected at all the heights during noon time except the bottom 3 m level during peak summer, but only at the highest layer (20 m) during noon in early or late summer. O3 vertical profile data will be available for further chemical process analysis within canopy.\n",

The ACES design demonstrates advancements in: (1) enhanced power-aperture product through the use and operation of multiple co-aligned laser transmitters and a multi-aperture telescope design; (2) high-efficiency, high-power Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers (EDFAs); (3) high-bandwidth, low-noise HgCdTe detector and transimpedence amplifier (TIA) subsystem capable of long-duration operation; and (4) advanced algorithms for cloud and aerosol discrimination. The ACES instrument, an Intensity-Modulated Continuous-Wave (IM-CW) lidar, was designed for high-altitude aircraft operations and can be directly applied to space instrumentation to meet the ASCENDS mission requirements. Specifically, the lidar simultaneously transmits three IM-CW laser beams from the high power EDFAs operating near 1571 nm. The outgoing laser beams are aligned to the field of view of three fiber-coupled 17.8-cm diameter telescopes, and the backscattered light collected by the same three telescopes is sent to the detector/TIA subsystem, which has a bandwidth of 4.9 MHz and operates service-free with a tactical Dewar and cryocooler. The electronic bandwidth is only slightly higher than 1 MHz, effectively limiting the noise level. Two key laser modulation approaches are being tested to significantly mitigate the effects of thin clouds on the retrieved CO2 column amounts. This work provides an over view of these technologies, the modulation approaches, and results from recent test flights.",

            "abstract": "Accumulation of bacterial biopolymers in porous media is known to decrease permeability by several orders of magnitude, referred to as bioclogging, thereby altering the hydraulic flow systems of porous media. Successful microbial bioclogging treatments require geophysical monitoring techniques to provide appropriate spatial and temporal information on bacterial growth and activities in the subsurface; such monitoring datasets can be used to evaluate the status of plugged reservoir sections and optimize re-treatment if the plug degrades. This study investigated the variations of P- and S-wave attenuation of porous media for monitoring in-situ accumulation of bacterial biopolymers in sediments. Column experiments, where Leuconostoc mesenterorides were stimulated to produce the insoluble polysaccharide biopolymer (referred to as dextran) in a sand pack, were performed while monitoring changes in permeability as well as P- and S-wave responses. P-wave responses at ultrasonic and sub-ultrasonic frequency ranges (i.e., hundreds of kHz and tens of kHz) and S-wave responses at several kHz were acquired using ultrasonic transducers and bender elements during accumulation of the biopolymer. The permeability of the sand pack was reduced by more than one order of magnitude while the insoluble biopolymer, dextran, produced by Leuconostoc mesenteroides occupied ~10% pore volume. The amplitude of the P-wave signals decreased at the both ultrasonic (hundreds of kHz) and sub-ultrasonic (tens of kHz) frequency ranges; and the spectral ratio calculations confirmed an increase in P-wave attenuation (1/QP) in the both frequency ranges. The amplitude of the S-wave signals significantly increased during the increase in S-wave velocity, possibly due to the increased shear stiffness of the medium. However, the spectral ratio calculation suggested an increase in S-wave attenuation (1/QS) in the several kHz band. The observed changes in permeability and P- and S-wave attenuation were correlated with the amount of biopolymer produced, and a pore-scale analysis of the experiment results provided meaningful insights into the pore-scale accumulation behavior of biopolymers and the interactions between biomaterial and grains in porous media.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGUFallMeeting.pdf\nDeconvolution is a technique most often used in signal and image processing to remove the effects of a system’s impulse response and recreate the input signal from a given output. In the context of paleoclimate, deconvolution by spectral division has been used to recover the climate system’s impulse response, also known as its transfer function, given the δ18O time series record of the north pole as the input and the south as the output (or vice versa). The working hypothesis of polar synchronization justifies the use of deconvolution methods. Various regularization approaches and spectral analysis show a clear connection of millennial scale periodicity linking the polar climates over the past 100,000 years. Tests of spectral peak consistency across regularization factors and of peak validity indicate that the connection is a result of the data and is not an artifact of the method used. Deconvolution can be applied to other linearly connected climate systems including teleconnected systems. Sea surface temperature dipoles found in the North Atlantic Ocean basin, for example, also display potentially geographically linked features, and correlation between the dipoles themselves suggests synchronization of adjacent dipoles. Having identified this system of synchronized variations with linear phase relations, deconvolution methods can be used to investigate potential transfer functions across different scales.",

Anomalies were produced repeatedly, each time after application of magnetic field pulse of varying amplitude and constant, normal or reversed, direction. This process resulted in both magnetizing and demagnetizing of the meteorite thin section, while keeping the magnetization vector in the plane of the thin section. Analysis of the magnetic data allows determination of coercivity of remanence (Bcr) for the magnetic sources in situ. Value of Bcr is critical for calculating magnetic forces applicable during missions to asteroids where gravity is compromised. Bcr was estimated by two methods. First method measured varying dipole magnetic field strength produced by each anomaly in the direction of magnetic pulses. Second method measured deflections of the dipole direction from the direction of magnetic pulses (Nabelek et al., 2015).\nNabelek, L., Mazanec, M., Kdyr, S., and Kletetschka, G., 2015, Magnetic, in situ, mineral characterization of Chelyabinsk meteorite thin section: Meteoritics & Planetary Science.",

Unraveling the stratrigraphy of these deposits, as well as their eruptive centers, is critical for constraining the volcanic history of this ignimbrite, the 18.8 Ma Peach Spring Tuff, is the recently identified 17.7 Ma Tuff of Bonelli House (TB) (Ferguson & Cook 2015) and may also occur in the southern Black and Sacramento Mountains. To help determine the extent and possible source of the TB, we have performed a combined remote sensing and paleomagnetic study of this unit, including possible correlatives.\nPaleomagnetic work involved Remanence and anisotropic magnetic susceptibility methods. Drill samples were collected and processed at Scripps Institute of Oceanography & Pomona College. An AC current was run to obtain the Paleomag current, as opposed to the traditional of heating up the cores at specific intervals. Sacramento Mountains samples produced an average direction of 200.9 / -26.4, which contrasts the Peach Spring Tuff paleodirection of 036.4/33 (Wells & Hillhouse, 1989). An AMS direction was determined using a MFK1 Kappabridge instrument and consistently showed similar flow direction to that of the PST. In compiling our data on a map, we took into account the Whipple Detachment Fault, ~40 km westward (Lister & Davis, 1989).\nWe were able to identify a spectral signature and remnant paleomagnetic direction for the TB and identify potential additional outcrops in the southern Black mountains. AMS showed us that the ignimbrites originated from a source in the Silver Creek Caldera, which may indicate the PST at TB were produced from a similar source. The remnant paleomagnetic direction allows us to closely correlate these tuff units as occurring within a similar timeframe. The contrasting paleodirection of the TB and the PST allows us to confidently say that the Peach Spring and Bonelli Tuffs occurred at different times when the Earth’s magnetic field directions were different.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we investigate the spatial distribution of PM1 in the greater London area during the Clean Air for London (ClearfLo) project in winter 2012 by applying two High-Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometers (HR-ToF-AMS) at a rural site (Detling, Kent) and an urban site (North Kensington, London). While the concentration of organic aerosol (OA) is comparable between the rural and urban sites, the OA sources are distinctly different. Due to elevated domestic heating in the urban area, the concentration of solid fuel OA at the urban site is about twice as high as at the rural site. In contrast, the OOA concentration at the rural site is almost twice that of the urban site. This is likely caused by a steep concentration gradient of OOA when air masses are advected from polluted mainland Europe. Taking advantage of low biogenic emissions in winter, the sources of OOA, which are highly uncertain, are investigated. Combing Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis and radiocarbon analysis, the majority of OOA is estimated to arise from aged biomass burning. We deploy a suite of instruments to investigate the organic volatility at the rural Detling site. After heating at 250°C in a thermal-denuder (TD), the mass fraction remaining of organics is 16%, which indicates the presence of non-volatile organics. By comparing the OA associated with refractory black carbon (measured by a soot-particle aerosol mass spectrometer) and total OA (measured by a HR-ToF-AMS), we proposed that the non-volatile organics have similar sources or have undergone similar chemical processing as refractory black carbon in the atmosphere. Finally, we will discuss the relationship between the volatility and the degree of oxidation of organics.",

This change exposes organic matter buried in the soils and permafrost to microbial degradation and mineralization to form CO2 and CH4. The proportion and fluxes of these greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere control the global feedback on warming. To improve representations of these biogeochemical processes in terrestrial ecosystem models we compared soil properties and microbial activities in core samples of polygonal tundra from the Barrow Environmental Observatory. Measurements of soil water potential through the soil column characterized water binding to the organic and mineral components. This suction combines with temperature to control freezing, gas diffusion and microbial activity. The temperature-dependence of CO2 and CH4 production from anoxic soil incubations at -2, +4 or +8 °C identified a significant lag in methanogenesis relative to CO2 production by anaerobic respiration and fermentation. Changes in the abundance of methanogen signature genes during incubations indicate that microbial population shifts caused by thawing and warmer temperatures drive changes in the mixtures of soil carbon degradation products. Comparisons of samples collected across the microtopographic features of ice-wedge polygons address the impacts of water saturation, iron reduction and organic matter content on CH4 production and oxidation. These combined measurements build process understanding that can be applied across scales to constrain key response factors in models that address Arctic soil warming.",

            "abstract": "Active source seismic data in the Salton Sea provide insight into the complexity of the pull-apart system development. Seismic reflection data combined with tomographic cross sections give constraints on the timing of basin development and strain partitioning between the two dominant dextral faults in the region; the Imperial fault to the southwest and the Southern San Andreas fault (SSAF) to the northeast. Deformation associated with this step-over appears young, having formed in the last 20-40 k.a. The complexity seen in the Salton Sea is similar to that seen in pull-apart basins worldwide. In the southern basin of the Salton Sea, a zone of transpression is noted near the southern termination of the San Andreas fault, though this stress regime quickly transitions to a region of transtension in the northern reaches of the sea. The evolution seen in the basin architecture is likely related to a transition of the SSAF dying to the north, and giving way to youthful segments of the Brawley seismic zone and Imperial fault.\nStratigraphic signatures seen in seismic cross-sections also reveal a long-term component of slip to the southwest on a fault 1-2 km west of the northeastern Salton Sea shoreline. Numerous lines of evidence, including seismic reflection data, high-resolution bathymetry within the Salton Sea, and folding patterns in the Borrego Formation to the east of the sea support an assertion of a previously unmapped fault, the Salton Trough fault (STF), parallel to the SAF and just offshore within the Salton Sea. Seismic observations are seen consistently within two datasets of varying vertical resolutions, up to depths of 4-5 km, suggesting that this fault strand is much longer-lived than the evolution seen in the southern sub-basin.\nThe existence of the STF unifies discrepancies between the onshore seismic studies and data collected within the sea. The STF likely serves as the current bounding fault to the active pull-apart system, as it aligns with the “rung-and-ladder” seismicity seen within the Salton Sea. Additionally, the presence of the STF may explain the gaps seen in the paleoseismic record along the SSAF (i.e. Philibosian et al., 2011), which shows an extended period of non-rupture. The STF may play a role in strain release along the SSAF, so a combined history may yield improved insight to the long periods of quiescence.",

It is reported that nearly half of all cropland in Indiana benefits from some sort of artificial drainage. However, subsurface tile has a significant negative impact on surface water quality by providing a fast means of transport for nutrients from fertilizers. Therefore, generating spatial data of tile drainage in the field is important and useful for agricultural landscape and hydrological studies. Subsurface tile drains in Indiana’s croplands are not widely mapped. In this study, we will delineate subsurface tile drainage in agricultural land in Shatto Ditch watershed, located in Kosciusko County, Indiana. We will use geo-spatial methodology, which was purposed by earlier researchers to detect tile drainage. We will use aerial color-infrared and satellite imagery along with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data. In order to map tile lines with possible accuracy, we will use GIS-based analysis in combination with remotely sensed data. This research will be comprised of three stages: 1) masking out the potential drainage area using a decision tree rule based on land cover information, soil drainage category, surface slope, and satellite image differencing technique, 2) delineate tile lines using image processing techniques, and 3) check the accuracy of mapped tile lines with ground control points. To our knowledge, this study will be the first to check the accuracy of mapping with ground truth data. Based on the accuracy of results, we will extend the methodology to greater spatial scales. The results are expected to contribute to better characterizing and controlling water pollution sources in Indiana, which is a major environmental problem.",

            "abstract": "Rainfall-triggered shallow landslides pose hazards to communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems. The magnitude and frequency of extreme precipitation are expected to change under climate warming, but their effects on landslide abundance, size, and spatial distribution are poorly understood. Fractional changes in extreme precipitation can be considerably greater than those in mean precipitation as storm intensity is not constrained by the atmospheric energy budget. Changes in orographic precipitation may also alter the spatial pattern of extreme precipitation. We assess relative changes in extreme precipitation for varying return periods and event durations predicted by regional climate models (RCM) in the USA over the periods 1971-2000 to 2041-2070. We delineate areas where orographic precipitation contributes to changes in extreme precipitation by analyzing topography and local winds associated with these extremes. To verify that RCMs reflect theoretical predictions, we quantify precipitation changes on the lee and windward slopes. We assess impacts of extreme precipitation change on landslide characteristics by applying a search algorithm that predicts landslide abundance, location, and size to a study site in the Oregon Coast Range (OCR) with a 10-year landslide observational record. We test a range of precipitation scenarios, forest management practices, and antecedent moisture conditions. To explore effects of orographic precipitation, we rescale observed precipitation for representative lee and windward locations and find that fractional changes in mean winter precipitation are ~3 times larger on leeward slopes. The fractional changes in intensity are much greater for extreme precipitation than mean precipitation, and they increase with return period. In the Pacific Northwest, leeward increases are ~10% for 2-year events and ~20% for 30-year events. At our study site, a 20% increase in precipitation or antecedent moisture corresponds to a 30-40% increase in landslide volume, but up to 250% increases are predicted leeward of the OCR and in undisturbed forest. These results suggest that the largest relative change in future landslide hazards may not occur in the areas that are currently most susceptible, underscoring the importance of informed land use practices under climate change.",

            "abstract": "Understanding of the dynamics in Earth's radiation belts is critical to accurate modeling and forecasting of space weather conditions, both which are important for design, and protection of our space-borne assets. In the current study, we utilize the Versatile Electron Radiation Belt (VERB) code, multi-spacecraft measurements, and a split-operator Kalman filter to recontructe the global state of the radiation belt system in the CRRES era and the current era. The reanalysis has revealed a never before seen 4-belt structure in the radiation belts during the March 1991 superstorm, and highlights several important aspects in regards to the the competition between the source, acceleration, loss, and transport of particles. In addition to the above, performing reanalysis in adiabatic coordinates relies on specification of the Earth's magnetic field, and associated observational, and model errors. We determine the observational errors for the Kalman filter directly from cross-spacecraft phase-space density (PSD) conjunctions, and obtain the error in VERB by comparison with reanalysis over a long time period. Specification of errors associated with several magnetic field models provides an important insight into the applicability of such models for radiation belt research. The comparison of CRRES area reanalysis with Van Allen Probe era reanalysis allows us to perform a global comparison of the dynamics of the radiation belts during different parts of the solar cycle and during different solar cycles. The data assimilative model is presently used to perform operational forecasts of the radiation belts (http://rbm.epss.ucla.edu/realtime-forecast/). ",

            "abstract": "In Southern California, it has long been understood that foehn-type Santa Ana winds are an important factor in the occurrence of large wildfires. Although a variety of anecdotal observations and statistical analyses have confirmed the importance of these winds to wildfire, particularly in the Fall months when Santa Ana winds overlap with dry fuels from summer drought, many of the details of those winds’ impacts on fire remain obscure.\nThis paper uses data regarding individual fires from California’s Fire and Resource Assessment Program database and a compilation of Santa Ana Wind days (SAW days) published by Abatzoglou et al. in 2013 to assess the relationship of Santa Ana winds to fire occurrence and size in Southern California. The analysis included 474 fires larger than 20 ha (~50 acres).that burned on the four Southern California national forests (Angeles, Cleveland, Los Padres and San Bernardino) between 1948 and 2010.\nOverall, just 10.3% of the fires started on SAW days, and 14.4% experienced at least one SAW day between start and containment dates. The impact of Santa Ana winds is greater, however, with increasing fire size. For fires > 4000 ha, 18.4% began on SAW days, with 30.4% experiencing at least one SAW day before containment. And 20% of fires > 20000 ha started on SAW days, with 50% including one or more SAW days. Fires beginning on SAW days were larger, with a mean of 6239 ha compared to 2150 ha for fires that began on non-SAW days.\nOnly 2% of the fires that began on SAW days were started by lightning, suggesting that the impact of Santa Ana winds on Southern California fire regimes may be enhanced by humans’ role in ignitions.",

The Landau resonant interactions became important for oblique whistler waves having a significant electric field component along the background magnetic field. Such interactions in the inhomogeneous magnetic field lead to parallel acceleration and to plateaus in the parallel (with respect to the background magnetic field) velocity component in the electron velocity distributions. We demonstrate that the observed electron energy related to the plateaus agrees with the energy required for resonant interaction with the simultaneously observed oblique whistler waves over a wide range of L-shells (from 3 to 6) in the outer radiation belt.",

The data are located on a 10 PB High Performance Data (HPD) Node that is integrated with a High Performance Computing (HPC) facility to enable a new style of Data-intensive in-situ analysis. Investigators can either log in via direct access to the data collections: access is also provided via modern standards-based web services.\nThe NCI integrated HPD/HPC facility is supported by a ‘village’ of partnerships. NCI itself operates as a formal partnership between the ANU and three major National Scientific Agencies: CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) and Geoscience Australia (GA). These same agencies are also the custodians of many of the national data collections hosted at NCI, and in partnership with other collaborating national and overseas organisations have agreed to work together to develop a shared data environment and use standards that enable interoperability between the collections, rather than isolating their collections as separate entities that each agency runs independently.\nTo effectively analyse these complex and large volume data sets, NCI has entered into a series of national and national partnerships with international agencies to provide world-class digital analytical environments that allow computational to be conducted and shared.\nThe ability for government and research to work in partnership at the NCI has been well established over the last decade, mainly with BoM, CSIRO, and GA.

Here, we describe a new \"dynamic\" flood mapping web‐tool that demonstrates the modeled effects of NNBF on flood hazard zones for the highly populated areas surrounding Jamaica Bay, New York City. The tool also provides information on damages from flooding as well as cost‐benefit analyses for NNBF adaptations for the bay. The project researchers are involved with development of a Jamaica Bay Coastal Master Plan, and the mapper will play an important role for increasing the public understanding of adaptation options. More broadly, dynamic flood mappers have many more possibilities than “static” mappers that simply add sea level rise onto pre‐defined flood levels and bathtub them over flood plains. Dynamic modeling can enable inclusion of the response of coastal systems, imposed human adaptation, as well as flooding by surge, tide and precipitation.",

            "abstract": "Although the volumes of high-silica rocks in submarine oceanic and supra-subduction zone environments are not well constrained, their common occurrence, field relations and compositions have led to various hypotheses suggesting that silicic intrusions (plagiogranites) in ophiolites formed by similar processes to high-silica volcanic rocks at mid-ocean ridge (MOR) or island arc environments. Geochemical attributes of andesite-rhyolite suites from MOR (East Pacific Rise, Juan de Fuca Ridge, Galapagos Spreading Center, Pacific–Antarctic Rise) and back-arc basins (Manus Basin, Lau Basin, East Scotia Ridge) show both similarities and differences to plagiogranitic suites (qtz. diorite-tonalite-trondhjemite) from ophiolites (Troodos and Semail). Both suites are commonly attributed to: extreme (>90%) fractional crystallization of basaltic melts; fractional crystallization coupled with assimilation of hydrated oceanic crust (AFC); or partial melting of preexisting crust. Normalized incompatible trace element patterns show either highly elevated, relatively flat patterns with negative Eu and Sr anomalies similar to high silica volcanics or have complimentary patterns with low abundance, more depleted patterns with positive Eu and Sr anomalies. None of the mechanisms, however, provide a consistent explanation for the compositional and isotopic variations that are observed among plagiogranites. In fact, ophiolitic plagiogranites can have at least two petrogenetic signatures – one indicative of a MORB parent and another that has been related to later, off-axis formation associated with supra-subduction zone magmatism. Based on thermal gradient experiments, the systematic changes in Fe and Si stable isotope ratios with differentiation observed in ophiolite and MOR high-silica suites may result from melt-mineral reactions within a temperature gradient near the boundaries of MOR magma lenses. Comparative major element, trace element and isotopic data will be presented from MOR, BAB and ophiolites to address questions of their origins. Although the mechanism(s) by which plagiogranite bodies form and their relationship to andesitic to rhyolitic lavas still remains enigmatic geochemical comparisons between them provide important clues toward understanding their petrotectonic origins.",

The aim of this study is to know the effect of local factors in spatial and temporal variability of solar radiation in a tropical mountain valley in Colombia. We estimated the potential solar radiation on simplified schemes of valleys by the means of theoretical exercises with different slopes and aspects for further analysis. Despite the closeness of the studied area to the line of Ecuador where the annual variation of radiation is almost zero we detected some differences. Changes were found in solar radiation on different valley schemes in terms of hours of sunshine and total energy that reaches the surface depending on the slope, the orientation of the slopes and the diurnal variation of the solar altitude angle. Results suggest that different aspects lead changes in the annual insolation up to 4 MJ / m2 on June and a lag of about two hours in the diurnal cycle of insolation in the southeast (135°) and northwest (315°) facing peaks with the highest radiation around 8 hours after sunrise. The annual variation cycle, related to the slope, does not show major changes, but the diurnal cycle of the cells with the major slope has the lower insolation with a maximum of about one hour before the other cells. Finally, a better understanding of the real dynamics of sunshine in the Valley of Aburrá - Colombia is possible knowing the variation of the annual cycle and the diurnal cycle of insolation in a synthetic valley reliant on the different aspects and slopes allows. This represents an opportunity to improve urban planning and rural productive activities that depends directly on the availability of energy.",

            "abstract": "The importance of unsteady flow on sediment transport rates has long been recognized. However, the majority of sediment transport models were developed under steady flow conditions that did not account for changing bed morphologies and sediment transport during flood events. More recent research has used laboratory data and field data to quantify the influence of hysteresis on bedload transport and adjust transport models. In this research, these new methods are combined to improve further the accuracy of bedload transport rate quantification and prediction.\nThe first approach defined reference shear stresses for hydrograph rising and falling limbs, and used these values to predict total and fractional transport rates during a hydrograph. From this research, a parameter for improving transport predictions during unsteady flows was developed. The second approach applied a maximum likelihood procedure to fit a bedload rating curve to measurements from a number of different coarse bed rivers. Parameters defining the rating curve were optimized for values that maximized the conditional probability of producing the measured bedload transport rate. Bedload sample magnitude was fit to a gamma distribution, and the probability of collecting N particles in a sampler during a given time step was described with a Poisson probability density function. Both approaches improved estimates of total transport during large flow events when compared to existing methods and transport models. Recognizing and accounting for the changes in transport parameters over time frames on the order of a flood or flood sequence influences the choice of method for parameter calculation in sediment transport calculations. Those methods that more tightly link the changing flow rate and bed mobility have the potential to improve bedload transport rates.",

            "abstract": "The Mulock and Skelton Glaciers are large outlet glaciers that flow through the Transantarctic Mountains and into the Ross Ice Shelf. A regional seismic deployment in the central Transantarctic Mountains (TAM) in 1999-2000 led to the identification of 63 events in the vicinity of Mulock and Skelton Glaciers [Bannister and Kennett, 2002]. A more recent study utilizing seismic data collected as part of the POLENET/A-NET and AGAP projects during 2009 again identified significant seismicity associated with these glaciers and suggested that many of these events were icequakes based on their shallow depths [Lough, 2014]. These two glaciers represent the most seismically active regions in the TAM aside from the well-studied David Glacier region [Danesi et al, 2007; Zoet et al., 2012]. In addition, many of the icequakes from this region have magnitude ML > 2.5, in contrast to most glacial events that are generally of smaller magnitude.\nUsing the waveforms of previously identified icequakes as templates, nearby POLENET/A-NET, AGAP, and GSN seismic stations were scanned using a cross-correlation method to find similar waveforms. We then used a relative location algorithm to determine high-precision locations and depths. The use of regional velocity models derived from recent seismic studies facilitates accurate absolute locations that we interpret in the context of the local geological and glacial features. The icequakes are concentrated in heavily crevassed regions associated with steep bedrock topography, likely icefalls. Future work will focus on determining whether these events are associated with stick-slip events at the bed of the glacier and/or crevasse formation near the surface. In addition the temporal pattern of seismicity will also be examined to search for repeating icequakes, which have been identified at the base of several other glaciers.",

            "abstract": "Drylands have been found playing an important role regulating the seasonality of global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Precipitation is a primary control of ecosystem carbon exchanges in drylands where a large proportion of the annual total rainfall arrives through a small number of episodic precipitation events. While a large number of studies use the concept of “precipitation pulses” to explore the effects of short-term precipitation events on dryland ecosystem function, few have specifically evaluated the importance of the diurnal timing of these events. The primary goal of this study was to determine how the diurnal timing of rainfall events impacts land-atmosphere net ecosystem CO2 exchanges (NEE) and ecosystem respiration in drylands. Our research leverages a substantial and existing long-term database (AmeriFlux) that describes NEE, Reco and meteorological conditions at 11 sites situated in different dryland ecosystems in South West America. All sites employ the eddy covariance technique to measure land-atmosphere the CO2 exchange rates between atmosphere and ecosystem. Data collected at these sites range from 4 to 10 years, totaling up to 73 site-years. We found that episodic precipitation events stimulate not only vegetation photosynthesis but also ecosystem respiration. Specifically, the morning precipitation events decrease photosynthesis function at daytime and increase ecosystem respiration at nighttime; the afternoon precipitation events do not stimulate ecosystem photosynthesis at daytime, while stimulate ecosystem respiration; the night precipitations suppress photosynthesis at daytime, and enhance ecosystem respiration at nighttime.",

            "abstract": "The Integrated Compartment Model (ICM) was developed as part of the 2017 Coastal Master Plan modeling effort. It is a comprehensive and numerical hydrodynamic model coupled to various geophysical process models. Simplifying assumptions related to some of the flow dynamics are applied to increase the computational efficiency of the model. The model can be used to provide insights about coastal ecosystems and evaluate restoration strategies. It builds on existing tools where possible and incorporates newly developed tools where necessary. It can perform decadal simulations (~ 50 years) across the entire Louisiana coast. It includes several improvements over the approach used to support the 2012 Master Plan, such as: additional processes in the hydrology, vegetation, wetland and barrier island morphology subroutines, increased spatial resolution, and integration of previously disparate models into a single modeling framework. The ICM includes habitat suitability indices (HSIs) to predict broad spatial patterns of habitat change, and it provides an additional integration to a dynamic fish and shellfish community model which quantitatively predicts potential changes in important fishery resources. It can be used to estimate the individual and cumulative effects of restoration and protection projects on the landscape, including a general estimate of water levels associated with flooding. The ICM is also used to examine possible impacts of climate change and future environmental scenarios (e.g. precipitation, Eustatic sea level rise, subsidence, tropical storms, etc.) on the landscape and on the effectiveness of restoration projects. The ICM code is publically accessible, and coastal restoration and protection groups interested in planning-level modeling are encouraged to explore its utility as a computationally efficient tool to examine ecosystem response to future physical or ecological changes, including the implementation of restoration and protection strategies.",

            "abstract": "Lassen Peak, located in northern California, last erupted in 1915 producing hybrid black dacite containing xenocrystic olivine grains with morphologically complex reaction rims of orthopyroxene. These rims are interpreted to have grown during magma mixing/mingling of admixed basaltic andesite and dacite reservoir magma prior to eruption. Reaction rim growth rates were determined from a series of hydrothermal experiments performed on starting materials consisting of powdered natural dacite pumice from the 1915 eruption and ~5 wt. % of Fo85 olivine separated from a spinel lherzolite xenolith (UM-5) from Kilbourne Hole, NM to constrain the length of time between magma recharge and eruption. Time series experiments were performed with run durations of 50, 100, 200, 400, and 600 hours at 50 and 100 MPa, 825oC and 875oC. The experiments produced a range in reaction rim growth rates where rim thickness generally increased with time. Average rim growth rate for each series is as follows: 0.031 µm²h-1 for 50 MPa at 825oC, 0.010 µm²h-1 for 50 MPa at 875oC, 0.158 µm²h-1 for 100 MPa at 825oC, and 0.088 µm²h-1 for 100 MPa at 875oC. Overall, the 100 MPa experiments resulted in faster growth rates and thicker reaction rims than the 50 MPa experiments. At a given pressure, the higher temperature (875 oC) experiments show slower average growth rates, but thicker reaction rims than the 825oC equivalents. This suggests that growth rate is not constant over time, but likely is more rapid at the early stages of the experiments/heating event, and then slows over time. Reaction rim widths on 100 olivine grains from samples of black dacite were determined by analysis of SEM BSE images and average 26.1 ± 21.7 µm. This average rim width corresponds to a range of mixing durations of 5.8 months (100 MPa, 825oC) to 93 months (50 MPa, 875oC). Average reaction duration of 10.6 months (at 100 MPa, 875oC) is most consistent with our previous experimental work on the 1915 dacite. Reaction rim widths measured on olivine from andesitic enclaves in the black dacite tend to be ~2-3 times thicker than olivine imaged from black dacite samples. Histograms of reaction rim width abundance versus calculated mixing duration suggests mafic magma was episodically injected into dacitic crystal mush over a sustained period of time at roughly 3, 8, and 16 months prior to the 1915 eruption.",

Some events are newsworthy, devastating, and visibly obvious at a global scale, others are merely regional curiosities. Regardless of the scope and significance of any one event, it is likely that multiple GIBS layers can be viewed to provide a multispectral, dataset-based view of the event.\nTo facilitate linking between the discrete event and the representative dataset imagery, NASA's Earth Observatory Group has developed a prototype application programming interface (API): the Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker (EONET). EONET supports an API model that allows users to retrieve event-specific metadata--date/time, location, and type (wildfire, storm, etc.)--and web service layer-specific metadata which can be used to link to event-relevant dataset imagery in GIBS.\nGIBS' ability to ingest many near real time datasets, combined with its growing archive of past imagery, means that API users will be able to develop client applications that not only show ongoing events but can also look at imagery from before and after. In our poster, we will present the API and show examples of its use.",

It is currently being developed by Deep Space Industries (DSI) as a mission concept that enables a broad participation in the scientific exploration of small bodies - the Mothership mission architecture. A Mothership shall deliver third-party nano-sats, experiments and instruments to Near Earth Asteroids (NEOs), comets or moons. The Mothership service includes delivery of nano-sats, communication to Earth and visuals of the asteroid surface and surrounding area. The Mothership is designed to carry about 10 nano-sats, based upon a variation of the Cubesat standard, with some flexibility on the specific geometry. The Deep Space Nano-Sat reference design is a 14.5 cm cube, which accommodates the same volume as a traditional 3U CubeSat. To reduce cost, Mothership is designed as a secondary payload aboard launches to GTO. DSI is offering slots for nano-sats to individual customers. This enables organizations with relatively low operating budgets to closely examine an asteroid with highly specialized sensors of their own choosing and carry out experiments in the proximity of or on the surface of an asteroid, while the nano-sats can be built or commissioned by a variety of smaller institutions, companies, or agencies. While the overall Mothership mission will have a financial volume somewhere between a European Space Agencies’ (ESA) S- and M-class mission for instance, it can be funded through a number of small and individual funding sources and programs, hence avoiding the processes associated with traditional space exploration missions. DSI has been able to identify a significant interest in the planetary science and nano-satellite communities.",

These volcanic rocks cover an area in excess of 1,200,000 km2 and can reach a maximum thickness of 1,700 m. The PEVP is composed mainly of tholeiitic basalts and subordinately by andesites and rhyolites/quartz-latites. Recently new models considering physical characteristics of the lava flow stratigraphy on both sides, Africa and South America, have been built providing a new vision of the volcanic stratigraphy and flow morphologies inside the province. This work presents a 3D model of the volcanic sequence at theTorres Syncline (Brazil). The 3D model was build using the PETREL E&P Software Platform. Geological sections based on field data and Log data from Paraná Basin (Gama-ray and soniclogs) were used to build the model. The Torres Syncline is a tectonic structure located in southern Brazil with the main orientation NW-SE. In Torres Syncline the basal portion is characterized by pahoehoe lava flows in a compound braided architecture, followed by rubbly lavas in a tabular classic architecture, and in the upper portions silicic units interbedded with basaltic lavas. The central portion of the volcanic pile is characterized by thick tabular lavas with rubbly tops (25-50 m thick). These flows have an internal structure divided in four parts: a smooth vesicular base, aphanitic massive cores with irregular joints, upper vesicular portion and a rubbly top. This unit is thicker along of the Torres Syncline and represents the main phase of the volcanism. Silicic units occur in the upper parts of the PEVP stratigraphy and include lava domes interbedded with rubbly flows and thick tabular flows. The Torres Syncline and Huab constituted one Basin features single active structure in the Early Cretaceous and during the main rifting phase. The onset of the volcanism was characterized by low effusion rate eruptions over the paleoerg, forming pahoehoe flow fields. The main phase of volcanism is build up by thick tabular rubbly pahoehoe flows, formed by larger volume sequences (slightly high effusion rates), that cover the initial pahoehoe flows. At the upper portion of the sequence, the volcanism is more differentiated forming silicic lavas.",

            "abstract": "As the Arctic sea ice thins, summer ice continues to shrink in its area, and multi-year ice becomes rarer, winter ice is not disappearing from the Arctic Basin. Rather, it is ever more dominated by first year ice. And each summer, as the total coverage withdraws, the first year ice is able travel faster and farther, carrying any ice-rafted material with it. Micro-organisms, sediments, pollutants and river runoff all move across the Arctic each summer and are deposited hundreds of kilometers from their origins. Analyzing Arctic sea ice drift patterns in the context of the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of the Arctic nations raises concerns about the changing fate of “alien” ice which forms within one country’s EEZ, then drifts and melts in another country’s EEZ. We have developed a new data set from satellite-based ice-drift data that allows us to track groups of ice “pixels” forward from their origin to their destination, or backwards from their melting location to their point of formation. The software has been integrated with model output to extend the tracking of sea ice to include climate projections. Results indicate, for example, that Russian sea ice dominates “imports” to the EEZ of Norway, as expected, but with increasing ice mobility it is also is exported into the EEZs of other countries, including Canada and the United States. Regions of potential conflict are identified, including several national borders with extensive and/or changing transboundary sea ice transport. These data are a starting point for discussion of transborder questions raised by “alien” ice and the material it may import from one nation’s EEZ to another’s.",

The CATS payload has been operating since early February 2015 from the International Space Station (ISS). CATS was designed to operate for six months, and up to three years, providing a combination of operational science, in-space technology demonstration, and technology risk reduction for future Earth Science missions.\nOne of the primary project goals of CATS is to demonstrate technology in support of future space-based lidar mission development. The CATS instrument has been demonstrating the high repetition rate laser and photon counting detection approach to lidar observations, in contrast to the low repetition rate, high energy technique employed by CALIPSO. Due to this technique, cloud and aerosol profile data exhibit high spatial and temporal resolution, which was never before possible from a space-based platform. Another important science goal of the CATS-FO project is accurate determination of aerosol type on a global scale. CATS provided the first space-based depolarization measurements at multiple wavelengths (532 and 1064 nm), and first measurements at 1064 nm from space. The ratio of the depolarization measurements at these two wavelengths enables significant improvement in aerosol typing.\nThe CATS retrievals at 1064 nm also provide improvements to detecting aerosols above clouds. The CATS layer identification algorithm is a threshold-based layer detection method that uses the 1064 nm attenuated scattering ratio and also includes a routine to identify clouds embedded within aerosol layers. This technique allows CATS to detect the full extent of the aerosol layers above the cloud, and differentiate these two layers so that the optical properties can be more accurately determined.",

            "abstract": "As a way to understand the characteristics of the earthquake source, studies of source parameters (such as radiated energy and stress drop) and their scaling are important. In order to estimate source parameters reliably, often we must use appropriate source spectrum models and the omega-square model is most frequently used. In this model, the spectrum is flat in lower frequencies and the falloff is proportional to the angular frequency squared. However, Some studies (e.g. Allmann and Shearer, 2009; Yagi et al., 2012) reported that the exponent of the high frequency falloff is other than -2. Therefore, in this study we estimate the source parameters using a spectral model for which the falloff exponent is not fixed.\nWe analyze the mainshock and larger aftershocks of the 2008 Iwate-Miyagi Nairiku earthquake. Firstly, we calculate the P wave and SH wave spectra using empirical Green functions (EGF) to remove the path effect (such as attenuation) and site effect. For the EGF event, we select a smaller earthquake that is highly-correlated with the target event. In order to obtain the stable results, we calculate the spectral ratios using a multitaper spectrum analysis (Prieto et al., 2009). Then we take a geometric mean from multiple stations. Finally, using the obtained spectra ratios, we perform a grid search to determine the high frequency falloffs, as well as corner frequency of both of events.\nOur results indicate the high frequency falloff exponent is often less than 2.0. We do not observe any regional, focal mechanism, or depth dependencies for the falloff exponent. In addition, our estimated corner frequencies and falloff exponents are consistent between the P wave and SH wave analysis. In our presentation, we show differences in estimated source parameters using a fixed omega-square model and a model allowing variable high-frequency falloff.",

Thus, we conducted high P-T, isothermal decompression experiments to investigate the affects of crystal content on percolation threshold development in low viscosity melts. We use these experiments to examine the mechanical effects phenocrysts and microlites impose on vesiculation during magma ascent and to observe the effects of decompression–induced crystallization on permeability development and magma degassing. We performed experiments using powdered natural K-phonolite (55 wt.% SiO2; Vesuvius EU2) seeded with andesine crystals to approximate alkalic magma with 20 and 40 vol. % phenocrysts. We performed a second series using a natural basaltic andesite (54 wt.% SiO2; Westdahl, Alaska) to approximate a mafic magma forming abundant microlites during ascent and degassing. First, we saturated the experiments with water at 100 MPa, holding the feldspar-seeded K-phonolite at 900°C for three hours and the basaltic andesite at 950°C for 24 hours to initiate crystal growth. We decompressed the K-phonolite step-wise at a rate of 0.25 MPa s-1 and the basaltic andesite continuously at 0.125 MPa s-1, with ending pressures between 75 and 25 MPa. We measured the permeability of the samples with a bench-top permeameter and calculated the Darcian (k1) and inertial (k2) permeabilities using the Forchheimer equation.\nIn order to understand the effect of crystals on the percolation threshold (Φc), we compare our results to crystal-free experiments. K-phonolite seeded with 20 vol.% phenocrysts develops permeability at Φc = 44 vol.%. K-phonolite seeded with 40 vol.% phenocrysts are permeable at Φc = 53 vol. %. Both thresholds are significantly less than Φc determined for crystal-free samples (Φc = 75 vol. %). The basaltic andesite developed permeability at Φc = 29 vol.%. This finding is significant because our experiments indicate Φc > 63 vol.% in crystal-free, vesiculating basaltic andesite melts. Our preliminary results indicate that phenocrysts and microlites significantly lower the percolation threshold of low viscosity melts.",

The uplift history of the 4 km high Plateau remains uncertain with paleoelevation studies along the CAP suggesting a complex, non-uniform uplift history. As part of the Central Andean Uplift and the Geodynamics of High Topography (CAUGHT) project, we use surface waves measured from ambient noise and two-plane wave tomography to image the S-wave velocity structure of the crust and upper mantle to investigate the upper mantle component of plateau uplift. We observe three main features in our S-wave velocity model including (1), a high velocity slab (2), a low velocity anomaly above the slab where the slab changes dip from near horizontal to a normal dip, and (3), a high-velocity feature in the mantle above the slab that extends along the length of the Altiplano from the base of the Moho to a depth of ~120 km with the highest velocities observed under Lake Titicaca. A strong spatial correlation exists between the lateral extent of this high-velocity feature beneath the Altiplano and the lower elevations of the Altiplano basin suggesting a potential relationship. Non-uniqueness in our seismic models preclude uniquely constraining this feature as an uppermost mantle feature bellow the Moho or as a connected eastward dipping feature extending up to 300 km in the mantle as seen in deeper mantle tomography studies. Determining if the high velocity feature represents a small lithospheric root or a delaminating lithospheric root extending ~300 km into the mantle requires more integration of observations, but either interpretation shows a strong geodynamic connection with the uppermost mantle and the current topography of the northern CAP.",

            "abstract": "Between the Black and Caspian Seas, the Greater Caucasus Mountains (GC) delineate the northern margin of the Arabia-Eurasia collision zone. The role of subduction in formation of the GC is not widely recognized, despite patterns of subcrustal seismicity attesting to its importance at the E end of the range. The GC currently absorbs most orogen-perpendicular plate convergence (11 mm/yr, 70% of total), but its tectonic evolution relation to subduction remain unclear. Proposed models include 1) subduction of an ~400 km wide backarc ocean basin followed by slab breakoff under the W end of the range; 2) loss of a lithospheric root followed by buoyancy-driven uplift; and 3) closure of a small (~100 km?) basin with no/minimal subduction. Patterns of modern seismicity, exhumation, and shortening are most consistent with the subduction/slab breakoff model, suggesting the western GC may capture the surface expression of processes associated with recent slab breakoff.\nEach model of the GC makes specific predictions for the amount of shortening within the orogen, with the subduction/breakoff model predicting large magnitudes of convergence. Here we estimate orogenic shortening by balancing mass along several, orogen-perpendicular, crustal-scale cross sections across the GC. First we estimate the original length of undeformed crust by comparing the modern deformed volume (determined from modern topography and moho depth and assuming no net erosional loss) with hypothesized end-member original crustal thicknesses (based on seismic data in the Eastern Black Sea and Scythian platform). These end-member assumptions allow shortening magnitudes as great as ~700 km (12 km-thick oceanic crust), and as small as ~100 km (39 km-thick Scythian margin). Second, we use line-length balanced crustal-scale geologic cross sections to estimate shortening in the western and central GC. We generated these sections using previously published 1:200k geologic maps and our own focused field observations. These sections contain ~230 km of total shortening. Based on area-balanced cross sections along the same transects, this magnitude of shortening falls within the expected range of the subduction/ slab breakoff model, and is greater than might be expected from either buoyancy driven uplift or closure of a small basin.",

The Pacific Plate subducts beneath the eastern North Island along the Hikurangi Trough. Crustal deformation is strongly affected by coupling on the subduction interface, and strike-slip faulting and back-arc volcanism in the upper plate. We present strain rates over the last 20 years using a new methodology based on Vertical Derivatives of Horizontal Stress (VDoHS) rates. VDoHS rates, calculated by solving the force balance equations at the Earth’s surface, are the most spatially compact surface expressions of subsurface deformation sources. We assess our results in the context of distribution of interseismic coupling on the subduction interface and highlight areas of forearc extension related to possible forearc gravitational collapse. Instead of a expected rifting signal, we find strong contraction within parts of the Taupo Volcanic Zone, indicating that non-tectonic effects from magmatic and/or hydrothermal processes must influence deformation.\nWe compare the 20 years deformation with the pattern of SSEs and transients. SSEs characteristics vary along the Hikurangi margin: in depth, duration, size and frequency. Recently small, deep SSEs have been identified downdip from larger ones at the central margin. Are there other small SSEs at Hikurangi that have gone undetected? We map all SSEs and transients spanning the last 6.5 years detectable using VDoHS rates.\nVDoHS rates also reveal the boundaries between the locked and unlocked portions of the megathrust, and we can track how this varies throughout the SSE cycle. Above the locked interface, the pull of the subducted plate generates shear tractions in the overlying plate in the direction of subduction, while above the creeping section shear tractions are in the opposite direction. We show a pattern of locking and unlocking signal along the Hikurangi margin and how this pattern changes with SSEs.",

Far from dependable, this region’s supply of winter precipitation is highly variable and often characterized by hydrologic opposites – droughts and floods. Predicting future precipitation and hydrologic dynamics requires a paleoperspective. Here, we present an up-to-date synthesis of hydroclimatic variability over the past 30,000 years. A variety of terrestrial-based studies are examined and compared to understand patterns of regional hydroclimatic change. This comparison is extended into the San Joaquin Basin of California where future climate change will impact the region’s agricultural stability and economy. Particularly interesting is the apparent role that Pacific sea surface temperatures (SSTs) play in modulating the region’s hydroclimate over a variety of timescales. Are past periods of above average Pacific SSTs analogs for future global warming? If yes, the region might expect an increase in winter precipitation as SSTs rise in response to global warming. However, how this potential precipitation increase is manifest is unknown. For example, will the intensity of precipitation events increase and thus present increased flood hazards and diminished freshwater capture? Finally, we present evidence for changes in the source of winter precipitation over time as well as ecological responses to past hydrologic change.",

            "abstract": "Studies of stream nutrient dynamics have often focused on the influence of a single potentially limiting nutrient; however, it has become increasingly evident that ecosystems are constrained by the supply of numerous limiting resources. These resources may vary seasonally as a function of temperature, sunlight, and input of carbon and nutrients from upstream or terrestrial sources. We used multiple approaches, including plateau and TASCC nutrient additions, as well as analysis of diel nitrate dynamics as three different and complementary measures of nutrient demand/limitation in New Hope Creek, a third order stream in the Duke Forest of North Carolina over the course of one year. Nitrate-N concentrations were relatively high during the winter, spring, and summer months ranging from 105 – 518 and averaging 383 µg/L between January – August. During this time frame there was low demand for and limited uptake of added nitrate during plateau or TASCC additions (i.e., addition of N did not stimulate increased N uptake) although there was processing of background N evident from diel N and oxygen analyses. During autumn litterfall ecosystem respiration increased strongly and nitrate-N concentrations dropped precipitously, ranging from 9 – 34 and averaging 23 µg/L between September – December. During this period of low in-stream nitrate-N, demand for and uptake of added nitrate was high with maximum uptake rates of 560 µg/m2/min. This highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between nutrient supply and demand and the need to determine multiple resource controls over system processing. We also suggest that nutrient addition experiments need to be interpreted within the context of the supply and demand of multiple potentially limiting resources and the that the temporal dynamics of these relationships should be considered.",

            "abstract": "A new type of sap flow gauge was developed to measure transpiration from herbaceous plants using a modified heat pulse technique. Gauges were fabricated using 3D-printing technology and low-cost electronics to keep the materials cost under $20 (U.S.) per sensor. Each gauge consisted of small-diameter needle probes fastened to a 3D-printed frame. One needle contained a resistance heater to provide a 6 to 8 second heat pulse while the other probes measured the resultant temperature increase at two distances from the heat source. The data acquisition system for the gauges was built from a low-cost Arduino microcontroller. The system read the gauges every 10 minutes and stored the results on a SD card. Different numerical techniques were evaluated for estimating sap velocity from the heat pulse data – including analytical solutions and parameter estimation approaches . Prototype gauges were tested in the greenhouse on containerized corn and sunflower. Sap velocities measured by the gauges were compared to independent gravimetric measurements of whole plant transpiration. Results showed the system could measure daily transpiration to within 3% of the gravimetric measurements. Excellent agreement was observed when two gauges were attached the same stem. Accuracy was not affected by rapidly changing transpiration rates observed under partly cloudy conditions. The gauge-based estimates of stem thermal properties suggested the system may also detect the onset of water stress. A field study showed the gauges could run for 1 to 2 weeks on a small battery pack. Sap flow measurements on multiple corn stems were scaled up by population to estimate field-scale transpiration. During full canopy cover, excellent agreement was observed between the scaled-up sap flow measurements and reference crop evapotranspiration calculated from weather data. Data also showed promise as a way to estimate real-time canopy resistance required for model verification and development. Given the low-cost, low-power, and open-source characteristics of the system; the technology is well suited for applications requiring large number of gauges (spatial scaling or treatment comparisons). While early work was done with agricultural crops, the approach is well suited for other species such as riverine shrubs.",

            "abstract": "Mountain streams are characterized by steep gradients and wide grain size distributions that include fine, more mobile sediment, and large immobile boulders. These large boulders are partially submerged for most of the year, but become fully submerged at higher flows, exhibiting low and high relative submergence, respectively. Through their interaction with the approach turbulent flow, the boulders modify the surrounding bed shear stress field, thus altering the timing, magnitude and pathways of bedload patterns. The goal of this study is twofold: (1) to identify the dominant vortex structures around the boulders at high and low relative submergence; and (2) assess the effects of these vortex structures on the surrounding bed shear stress field. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to interrogate the turbulent flow field around a spherical boulder mounted atop a flat rough bed under high and low relative submergence conditions. Under high relative submergence, a pair of arch vortices and inboard vortices with the same sense of rotation dominated the boulder wake. For the low relative submergence, a pair of strong von-Karman vortices developed within the boulder wake region. The arch and von-Karman vortices observed for the high and low relative submergence conditions affected the magnitude and the directionality of the bed shear stress vector in plan view, by directing it towards and away from the boulder centerline, respectively. The reversal of the bed shear stress vector directionality likely promotes a reversal of incoming sediment deposition from the boulder wake to the stoss region for high and low relative submergence, respectively. This reversal was verified by prior observations of bedload particle deposition around the boulder. The findings of this research underline the effects that large, immobile boulders have on the surrounding turbulent flow and bed load particle movement with important implications on sediment management in mountain streams.",

            "abstract": "Extending from Virginia to east Texas in the southeastern United States, managed pine forests are an important component of the region’s carbon cycle. One objective of the Pine Integrated Network: Education, Mitigation, and Adaptation project (PINEMAP) is to improve estimates of how ecosystem carbon pools respond to the management strategies used to increase the growth of loblolly pine forests. Experimental studies (108 total) that had historically been used to understand forest productivity and stand dynamics by university-forest industry cooperatives have now been measured for the carbon stored in the trees, coarse-wood, forest floor, understory and soils to 1-meter (0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-50 cm, and 50-100 cm). The age of the studied forests ranged from 4-26 years at the time of sampling, with 26 years very near the period when these forests are commonly harvested. The study sites encapsulated a wide regional range in precipitation (1080 mm -1780 mm) and potential evapotranspiration (716 mm – 1200 mm). The most prevalent three soil orders measured were Ultisols (62%), Alfisols (19%), and Spodosols (10%) with Entisols, Inceptisols and 1 Histosol making up the remainder (9%).\n<span\">Across all study sites, 455 experimental plots were measured. The plots had as a treatment either fertilization, competition control, and stand density control (thinning), including every possible combination of treatments and also ‘no treatment’. The most common treatment regime, at 36% of the total number of plots, was the combination of competition control, fertilization, and thinning. The distribution of treatments relative to soils and climate prevented a simple analysis of single treatment effects and instead necessitated an examination how the carbon accumulation rate in wood, which is commonly measured and modeled in these forests, corresponded to the response of other C pools (e.g. forest floor and soil).

            "abstract": "The Digital Terrain Model (DTM) in forest areas is invaluable information for various environmental, hydrological and ecological studies, for example, watershed delineation, vegetation canopy height, water dynamic modeling, forest biomass and carbon estimations. There are few solutions to extract bare-earth Digital Elevation Model information. Airborne lidar systems are widely and successfully used for estimating bare-earth DEMs with centimeter-order accuracy and high spatial resolution. However, expensive cost of operation and small image coverage prevent the use of airborne lidar sensors for large- or global-scale. Although IceSAT/GLAS (Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite/Geoscience Laser Altimeter System) lidar data sets have been available for global DTM estimate with relatively lower cost, the large footprint size of 70 m and the interval of 172 m are insufficient for various applications.\nIn this study we propose to extract higher resolution bare-earth DEM over vegetated areas from the combination of interferometric complex coherence from single-pass TanDEM-X (TDX) data at HH polarization and Digital Surface Model (DSM) derived from high-resolution WorldView (WV) images by means of random volume over ground (RVoG) model. The RVoG model is a widely and successfully used model for polarimetric SAR interferometry (Pol-InSAR) forest canopy height inversion. The bare-earth DEM is obtained by complex volume decorrelation in the RVoG model with the DSM estimated by stereo-photogrammetric technique. Forest canopy height can be estimated by subtracting the estimated bare-earth model from the DSM. Finally, the DTM from airborne lidar system was used to validate the bare-earth DEM and forest canopy height estimates.",

            "abstract": "The DFDP-1A and DFDP-1B boreholes drilled in 2011 enabled the collection of samples of unaltered Alpine Fault Zone rock. We present laboratory measurements of the elastic properties of these samples, as well as protoliths collected at outcrops. These data were collected with a unique non-contacting laser ultrasonic system, and transducers under a range of pressure conditions representative of the upper-crust. Based on the laser measurements we conclude that there is strong anisotropy in the foliated protoliths, particularly in the protomylonites. We also show that even at core scale, the anisotropy is scale dependent (there are systematic relationships between wavelength and mineral foliation). For the cataclasites, preliminary data show that elastic wave anisotropy decreases as we approach the Principal Slip Zone, in the two boreholes. The P-wave velocities exhibit a high pressure dependence for the borehole samples, meaning that most of the cracks are closed before an effective pressure of 5MPa, reducing the elastic anisotropy. However, on a cataclasite sample, the S-wave velocity measurements, polarized perpendicular and parallel to the fractures, exhibit weak anisotropy (γ=13%) at 20MPa, even when the P-wave velocity - pressure curve displays an asymptotic shape. This observation probably indicates that elastic anisotropy results from preferred mineral orientation rather than fractures. The elastic wave measurements are complemented with petrographical, XRD, XRF, SEM and CT scan analyses to understand the source of the elastic wave anisotropic behavior in the Alpine Fault damaged zone. Finally, the laboratory data are compared to the P-wave sonic log to understand the effect of elastic wave anisotropy, fluid pressures and mineralogy.",

            "abstract": "The August 24, 2014 South Napa Mw6.0 earthquake ruptured to the north along the West Napa fault, producing strong shaking in the deep sediments (~1000 m) of the Napa Valley. Aftershock locations define the roughly north-northwest striking fault plane, but details regarding the dip of the fault and the strike of the northernmost section of the fault remain less certain. Preliminary inversions based on the inversion of broadband data from the BDSN, PBO GPS, and InSAR observations show a 13 km long rupture initiating at a depth of 11 km and propagating unilaterally to the northwest and up-dip (Dreger et al., 2015), however this kinematic finite-source model assumes a single planar fault. Field reconnaissance and LiDAR imaging reveals a complex system of sub-parallel faults at the surface. The main western branch, which had the largest surface offsets, shows a marked change in strike approximately 9 km north of the epicenter (Bray et al., 2014). In addition, there is evidence of surface offsets on eastern branches of the West Napa fault system (Bray et al., 2014). Whether this complexity persists, or how the faults may link at depth, is an open question. However, based on the limited preliminary dataset of Dreger et al (2015), we conclude that the fault dip is nearly vertical. In this study we investigate complex fault models that account for changing strike, and en echelon west dipping faults that may join at hypocentral depth by means of finite-source inversion of regional broadband, local strong-motion and GPS and InSAR geodetic data sets. We build on the data set used in the prelimary model of Dreger et al, (2015) by incorporating local strong motion waveform data as well as the static displacement dataset of Funning (2015). For the strong motion data, we incorporate stations located on “rock” (Vs30 > 700 m/s). Green’s functions for the “rock” stations are computed with a modified Gil7 model to account for the lower velocity in the upper 30 meters. Preliminary results from a kinked model in which the strike 10 km north of the epicenter rotates 20 degrees more northerly reveal a slip model that is highly consistent with the results of the Dreger model in terms of the directivity and area of slip, but the modified Gil7 model tends to produce higher peak slips around 120 cm.",

            "abstract": "Global climate during Quaternary and Late Pliocene (present–3.1 Ma) is characterized by alternating glacial and interglacial conditions. Recently, several interglacials have been identified as warmer than others, like 9, 11, 31, 49, 55, 77, 87 and 91, and are termed as “Superinterglacials”. Our proposed theory associates these superinterglacials with variations in the behavior of the Northern Hemisphere (NH) ice sheets with respect to the Southern Hemisphere (SH) ice sheets. At lower eccentricities, with the effect of precession being minimal, the NH ice sheets vary in-phase with SH. At higher eccentricities, NH ice sheets vary out-of-phase with SH ice sheets and are forced by precession driven local insolation changes.\nModel results indicate that during periods of low eccentricity, favorable forcing (high obliquity, high CO2) leads to unusually long interglacial conditions in both NH and SH. Using an ensemble of GCM simulations covering MIS 11, 31 and 49 we show that SH ice-sheets follow boreal summer insolation at lower eccentricities, switching to austral summer insolation at higher eccentricities. This switch provides the necessary orbital forcing for prolonged interglacial climates, much longer than expected from global oxygen isotope records. The prolonged warm conditions in the SH preconditions the poles to produce a large response during the superinterglacials. Recent paleodata studies have shown the existence of such extra-long interglacials in the NH during MIS 15-13 (preceding MIS 11) using grain-size records from Chinese loess (Q Hao, 2015). In this study we work with a collection of paleoclimate records though Pleistocene and correlate with our modeling results. Global records such as benthic δ18O capture the integrated signals of ice volume from both hemispheres, making it difficult to isolate the behaviour of the NH and SH ice sheets. Hence we focus on paleodata records, which capture the NH and SH ice volume signals individually, like the Chinese loess records serving as a proxy for Arctic climate variability or benthic records from Shackleton site (IODP U1385) which provides a long term continuous record of the SH signal. Using combination of model results and paleodata, we analyze future climate trends during astronomical analogues of the superinterglacials like MIS 11 and 31.",

            "abstract": "The formation of cellular magnetic dipoles by chain assemblies of nearly equidimensional, stable single domain magnetite nanocrystals aligned along their [111] easy axes is a common property encountered in many magnetotactic bacteria (MTB). The development of such dipoles permits the navigation of MTB along the geomagnetic field towards favourable habitats, a process also referred to as magnetotaxis. An important characteristic is the anisotropy within the chains, which mainly consists of the magnetocrystalline and the shape anisotropy. The two anisotropy contributions can be cooperative or competitive depending on the orientation with respect to the chain axis. The change in the relative orientation between the two anisotropy contributions caused by the Verwey transition TV, can be used to unambigously detect MTB and their fossil remains. Ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy (FMR) is a well-established method to probe magnetic anisotropy in absolute units.\nHere, we use X- and Q-band FMR spectroscopy and numerical simulation to analyze the MTB species of Desulfovibrio magneticus RS-1 with elongated magnetosomes aligned along the [100] hard axis. In this special case, the magnetotaxis above TV is strongly affected by the shape anisotropy of the nanocrystals and it is competitive to the magnetocrystalline anisotropy. Below TV, the change of the easy axis [111] to [100] generates a cooperative system, which can be considered as the optimal case for magnetotaxis, i.e., shape and magnetocrystalline anisotropies are nearly parallel to the MTB chain axis.\nIn summary, the nanocrystal assembly in RS-1 provides another step towards a better understanding of the physics behind magnetotaxis.",

VMC is defined as the ratio between water content (weight of live biomass – weight of dry biomass) and either dry or living biomass weight. Despite the wide range of potential applications for systematic estimates of VMC, no VMC thematic product is currently generated (Yebra et al. 2013). The present paper presents the initial steps toward developing a modeling framework for the retrieval of VMC. A suite of field and laboratory measurements were collected weekly for various crop species throughout the 2014 and 2015 summer growing periods in the Southern Palouse region of Idaho. Measurements included: VMC, leaf area index (LAI), soil moisture content, leaf area, canopy height, and ground measured spectroradiometer data (350-2500 nm) of leaf and canopy reflectance. Field measurements were coincident with Landsat 8 OLI overpasses. PROSPECT- 5 and SAIL radiative transfer models were used to generate spectral signatures, simulating a variety of conditions and constrained by field and laboratory observations. Landsat 8 OLI data from coincident overpasses were used in an inversion approach to characterize VMC from field sites. The sources of uncertainty were characterized and examined for future model ensemble development.",

            "abstract": "Impacts of droughts on water quality qre difficult to quanitify but are essential to manage ecosystems and maintain public water supply. During drought, river water quality is significantly changed by increased residence times, reduced dilution and enhanced biogeochemical processes. But, the impact severity varies between catchments and depends on multiple factors including the sensitivity of the river to drought conditions, anthropogenic influences in the catchment and different delivery patterns of key nutrient, contaminant and mineral sources. A key constraint is data availability for key water quality parameters such that impacts of drought periods on certain determinands can be identified.\nWe use national-scale water quality monitoring data to investigate the impacts of drought periods on water quality in the United Kingdom (UK). The UK Water Quality Sampling Harmonised Monitoring Scheme (HMS) dataset consists of >200 UK sites with weekly to monthly sampling of many water quality variables over the past 40 years. This covers several major UK droughts in 1975-1976, 1983-1984,1989-1992, 1995 and 2003, which cover severity, spatial and temporal extent, and how this affects the temporal impact of the drought on water quality. Several key water quality parameters, including water temperature, nitrate, dissolved organic carbon, orthophosphate, chlorophyll and pesticides, are selected from the database. These were chosen based on their availability for many of the sites, high sampling resolution and importance to the drinking water function and ecological status of the river. The water quality time series were then analysed to investigate whether water quality during droughts deviated significantly from non-drought periods and examined how the results varied spatially, for different drought periods and for different water quality parameters. Our results show that there is no simple conclusion as to the effects of drought on water quality in UK rivers; impacts are diverse both in terms of timing, magnitude and duration. We consider several scenarios in which management interventions may alleviate water quality pressures, and discuss how the many interacting factors need to be better characterised to support detailed mechanistic models to improve our process understanding.",

Past studies have shown that the PICS method is useful for evaluating the trend of sensors over time or cross-calibration of sensors but was not considered until recently for deriving absolute calibration. Current interest in using this approach to establish absolute radiometric calibration stems from recent research that indicates that with empirically derived models of the surface properties and careful atmospheric characterisation Top of Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance values can be predicted and used for absolute sensor radiometric calibration. Critical to the continued development of this approach is the accurate characterization of the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) of PICS sites. This paper presents the field data collected by a high-performance portable goniometer system in order to develop a BRDF model for the Algodones Dunes in California. These BRDF data are part of a larger study that is seeking to evaluate and quantify all aspects of this dune system (from regional effects to the micro scale optical properties of the sand) in order to provide an absolute radiometric calibration PICS. This paper presents the results of a dense temporal measurement sequence (several measurements per hour with high angular resolution), to yield detailed information on the nature of the surface reflectance properties. The BRDF data were collected covering typical view geometry of space borne sensors and will be used to close the loop on the calibration to create an absolute calibration target for optical satellite absolute radiometric calibration.",

Both sodium carbonate standards and unknown samples from carbonate mineral dissolution experiments in high salinity brines were analyzed using a 532 nm laser coupled to an inVia Renishaw spectrometer to collect carbonate spectra from near-saturated sodium chloride and sodium sulfate brines. A calibration curve was determined by collecting spectra from solutions of known carbonate concentrations mixed with a pH 13 buffer and a near-saturated NaCl or Na2SO4 brine matrix. The spectra were processed and curve fitted to determine the height ratio of the carbonate peak at 1066 cm-1 to the 1640 cm-1 water peak. The calibration curve determined using the standards was then applied to the experimental data after accounting for dilutions. Concentrations determined based on Raman spectra were compared against traditional acid titration measurements. We found that the two techniques vary by less than one order of magnitude. Further work is ongoing to verify the method and apply similar techniques to measure aqueous carbonate concentrations in other high salinity brines.Traditional methods of quantitative analysis are often ill-suited to determining the bulk chemistry of high salinity brines due to their corrosive and clogging properties.

Given the complexity of understanding the scientific problem domain being researched, combined with the overhead of learning to use advanced computing technologies, it becomes paramount that the next generation of scientists and researchers learn to embrace best-practices.\nThe Integrative Computational Education and Research Traineeship (ICERT) is a National Science Foundation (NSF) Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site at the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC). During Summer 2015, two ICERT interns joined the 3DDY project. 3DDY converts geospatial datasets into file types that can take advantage of new formats, such as natural user interfaces, interactive visualization, and 3D printing. Mentored by TACC researchers for ten weeks, students with no previous background in computational science learned to use scripts to build the first prototype of the 3DDY application, and leveraged Wrangler, the newest high performance computing (HPC) resource at TACC.\nTest datasets for quadrangles in central Texas were used to assemble the 3DDY workflow and code. Test files were successfully converted into a stereo lithographic (STL) format, which is amenable for use with a 3D printers. Test files and the scripts were documented and shared using the Figshare site while metadata was documented for the 3DDY application using OntoSoft.\nThese efforts validated a straightforward set of workflows to transform geospatial data and established the first prototype version of 3DDY. Adding the data and software management procedures helped students realize a broader set of tangible results (e.g. Figshare entries), better document their progress and the final state of their work for the research group and community, helped students and researchers follow a clear set of formats and fill in the necessary details that may be lost otherwise, and exposed the students to the next generation workflows and practices for digital scholarship and scientific inquiry for converting geospatial data into formats that are easy to reuse.",

The HPCA Radio Frequency (RF) filtering provides a unique method to suppress the overwhelming H+ signal and enables measurement of heavier ion species.

            "abstract": "Millennial climate changes during the last deglacial and glacial periods were accompanied by rapid changes in atmospheric CO2 (CO2,atm) that still remain unexplained. While the role of the Southern Ocean as major control of ocean-atmosphere CO2 exchange has often been emphasized, it has been debated whether millennial-scale rises in CO2,atm are linked with variations in biological export productivity in the sub-Antarctic region, possibly driven by fluctuations in airborne dust supply, or with variations in vertical mixing in the Antarctic region, possibly driven by changes in westerly wind stress or density stratification of the water column. We present high-resolution multi-proxy bottom water [O2]- (closely linked to dissolved organic carbon concentrations in the ocean), biological export production- and 14C ventilation age reconstructions in the sub-Antarctic Atlantic sediment core MD07-3076Q (14°13.7’W, 44°9.2’S, 3770 m water depth), to provide new insights into the role of the Southern Ocean in the global carbon cycle from a deep-sea perspective. Our new data show that millennial-scale changes in CO2,atm during the last 70,000 years were paralleled by decreases in deep-ocean carbon storage, which were linked with increases in deep-ocean ventilation of the Southern Ocean carbon pool (via southern-sourced water masses) and decreases in the export of carbon to the deep sub-Antarctic Atlantic. Reconstructed bottom water [O2] changes indicate a deep-ocean carbon loss of 509±68 Gt C during the early deglaciation and 292±111 Gt C during mid-glacial events, when extrapolated to the global deep ocean below 3 km, which may fully account for the observed CO2,atm changes. We propose that the Southern Ocean's 'organic carbon pump' has exerted a tight control on CO2,atm and global climate specifically via a synergy of both physical (e.g. ocean dynamics, and air-sea CO2 exchange) and biological processes (e.g. export productivity).",

            "abstract": "A curriculum for an intensive one-day workshop about mangroves, oceans, and climate has been developed for schoolteachers in the Federated States of Micronesia. The goals of the workshop are for teachers/attendees to be able to (i) explain what salinity is and describe how it varies from the ocean to the river, (ii) explain what a mangrove is and describe adaptations mangroves have developed that allow them to live in saline or brackish water, and adjust to changing sea level, and (iii) develop a grade-appropriate poster on mangroves or salinity and one interactive activity that uses the poster to engage students in learning. These objectives are accomplished by field trips to the ocean and mangrove swamp, where each participant learns how to measure salinity and identify mangrove species. The hands-on field component is followed by a poster development session where participants design, present, and share feedback on their posters that they will bring back to their classrooms. This experience allows schoolteachers to intimately explore their coastal ecosystems and gain new perspectives about their environment that they can take back to their students.\nThe workshop was designed through a collaborative effort between Pacific Resources for Education and Learning (PREL) NSF Pacific Climate Education Partnership, University of Washington professors and graduate students and undergraduate students, Kosrae Department of Education, Kosrae Island Resource Management Authority (KIRMA), Kosrae Island Conservation and Safety Organization (KCSO), and local Kosraean schoolteachers and administrators.

            "abstract": "Six hundred and eighty-eight focal mechanisms were calculated between 2010 and 2015 and used to determine optimally oriented fault orientations within the contemporary stress field in Oklahoma. The contemporary stress, maximum horizontal stress (shmax) orientation of N85°E, is determined from the orientation of the P- and T-axes of the 688 focal mechanisms used. The majority of the focal mechanism solutions were computed using earthquakes occurring in central and north-central Oklahoma, a region where the greatest numbers of recent earthquakes have occurred. The focal mechanisms used in this compilation include Regional Moment Tensor solutions and first-motion focal mechanisms. We determined a mean shmax of 83.2° with a standard deviation of 21.3° azimuth. The median shmax is 84.8° with 633 observations. From the probability density functions, it is possible to define orientations of optimal, moderately optimal and sub-optimal fault strikes. The focal mechanism distribution is dominated by strike-slip motion on steeply dipping faults and thus fault strike is restricted to the range of 0° to 180°. Optimal fault strike orientation ranges between 45°-60°, 105°-120° and 135°-150° and represent fault orientations most likely for failure. Moderately optimal fault strike orientation ranges between 15°-45°, 60°-75°, 90°-105° and 120°-135° and represent fault orientations moderately likely for failure. All other orientations of fault strike are sub-optimal orientations and have a low likelihood of failure. These results do not indicate that failure cannot occur on sub-optimal fault strikes, but suggest that they are less likely. We apply these results to the most comprehensive Oklahoma fault map to date. Identifying optimal fault orientations is important for determining the potential earthquake hazard of both naturally occurring and triggered seismicity.",

While traditional faculty mentors play essential role in students’ development as researchers and professionals, other formal and informal mentoring can be important component of the REU program and student experiences. Students receive mentoring from program directors, coordinators, and on site undergraduate advisors. While working on their research projects, REU students receive essential support and mentoring from undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral scientists in the research groups of their primary mentors. Cohort living and group activities give multiple opportunities for peer mentoring where each student brings their own strengths and experiences to the group. Biosphere 2 REU program puts strong emphasis on teaching students to effectively communicate their research to public. In order to help REUs learn needed skills the outreach personnel at Biosphere 2 mentor and advise students both in groups and individually, in lecture format and by personal example, on best outreach approaches in general and on individual outreach projects students develop. To further enhance and strengthen outreach mentoring we used a novel approach of blending cohort of REU students with the Cal Poly STAR (STEM Teacher And Researcher) Program fellows, future K-12 STEM teachers who are gaining research experience at Biosphere 2. STAR fellows live together with the REU students and participate with them in professional development activities, as well as perform research side by side. Educational background and experiences gives these students a different view and better preparation and tools to effectively communicate and adapt science to lay audiences, a challenge commonly facing researchers but rarely taught to future scientists. In addition, REU students act as mentors themselves to the middle and high school students in Biosphere 2 Science Academy sharing with them exciting research they are doing and their experiences about doing science and life in college.",

A retrieval algorithm for the boundary layer inversion height and surface-based inversion (SBI) frequency is developed for dry atmospheric conditions (total precipitable water < 3.6 mm) that typically exist during polar winter, as well as in high-latitude, elevated regions such as eastern Antarctica and central Greenland. The algorithm is applied to the high-resolution refractivity profiles obtained over the polar Arctic region using the Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC) dataset for the period 2006-2013. The method is found useful for capturing the spatiotemporal variability in Arctic inversion properties. For the Arctic Ocean, the spatial patterns show a minimum inversion height (maximum SBI frequency) over the ice-covered Pacific sector similar to that observed in past studies. Monthly evolution of the inversion characteristics suggests a surface temperature control in the multi-year sea ice region, with the peak in SBI frequency occurring during the transition period from winter to spring. For central Greenland, the seasonal peak in SBI frequency occurs during winter. The diurnal variability in SBI frequency is forced mainly by solar heating, consistent with past observations. Despite some limitations, the RO refractivity profile is found quite useful for monitoring the Arctic boundary layer, and is able to capture the interannual variability of inversion characteristics.",

            "abstract": "Light (C2-C4) alkenes, light alkanes and isoprene (C5H8) are non-methane hydrocarbons that play important roles in the photochemical production of tropospheric ozone and in the formation of secondary organic aerosols. Natural terrestrial fluxes of the light hydrocarbons are poorly characterized, with global emission estimates based on limited field measurements. In 2014, net fluxes of these compounds were measured at the Manitou Experimental Forest Observatory, a semi-arid ponderosa pine forest in the Colorado Rocky Mountains and site of the prior BEACHON campaigns. Three field intensives were conducted between June 17 and August 10, 2014. Net ecosystem flux measurements utilized a relaxed eddy accumulation system coupled to an automated gas chromatograph. Summertime average emissions of ethene and propene were up to 90% larger than those observed from a temperate deciduous forest. Ethene and propene fluxes were also correlated to each other, similar to the deciduous forest study. Emissions of isoprene were small, as expected for a coniferous forest, and these fluxes were not correlated with either ethene or propene. Unexpected emissions of light alkanes were also observed, and these showed a distinct diurnal cycle. Understory flux measurements allowed for the partitioning of fluxes between the surface and the canopy. Full results from the three field intensives will be compared with environmental variables in order to parameterize the fluxes for use in modeling emissions.",

With access to the Bay and surrounding environment, and strong partnerships with a national network of NOAA scientists and local researchers, the museum can serve as an educational node for a variety of atmosphere and ocean observing networks.\nThe most visible and iconic instrument at the museum’s Pier 15 location is a CO2 buoy from NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Lab in Seattle. Part of an international network of real-time ocean acidification sensors, the NOAA buoy streams temperature, salinity, atmospheric and surface water CO2 data from the Exploratorium location to NOAA. Near real-time and archived ocean and atmosphere carbon data is displayed in the museum’s Bay Observatory along with other water quality, weather, and air quality conditions. Displaying both the instruments and the data they provide gives the public a better understanding of where climate data comes from, how scientists make meaning from time series data, and the value of long-term observation in understanding climate change and the ways that humans impact the environment. However, creating interactive exhibits from environmental data presents many challenges, including interpreting complex earth systems and biological and human interactions. What is the impact of the adjacent urban center and the estuary on the Bay’s carbon content? How do we tease out long-term trends from the local variability? How do we connect the place-based learning to global processes and impacts? We’ll address some of these challenges in the presentation and include the importance of collaborative partnerships between informal education institutions and researchers in place-based education about climate and environmental change.",

Natural remanent magnetization (NRM) and various laboratory-induced magnetizations of the u-channel samples were measured at every 1 cm interval on a 2G Enterprises u-channel pass-through superconducting rock magnetometer, before and after a minimum of 13 step alternating field (AF) demagnetization routine at 5 or 10 mT spacing between steps, up to a maximum peak field of 100 mT. NRM demagnetization data reveal a stable and well-defined primary magnetization for samples from all three sites. Maximum angular deviation (MAD) values associated with the component direction calculations using principal component analysis (PCA) are mostly < 2°. We use a combination of radiocarbon dating, benthic and planktic oxygen isotope stratigraphy, and correlation of natural gamma radiation and X-ray fluorescence data to those of nearby well-dated piston cores, to construct reliable age models for the studied sediments. Studied samples from the three sites cover the last ~40 to over 100 kyrs, with mean sediment accumulation rates ranging from ~10 cm/kyr to over 70 cm/kyr. Occasional sandy layers in the sediments appear to correspond to significantly lower intensities of NRM and ARM, but have little influence on NRM directions. Relative paleointensity (RPI) variations at the three sites estimated using the slopes of best-fit lines of the NRM and anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) data and mean NRM/ARM ratios placed on the acquired age models, show detailed (sub-) millennial scale variabilities and apparently resemble each other and RPI records from other North Atlantic regions at least on time scales of a few thousand years.",

However, existing conceptual models for Critical Zone evolution and architecture may become limited in their applicability for steep landscapes at the extreme end of the erosional spectrum. In these systems, complex morphologies and stochastic but rapid erosion add complexity and heterogeneity to regolith weathering and cover. Here, we use global compilations of riverine and soil-derived weathering fluxes and insight from new research in diverse mountain belts to highlight this complexity and explore its underlying controls. Regolith in rapidly eroding landscapes often records rapid and surprisingly intense chemical weathering, even as soils thin and/or becomes increasingly isolated. At the same time, data show that local regolith weathering rates become poor predictors of landscape-wide fluxes in these bedrock-dominated systems. The transition to kinetically-limited weathering can help to explain some complexity of regolith structure and function in these systems as weathering fluxes become sensitive to multiple controls including hydrology, moisture availability, and fluid and mineral residence times. However, grand challenges persist in both quantifying this complexity and understanding its implications and controls within the critical zone.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_Poster_fcs_inpe.pdf\nTerrestrial vegetation, especially tropical forests, releases large amounts of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) into the atmosphere. The global emissions of BVOC (~1000 Tg C/year) are dominant in relation to anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (~100 Tg C/year), with biomass burning contributing close to 10 - 50 Tg C/year. Tropical trees cover about 18% of the global land surface but are estimated to be responsible for approximately 80% of terpenoid and 50% of other BVOCs emissions. Considering the importance of these emissions, the SAMBBA (South American Biomass Burning Analysis) experiment, which occurred during the dry season (September 2012) in the Amazon Rainforest, provided information about the chemical composition of the atmosphere through measurements on the aircraft FAAM BAE-146. Although primarily focused on biomass burning flights, the SAMBBA project carried out other flights providing indirect oxidative capacity data in different environments: natural emission dominated flights and biomass burning flights with fresh plumes (< 2 hours) and aged plumes (> 2 hours). Calculation of the [MVK+MACR]/[Isoprene] ratio enabled investigation of the impact of biomass burning on surface oxidation in comparison to the natural emission flights. During the morning (altitude < 500m), the [MVK+MACR]/[Isoprene] values for natural emission flights (1.0±0.4), fresh plume (1.9±0.6) and aged plume (1.4±0.6) suggest that biomass burning enhances BVOC oxidation in relation to the lifetime of the air mass. This study aims to improve the knowledge about the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere, which depends not only on chemical composition, but also other factors like the history of the air mass trajectories influencing the availability of these compounds, the NOx dependence of isoprene oxidation and whether the chemistry is dominated by OH or O3. A synergistic approach integrating observation and modeling, using 3D numerical model of chemical transport (CCATT-BRAMS) coupled with a natural emission model (MEGAN) has been applied to study the BVOC in the Amazon rainforest. The SAMBBA experiment provided a valuable database that is being included into a numerical model of air quality, developing a numerical model that incorporates the understanding needed to represent the observations.",

JPL, working with the science community, has developed the InSAR Scientific Computing Environment (ISCE), a next-generation interferometric SAR processing system that is designed to be flexible and extensible. ISCE currently supports many international space borne data sets but has been primarily focused on geodetic science and applications. A second evolutionary path, the Advanced Rapid Imaging and Analysis (ARIA) science data system, uses ISCE as its core science data processing engine and produces automated science and response products, quality assessments and metadata. The success of this two-front effort has been demonstrated in NASA's ability to respond to recent events with useful disaster support. JPL has enabled high-volume and low latency data production by the re-use of the hybrid cloud computing science data system (HySDS) that runs ARIA, leveraging on-premise cloud computing assets that are able to burst onto the Amazon Web Services (AWS) services as needed. Beyond geodetic applications, needs have emerged to process large volumes of time-series SAR data collected for estimation of biomass and its change, in such campaigns as the upcoming AfriSAR field campaign. ESTO is funding JPL to extend the ISCE-ARIA model to a “SAR Science Data Processing Foundry” to on-ramp new data sources and to produce new science data products to meet the needs of science teams and, in general, science community members. An extension of the ISCE-ARIA model to support on-demand processing will permit PIs to leverage this Foundry to produce data products from accepted data sources when they need them. This paper will describe each of the elements of the SAR SDP Foundry and describe their integration into a new conceptual approach to enable more effective use of SAR instruments.",

            "abstract": "Standard active-source seismic processing and imaging steps such as velocity analysis and reverse time migration usually provide best results when all reflected waves in the input data are primaries (waves that reflect only once). Multiples (recorded waves that reflect multiple times) represent a source of coherent noise in data that must be suppressed to avoid imaging artefacts. Consequently, multiple-removal methods have been a primcipal direction of active-source seismic research for decades. We describe a new method to estimate primaries directly, which obviates the need for multiple removal. Primaries are constructed within convolutional interferometry by combining first arriving events of up-going and direct wave down-going Green’s functions to virtual receivers in the subsurface. The required up-going wavefields to virtual receivers along discrete subsurface boundaries can be constructed using Marchenko redatuming. Crucially, this is possible without detailed models of the Earth’s subsurface velocity structure: similarly to most migration techniques, the method only requires surface reflection data and estimates of direct (non-reflected) arrivals between subsurface sources and the acquisition surface. The method is demonstrated on a stratified synclinal model. It is shown both to improve reverse time migration compared to standard methods, and to be particularly robust against errors in the reference velocity model used.",

We compare the historical (1951-2010) changes in annual-mean and annual-maximum daily precipitation in a global set of weather station observations (GHCN-Daily) and bias-corrected precipitation projections of 5 global climate models from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISI-MIP), temporally and spatially subsampling the models as observations, and develop the study to the period 2011-2099 for model projections under the RCP8.5 forcing scenario. We also develop a Rainwater Harvesting System (RWHS) model and drive it with observational and modeled daily precipitation data to study the changes in reliability of the RWHS for each station in order to study the impact of changes in precipitation pattern on reliability of precipitation-based water supply. Results show that historical mean and maximum precipitation has increased at a rate of 7.64 and 10.14 % per K global warming, respectively, which is higher than the subsampled ISI-MIP models’ average trends of 1.36 and 7.34 % per K, respectively. Despite the faster increase in maximum precipitation than mean precipitation, the reliability of the RWHS driven by observed precipitation has increased by an average of 0.2% per decade over 1951-2010. By contrast, all 5 ISI-MIP model daily precipitation series imply decreases in mean reliability over the station locations, for an average 0.15% per decade decrease over 1951-2010. By scaling the decadal precipitation to the initial decade’s average, to factor out the impact of change in precipitation amount on the RWHS reliability, observations show an average 0.11%/decade increase while models show an average 0.13%/decade decrease in the reliability. Our results show that, compared to station observations, climate models underestimate the increasing trends in mean and maximum precipitation and also show the opposite direction of average change in the reliability of a model water supply system. These systematic mismatches for the recent decades suggest the need for caution in using precipitation trend scenarios derived from climate models as a basis for designing water supply systems.",

WIPP performance assessment (PA) calculations estimate the probability and consequence of potential radionuclide releases from the repository to the accessible environment arising from events and processes that could occur over the 10,000 year regulatory period. The conceptual model estimates three possible cases and the combinations of these cases: 1) undisturbed condition of the repository, 2) human borehole intrusion condition that penetrates the repository, and 3) human borehole intrusion that penetrates pressurized brine underlying the repository. To date, WIPP PA calculations have employed multiple two-dimensional (2D) numerical models requiring simplification of the mesh and processes including homogenization of materials and regions while maintaining volume aspect ratio. Introducing three-dimensional (3D) numerical models within WIPP PA enables increasingly realistic representations of the WIPP subsurface domain and improved flexibility for incorporating relevant features. PFLOTRAN is a state-of-art massively parallel subsurface flow and reactive transport code that will be implemented to enhance PA with more physically realistic 3D flow and transport models; eliminating the need for multiple related, but decoupled 2D models. This paper demonstrates PFLOTRAN simulation of a single waste panel of the WIPP undisturbed condition in 3D. The simulation also employs newly implemented WIPP specific functionalities to PFLOTRAN: 1) gas generation from the wastes, 2) creep closure of bedded salt formation, 3) fractures of marker beds near the excavation, 4) Klinkenberg effect on gas permeability in low-permeable materials, and 5) Redlich-Kwong-Soave equation of state for gas density.",

Critical to our understanding of Arctic carbon budgets are small, but numerically abundant watersheds that dominate the landscape of the Alaskan Arctic Coastal Plain (ACP), which appears to be changing rapidly in response to climate warming and other environmental changes. This study was designed to understand the contribution of freshwater ecosystems in the Arctic to regional carbon budgets. pCO2 was logged continually in ponds, lakes and streams sites near Barrow, AK and recorded across transects in Elson Lagoon, a coastal lagoon on the Beaufort coast. Average pCO2 of the pond over 2 weeks in August (1196 µatm) was double that of lakes and streams, and four times higher than Elson Lagoon (216 µatm); thus, the Lagoon was acting as a small sink while the pond was a substantial source of CO2 to the atmosphere. The uptake of CO2 in Elson Lagoon, combined with an oversaturation of O2, may be due to enhanced primary productivity caused by freshwater nutrient inputs. Conversely, pCO2, chlorophyll-a and DOC increased substantially in the pond after a large rain event, suggesting that run-off introduced large amounts of terrestrially-derived carbon from groundwater. Further studies are required to elucidate the fate and transport of carbon in the numerically abundant smaller watersheds of the Arctic.",

The upper 0–280 m of continuous, weakly deformed sediments, designated by IODP Expedition 344 as structural domain I, is bounded by a major erosional event, (CRISP-U1, dated near 1 Ma), suggesting wave-plain erosion from the present shelf break out to 25 km seaward, to a present-day water depth of 900–1300 m. The eastern toe of its surface is characterized by a large drainage system, likely including submarine channels that eroded to depths >1500 m below present-day water depth. CRISP-U1 is variably uplifted by a series of fault propagation folds and cut by an intersecting array of normal faults. Another, major erosional event, (CRISP-M1, approximately 2 Ma) extended from the outer shelf to the mid slope and removed 500–1000 m of material. Overlying CRISP-M1 is up to 1 km of sediments that are more deformed by fault propagation folds, back thrusts, and intersecting arrays of normal faults. Unconformities with smaller areal extent are variably found in these overlying sediments across the mid-slope to outer shelf, at present-day water depths >220 m. Below CRISP-M1, sediments are more densely deformed and also contain major unconformities that extend survey-wide. Both unconformities, CRISP-U1 and CRISP-M1, are encountered in well U1413 and are demarcated by major benthic foraminifera assemblage changes at 149 mbsf and ~504 mbsf (Harris et al., 2013, Proceeding of the IODP, Volume 344).CRISP-M1 is likely correlative to the major sediment facies and benthic foraminifera assemblage change found in U1379 at ~880 mbsf (Vannuchi et al., 2013). The unconformities and intersecting array of normal faults may demarcate the passing of topography on the downgoing Cocos plate, episodically lifting and then subsiding the Costa Rica margin, with amplitudes up to about 1 km.",

            "abstract": "A new generation of high-resolution (~1km) weather forecast models now becoming operational over Europe promises to revolutionize predictions of severe weather, specifically by explicitly resolving convection. For this, a dense observing network is required, focusing especially on the lowest few km of the atmosphere, so that forecast models have the most realistic state of the atmosphere for initialization, continuous assimilation and verification. In this context, the current European COST action TOPROF (ES1303) deals with operational networking of three existing but so far under-exploited, ground-based remote sensing instruments throughout Europe: i) Several hundreds of ceilometers, ii) more than 20 Doppler lidars, and iii) About 30 microwave profilers (MWP) giving profiles of temperature and humidity in the lowest few km every 10 minutes.\nSpecifically, MWP are highly suited for continuously monitoring the temporal development of atmospheric stability (i.e. Cimini et al. 2015, AMT) before the initiation of deep convection. However, the vertical resolution of MWP temperature profiles is best in the lowest kilometer above the surface, decreasing rapidly with increasing height. In addition, humidity profile retrievals typically cannot be resolved with more than two degrees of freedom for signal, resulting in a rather poor vertical resolution throughout the troposphere. Typical stability indices (i.e. K-index, Lifted Index, Showalter Index, CAPE,..) rely on temperature and humidity values not only in the region of the boundary layer (850 hPa) but also at 700 hPa, 500 hPa, in between these levels or even higher above. In this study, for clear sky cases, satellite remote sensing (i.e. SEVIRI radiances from the geostationary METEOSAT ) is used to complement the ground-based MWP information. The theoretical basis of the combined retrieval is highlighted, error reductions resulting from the sensor synergy are discussed and applications to real data are shown. The study generally underlines the need for an enhanced ground-based and satellite synergy. Such techniques may possess high potential for improving weather forecasting and/or nowcasting application, however have not even begun to be exploited.",

Here we provide direct experimental evidence that aerosol enrichment shifts seawater chemistry by increasing the ratio of N to phosphorus (N:P) and supports the growth of bloom-forming phytoplankton in the East China Sea. We use a combination of field-based aerosol addition incubation experiments, along with ocean color data on blooms dominated by different taxa to show that HAB forming dinoflagellates are particularly responsive to aerosol inputs. Moreover, we show that the effect of N deposition is strongest in offshore waters further from the Yangtze River outflow, consistent with the large anthropogenic flux of N from this source. This study shows the potential for aerosols to control N:P ratios in offshore waters and to shape the phytoplankton community, contributing to the success of bloom-forming organisms.",

This study, for the first time, examines the reproductive phenology of a dipterocarp-dominated forest in a seasonally-dry region in Southeast Asia. We monitored flowering and fruiting monthly for 1344 trees (>300 spp.) in a seasonally-dry forest in Khao Chong, Thailand from 2001-2009, and assessed frequency, duration, seasonality, and synchrony of reproduction. Reproductive phenology of the Khao Chong forest was more similar to tropical forests in other seasonally-dry parts of the tropics than it was to dipterocarp forests in everwet regions of Southeast Asia, despite being more phylogenetically similar to the latter. The Khao Chong forest exhibited annual reproduction, with peak flowering occurring at the end of the dry season, and peak fruiting occurring early in the wet season. The majority of species and individuals also reproduced annually, including some species that are known to be “general flowering” in everwet climates. Short periods of drought appeared to be the cue that initiated flowering in early flowering species, while species flowering later in the dry season may have responded to either drought or low temperature. Over the eight years of our study, we observed a decline in the proportion of individuals reproducing each season. This decline appeared to be associated with a shorter dry season due to a later onset of continuous drought, suggesting that changing climate in the region may have significant impacts on plant reproduction and recruitment.",

However, physical mechanisms at work at ion scales are still under debates. In particular, it is not clear whether we have to deal with a random phase fluctuations, or with a superposition of coherent structures, or with a mixture of both kind of fluctuations. In this paper, using in-situ measurements of the Wind spacecraft in a fast stream on January 30, 1995, we investigate for the first time the phase coupling between different components of the magnetic fluctuations, and in a large range of scales around\nf\nb\n. For the fluctuations in the plane perpendicular to the mean magnetic field\nB\n0\n, the analysis of the phases reveals a sporadic narrow frequency band of Alfv\\'en Ion Cyclotron waves. The phase coupling of the fluctuations, in the plane parallel to\nB\n0\n, reveals presence of coherent structures such as current sheets and Alfv\\'en vortex like structures. Furthermore both waves and coherent structures have characteristic frequencies and scales close to\nf\nb\nwhich makes them suitable candidates for a clear break and a slope steepening at ion scales. We detail the spectral contribution of waves, structures and of the rest of the signal to the observed spectrum. This analysis allows us to conclude that a particular combination of these phenomena defines the spectral shape around ion scales. We discuss the necessity to consider waves and coherent structures in order to build a model to describes the solar wind turbulence at ion scales.",

            "abstract": "The present study is a compilation of neotectonic data offering an unprecedented view into spatial and temporal patterns of seismic strain release in diffusely deforming crust, at timescales of 1 kyr to 1 Myr. We compiled paleoseismologic and Quaternary geology data from 159 published studies, for some 167 faults across the Great basin region (Western US), an archetype for diffuse deformation of the continental crust. Our database is accessible online through an interactive GIS interface and an Excel file.\nResults from the database indicate a mean vertical displacement for earthquakes on Basin and Range normal faults of 2 m. The distribution of earthquake recurrence intervals is far more scattered, with a mode value of 1-3 kyr and a mean value of ~11 kyr. A significant fraction of recurrence intervals (24%) are >10 kyr, and about half that (12%) are >20 kyr. Displacement per event and recurrence interval seems not clearly correlated. Finally, in 2/3 of the measurements, the difference in vertical displacement with a previous event on the same fault is < ±1 m.\nWe then investigate the spatial and temporal variations of displacement rates over varying time windows during the Quaternary. Over the last 15 ka, the deformation has been concentrated along the edges of the province (Wasatch front, central Nevada seismic belt), the central part of the Great Basin being almost inactive. However, the deformation is evenly distributed in the overall region when considering a 150 ka time window, with homogeneous finite displacement rates of ~0.2-0.3 mm/yr on the faults. Spatial paleoearthquakes kinematics is not random: we can distinguish \"local clusters\" (episode of events on a single fault) from \"regional clusters\" (episode of events, distributed on several faults, each with a single event). We thus propose a general model where any given fault alternates between: (1) fast transient displacement rate episodes (1-2 mm/yr), lasting ~20-50 kyr, associated to “local clusters”; (2) slow transient displacement rate episode (0.05-0.1 mm/yr), lasting up to 400 kyr, associated to “regional clusters”. More speculatively, we comment on possible “local clusters” migrations and connections between clustering and climatic forcing.",

We will present the UCCRN and the Second UCCRN Assessment Report on Climate Change and Cities (ARC3-2), the second in an ongoing series of global, interdisciplinary, cross-regional, science-based assessments to address climate risks, adaptation, mitigation, and policy mechanisms relevant to cities.\nThis is an especially important time to examine these issues. Cities continue to act as world leaders in climate action. Several major climate change assessment efforts are in full swing, at a crucial stage where significant opportunities for the co-production of knowledge between researchers and stakeholders exist. The IPCC AR5 Working Group II and III Reports have placed unprecedented attention on cities and urbanization and their connection to the issue of climate change. Concurrently several major, explicitly city-focused efforts have emerged from the Urban Climate Change Research Network (UCCRN), ICLEI, the Durban Adaptation Charter (DAC), C40, Future Earth, and the Urbanization and Global Environmental Change (UGEC) Project, among others.\nThe underlying rationale for the discussion will be to identify methods and approaches to further foster the development and dissemination of new climate change knowledge and information that will be useful for cities, especially in small and medium-sized cities and in the developing country context where the demand is particularly acute.\nParticipants will leave this session with:\n· The latest scientific data and state-of-the-knowledge on how cities are responding to climate change\n· Emerging opportunities and challenges to the effective placement of this knowledge in the hands of local stakeholders and decision-makers and for urban resilience and adaptation action\n· How practitioner-scientist interactions can work best\n· Synergies between the IPCC, ARC3, and other climate and cities assessments",

            "abstract": "Emergency responders such as the Fire & Rescue and Ambulance Services often face the challenging task of having to respond to or operate in dynamic weather conditions, including floods. In the UK, in order to meet government legislation and improve resilience of their operation, emergency responders, coordinated by Local Resilience Forums actively seek to identify areas which are most vulnerable to flooding, as well as the potential impacts of flood events on the critical infrastructure nodes and networks upon which their operations rely. This has been facilitated by the recent advances in flood modelling which provides country-wide publicly accessible flood risk mapping. Whilst in the possession of a wealth of data and abundant local knowledge, emergency responders often find it challenging to apply existing flood ‘hotspot’ data to assist strategic planning and operational response.\nThis abstract describes a recently completed project funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council, which combined an interdisciplinary team of researchers based at Loughborough University with a group of project partners working in the field of flood resilience within the City of Leicester, UK, to evaluate the resilience of emergency response during extreme flood events. One key piece of work which stakeholders found useful and effective was the accessibility of the city to emergency responders during extreme flooding. The figure below maps the areas of the City accessible within 8 minutes, the response time required for serious, high-priority incidents by legislation, for the Fire & Rescue Service stations under a 1 in 20 year pluvial flood event. This goes beyond what the stakeholders are already aware of in terms of direct impacts of flooding, i.e. the ‘hotspot’ areas which would directly become inundated, and highlights the indirect, cascading impacts of flood events of different magnitudes on emergency response times at the city-scale. This also provides stakeholders with useful information to implement strategic adaptation measures for mitigating the potential impacts of flooding. In addition to the key findings, the abstract will also present the process of engagement and lessons learned for successful academia-stakeholder engagement.",

            "abstract": "Boreal peatlands are important to global carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. While they cover only 3-4% of the terrestrial surface, they account for 25-30% and 9-15% of the world’s soil C and N, respectively. Globally, peatlands function as a net sink for atmospheric CO2, but also act as a net source of CH4. In peatlands of Alberta, Canada, rates of atmospheric N deposition are low: ~1 kg·ha-1·yr-1, however, NPP of Sphagnum mosses is surprisingly high. Sphagnum mosses are able to maintain high levels of NPP due to their symbiotic relationship with N2-fixing methanotrophs. Annually, rates of N2-fixation typically provide between 10-30 kg of newly fixed N per ha, while also oxidizing CH4. CH4 fluxes from boreal peatlands in Canada are typically quite low, however, fluxes also can be high during rare episodic ebullition events. CH4 accumulation and storage is substantial, especially at depth as CH4 concentrations in peat pore water typically exceed 1000 µM at 1-m below the peat surface. Given that CH4 fluxes are typically low, we wanted to examine the importance of CH4 oxidation in these same peats. We hypothesized that methanotrophic N2-fixation may be important not only in providing inputs of newly fixed N, but also in regulating CH4 emissions from peatlands. We measured concentrations of CH4 in peat porewaters, CH4 flux rates, CH4 oxidation rates, biological N2-fixation rates. Porewater CH4 concentrations were highest at depth and decreased to negligible amounts closer to the surface of the water table. CH4 flux rates were low and ranged from -2.6 to +8.7 µmol·m-2·min-1 (negative values indicate net CH4 consumption). In Sphagnum incubations, rates of CH4 oxidation (0.6-10.2 mmol·m-2·min-1) were ~2-3 orders of magnitude higher than CH4 flux rates. Additionally, N2-fixation rates in paired cores ranged from 11.7-63.3 kg·ha-1·yr-1; CH4 oxidation rates in these same units ranged from ~3.1-622 kg·CH4 oxidized ha-1·yr-1. Additionally, we confirmed that N2-fixing methanotrophs (not cyanobacteria) were the dominant fixers by quantifying gene expression of nifH, the gene that encodes for N2-fixation. Collectively, these data confirm that N2-fixing methanotrophs both provide inputs of newly fixed N, and substantially moderate CH4 fluxes from boreal peatlands of Alberta to the atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Tree-ring science provides an engaging, intuitive, and relevant entryway into understanding both climate change and environmental research. It also sheds light on the process of science--from inspiration, to fieldwork, to analysis, to publishing and communication. The basic premise of dendrochronology is that annual rings reflect year-to-year environmental conditions and that by studying long-lived trees we can learn about environmental and climatic conditions going back hundreds to thousands of years. Conceptually, this makes tree-ring studies accessible to students and faculty for a number of reasons. First, in order to collect their data, dendrochronologists often launch expeditions to stunningly picturesque and remote places in search of long-lived, climate sensitive trees. The exciting stories and images that scientists bring back from the field can help connect students to the studies, their motivation, and the data collected. Second, tree rings can be more easily explained as a proxy for climate than ice cores, speleothems and others. Most people have prior knowledge about trees and annual growth rings. It is even possible, for example, for non-expert audiences to see climate variability through time with the naked eye by looking at climate-sensitive tree cores. Third, tree rings are interdisciplinary and illustrate the interplay between the mathematical sciences, the biological sciences, and the geosciences—that is, they show that the biosphere is a fundamental component of the Earth system.\nHere, we present online, multi-media learning modules for undergraduates that introduce students to several foundational studies in tree-ring science. These include evaluating tree-ring cores from ancient hemlock trees growing on a talus slope in New Paltz, NY to learn about drought in the Northeastern US, evaluating long-term streamflow and drought of the Colorado River based on tree-ring records, and using tree-ring dating techniques to develop construction histories of cliff dwellings and pueblos in the US Southwest. Our modules are designed to give undergraduate students a sense of the scientific process, from fieldwork and logistics, to data processing and data analysis.",

            "abstract": "With climate change expected to subject staple crops in major growing regions to increased heat exposure, a critical question for agriculture and global food security is the degree to which crop water demand is also likely to change. Recent work has explored the relationship between extreme temperatures and crop water demand, finding that vapor pressure deficit (VPD), through its dependence on both temperature and humidity, provides a very good meteorological predictor of water stress. However, assessing crop water demand solely through atmospheric conditions ignores the roles of radiation and transpiration efficiency, which are increased through elevated CO2. We provide a 60-year global assessment of crop water demand in the world’s major growing areas, comparing trends and drivers across key growing regions. We find that an atmospheric-based demand measure can differ significantly from that of a crop-specific sink-based approach that incorporates radiation and CO2 effects, sometimes enough to reverse the sign of historical trends. We also find that these changes differ significantly by region, and that multi-decadal trends can mask large decadal swings. To our knowledge, our work is the first to use global meteorological datasets in a global analysis of crop water demand, and should serve as a valuable reference for future work examining the interaction of hydrological, temperature, and CO2 changes on crop yields.",

A key feature of many SRMVF ignimbrites is compositional zonation, with many volcanic units comprising both dacitic and rhyolitic horizons. Geochemical, field and petrographic evidence suggests that dacites and rhyolites are cogenetic. Here, we report U-Pb zircon ages by chemical abrasion inductively-coupled-plasma mass spectrometry (CA-LA-ICPMS) for rhyolitic and dacitic components in four units: the Bonanza, Rat Creek, Carpenter Ridge and Nelson Mountain Tuffs. All units show zircon age spectra that are either within analytical uncertainty of Ar/Ar ages or are appreciably older, indicating prolonged magma residence times (~500 ka) prior to eruption. Anomalously young Pb-loss zones in zircon have been largely removed by chemical abrasion. Older, inherited zircons and zircon cores (60-2000 Ma) are rare in all samples, suggesting limited assimilation of upper crustal Precambrian country rock or complete resorption during recharge events and magma chamber growth.",

Two of these episodes took place during the 2013 Discover-AQ field experiment. We used observations and CMAQ model simulations to study PM2.5 formation during these episodes. The study domain covered all of central and portions of northern California. Analyses were conducted with special emphasis on the differences on the meteorology and PM2.5 components over three sub-regions: the San Francisco Bay Area (SFBA), the Sacramento area (SAC), and the San Joaquin Valley area (SJV).\nThe CMAQ had 15 vertical layers and 4 km horizontal grid resolution. The SAPRC99 chemical and AE5 aerosol mechanisms were used in the simulations. Meteorological inputs to CMAQ were generated using the WRF model. An available 2012 emissions inventory was used for 2013 simulations.\nIn all three sub-regions, the WRF model slightly under predicted wind speed while correctly predicted the wind direction. The predicted boundary layer thickness had good correlation with observed average PM2.5 concentrations, especially in SJV.\nThe CMAQ model reproduced all five high PM2.5 episodes. The predicted PM2.5 almost matched the observed values in the SFBA. For the two episodes captured by the Discover-AQ field experiment, CMAQ under predicted PM2.5 in the SJV area This under prediction may be attributed to the thickness of the first layer of CMAQ, which is about 32 m. The nighttime PBL height computed by WRF can be as low as 15 m in SJV during this period.\nThere were considerable differences in the ratio of primary to secondary PM2.5 among in the three sub-regions. Secondary PM2.5 averaged 27% of total PM2.5 in SFBA. The corresponding ratio was 36% in SAC and 45% in SJV. The biggest component of secondary PM2.5 in SJV was ammonium nitrate, which is consistent with large ammonia emissions there from dairy and feedlot operations.\nWe found large sensitivity of CMAQ simulated PM2.5 to the model layer structure and the PBL schemes. We plan to rerun CMAQ with additional vertical layers and finer vertical resolution near the surface to better delineate the nighttime boundary layer structure. The WRF model will also be tested with several PBL schemes. The simulated PM2.5 at upper layers will be compared with aircraft observations from the Discover-AQ campaign.",

We have measured the structure of carbonate-silicate liquids as a function of carbon content along the calcite-wollastonite (CaCO3-CaSiO3) and calcite-forsterite (CaCO3-Mg2SiO3) compositional joins at ~1800 oC, and 3 or 6 GPa in a Paris-Edinburgh press using X-ray diffuse scattering. Pair distribution functions calculated from the scattering data confirm that CaCO3 behaves as an ionic liquid, while compositions with 40-100 wt% wollastonite contain polymerized silicate with an average connectivity (Qn) of at least two bridging O per Si (Q2). Even liquid compositions with as little as 35 wt% forsterite component contain silicate polymers, despite the absence of bridging O in the crystalline orthosilicate. As the carbonate content of the melt is increased, the average connectivity of SiO4 units linearly increases from ~Q2 for pure wollastonite liquid to >Q3 for 40 wt% wollastonite, even though less silicate is present. Analysis of Ca-Ca and Ca-Si pair correlations, as well as Ca-O bond distances, indicate that Ca2+ bonds more strongly to the silicate framework as carbonate content increases. Increasing pressure from 3 to 6 GPa at constant composition causes Qn to fall near Q0. The trends in local atomic structure with composition and pressure explain falling sphere viscometry measurements in carbonate-silicate liquids at upper mantle conditions. These viscosities are as low as 6x10-3 Pa-s for pure CaCO3, only half a log unit higher than that of water, and span ~1.6 log units between the carbonate and silicate end-members. Structural and viscosity trends taken together indicate carbonate-rich, depolymerized and highly mobile liquid at depth which transitions into silicate-rich, polymerized and much less mobile liquid as the melt ascends into the crust.",

As part of a yearlong epidemiological study of dengue, this paper takes the first step to model the relationship between the urban/built environment and incidents of dengue fever in Roatán, Honduras. Roatán has experienced an 80-fold increase in annual tourists since the 1990s, with over 1.2 million people now visiting the island yearly. In tandem, the Caribbean island’s population has exploded from fewer than 13,000 people in the 1970s to over 100,000 people today. Using broadband remote sensed satellite imagery, this paper maps and measures how this massive influx of tourists and population has altered the island’s landscape. Results from a decision tree classifying technique applied to a Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) image from 1985 and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) image from 2014 suggest a rapid pace of urbanization; built and impervious surface has increased over 300% in the last 30 years. Emerging research suggests, similar to other mosquito-borne diseases, a correlation between built environment and risk to dengue because of the increase in stagnate water that serve as disease-host reservoirs. This remote sensing analysis will be integrated with georeferenced household level data of cases of dengue collected during a year-long cross-sectional study of dengue patients in Roatán. The result will be to model the relationship between dengue fever and urban/built environment.",

High resolution DEMs and ortho-images derived from Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover science and navigation cameras are represented in context with lower resolution, wide coverage DEMs and ortho-images derived from Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) HiRISE and CTX camera images and Mars Express (MEX) mission HRSC images. Merging MSL rover image derived terrain models with those from orbital images at a uniform high resolution would require super-sampling of the orbital data across a large area to maintain significant context. This solution is not practical, and would result in a mapping product of enormous size. Instead, we choose a sparse hierarchical map representation. Each level in this hierarchical representation is a map described by a set of tiles with fixed number of samples and fixed resolution. The number of samples in a tile is fixed for all levels and each level is associated with a specific resolution. In this work, the resolution ratio between two adjacent levels is set to two. The map at each level is sparse and it contains only the tiles for which data is available at the resolution of the given level. For example, at the highest resolution level only MSL science camera models are available and only a small set of tiles are generated in a sparse map. At the lowest resolution, the map contains the complete set of tiles. The reference level of the representation is chosen to be the HiRISE terrain model and CTX, HRSC and MSL data are projected onto this model before being mapped. While our terrain representation was developed for use in “Antares”, a visual planning and sequencing tool for MSL science cameras developed at NASA Ames Research Center, it is general purpose and has a number of potential geo-science visualization applications.",

            "abstract": "In regions of the arctic and subarctic baseline measurements of permafrost dynamics are lacking and scientific research can be especially expensive when remote sensing techniques are utilized. This research demonstrated the importance of local observations, a powerful tool for understanding landscape change, such as permafrost dynamics. Fifty-five interviews were recently conducted with community members in four villages of the lower Yukon River Basin and Yukon Delta to understand local environmental and landscape changes and the impacts these changes may be having on the lives and livelihoods of these communities. The interviews were semi-structured and focused on many climate and landscape change factors including knowledge of permafrost in their community or the surrounding landscape. All positive respondents stated that they believe the permafrost is thawing. The research revealed that residents of the arctic and subarctic interact with permafrost in a variety of ways. Some people utilize permafrost to store food resources and have found that they have to dig deeper presently than in their youth in order to find ground cold enough. Others are involved in digging graves and report encountering easier excavation in recent years. Subsistence hunters and gatherers travel long distances by snowmobile and boat, and have noticed slumping ground, eroding river banks and coast lines, as well as land that seems to be rising. Finally, all residents of the arctic and subarctic interact with permafrost in terms of the stability of their homes and other infrastructure. Many interview participants complained of their houses leaning and needing more frequent adjustment than in the past. Indigenous residents of the arctic and subarctic have intimate relationships with their landscape owing to their subsistence lifestyle and are also connected to the landscape of the past through the teachings of their elders. Further, arctic and subarctic communities will sustain the majority of the impacts of permafrost degradation as the infrastructure of their communities is affected. Local residents have much to add to the study of permafrost in the arctic and subarctic. Ultimately, arctic and subarctic research will benefit most from the careful integration of local observations and physical science techniques.",

In the winter of 2013/2014 several polar vortexes were experienced in Illinois, US, resulting in periods of extreme low temperatures between -20°C and ‑35°C. Prior to the extreme cold winter of 2013/2014 the region experienced drought over a hot summer in 2012. Four established fields of three perennial biofuel crops (Miscanthus x giganteus, Panicum virgatum L., and a mixture of native prairie species) and Zea mays/Glycine max agroecosystem have been studied since 2009 in order to investigate the effect of climate change and land-use change on carbon and water fluxes using the eddy covariance technique, as well as biomass production of these species. The combined effect of the heat and drought stress in 2012 resulted in severe water deficit of all species (up to -360 mm for miscanthus), which resulted in reduced net ecosystem exchange (NEE) during the drought for all species other than miscanthus. In the following year, during the recovery of these species from drought, miscanthus showed decreased NEE but the other species did not appear to be negatively influenced. As a consequence of the environmental stresses (heat and drought stress followed by extreme freezing), the water and carbon exchanges (such as ET, NEE, GPP, Reco) as well as growth parameters (LAI, biomass production) are shown to vary based on the stress tolerance of these species.",

PolarTREC has worked specifically with OIB for 3 years and looking forward to ongoing collaboration.\nPolarTREC brings U.S. K­12 educators and polar researchers together through an innovative teacher research experience model. Participating teachers spend 3-6 weeks in the field with research teams conducting surveys and collecting data on various aspects of polar science. During their experience, teachers become research team members filling a variety of roles on the team. They also fulfill a unique role of public outreach officer, conducting live presentations about their field site and research as well as journaling, answering questions, and posting photos.\nWorking with OIB has opened up the nature of science for the participating teachers. In developing the long-term relationship with OIB teams, teachers can now share (1) the diversity of training, backgrounds, and interests of OIB scientists, (2) identify the linkages between Greenlandic culture and community and cryospheric science and evidence of climate change, (3) network with Danish and Greenlandic educators on the mission (4) gain access to the full spectrum of a science project - development, implementation, analysis, networking, and dissemination of information. All aspects help these teachers become champions of NASA science and educational leaders in their communities.\nEvaluation data shows that PolarTREC has clearly achieved it goals with the OIB partnership and suggests that linking teachers and researchers can have the potential to transform the nature of science education. By giving teachers the content knowledge, pedagogical tools, confidence, understanding of science in the broader society, and experiences with scientific inquiry, participating teachers are using authentic scientific research in their classrooms.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the temperature distribution along an active subducting plate interface improves our understanding of subduction zone dynamics and seismic hazards. The temperature dependence of the locked zone is an important tool in identifying the region of stress accumulation along the subducting plate. The temperature at the up-dip limit of the seismic zone typically ranges from 100-150°C and the down-dip limit is a transition zone between 350°C and 450°C. In July 2012, Multi-Channel Seismic (MCS) data was collected using the R/V Langseth along nine profiles perpendicular to the accretionary wedge offshore Grays Harbor, Washington. The MCS lines extend from seaward of the deformation front to the continental shelf. In August 2013, we made seafloor heat flow measurements using a violin bow probe, thermal blankets and the Jason heat flow probe. These data show mean heat flow values of 110 mW/m2 over the incoming plate, 30 mW/m2 at the first deformation ridge, and mean of 100 mW/m2 over the lower accretionary wedge terrace. These measurements were co-located with two MCS profiles allowing for direct comparison with Bottom Simulating Reflectors (BSRs) that provide heat flow along all MCS lines from the deformation front to the methane hydrate stability depth at roughly 500 m. BSR-derived heat flow decreases from 90 mW/m2 at the deformation front to 60 mW/m2 beyond 60 km landward of the deformation front lower than consistent with our heat flow measurements, implying active upward diffuse fluid flow. Seismic velocities from MCS data provide an estimate of porosity and thermal conductivity of the underlying sediments providing the thermal parameters for a 2D model. Local but substantial heat flow anomalies likely reflect advective heat transfer within the shallow portion of the accretionary wedge. Preliminary modeling results indicate an incoming oceanic plate temperature of 215°C, potentially placing the up-dip limit of the seismogenic zone at the deformation front.",

            "abstract": "The potential impact of a volcanic eruption is highly dependent on its eruption rate. In explosive eruptions ash may pose an aviation hazard that can extend several thousand kilometers away from the volcano. Models of ash dispersion depend on estimates of the volcanic source, but such estimates are prone to high error margins. Recent explosive eruptions, including the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull in Iceland, have provided a wealth of data that can help in narrowing these error margins. Within the EU-funded FUTUREVOLC project, a multi-parameter system is currently under development, based on an array of ground and satellite-based sensors and models to estimate mass eruption rates in explosive eruptions in near-real time. Effusive eruptions are usually considered less of a hazard as lava flows travel slower than eruption clouds and affect smaller areas. However, major effusive eruptions can release large amounts of SO2 into the atmosphere, causing regional pollution. In very large effusive eruptions, hemispheric cooling and continent-scale pollution can occur, as happened in the Laki eruption in 1783 AD. The Bárdarbunga-Holuhraun eruption in 2014-15 was the largest effusive event in Iceland since Laki and at times caused high concentrations of SO2. As a result civil protection authorities had to issue warnings to the public. Harmful gas concentrations repeatedly persisted for many hours at a time in towns and villages at distances out to 100-150 km from the vents. As gas fluxes scale with lava fluxes, monitoring of eruption rates is therefore of major importance to constrain not only lava but also volcanic gas emissions. This requires repeated measurements of lava area and thickness. However, most mapping methods are problematic once lava flows become very large. Satellite data on thermal emissions from eruptions have been used with success to estimate eruption rate. SAR satellite data holds potential in delivering lava volume and eruption rate estimates, although availability and repeat times of radar platforms is still low compared to e.g. the thermal satellites. In the 2014-15 eruption, lava volume was estimated repeatedly from an aircraft-based system that combines radar altimeter with an on-board DGPS, yielding a several estimates of lava volume and time-averaged mass eruption rate.

            "abstract": "A new method of mapping storm-tide (inundation) pathways and linking those data with tidal elevations in real-time for local managers is being developed. Separate, ongoing studies in two coastal towns in Massachusetts have demonstrated the strengths of this method. High-resolution lidar datasets are imported into 3D data visualization software and water levels are raised incrementally from the highest spring tide of the year to the storm of record +1 m. This range was identified to include ‘nuisance flooding’ as well as present and future inundation pathways not yet observed by local authorities caused by storms superimposed on projected sea level rise. Potential storm-tide pathways are identified using Lidar data but are then verified with extensive fieldwork using RTK-GPS instruments (tested vertical accuracy of 4.9 cm at 95%) to overcome the vertical uncertainty associated with Lidar data. The fieldwork serves two purposes, first is to field check the lidar data with the highest resolution instrument available and, second to verify and document the presence or absence of a storm-tide pathway.\nHaving developed the map of storm tide pathways within a GIS environment referenced to a geodetic datum (NAVD88), a tide gauge or staff is installed in the town’s harbor or other sheltered coastal area and the elevations of all storm tide pathways are then referenced to the local tidal datum. The benefit here is three-fold. First, local officials can use the high-resolution data set that is tied to a local tidal datum to autonomously monitor predicted storm surges and be prepared for inundation at sites prior to flooding. Second, storm-tide pathways that have heretofore never been inundated can be identified and steps can be taken to remove or minimize flooding hazards. Finally, identification of present and future storm tide pathways can be used to prioritize and budget proactive solutions in response to increases in chronic, nuisance and more frequent flooding associated with sea level rise and climate change. This method does not rely on costly numerical models that are often too coarsely gridded to be of use on a street-by-street basis. Lidar data are publicly available in many coastal areas and can be used with little training to new or already existing local or regional GIS staff.",

            "abstract": "What is the value of clean groundwater? Might one aquifer be considered more valuable than another? To help address these, and similar, questions, we propose that aquifers be assessed by two metrics: 1) the contaminated area of an aquifer, defined by high concentrations (km2 or proportion); and 2) equivalent-population potentially impacted by that contamination (number of people or proportion). Concentrations are considered high if they are above a human health benchmark. The two metrics provide a quantitative basis for assessment at the aquifer scale, rather than the well scale.\nThis approach has been applied to groundwater used for public supply in California (Belitz and others, 2015). The assessment distinguishes between population (34 million, 2000 census) and equivalent-population (11 million) because public drinking water supplies can be a mix of surface water and groundwater. The assessment was conducted in 87 study areas which account for nearly 100% of the groundwater used for public supply.\nThe area-metric, when expressed as a proportion, is useful for identifying where a particular contaminant or class of contaminants might be a cause for concern. In CA, there are 38 study where the area-metric ≥ 25% for one or more contaminants; in 7 of these, the area-metric ≥ 50%. Naturally-occurring trace elements, such as arsenic and uranium, are the most prevalent contaminant class in 72 study areas. Nitrate is most prevalent at high concentrations in 11 study areas, and organic compounds in 4. By the area-metric, 23% of the groundwater used for public supply in CA has high concentrations of one or more contaminants (20,000 of 89,000 km2 assessed).\nThe population-metric, when expressed as a number of people, identifies the potential impact of groundwater contamination. There are 33 CA study areas where the population-metric exceeds 10,000 people (equivalent population multiplied by detection frequency of wells with high concentrations). The population-metric exceeds 50,000 people in 10 study areas. On a statewide basis, the population metric is 2 million people (18% of 11 million equivalent-people).\nThe proposed assessment approach is independent of scale, allows for consistent comparison across regions, and provides a foundation for subsequent economic or health assessments.",

            "abstract": "Permeable walls are encountered in a variety of geophysical flows, including alluvial river beds, canopies and urban environments. Permeable walls possess very different boundary conditions as compared to classic impermeable walls (i.e. the slip condition and penetration of flow into the bed). Permeability allows flow interactions across the wall interface, resulting in notable mass, momentum and energy exchange. Such exchange takes place in the so-called transition layer and often occurs through turbulent flow mechanisms. It is increasingly recognized that turbulence plays a key role in a number of important natural functions, including biogeochemical as well as geomorphological processes. However, the flow physics of the transition layer are still poorly understood due to a lack of quantitative investigation of these permeable systems within which physical and optical access are severely compromised. This is particularly true for state-of-the-art flow measurement techniques such as particle image velocimetry (PIV) that require unaberrated optical access to the measurement locations. To overcome optical limitations, a refractive index matching (RIM) technique was employed herein to gain full optical access to the transition layer. Sodium Iodide aqueous solution (63% by weight and RI ~ 1.496 at 20°C) served as a working fluid, and an acrylic resin (RI ~ 1.499) was chosen for fabricating wall models. Measurements were performed using high-resolution planar PIV in different configurations to characterize the turbulent boundary layer and the transition layer. The wall models comprised uniform spheres packed in a cubic arrangement, and two cases were modeled - impermeable and permeable walls that were both rough. To eliminate the effect of roughness, and thus isolate the effect of permeability, the surface roughness of the two wall models was kept identical. This allowed us to obtain a more meaningful comparison and highlight the impact of wall permeability in natural systems. The primary finding of this new study is that wall permeability promotes significant structural alteration of velocity fluctuations in transitional layer, which be detailed, whereas mean streamwise velocity presents no dependence of wall permeability but rather the topographical effect of the roughness.",

            "abstract": "Coastal zone managers, elected officials and emergency planning personnel are continually seeking more reliable estimates of storm surge and inundation for better land use planning, the design, construction and operation of coastal defense systems, resilience evaluation and evacuation planning. Customers of modern regional weather and storm surge prediction models demand high resolution, speed, accuracy, with informative, interactive graphics and easy evaluation of potentially dangerous threats to life and property. These challenges continue to get more difficult as the demand for street-scale and even building-scale predictions increase. Fluctuations in sub-grid-scale wind and water velocities can lead to unsuspected, unanticipated and dangerous flooding in local communities. But how reliable and believable are these models given the inherent natural uncertainty and chaotic behavior in the underlying dynamics, which can lead to rapid and unexpected perturbations in the wind and pressure fields and hence coastal flooding?\n Traditionally this uncertainty has been quantified by the use of the ensemble method, where a suite of model runs are made with varying physics and initial conditions, presenting the mean and variance of the ensemble as the best metrics possible. But this assumes that each component is equally possible and is statistically independent of the others. But this is rarely true, although the “safety in numbers” approach is comforting to those faced with life and death decisions.\n An example of the ensemble method is presented for the trajectory of superstorm Sandy’s storm center as it approached coastal New Jersey. If one were to ask the question “was Sandy a worst case scenario”, the answer would be “no: small variations in the timing (vis-à-vis tide phase) and location of landfall could easily have led to an additional surge of +50 cm at The Battery NY with even more catastrophic consequences to those experienced”.",

            "abstract": "In a recent work, Carrano and Rino (Proc. of the Ionospheric Effects Symposium, 2015) extended the phase screen power law theory of ionospheric scintillation to account for the case where the refractive index irregularities follow a two-component power law spectrum. A specific normalization was invoked to exploit the self-similar properties of the problem and achieve a universal scaling, such that different combinations of perturbation strength, propagation distance, and frequency produce the same results. Using this model, numerical quadrature was employed to obtain essentially exact solutions of the 4th moment equation governing the intensity fluctuations resulting from propagation through two-dimensional field-aligned ionospheric irregularities. In this paper, we present a series of new asymptotic solutions for the case of a one-component spectrum for all integer and half-integer values of the phase spectral index, p, between 1 and 5. In addition, we present an asymptotic solution to the high frequency portion of the intensity spectrum for the case of a general two-component spectrum with 1<p1<3 and 3<p2<5, where p1 and p2 are the low frequency and high frequency spectral indices, respectively. We show these analytic results, which are strictly valid for asymptotically large values of the universal strength of scatter parameter (U>>1), agree rather well with the exact numerical results even as U approaches unity from above. This suggests the asymptotic results are more widely applicable than perhaps previously appreciated and may prove useful in the interpretation of scintillation data collected under a wide range of scattering conditions.",

An important factor is the triggering distances for earthquakes of varying magnitudes from a given site. Data from paleoseismic studies globally (Japan, Taiwan, Sumatra, Black Sea, Sea of Marmara, Portugal, Haiti, California Borderlands, Monterey Bay, alpine lakes in Chile, Lake Washington, and southern Cascadia lakes) were compiled as a basis for comparison between sites. A limited assessment of site conditions such as across strike vs. along strike position of core sites, fault type, directivity, and Q value was included. Global averages suggest an MMI of 5.5 and distance of ~ 50-100 km is most common. Maximum triggering distances were estimated as 60-120 km for the CSZ, and 40-75 km for the NSAF based on existing data and comparisons to global values. The region between Eel Canyon and Mendocino Channel (CSZ) and Noyo Canyon (NSAF) has a higher likelihood of recording at least a portion of past seismicity from both the NSAF and CSZ, though Noyo Canyon is likely at the limit of possible influence from the CSZ. The high seismoturbidite frequency (240 yrs. vs. 500 yrs. in Washington) of southern Cascadia (excluding the Eel system) shows clear continuity along strike nearly bed for bed over 170 km (cores, CHIRP profiles), crossing four canyon systems. The record shows a weak relationship to sediment supply from the canyons, and no relationship to slope angle, recently suggested as an explanation. The average axial slope is 3-6 o for these systems, with a few short pitches of 12-20 o. By comparison, the lower frequency record at Hydrate Ridge (~ 350 yrs.) has a steeper average source slope of 10o, steep 20-30 o pitches and no modern sediment supply. The turbidite frequency at the base of the upper reach of Quinault Canyon is lower still (~ 500 years), but the source slope angles average ~ 7 o, with the upper pitches ~ 13-16 o and abundant modern recharge. The record in the relict JDF system (avg. 0.48 o profile), with no modern sediment supply, is identical. These observations demonstrate that the variable turbidite frequency in the CSZ is not an artifact of either sediment supply or slope angle, and is most likely the result of segmented ruptures.",

The striking loss of sea-ice in recent summers reflects profound changes in the Arctic system. However these climate driven changes in sea ice are not the only pressures on the region as the increase in the demand for natural resources are providing opportunities for investment, with estimates of $100bn or more coming in to the Arctic region over the next decade. Sea ice loss is one of the drivers behind this investment. However the environmental, socio-economic, and geopolitical consequences associated with sea ice loss bring opportunities and possibilities, but also far-reaching change amidst the potential conflicts and risks for human activities right across the Arctic and the globe. To better understand the impact of sea ice loss a multi-sectorial approach is needed. This innovative multi-sector approach to sea ice loss has gained traction over recent years as it transcends disciplinary boundaries, advances knowledge of Arctic change within a regional and global context, has a sharp eye to policy-relevance, and builds strong partnerships with northern communities. Ice Climate and Economics: Arctic Research on Change (ICE-ARC) is one of these programmes. ICE-ARC involves 23 institutes from 11 European Union and Russia.

We perform a like-with-like comparison using three published energy-budget methods to derive modelled TCR from historical CMIP5 temperature series sampled in a manner consistent with HadCRUT4. Observation-based TCR estimates agree to within 0.12 K of the multi-model mean in each case and for 2 of the 3 energy-budget methods the observation-based TCR is higher than the multi-model mean.

            "abstract": "Melt ponds contribute significantly to the feedback processes that serve to amplify the polar response to climate change. A substantial volume of melt water is found in shallow ponds during the Arctic summer on the Greenland Ice Sheet, which have consequences on glacial dynamics and ice loss, however, the water content and subsurface topography of the ponds has proven difficult to measure. The need for instrumentation to provide high-resolution depth measurements in shallow water is addressed by utilizing novel polarization discrimination techniques in a high repetition rate, low power, 532nm photon counting lidar system. Recent advances demonstrate the ability to achieve kHz acquisition rates with a depth precision of 1cm. Use of this technique eliminates the necessity for short laser pulses and high-bandwidth detectors and instead provides a less complex, smaller, and more economical solution to airborne lidar instrumentation. Recent deployment of the lidar system aboard the NASA DC-8 research aircraft, during the 2015 NASA SARP campaign, provided critical engineering data and experience to facilitate further advancement of an airborne bathymetric lidar system for melt pond studies. Signal performance from flight indicates a 50 cm horizontal ground resolution at nominal altitudes below 1000 feet above ground level, and also indicates that maintaining a vertical precision of 1cm is achievable, though these results will be further examined. Results from the DC-8 aircraft deployment are promising, and the modest system size opens up the possibility for future integration into a UAS. This presentation will highlight the measurement capabilities of this novel lidar system, and explore polarization scattering properties of laser light with snow, ice, liquid water. System performance metrics will be evaluated for operating during summer periods in the Polar Regions and discuss the scientific contribution to Cryosphere research – most notably the depth and subsurface ice topography of glacial melt ponds.",

            "abstract": "From September 1730 to April 1736, more than 30 vents formed along a ~18 km long rift on the island of Lanzarote in the Canary Islands. Little actual data of these eruptions exist with the exception of court records and the diary of a priest from Yaiza. Previous research has broken this five and a half year period into 5 major eruptive phases (Carracedo et al., 1992).\nMontaña Colorada – a 150 m-tall, 600 m wide cinder cone – is the final vent associated with this eruption, and likely formed in <10 days (Carracedo et al., 1992). A’a lava flows (including one >10 km long), large spatter clasts, spatter within the cinder cone, and a minor ash blanket are associated with this vent. These are typical of the 1730-1736 vents on Lanzarote. Unique to Montaña Colorada is the presence of a solidified lava pond within the vent, and an array of large (~1-4 m diameter), dense (2800 kg/m3), basaltic blocks roughly 500-1000 m from the vent. Additionally, peridotite nodules (up to 15 cm diameter) are found both within the lava flows and the tephra: the nodules are seen only here and at the, nearby, first vent associated with the eruptions.\nLava flows, possibly from a fissure vent, started the eruption at Montaña Colorada: an effusion rate of 74.9 ± 25.9 m3s-1 is estimated for the 10.6 km-long, peridotite-bearing, flow, giving an emplacement time of ~1-3 days. As the eruption rate decreased, agglutinated spatter collected closer to the vent with loose tephra distally forming the main cinder cone. Towards the end of the eruption it appears the vent was filled with a lava pond, which breached to the north. The large, dense, blocks surrounding Montaña Colorada are here suggested to be the result of a transient explosion of a previous lava pond that occupied the vent. A lack of peridotite nodules or vesicles would be consistent with basalt that had pooled within the vent for some time. Eruption velocities on the order of 70-300 ms-1 are calculated for these blocks.",

            "abstract": "Despite the many efforts to reduce mercury concentrations in the environment, there are relatively few datasets on long-term trends in mercury in biota, especially for the bioavailable form, methylmercury (MeHg). This study used museum preserved bivalves (stored in ethanol) to look at MeHg trends in the Asian date mussel Musculista senhousia and the Asian clam Potamocorbula amurensis, collected from San Francisco Bay, California between 1975 and 2012. For each sampling date, 4 to 15 individuals were obtained from museum collections (N = 156 total specimens), freeze-dried, weighed, homogenized, digested, and individually analyzed for MeHg using trace metal clean techniques. The bivalves were also analyzed for δ13C and δ15N to look for changes in food web structure. P. amurensis specimens were only available from 1988 to 2012, and an increase in MeHg was observed during that time. In contrast, M. senhousia specimens were available for the entire 37 year period and exhibited a significant decline in MeHg in the southern reach of the estuary (South Bay). The median MeHg concentration in M. senhousia was highest at 239 ng/g dw in October 1975. That year was the last year of operations for the New Almaden Mercury Mining District, which drained into South Bay. By the 1990s, MeHg concentrations in M. senhousia dropped significantly to a median of 37 ng/g dw. Isotopic δ15N values did not support a hypothesis of reduced trophic position causing the MeHg decline. Over the study duration, δ15N increased in M. senhousia, which we attributed to a baseline shift. We also observed a decline in δ13C since 2000, which may represent a shift in bivalve carbon towards greater utilization of planktonic sources. To validate the use of museum specimens, we ran a preservation study, where we collected fresh bivalves, fixed them in ethanol or formalin, and then transferred them to ethanol for long-term storage. Although MeHg concentrations increased after 1 week, they stabilized over time, indicating the suitability of preserved bivalves for collection of historical MeHg data. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report a long-term decrease in MeHg in San Francisco Bay biota. Our results suggest that aquatic biota MeHg exposure has declined since the 1970s, likely due to curtailment of historical mercury mining and industrial use.",

Each of the RAs operate standards-based regional data portals designed to aggregate near real-time and historical observed data and modeled outputs from distributed providers and to offer these and derived products in standardized ways to a diverse set of users. The RA’s portals are based on the IOOS Data and Communications Plan which describes the functional elements needed for an interoperable system. One of these elements is called “Uniform On-line Browse” which is an informational service designed primarily to visualize the inventory of a portal. An on-line browse service supports the end user’s need to discover what parameters are available, to learn the spatial and temporal extend of the holdings, and to examine the character of the data (e.g, variability, gappiness, etc). These pieces of information help the end user decide if the data are fit for his/her purpose and to construct valid data requests. Note that on-line browse is a distinctly different activity than data analysis because it seeks to yield knowledge about the inventory and not about what the data mean. “Uniform” on-line browse is a service that takes advantage of the standardization of the data portal’s data access points. Most portals represent station locations on a map. This is a view of the data inventory but these plots are rarely generated by pulling data through the standards-based services offered to the end users but through methods only available to the portal programmers. This work will present results of Uniform On-line browse tools developed within GCOOS-RA and their applicability to other RA portals.",

            "abstract": "Lidar (light detection and ranging) provides absolute depth and topographic mapping capability compared to other remote sensing methods, which is useful for mapping rapidly changing environments such as riverine systems. Effectiveness of current lidar bathymetric systems is limited by the difficulty in unambiguously identifying backscattered lidar signals from the water surface versus the bottom, limiting their depth resolution to 0.3-0.5 m. Additionally these are large, bulky systems that are constrained to expensive aircraft-mounted platforms and use waveform-processing techniques requiring substantial computation time. These restrictions are prohibitive for many potential users.\nA novel lidar device has been developed that allows for non-contact measurements of water depth down to 1 cm with an accuracy and precision of < 1 cm by exploiting the polarization properties of the light-surface interaction. This system can transition seamlessly from ranging over land to shallow to deep water allowing for shoreline charting, measuring water volume, mapping bottom topology, and identifying submerged objects. The scalability of the technique opens up the ability for handheld or UAS-mounted lidar bathymetric systems, which provides for potential applications currently unavailable to the community. The high laser pulse repetition rate allows for very fine horizontal resolution while the photon-counting technique permits real-time depth measurement and object detection. The enhanced measurement capability, portability, scalability, and relatively low-cost creates the opportunity to perform frequent high-accuracy monitoring and measuring of aquatic environments which is crucial for understanding how rivers evolve over many timescales. Results from recent campaigns measuring water depth in flowing creeks and murky ponds will be presented which demonstrate that the method is not limited by rough water surfaces and can map underwater topology through moderately turbid water.",

Diagnostic age signatures enable straightforward discrimination of competing sediment sources within the Andean magmatic arc (Western Cordillera-Central Cordillera), retroarc fold-thrust belt (Eastern Cordillera-Subandean Zone), and Amazonian craton (composed of several basement provinces). More complex, however, are the mid/late Cenozoic provenance records generated by recycling of basin fill originally deposited during early/mid Mesozoic extension, late Mesozoic thermal subsidence, and early Cenozoic shortening. Although subject to time-transgressive trends, regionally significant provenance patterns in Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia reveal: (1) Triassic-Jurassic growth of extensional subbasins fed by local block uplifts (with commonly unimodal 300­–150 Ma age peaks); (2) Cretaceous deposition in an extensive postrift setting fed by principally cratonic sources (with common 1800–900 Ma ages); and (3) Cenozoic growth of a broad flexural basin fed initially fed by magmatic-arc rocks (100–0 Ma), then later dominance by thrust-belt sedimentary rocks with progressively greater degrees of basin recycling (yielding diverse and variable age populations from the aforementioned source regions).\nU-Pb results from modern rivers and smaller subbasins prove useful in evaluating source-to-sink relationships, downstream mixing relationships, hinterland-foreland basin connectivity, paleodrainage integration, and tectonic/paleotopographic reconstructions. Most but not all of the elevated intermontane basins in the modern hinterland of the northern Andes contain provenance records consistent with genesis in a broader foreland basin developed at low elevation. Downstream variations within modern axial rivers and Cenozoic axial basins inform predictive models of Andean contributions from the >1500 km Marañon river to the broader Amazon drainage system, and help pinpoint the late Miocene birth of the >1500 km Magdalena river and associated submarine fan along the southern Caribbean margin.",

Now that the concept of fully three-dimensional air/water flow modelling for real world engineering analysis is achieving acceptance by the wider engineering community, it is critical to expand careful comparative studies on verification,validation, benchmarking, and uncertainty quantification for the variety of competing numerical methods that are continuing to evolve. Furthermore, uncertainty still remains about the relevance of secondary processes such as surface tension, air compressibility, air entrainment, and solid phase (structure) modelling so that questions about continuum mechanical theory and mathematical analysis of multiphase flow are still required. Two of the most popular and practical numerical approaches for large-scale engineering analysis are the Volume-Of-Fluid (VOF) and Level Set (LS) approaches. In this work we will present a publically available verification and validation test set for air-water-structure interaction problems as well as computational and physical model results including a hybrid VOF-LS method, traditional VOF methods, and Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) results. The test set repository and test problem formats will also be presented in order to facilitate future comparative studies and reproduction of scientific results.",

            "abstract": "Management or mitigation of natural disasters is comprised of two distinct elements: disaster preparedness and disaster response. Fundamentally disasters fall into two categories: 1) those whose timing can be predicted and evaluated in advance, such as hurricanes, floods, tsunamis, or even sea level rise; and 2) those that can be anticipated based on analysis, but their exact timing is unknown, such as earthquakes and landslides. Consequently, the type of response and options available for scientific and engineering consultation are fundamentally different.\nThe common aspects of all natural disasters is that there is evidence of past events either historical or geologic, or both. Thus, given past evidence, scientists and engineers have an opportunity to recommend and guide development and implementation of long term or permanent mitigation measures, such as improving the resiliency of the infrastructure and emergency preparedness. However, the appropriate mitigation measures are very much a function of the type of event. Severe atmospheric events, such as hurricanes, typically can be predicted several days in advance and scientists and engineers have a role in guiding preparation of specific additional, temporary, mitigation measures and selective evacuation, as appropriate. In contrast, while earthquake potential of a given region may be well recognized, the actual timing of the event is an unknown and, consequently, the primary defense is in developing sufficiently resilient infrastructure which can be enhanced with early warning systems. Similarly, the type of damage caused by flooding, e.g. hurricane and tsunami, is significantly different from the type of damage caused by an earthquake in that flooding damage is pervasive affecting large contiguous areas wiping out all infrastructure whereas earthquake or landslide damage tends to be clustered with many elements of infrastructure remaining fully or somewhat operable. This distinction is very important when it comes to the type of technical guidance that is needed following such events.\nThis presentation highlights lessons learned from post-event reconnaissance as a part of the NSF-funded Geotechnical Extreme Event Reconnaissance (GEER) over the last two decades.",

In particular, we focus on the regions over subtropical Eastern oceans where ducting conditions are known to be prevalent. It is known that under ducting conditions, the inversion of bending angles to refractivity is no longer unique.

However, it is a challenge to estimate, due to difficulty in making direct measurements and gaps in our theoretical understanding. Here we present a new data-driven, ~1km2 resolution map of long-term average actual evapotranspiration rates across the CONUS. The new ET map is a function of the USGS Landsat-derived National Land Cover Database (NLCD), precipitation, temperature, and daily average temperature range (from the PRISM climate dataset), and is calibrated to long-term water balance data from 679 watersheds. It is unique from previously presented ET maps in that (1) it was co-developed with estimates of runoff and recharge; (2) the regression equation was chosen from among many tested, previously published and newly proposed functional forms for its optimal description of long-term water balance ET data; (3) it has values over open-water areas that are derived from separate mass-transfer and humidity equations; and (4) the data include additional precipitation representing amounts converted from 2005 USGS water-use census irrigation data. The regression equation is calibrated using data from 2000-2013, but can also be applied to individual years with their corresponding input datasets. Comparisons among this new map, the more detailed remote-sensing-based estimates of MOD16 and SSEBop, and AmeriFlux ET tower measurements shows encouraging consistency, and indicates that the empirical ET estimate approach presented here produces closer agreement with independent flux tower data for annual average actual ET than other more complex remote sensing approaches.",

The Southern California Earthquake Center (SCEC) has developed the Unified Community Velocity Model (UCVM) package for both Linux and OS X. This unique framework provides a cohesive way for querying and visualizing 3D models. UCVM v14.3.0, supports many Southern California velocity models including CVM-S4, CVM-H 11.9.1, and CVM-S4.26. The last model was derived from 26 full-3D tomographic iterations on CVM-S4. Recently, UCVM has been used to deliver a prototype of a new 3D model of central California (CCA) also based on full-3D tomographic inversions. UCVM was used to provide initial plots of this model and will be used to deliver CCA to users when the model is publicly released.\nVisualizing models is also possible with UCVM. Integrated within the platform are plotting utilities that can generate 2D cross-sections, horizontal slices, and basin depth maps. UCVM can also export models in NetCDF format for easy import into IDV and ParaView. UCVM has also been prototyped to export models that are compatible with IRIS’ new Earth Model Collaboration (EMC) visualization utility. This capability allows for user-specified horizontal slices and cross-sections to be plotted in the same 3D Earth space.\nUCVM was designed to help a wide variety of researchers. It is currently being use to generate velocity meshes for many SCEC wave propagation codes, including AWP-ODC-SGT and Hercules. It is also used to provide the initial input to SCEC’s CyberShake platform. For those interested in specific data points, the software framework makes it easy to extract P and S wave propagation speeds and other material properties from 3D velocity models by providing a common interface through which researchers can query earth models for a given location and depth.\nAlso included in the last release was the ability to add small-scale stochastic heterogeneities to extracted Cartesian meshes for use in high-frequency ground motion simulations.

            "abstract": "Rapid climatic and biotic events putatively associated with ocean acidification are scattered throughout the Meso-Cenozoic. Many of these rapid perturbations, variably referred to as hyperthermals (Paleogene) and oceanic anoxic events or mass extinction events (Mesozoic), share a number of characteristic features, including some combination of negative carbon isotopic excursion, global warming, and a rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration. Comparisons between ocean acidification events over the last ~250 Ma are, however, problematic because the types of marine geological archives and carbon reservoirs that can be interrogated are fundamentally different for early Mesozoic vs. late Mesozoic-Cenozoic events. Many Mesozoic events are known primarily or exclusively from geological outcrops of relatively shallow water deposits, whereas the more recent Paleogene hyperthermal events have been chiefly identified from deep sea records. In addition, these earlier events are superimposed on an ocean with a fundamentally different carbonate buffering capacity, as calcifying plankton (which created the deep-sea carbonate sink) originate in the mid-Mesozoic. Here, we use both Earth system modeling and reaction transport sediment modeling to explore the ways in which comparable ocean acidification-inducing climate perturbations might manifest in the Mesozoic vs. the Cenozoic geological record. We examine the role of the deep-sea carbonate sink in the expression of ocean acidification, as well as the spatial heterogeneity of surface ocean pH and carbonate saturation state. These results critically inform interpretations of ocean acidification prior to the mid-Mesozoic advent of calcifying plankton and expectations about the recording of these events in geological outcrop.",

            "abstract": "Temperature increases due to climate change will alter two main drivers of hydrology, energy and moisture, by reducing the fraction of precipitation falling as snow, as well as impacting the land surface energy budget. Recent hydrological work has studied the impacts of these two drivers using statistical analysis of basins with different average precipitation and climate as proxies for moisture and energy changes, however, very few studies have used modeling to explicitly separate energy budget changes from snow to rain transitions. Integrated models provide an opportunity to isolate these effects of climate change from natural interannual variability, the latter of which are difficult to tease out in field and statistical studies. Given that much of the world depends on mountain snowpack for their water supply, understanding hydrologic sensitivity to variability in phase and amount of precipitation, temperature and runoff in complex terrain is imperative.\nThis study uses an integrated hydrologic model, Parflow, fully coupled to the Common Land Model, to investigate a hypothetical, vegetated mountain hillslope response to energy budget and precipitation phase changes due to warming. In our simulations, year round warming scenarios decreased mean streamflow by approximately 20%, contrary to shifts from snow to rain which in some scenarios exhibited a small increase in streamflow, indicating that energy budget is the main driver of total mean streamflow. Seasonal warming impacted the volume of peak runoff, with winter and transitional (fall&spring) warming increasing peak runoff by more than 15%, suggesting that interannual variation in temperature may aid in flood risk calculations. This modeling framework can be applied in other regions to provide context and points of comparison for existing observational and statistical studies of climate change impacts on hydrology.",

Warm conditions and warm winters contribute to reduced winter snow accumulations. We examine long-term trends (1920-2015) of average daily maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperature as estimated by different long-term records, specifically: a) UCLA’s West Coast Surface Water Monitor (SWM), b) the Parameter-Elevation Regression on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM), c) the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature (BEST), and c) the National Climatic Data Center’s (NCDC) (VOSE) data set. We also examine climatological values for Tmax and Tmin as estimated by Livneh et al. (J Clim., 2013) and Maurer et al. (J Clim., 2002) as these are related to the SWM gridded data set. We draw on station data from the U.S. Hydroclimatic Network (HCN) and the U.S. Cooperative Observer Network (COOP) and the temperatures published by NCDC as made available via ncdc.noaa.gov/cag/time-series/us for comparison. Within each data set, Tmin has stronger uptrends than Tmax. For both Tmin and Tmax, all but one of the data sets have increasing (mostly statistically significant) trends. Minimum winter temperature trends range from 1.3-1.8 C/100 years across the state; maximum winter temperature trends range from near zero to 1.0 C/100 years. Maps of trend magnitudes at the grid cell level show a surprising lack of agreement in spatial pattern likely due to differences in how each data set was constructed. Some data sets show nearly uniform trends due to the use of spatial smoothing, while others show highly varied local trends. We evaluate differences among the data sets in the stations used, periods of record, and gridding algorithms in an attempt to account for the variations in inferred temperature trends.",

This is critical in order to quantify the land-carbon feedback into the climate system. Ecological observations are extremely important in order to quantify model skill and to improve techniques in which to simulate ecosystem behavior. Isotope observations of 13C are especially useful in diagnosing the ecosystem response to water stress, atmospheric humidity and CO2 fertilization. We test the representation of isotopes within CLM 4.5 against site level observations of biomass and carbon fluxes measured at Niwot Ridge, Colorado. First we ‘spun-up’ the model for 1800 years to approximate site level conditions during the 21st century. We accomplished this by imposing a site-level reconstruction of seasonally varying atmospheric δ13C and atmospheric CO2 from 1850-2013 and site level meteorological observations from 1998-2013. We also imposed an empirical-downscaling of simulated photosynthesis to reproduce the observed photosynthesis. We found that the simulated δ13C of biomass pools was more depleted than the observed by 1-2 o/oo. This finding suggests the magnitude of photosynthetic discrimination was overestimated in the model. The model reproduced observed seasonal trends in discrimination with higher values in the spring and fall but lower values in the summer. However, if nitrogen-limitation is imposed in the model the photosynthetic downscaling influences the fractionation in such a way to obscure this observed trend. This suggests an alternative approach should be taken in order to account for nitrogen limitation. During the last century the model simulated an abrupt drop in δ13C for biomass pools, primarily because of the concurrent drop in atmospheric δ13C, but also because of increasing discrimination driven by increases in the ratio of intercellular to atmospheric CO2. Finally, we identified photosynthetic rate, and vapor pressure deficit as two primary drivers for photosynthetic discrimination.",

The wave length scale is on the order of the electron gyroradius, which makes it hard to study them in detail. In this study, we present a new single spacecraft method that correlates the wave electric and magnetic fields to decide the velocity of the waves in the plane perpendicular to the background magnetic field. From the velocity, the length scale and electrostatic potential can be inferred. We apply this method to magnetic reconnection events in different regions of the magnetosphere.

The objective of this study was to examine controls on secondary mineral formation in a forested catchment in the Catalina-Jemez CZO. We hypothesized landscape position controls the type of secondary minerals formed in that well-drained hillslopes favor Si-poor secondary phases such as kaolinite, whereas poorly drained portions of the landscape that collect solutes from surrounding areas favor formation of Si-rich secondary phases such as smectite. The study focused on a catchment in Valles Caldera in northern New Mexico where soils are derived from a mix of rhyolitic volcanic material, vegetation includes a mixed conifer forest, and climate is characterized by a mean annual precipitation of ~800 mm yr-1 and mean annual temperature of 4.5°C. Soils were collected at the soil-saprolite boundary from three landscape positions, classified as well drained hillslope, poorly drained convergent area, and poorly drained hill slope. Clay fractions were isolated and analyzed using a combination of quantitative and qualitative x-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses and thermal analysis. Quantitative XRD of random powder mounts indicated the presence of both primary phases such as quartz, and alkali and plagioclase feldspars, and secondary phases that include illite, Fe-oxyhydroxides including both goethite and hematite, kaolinite, and smectite. The clay fractions were dominated by smectite ranging from 36-42%, illite ranging from 21-35%, and kaolinite ranging from 1-8%. Qualitative XRD of oriented mounts confirmed the presence of smectite in all samples, with varying degrees of interlayering and interstratification. In contrast to our hypothesis, results indicated that secondary mineral assemblage was not strongly controlled by landscape position, but rather varied with underlying variation in lithology. The catchment is underlain by a combination of porphorytic rhyolite and hydrothermally altered rhyolitic tuff, with an intrusion of Paleozoic sandstone. Smectite content was generally greater in areas underlain by the tuff and likely represent a combination of both diagenic smectite formed by hydrothermal alteration of volcanic glass and authigenic smectites formed in the soils via chemical weathering.",

This conflict was in part fueled by scientific disagreements concerning the effects the oyster operation had on the local seal population. The National Park Service testified on this issue in a public hearing and published two peer reviewed papers, as well as a number of planning documents including a formal Environmental Impact Statement. All interventions asserted the incompatibility of the oyster operation with a wilderness designation.\nAs these documents were made public, they were contested by independent scientists acting on behalf of the oyster company, who publicized their views through several self-produced live presentations to the community, film and videos as well as numerous editorials and opinion pieces published in the local, regional and national press. This activity, which was amplified with letters to the editor, was also punctuated by two reviews conducted by the National Academy of Science and another conducted by the Marine Mammal Commission which unsuccessfully attempted to settle the disagreements by convening a moderated panel of scientists.\nTo understand the nature of this controversy, we analyzed the use of a key argument in the debate, the alleged effect of the oyster operation on the seal colony. Specifically, we scrutinized its content and coherence over time as well as the communication tactics used to broadcast it to show how scientific discourse was deployed to create the illusion of misconduct, which was detrimental to an amiable resolution to this conflict but was also poised to serve as an argument in future land management settings.",

In early settlement periods, humans choose to locate close to rivers to satisfy their direct consumptive use as well as for navigation purposes. However, as population, wealth, and technical sophistication grow, the relative importance of proximity to rivers weakens, while agglomeration economic effects of historical established settlements and the indirect amenity value of water grow stronger. The reliance on locally available water decreases such that people are not constrained to live only in water-rich places. In this study, we examined the relationship between water resources (surface river networks and major aquifers) and the human population distribution in the conterminous United States from 1790-2010 to answer the following questions: 1) Are we getting closer to or farther from surface water? 2) How is the relative importance of groundwater changing over time? Our analysis indicated that humans have gotten farther from surface water, especially the arid regions, where the mean human population distance increased steadily from 13km to 26km from 1790 to 2010. However, groundwater became more attractive in determining human population distribution, indicated by rapid growth in population percentage living over major aquifers, especially after 1940. The latter trend is associated with rapid technological development. This study of the relationship between human population and water resources provides policy support for the sustainable management of surface water and groundwater resources.",

            "abstract": "Small differences in wind speed can translate to large differences in wind energy (WE) revenues, so WE decision making requires accurate measurements of wind profiles through the turbine rotor layer of the lower atmosphere. Advances in understanding and modeling of boundary-layer processes, also needed by WE, requires such measurements through an even deeper layer—at least the lowest few hundreds of meters. An important use for such accurate measured wind-profile data is in the initiation and verification of NWP models. This prospect raises several fundamental questions, such as, what does the modeled profile represent, how was the measured profile determined, and what if the profile had been measured from a different site within the grid cell? To address these questions, two experiments were conducted at the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory (BAO) in modestly complex terrain downwind of the mountains. The Lidar Uncertainty Measurement Experiment (LUMEX) in June-July 2014 featured 5 Doppler lidars (2 scanning), and XPIA in April-May 2015, 11 Doppler lidars, including 5 scanning systems. Two broad goals of these projects were to assess differences in scanning and other data acquisition procedures on the measurements, addressed in (Pichugina et al.) at this conference, and to evaluate the effects of varying spatial separations on differences in the measured winds, addressed in the present paper. Sonic anemometers every 50 m on the 300-m BAO tower were used as a reference for the wind calculations, as well as another profile location. Lidar scan data indicated terrain-related regions of stronger flow within the scan volume of more than 1 m/s that were at least semi-recurrent. This variability produced significant differences in mean rotor-level winds by 2 identical profiling lidars separated by 500 m. During XPIA, four of the scanning Doppler lidars performed intersecting elevation scans (vertical-slice or “RHI”) to create ‘virtual towers’ at various separation distances from less than 100 m to more than 500 m. These datasets show increasing RMS differences in winds as the profile separation distances increase.",

            "abstract": "The Pleistocene sedimentary infillings of the Turkana basin, a hotspot for early human evolution, document both human evolutionary and climatic events between 2.1-1.4 Ma. During this time interval, several early Homo species inhabited the vicinity of the Lorenyang paleo-lake, which was mainly fed by the Omo River, draining the Ethiopian Highlands. Paleo-Omo discharge could be expected to be modulated by changes in orbital eccentricity, causing wet-dry climate variability at ~20 kyr timescales, superimposed upon a long-term transition to drier conditions. To reconstruct climate and environmental changes during this key period of human evolution, we obtained high-resolution records of strontium (Sr) isotope ratios in lacustrine fossils as well as lithogenic grain-size distributions. High resolution sampling of sediment sequences containing abundant lacustrine fossils was carried out at outcrops situated to the east and the west of the lake. The sequences can be stratigraphically linked by several volcanic tuff layers, as well as paleomagnetic data. The Turkana basin is a half-graben and, as a consequence, the lacustrine sediment sequences along the western margin are relatively more continuous and deposited in a relatively deeper part of the lake, when compared to sequences at the eastern margin, where the paleo-Omo delta was situated. The outcrops to the west of Lake Turkana are situated in close proximity to core WTK13-1A, which was retrieved for the Hominin Sites and Paleolakes Drilling Project (HSDPD), and span approximately the same stratigraphic interval. In this study, we successfully linked the stratigraphies of the sediment core and the outcrops, the latter of which were logged in great detail in the field. In addition, time-synchronous Sr isotope records from both sides of Lake Lorenyang display similar trends in Sr isotope stratigraphy, thereby confirming the lateral correlations. However, large differences in grain-size distribution and accumulation of the lithogenic sediments are noted. The Sr isotope stratigraphy, especially when combined with sedimentological data, provides a useful tool for stratigraphic correlation, as well as studies of climate and environmental change in Lake Loreyang and comparable lakes.",

When peroxy defects are activated they become defect electrons (positive holes) in the oxygen anion sub-lattice. This in essence converts the granite sample to a p-type semiconductor. Our preliminary results of the thermoelectric (Seebeck) effect for granite show that positive charge carriers are being generated (positive gradient: see Figure) in the granite sample and that the concentration of peroxy defects in the granite sample is 1137 ± 20 ppm. The Seebeck coefficient (α) is the gradient between the voltage (V) and the temperature (T), such that α = V /T . One end of the granite sample was placed in a furnace and heated. At 300ºC the peroxy defect spins decouple, while at 430ºC the peroxy defects dissociate, producing positive holes. When the positive holes are activated their mobility increases and they move towards the cool end of the granite sample through diffusion. This induces a potential difference linked to a thermal gradient between the two ends of the sample. We then fitted the coefficients of two first order polynomials and a point of inflection using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. This was done to statistically estimate the uncertainties in the coefficients from a Bayesian statistical analysis. The best fit and corresponding standard\nerror of the reflection point was found to be 426 ± 5ºC. This is in excellent agreement to values, around 430ºC, found in the literature. We then find α = 18.50 ± 0.18 μV K−1 above 426 ± 5ºC, which equates to a carrier concentration of 1.16 × 1020 cm−3 compared to the carrier concentrations of heavily doped semiconductors, which are on the order of 1021 cm−3. This then gives a peroxy defect concentration of 1137 ± 20 ppm.",

However, OKM is under high anthropogenic pressure but it is still considered as a first priority corridor for elephant migration. Therefore a comprehensive suitability model was developed in a GIS environment to identify remaining suitable patch of habitat. Considering the ecology of the African Savannah elephant, criteria such as pound thickness, distance to rivers, distance to roads, distance to settlements, Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) were standardized using appropriate fuzzy membership functions and sum overlaid. A set of elephant occurrence data from park managers and from casual sighting was used as test data. About 29.01 % of the area of OKM was classified as suitable habitat whereas 60.84 % and 10.14% were respectively considered as somewhat and less suitable habitats. About 36.5% of the occurrence data felt in the suitable area while 62.16% in the somewhat suitable area. Forest lands were the main contributor to the suitable habitat whereas others land cover types (savannahs, wetlands and croplands) contributed mostly to the somewhat suitable habitat (60.97% to 63.43%). The Habitat Unit Index (HUI) for suitable habitat shows that forests are the most preferred vegetation type (0.49) followed by wetlands (0.32) and savannah (0.31). Despite the high anthropogenic pressure on OKM, there are still potential suitable patches of elephant habitat. Improvement of management and restauration activities could enable OKM to play a key role in biodiversity conservation in West Africa by allowing the seasonal migration of elephants. This study gives an insight on the availability of suitable habitat within OKM, however, further investigation is needed to refine the model and to assess habitat fragmentation.",

However, storage bears considerable potential for catchment inter-comparison exercises, as well as it is likely to have an important role in regulating catchment functions. Catchment comparisons across a wide range of environments and scales will help to increase our understanding of relationships between storage dynamics and catchment processes.\nWith respect to the potential of catchment storage for bringing new momentum to catchment classification and catchment processes understanding we currently investigate spatial and temporal variability of dynamic storage in a nested catchment set-up (16 catchments) of the Alzette River basin (Luxembourg, Europe), covering a wide range of geological settings, catchment areas, contrasted landuse, and hydro-meteorological and tracer series. We define catchment storage as the total amount of water stored in a control volume, delimited by the catchment’s topographical boundaries and depth of saturated and unsaturated zones. Complementary storage assessments (via input-output dynamics of natural tracers, geographical sounding, groundwater level measurements, soil moisture measurements, hydrometry) are carried out for comparison purposes.\nIn our nested catchment set-up we have (1) assessed dependencies between geology, catchment permeability and winter runoff coefficients, (2) calculated water balance derived catchment storage and mixing potential and quantified how dynamic storage differs between catchments and scales, and (3) examined how stream baseflow dD (as a proxy for baseflow transit time) and integrated flow measures (like the flow duration curve) relate to bedrock geology.\nCatchments with higher bedrock permeability exhibited larger storage capacities and eventually lower average winter runoff coefficients. Over a time-span of 11 years, all catchments re-produced the same winter runoff coefficients year after year, regardless of their bedrock geology, permeability and winter season storage filling ratios. Ultimately, catchment organisation in our area of interest (i.e. geology, permeability, flowpath length) appeared to have a strong control on winter runoff coefficients, catchment storage and subsequently baseflow dD.",

In this study, we have conducted frequency analysis of hydrological droughts and quantified associated uncertainty in the YRB under both historical and changing climate. Streamflow drought index (SDI) was employed to identify mutually correlated drought characteristics (e.g., severity, duration and peak). The historical and future characteristics of drought were estimated by applying tri-variate copulas probability distribution, which effectively describe the joint distribution and dependence of drought severity, duration, and peak. The associated prediction uncertainty, related to parameters of the joint probability and climate projections, were evaluated using the Bayesian approach with bootstrap resampling. For the climate change scenarios, two future representative pathways (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) from University of Idaho’s Multivariate Adaptive Constructed Analogs (MACA) database were considered. The results from the study are expected to provide useful information towards drought risk management in YRB under anticipated climate changes.",

It has been shown by past studies that this region is one of the most vulnerable areas in getting adapted to the climate change in South America. Due to the heterogeneity in topography in Bolivia, it is difficult to capture future impacts of the climate change with the coarse resolution of current GCMs. In order to represent these changes at a more appropriate scale, downscaled simulations using different GCMs are required. Prior to downscaling, evaluation of the GCMs is a necessary step to take to ensure physically meaningful results. This is the first part of the broader project on evaluating climate impacts on Bolivia. This evaluation has been done using climate variables including precipitation, temperature and wind and pressure components to assess climate patterns of the region. Climate processes such as the annual, seasonal and monthly positions of the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ), Bolivian High, Chaco Low and South American Low Level Jet (SALLJ) have been analyzed. Eight GCMs have been employed in this evaluation, those which have generated the climate patterns of South America closer to reality in the past different case studies.

This study provides a strong foundation for establishing a path for maturing truly global direct surface soil moisture (SM) and RZSM measurement system over a variety of land covers with limited density restrictions. In SoOp methodology, signals transmitted by already existing transmitters, in this case the Military Satellite Communication (MilSatCom) System’s UHF Follow-On program, are utilized to measure properties of reflecting targets by recording reflected signals using a simple passive microwave receiver.\nWe developed and will test VHF (240-270 MHz) antenna technology for SoOp receivers for 6U Cubesat platforms and perform measurement of SM and RZSM using the proposed antennas deployed on a ground-based Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) simulator boom truck. We will validate the RZSM and SM estimation algorithms from measured data (where RZSM is defined as the volumetric SM contained in the top 1 m of the soil column).\nKnowledge of RZSM up to a depth of 1 m and surface SM up to a depth of 0.05 m on a global scale, at a spatial resolution of 1-10 km through moderate-to-heavy vegetation, is critical to understanding global water resources and the vertical moisture gradient in the Earth’s surface layer which controls moisture interactions between the soil, vegetation, and atmosphere. Current observations of surface SM from space by L-band radiometers and radars are limited to measurements of surface SM up to a depth of ~0.05 m through moderate amounts of vegetation. Developing bi-static reflectometry using VHF geostationary satellite SoOp creates the potential of directly observing SM and RZSM on a truly global basis from a constellation of small satellite-based receivers in low earth orbit. The technique provides the long-wavelength (1.2 m, 5 times larger than existing instruments) needed to remotely sense deeper into the root zone. \nWith a temporal resolution of 1 day and a spatial resolution of 1.5 km, the SM information available from the CubeSat constellation would be a valuable data set for many hydrology applications at local to global scales.",

Our experience covers domains such as solar terrestrial physics, geophysics and oceanography; and the use of general purpose ontologies such as those with representations of people, organizations, data catalogs, observations and measurements and provenance. We will cover how we determine ontology scope, manage ontology change, specify ontology version, and what best practices we follow for ontology publication and use. The implications of following these best practices is that the ontologies we use and develop are mature, stable, have a well-defined scope, and are published in accordance with linked data principles.",

Our results show that the majority of total annual primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (Reco), and evapotranspiration (ET) occurred during the monsoon season at most sites and in most years. During spring, typically the driest period in this region, the sites frequently had high rates of GPP and comparatively low Reco and ET, meaning this time period is important for annual carbon sequestration. Correlation between seasonal productivity measures and precipitation are generally weak, suggesting that some productivity peaks, such as the one in spring, are supported by stored soil water. We estimated the size of available soil water pools at multiple depths using extensive measurements of soil volumetric water content. Preliminary findings show strong relationships between seasonal CO2 and H2O fluxes and estimated available water in deeper soil layers. Our work indicates that relatively infrequent soil water recharge events are key to understanding the temporal distribution of ecosystem CO2 and H2O fluxes in the southwestern U.S., and potentially in other semi-arid ecosystems.",

Bioaccumulation of methylmercury (MeHg) in marine fish\nposes health risks for fish-consuming populations and is a worldwide health concern. A broader understanding of major environmental processes controlling Hg cycling and MeHg production and bioaccumulation in estuaries is therefore needed. Recent fieldwork and modeling show diverse sources of MeHg production in estuaries. We present geochemical modeling results for Hg and MeHg across\nmultiple estuaries with contrasting physical, chemical and biological characteristics. We report new measurements of water column and sediment mercury speciation and methylation data from the subarctic (Lake Melville, Labrador Canada) and temperate latitudes (Long Island Sound, Delaware Bay, Chesapeake Bay). We find that benthic sediment is a relatively small source of MeHg to the water column in all systems. Water column methylation drives MeHg levels in Lake Melville, whereas in more impacted shallow systems such as Chesapeake Bay and Long Island Sound, external inputs and sediment resuspension are more dominant. All systems are a net source of MeHg to the ocean through tidal exchange. In light of these inter-system differences, we will evaluate timescales of coastal ecosystem responses to changes in Hg loading that can help predict potential responses to future perturbations.",

While C lability is associated with decomposition and transport processes in soils in, the stable portion of soil C persists in soil for decades to millennia. To better understand storage, flux and processes of soil C from across the soil-landscape continuum, we upscaled different fractions of soil C. Recalcitrant carbon (RC), hydrolysable carbon (HC) and total carbon (TC) were derived from the topsoil (0-20 cm) at 1,014 georeferenced sites in Florida (~150 000 km2). These were identified using a random-stratified sampling design with landuse-soil suborders strata. The Boruta method was employed for identifying all-relevant variables from the available 327 soil-environmental variables in order to develop the most parsimonious model for TC, RC and HC. We compared eight methods: Classification and Regression Tree (CaRT), Bagged Regression Tree (BaRT), Boosted Regression Tree (BoRT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR), Regression Kriging (RK), and Ordinary Kriging (OK). The accuracy of each method was assessed from 304 randomly chosen samples that were used for validation. Overall, 36, 20 and 25 variables stood out as all-relevant to TC, RC and HC, respectively. We predicted TC with a mean of 4.89 kg m-2 and standard error of 3.71 kg m-2. The prediction performance based on the ratio of prediction error to inter-quartile range in order of accuracy for TC was as follows: RF>BoRT>BaRT>SVM>PLSR>RK>CART>OK; however, BoRT outperformed RF for RC and HC, and the remaining order was identical for RC and HC. The best models, explained 71.6, 73.2, and 32.9 % of the total variation for TC, RC and HC, respectively. No residual spatial autocorrelation was left among the evaluated models. This indicates that the inclusion of all-relevant environmental variables explained the majority of the variation in soil C fractions.",

On annual-to-decadal time scales, ENSO- and PDO-controlled precipitation variability is expressed as a north-south dipole in the western US, with a transition zone that separates a wet Pacific Northwest and a dry Southwest.\nMost lacustrine paleoclimate records suggest that water levels were lower across the western US, due to warmer, drier conditions during the middle Holocene. Lake levels rose with increased precipitation and decreased evaporation in the late Holocene. The magnitude of the lake level changes and the timing of these transitions vary with latitude and local conditions such as proximity to the coast and elevation.\nFavre Lake (2899 masl), located in the Ruby Mountains of northeastern Nevada filled gradually between 7625 and 5600 cal yr BP, after which lake level remained relatively stable for the remainder of the Holocene. Medicine Lake (2033 masl),lying within the caldera of Medicine Lake Volcano (northeastern California) filled to a maximum level between 11,400 and 6000 cal yr BP and then fluctuated by several meters during the remainder of the Holocene. The lowest elevation lake, Swamp Lake (1545 masl), exhibited the strongest record of changes in seasonality over the Holocene, beginning with a transition to warmer conditions ~10,800 cal yr BP, maximum drying between 7400-5500 cal yr BP, followed by a gradual increase in moisture for the remainder of the middle Holocene succeeded by a major shift to wetter conditions at about 3100 cal yr BP. Lower Bear Lake (2065 masl) in the San Bernardino Mountains east of Los Angeles is most strongly influenced by marine conditions. The overall Holocene trend is a gradual increase in salinity, suggesting drying conditions, but is also punctuated by several centuries-long pluvial events.",

Modern experiments relying on laser-driven compression have the advantage of reaching higher pressures than laboratory impact experiments, but up is typically not determined; instead, Hugoniot temperature (TH) and shock velocity are more readily measured.\nAssuming a linear US–up equation of state and that the Grüneisen parameter has the volume dependence g(V) = g0 (V/V0), measurements of the Hugoniot temperature as a function of shock velocity provide constraints on the specific heat along the Hugoniot\nCVH(US) = V0 f(US)[c0 g0 TH – s US dTH/dUS]–1\n where the Walsh-Christian (1955) function f(US) = – (US – c0)2 US/(V0 s c0) = TH dSH/dVH gives the entropy change along the Hugoniot (subscripts 0 and H indicate zero-pressure and Hugoniot states, respectively). In this sense, TH(US) measurements are similar to calorimetry experiments. If specific heat and Grüneisen parameter are determined independently (e.g., from wave-velocity measurements and experiments on porous samples), the TH(US) analog to the linear US–up equation of state is\n TH(US) = {T0 exp(g0 /s) – ò[V0 c0 f(x)/(s x CV)] exp[c0 g0 /(s x)] dx} exp[– c0 g0 /(s US)]\nwhere the integration is from x = c0 to x = US.\nIn addition, experiments can be considered with: 1) different initial volume, as in a porous sample; 2) different initial internal energy, as in a sample heated at constant volume; and 3) different initial volume and internal energy, as in a sample initially heated at ambient pressure. From these four initial states, we get four different Hugoniot curves, and can also consider the effect of phase transition latent heat. Temperature as a function of shock velocity may thus be benefit the analysis of melting and other phase transitions with small volume change and finite latent heat.",

Many of these data models are ancient are difficult to consume with mother geospatial tools. Specifically, these tools are, in some cases, unable to read the files and/or unable to interpret properly the data organization inside them so they cannot be visualized or analyzed. This problem extends to other data products held by the various NASA data centers. A solution that can apply to all these data products across NASA data centers would be valuable.\nGDAL is an open source library used by many GIS software (e.g. ArcGIS and QGIS) to access EOS data products. One possible approach to solve the interoperability problem on data access is to revise the data structure and interpretation interface from the GDAL-level. We will develop a plug-in framework based on GDAL to interpret the non-compliant data. The framework will contain data interpretation functions that are useful for solving the common problems across data products and the plug-ins (an XML file) will handle the product specific issues. With testing on multiple GIS software, we will propose a generic way to integrate the design framework into those software, ensuring the feasibility and flexibility of using our design. The framework would be an open-source package with sufficient stability and demonstration. This will allow the other data centers extend the framework and construct their own plug-ins to adjust more data products.",

However, direct evidence of changes in the ice sheet is limited to sites in or close to the Transantarctic Mountains. Here we present evidence for ice sheet change from two widely separated sites offshore of East Antarctica, IODP Site U1356, Wilkes Land, and ODP Site 1165, Prydz Bay. Between 14.1 and 13.8 Ma at these sites, episodic pulses of ice-rafted debris (IRD), including dropstones, were deposited in concentrations exceeding those in the rest of the Miocene. These repeated pulses of IRD-bearing icebergs indicate large and repeated advances and retreats of the ice sheet during the course of the transition to a larger and relatively more stable ice sheet.\nWe conducted provenance analyses on the mid-Miocene IRD and sediments. At Site U1356, 40Ar/39Ar ages of ice-rafted hornblende grains show that a major ice drainage was situated along the inland part of the Mertz Shear Zone and its southward extension along the west side of the Wilkes Subglacial Basin, while Nd isotope data from the terrigenous fine fraction show that the ice margin periodically expanded from high ground well into the Wilkes Subglacial Basin during periods of ice growth. At Site 1165, 40Ar/39Ar on dropstones indicate provenance from both the Lambert Glacier region and the part of Wilkes Land that contains the Aurora Subglacial Basin. The two sites provide a direct record of repeated collapse and re-growth of ice in at least two of East Antarctica's main drainage basins during the mid-Miocene climate transition. We will set our ice-rafted debris and provenance evidence for cryosphere change in the context of mid-Miocene climate records.",

            "abstract": "We used Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and aeromagnetic data to map extensional structures in the Makgadikgadi Pans in northeastern Botswana. These pans are a major morphological feature in Southern Africa characterized by the presence of low lying and flat topography with the highest elevation of 945 m. This topography was a result of multiple filling and desiccation of paleo-lakes that accompanied alternation of wetter and dryer climate during the Late Quaternary period. The objective of our study was to map the extent and distribution of normal faults using their morphological expression and magnetic signature, and examine their relationship with paleo-shorelines of the pans. We: (1) Created a hill shade relief map from the SRTM DEM; (2) Extracted regional NW-SE trending topographic profiles across the pans; (3) Constructed displacement profiles for major normal faults; and (4) Created tilt derivative images from the aeromagnetic data. We found that: (1) The northeastern part of the pan is dissected by three morphologically-defined NE-trending normal faults. The along strike continuity of these faults is in the range of 75 and 170 km and they are spaced at ~30 km apart from each other. (2) The topographic profiles suggest that the exposed minimum vertical displacement (EMVD), defined by poorly developed escarpments, is in the range of 0 m and 49 m. (3) The displacement profiles of the faults is characterized by maximum EMVD in the middle of the faults and that it decays towards the fault tips. These faults are also apparent in the aeromagnetic maps where they seem to displace E-W trending Karoo-age dikes. (4) At least the outer paleo-shoreline of the pans is modified by the NE-trending faults. This suggests that the faults are younger than the paleo-shorelines, which is suggested to have been developed between 500 and 100 ka. Traditionally, the southwestern extension of the East African Rift System has been assigned to the Okavango Rift Zone to the northwest of the Makgadikgadi Pans. Our results suggest that the southwestern continuation of this rift system might be a 400 km wide and diffused zone of extension that encompasses both the Okavango Rift Zone and the Makgadikgadi Pans. Our study has implication for understanding within-plate kinematics and seismicity of the African continent.",

NEON will provide a suite of standardized data from several ecological topics of interest, including net primary productivity and nutrient cycling, from 60+ sites across 20 eco-climatic domains when fully operational in 2017. The breadth of sampling includes ground-based measurements of foliar nitrogen and vegetation structure, ground-based spectroscopy, airborne LIDAR, and airborne hyperspectral surveys occurring within narrow overlapping time intervals once every five years. While many advancements have been made in linking and scaling in situ data with airborne imagery, establishing these relationships across dozens of highly variable sites poses significant challenges to understanding continental-wide processes. Here we study the relationship between foliar nitrogen content and airborne hyperspectral imagery at different study sites. NEON collected foliar samples from three sites in 2014 as part of a prototype study: Ordway Swisher Biological Station (pine-oak savannah, with active fire management), Jones Ecological Research Center (pine-oak savannah), and San Joaquin Experimental Range (grass-pine oak woodland). Leaf samples and canopy heights of dominant and co-dominant species were collected from trees located within 40 x 40 meter sampling plots within two weeks of aerial LIDAR and hyperspectral surveys. Foliar canopy samples were analyzed for leaf mass per area (LMA), stable isotopes of C and N, C/N content. We also examine agreement and uncertainty between ground based canopy height and airborne LIDAR derived digital surface models (DSM) for each site. Site-scale maps of canopy nitrogen and canopy height will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "Snowpack supplies and stores water for many ecosystems of the greater Rocky Mountain region. In Wyoming the snowpack supplies water to 18 states east and west of the Continental Divide. The spatial variability in physical and biological processes creates a heterogeneous pattern of snow evolution. Understanding these processes within individual plots and throughout the entire watershed increases the predictive power of snow distribution, melt rates and contribution to streamflow. However, on site sampling of snow can be an expensive and arduous process. The objective of this experiment was to quantify spatial and temporal patterns of snowpack evolution and melt rates while minimizing perturbations to snowpack through the use of time-lapse photography via trail cameras. Field cameras were assessed as a method to quantify snow depths throughout the 120 ha No Name watershed at approximately 3000 m elevation in central Wyoming. RGB trail cameras were installed at three systematically chosen sites within the watershed to correlate physical and biological drivers of snow distribution. Five stakes were placed in each site in heterogeneous spots that remained in the frame of the camera. Stakes were divided into five centimeter increments, alternating black and white bars, with red bars denoting each half meter. Images were then taken at two-hour intervals over a period of three-months and analyzed with the ImageJ program. Snowpack distributions, as well as melt rates, were variable at both the plot and watershed scales. Meteorological and physical drivers, primarily topography and radiation, accounted for the greatest variability when comparing among plot across the watershed; however, LAI and soil and air temperature were the most significant drivers within plots. Snow-melt rate increased as soils and course woody debris became exposed increasing ground and soil temperature. These data will improve process model predictions of streamflow from the watershed.",

            "abstract": "Climate monitoring tools designed to help stakeholders reduce climate impacts have been developed for the primary Midwest field crops of corn and soybean. However, the region also produces vital livestock and specialty crops that currently lack similar climate monitoring and projection tools. In autumn 2015, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA’s) National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) and Midwestern Regional Climate Center (MRCC) partnered with the US Department of Agriculture’s Midwest Climate Hub to convene agriculture stakeholders, climate scientists, and climate service specialists to discuss climate impacts and needs for these two, often under-represented, sectors. The goals of this workshop were to (1) identify climate impacts that specialty crops and livestock producers face within the Midwest, (2) develop an understanding of the types of climate and weather information and tools currently available in the Midwest that could be applied to decision making, and (3) discover the types of climate and weather information and tools needed to address concerns of specialty crop and livestock commodities across the Midwest. This presentation will discuss the workshop and provide highlights of the outcomes that developed into strategic plans for the future to better serve these sectors of agriculture in the Midwest.",

Most communities in this region are continously affected by landslides even some locations have disappeared because of this natural phenomenon. This study is focused on the communities that are located along the Xelajú river on this basin. The Motozintla basin has a triangular shape with an area of about 98.6 km2. The slopes in the basin are abrupt ranging from 18° to 45° in about 72.11% of its area. The local altitudes range from 1,024 meters at the lowest point to 2,611 meters at the highest sites. These geomorphological features create unstable slopes which favors slow mass movements processes with different concentrations of sediment that can be transformed in sudden landslides. Many of these processes are accelerated by environmental degradation generated by human activities such as road constructions, land use changes from forest to agriculture or urban development. In this work we focus our research on determining how these human degrading actions increase the susceptibility of mass removal processes, mainly landslides. With this purpose, we generated a landslide inventory of our region of study for the period 1985-2014. We classified the landslides according to their origin (natural or man-made). Based on its location and the local characteristics, we could determine if the identified landslide was caused by natural or human actions. In addition, as environmental factors, we considered the land use characteristics and slope changes to determine the impact of the environmental degradation in the landslide susceptibility.",

Recent activities include the development of new TC forecast verification methods and the development of an adaptable TC display and diagnostic system. The next generation display and diagnostic system is being developed to support evaluation needs of the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) and broader TC research community. The new hurricane display and diagnostic capabilities allow forecasters and research scientists to more deeply examine the performance of operational and experimental models. The system is built upon modern and flexible technology that includes OpenLayers Mapping tools that are platform independent. The forecast track and intensity along with associated observed track information are stored in an efficient MySQL database. The system provides easy-to-use interactive display system, and provides diagnostic tools to examine forecast track stratified by intensity. Consensus forecasts can be computed and displayed interactively. The system is designed to display information for both real-time and for historical TC cyclones. The display configurations are easily adaptable to meet the needs of the end-user preferences. Ongoing enhancements include improving capabilities for stratification and evaluation of historical best tracks, development and implementation of additional methods to stratify and compute consensus hurricane track and intensity forecasts, and improved graphical display tools. The display is also being enhanced to incorporate gridded forecast, satellite, and sea surface temperature fields. The presentation will provide an overview of the display and diagnostic system development and demonstration of the current capabilities.",

            "abstract": "Apollo-era observations of “lunar horizon glow” phenomena have been interpreted as being due to the forward scattering of sunlight by very small dust grains above the lunar surface. High altitude lunar horizon glow (LHG) seen in coronal photographs taken above orbital sunset during Apollo 15 is consistent with a population of exospheric dust grains with radii of ≈0.1 μm extending to altitudes of ≈10 km; while near-surface LHG observed by the TV cameras aboard a few of the Surveyor landers is consistent with dust grains with radii of ≈5 μm within about a meter of the surface. More recent searches have been undertaken for high altitude LHG, or the associated dust population, using the Clementine star tracker cameras (sensitive to visible and near-IR), the Lyman Alpha Mapping Project (LAMP) far-UV spectrograph on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), and the Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) on the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE). These searches have only produced upper limits for these exospheric dust abundances, as opposed to a clear detection.\nThis motivated a search for LHG with the LRO star tracker cameras. Despite being designed for spacecraft navigation, the images these cameras produce are very suitable for scientific use. They also offer benefits over instruments previously used in terms of spatial resolution and ability to probe to low altitudes (both are of order a few hundred meters at the limb), as well as sensitivity to a similar wavelength range as the Apollo-era observations. Interestingly, the initial series of searches have resulted in some images that show bright patches at the limb that could be possible evidence for LHG. However, since these patches appear to typically extend only ~1000 m horizontally and just a few hundred meters vertically, this raises the possibility that they are simply due to sunlight reflected off surface topography along the limb. Initial simulations using a 64 pixel/degree digital elevation model (DEM) indicate that the bright patches could not be explained by surface-reflected sunlight; however, this is being further investigated with higher resolution DEMs to provide the best possible assessment. If these bright patches are best explained as LHG, then the exospheric dust abundances consistent with these calibrated measurements will be determined.",

This trend has important implications for aquatic biota conservation, including the semi-aquatic Western Chicken Turtle (Deirochelys reticularia miaria). This species inhabits seasonally inundated, ephemeral water bodies and adjacent uplands in the southeastern U.S. However, wetland conversion to agriculture and urbanization is thought to cause the species’ decline, particularly in Texas, which includes the westernmost part of its range. Because the species moves only a few kilometers between wetlands, it particularly sensitive to habitat loss and fragmentation. Thus, as part of the only state-funded species research program, this study provides the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) with scientific data to determine if the species warrants protection under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). We use a species distribution model to map potentially suitable habitat for most of East Texas. We evaluate landscape-scale anthropogenic activities in this region which may be contributing to the species’ decline. We identify areas of urbanization, agricultural expansion, forestry, and resulting wetland loss. We find that between 2001 and 2011 approximately 80 km2 of wetlands were lost in potentially suitable habitat, including the urbanizing Houston area. We use spatial geostatistics to quantify wetland habitat fragmentation. We also introduce the Habitat Alteration Index (HAI), which calculates total landscape alteration and mean probability of occurrence to identify high-quality habitat most at risk of recent anthropogenic alteration. Population surveys by biologists are targeting these areas and future management actions may focus on mitigating anthropogenic activities there. While this study focuses on D. r. miaria, this approach can evaluate wetland habitat of other aquatic organisms.",

            "abstract": "The Sierra Valle Fértil (SVF) in northern Argentina is a tilted Ordovician fossil arc complex with continuous exposure from paleodepths of ~10 km to ~30 km. The system is layered when viewed at a large scale: shallow, granodiorite plutons give way to a heterogeneous granodiorite-tonalite zone, which in turn grades into a gabbro-tonalite zone at the base of the section. A metapelitic country rock package is interlayered throughout the magmatic complex, allowing for determination of emplacement depths within the section. Our work focuses on the lowermost domain of the SVF, as it preserves what we consider to be a frozen example of a MASH zone. Here, dominant rock types are hornblende gabbronorite and tonalitie variants, which appear to be interfingered as dm- to 10s of m-scale sheets. Mappable ultramafic pods containing dunites, websterites, troctolites, and minor anorthosites are also present. Field relations are consistent with a complex series of intrusive events. Much of the SVF mafic zone compositional array can be modeled by fractional crystallization where the mafic rocks are cumulate assemblages and the intermediate rocks are the daughter magmas. Amphibole and, perhaps more importantly, Fe-Ti oxide crystallization are likely the principal agents of silica enrichment. Metapelitic rocks exposed throughout the SVF are likely the vestiges of a country rock package that was melted (or reacted) and incorporated into SVF magmas, but field and compositional evidence for assimilation is cryptic in the mafic zone. While isotopic data (Sr, Nd, O) seem to implicate crustal contributions to the SVF mafic zone, incompatible major and trace elements typically associated with an \"assimilation signature\" (e.g., K, Rb, Ba) are sparse. Such elements are abundant in the metapelites and in igneous rocks farther up section. We interpret this isotopic and elemental decoupling as a byproduct of prolonged MASH processes in the lower crust. A high temperature and an increasingly mafic environment likely resulted in the development of a crystal mush inhospitable to crustally contributed incompatible elements. Over time, these elements were thoroughly flushed out of the MASH zone via melt extraction. Isotopes, then, may be the only residual evidence of assimilation within the SVF mafic zone.",

            "abstract": "Pacific southwesterly Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) are in temporary conduits continually form to transport huge amounts of atmospheric water vapor from the tropical ocean surface to the U.S. West Coast. Such ARs’ frequent landfall over California in a winter season can sometimes bring up to 50% of California’s annual precipitation (snow and/or rain). However, the landfall of strong ARs can often cause extreme precipitations and lead to severe flooding damage in the state. To study the characters of AR, a 16-years (2000-2015) AR database is built which records ARs’ water vapor and precipitation dynamic images from SSM/I and GOES satellites and calculates their characteristics including the time, duration, location, coverage, intensity, transport strength, precipitation amount. The above-mentioned information is useful for California weather forecasting and water resource management, therefore this study is supported by and cooperated with California Department of Water Resources.\nThe AR dataset is a subset of the object-orientated satellite precipitation database PERSIANN-CONNECT (http://connect.eng.uci.edu). The PERSIANN-CONNECT put together connecting precipitation images at sequential time steps into “objects (events)” in the 4-D of space, time, and intensity. An AR-induced precipitation are typical kinds of “objects” differ from other such as the hurricanes, monsoons. Our results show that the object-oriented database can capture the evolution of AR and AR precipitation from its origination, development, landfall, and dissipation to recess. Therefore, the AR database is useful for the predictability and prediction diagnostic study of numerical weather/climate models. Our preliminary study using the AR database shows that the most frequent AR occurrences in a year are from November to January; the most severe AR landing events occurred during the winter of 2005 to 2006.The PERSIANN-CONNECT AR database indicates it is possible that we can identify AR 3-4 days before the AR landfall over the coastal region. As ARs exist globally, the results and methodology of our study are applicable and transferrable for risk characterization of AR-induced extreme precipitations in the context of a variable and changing climate.",

            "abstract": "The lack of knowledge associated with the controls on CO2 exchange and responses to climate change of tropical dry forests (TDF) represent substantial uncertainties in global climate models. These ecosystems contain large stores of biomass, which lead to rapid cycling of carbon pools through photosynthesis and respiration. The projected increase in severe drought in a climate change environment is expected to affect the mechanisms and total amounts of carbon sequestered by TDFs. Using eddy covariance CO2 and H2O flux measurements in Santa Rosa National Park, Costa Rica, we investigated the relationship between phenology and productivity in normal year, followed by two sequential drought years, in terms of net and gross ecosystem exchange (NEE and GEE, respectively). Eddy covariance measurements were used to derive phenologic indicators. Inflection points displaying the transition points between CO2 source and sink were determined using NEE flux measurements as well as the onset of phenologic stages (green-up, maturity, senescence and dormancy). Onset of green-up was significantly delayed due to drought; however, the total green-up period remained unchanged in length, compared to the normal year. Thus, the integrated carbon sequestration during green-up was significantly lower during drought. To compensate for this, in drought, the length of maturity and senescence were extended, allowing the ecosystem to reach similar carbon accumulation levels as observed during normal conditions. An increase in physiological activity seems to have also occurred. However, as drought persists in subsequent years and resources become limiting, we expect this activity to decrease, resulting in a reduction of total ecosystem carbon sequestration. The highly dynamic changes occurring in TDFs, make these ecosystems significantly important as we try to better understand the global carbon cycle in a climate change environment.",

Salt compounds are the products of aqueous alteration of the rock phase under hydrothermal conditions and have been predicted theoretically for these objects per analogy with carbonaceous chondrite parent bodies. Evidence for salt enrichment comes from magnetometer measurements (Galilean satellites), direct detection in the case of Enceladus, and inversion of the gravity data obtained at Titan.\nWhile there is direct detection for the presence of chlorides in icy grains ejected from Enceladus, the chemistry of the oceans detected so far, or even their densities, remain mostly unconstrained. However the increased ocean density impacts the interpretation of the tidal Love number k2and this may introduce confusion in the inference of the icy shell thickness from that parameter.\nWe will present estimates of k2for a range of assumptions on Europa’s hydrospheric structure that build on geophysical observations obtained by the Galileo mission combined with new models of Europa’s interior. These models keep track of the compositions of the hydrated core and oceanic composition in a self-consistent manner. We will also estimate the electrical conductivity corresponding to the modeled oceanic composition. Finally we will explore how combining electromagnetic, topographic, and gravity data can decouple the signatures of the shell thickness and ocean composition on these geophysical observations.\nAcknowledgement: This work is being carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract to NASA.

            "abstract": "In temperate climates, ice nucleating particles (INPs) are vital for precipitation initiation. Because INPs may affect precipitation efficiency, and thereby the supply of water resources, it is paramount to have a clear understanding of both natural and anthropogenic sources of INPs. This is especially important to understand in California where drought continues to be a major problem. The CalWater 2015 field campaign, which took place in California from January 15 - March 9, 2015, included comprehensive characterizations of aerosols and their ice nucleating ability via ground-, air-, and ship-based measurements. As part of this campaign, we characterized and analyzed the intra-air mass differences of INPs at a coastal site (Bodega Bay) using immersion freezing measurements of particles collected on filters.\nAerosol filters collected throughout the campaign were characterized by their loading and dominant type using meteorology, aerosol size distributions, aerosol composition, and trace gas concentration data. Samples contained a variety of aerosol influences, including biomass burning, nitrogen pollution, sulfur pollution, and sea spray. This study had a particular focus on the INP activity spectra of sea spray aerosol (SSA). We used the online aerosol data to infer variations in SSA types and heat-treated specific samples to look for the presence of heat-labile biological INPs. Furthermore, we ran the NOAA HYSPLIT model to obtain back trajectories for samples dominated by SSA.\nWe found that air masses dominated by distinct terrestrial source types are not well distinguished by their INP number concentrations. However, we did see significantly higher (up to 5000-fold) INP number concentrations in SSA samples taken at the coast compared with number concentrations in samples obtained over open ocean. This difference could be attributable to differences in overall aerosol abundance, which will be evaluated in future studies. Overall, our findings suggest that an ocean-specific INP parameterization is needed for oceanic emissions and that terrestrial INP sources strongly impact the ice nucleating ability of marine boundary air.",

To document the geomorphological changes occurring from the apex to the toe of deltas, a database of 84 large modern deltas was compiled. Of these deltas, several were specifically selected to gauge the interplay of tidal, groundwater, and fluvial influence on the modern river channels on these deltas. On these selected deltas, we analyzed the river width and sinuosity with distance downstream from the apex using Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) and LANDSAT imagery. Additionally, we analyzed a time-series from the year 2000 to 2015 of interpreted vegetation density using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Since vegetation density and type are related to both salinity and groundwater conditions, we are able to observe systematic changes in vegetation across different portions of the delta, depending on the major hydrologic influences in each area (e.g., tidal, fresh groundwater, brackish groundwater, or direct fluvial influence). In this study, we evaluate correlations between fluvial morphologic changes and vegetation density and type, thus helping to improve our understanding of the significance of tides and groundwater on fluvio-deltaic behavior globally.",

On two outer-coast islands near the center of the Pacific Coastal Temperate Rainforest (PCTR), the Hakai Institute has established a coastal margin observatory to examine the flux of terrestrial organic matter from land to sea – the origins, pathways, processes and marine consequences – in the context of long-term environmental change. The outer-coast PCTR is characterized by an ocean-moderated climate, subdued terrain, extensive wetlands and lower forest productivity than the mountainous mainland coast. Here we give an overview of, and initial results from, a new long-term multi-disciplinary investigation of processes that link PCTR watersheds with the carbon balance and food web of northeastern subarctic Pacific coastal waters.\nBeginning in 2013, we established year-round sampling and a sensor network to quantify – at high temporal resolution – the amount and character of terrestrial exports from seven focal watersheds on Calvert and Hecate Islands, British Columbia. Early results show that freshwater dissolved organic carbon concentrations are high on average, fluctuate temporally and vary spatially across watersheds. A real-time hydrological sensor network shows rapid responses of stream stages and soil water tables to rainfall inputs. Carbon export can vary greatly with stream discharge in these flashy systems. We use paired marine monitoring stations at stream outlets to concurrently track ocean conditions and to trace terrestrial organic matter. Across a larger set of watersheds, we examine the role of catchment topography, hydrology and composition in controlling biogeochemical exports. On land, we use airborne LiDAR data to evaluate landscape controls on vegetation height – a proxy for forest productivity and biomass. We use field plots to characterize ecosystem pattern and process across a landscape gradient. Finally, we investigate the role of microbial communities in the processing of organic matter across multiple scales and interfaces: within soil profiles, across a soil drainage gradient and across the broader land-sea gradient.",

Results from some uplifted central peaks in craters on Mars indicate that substantial carbon was also present at depth and might have helped sustain a deep biosphere. In fact, many factors relevant to deep biosphere habitability are more favorable on Mars than on Earth (e.g. porosity of the crust, geothermal gradient). Future exploration of Mars should include landing sites where materials have been exhumed from depth by meteor impact or basins where subsurface fluids have emerged, carrying clues to subsurface habitability.\nOne of the most astrobiologically interesting sites on Mars McLaughlin Crater, a 93 km-diameter impact crater that formed ~4 b.y. ago. On the floor of the crater is a stratigraphic section of subhorizontal, layered sedimentary rocks with strong spectroscopic evidence for Fe-rich clay minerals and Mg-rich carbonates, which we interpret as ancient lacustrine deposits. The fluids that formed these materials likely originated in the subsurface, based on the paucity of channels leading into the crater basin and the fact that this is one of the deepest basins on Mars – a good candidate to have experienced upwelling of subsurface fluids. Therefore, the deposits within McLaughlin crater provide insight into subsurface processes on Mars. In this presentation, we will discuss the habitability of the martian subsurface as well as the geology of McLaughlin Crater and the possibility to detect biomarkers at that site with a future landed mission.",

In the southern Sierra Nevada, O3 pollution has afflicted pine-dominated forests for over 40 years. Here we report the results of a long-term study of O3 impact on tree injury, growth, and mortality. Our study employed a network of forest plots along a gradient of O3 pollution with recurring measurements from 1991-2012. Over the same period and locations, summer O3 was monitored via partnership with USNPS and USFS, making this one of the longest known ecosystem studies of O3 pollution and its effects. We found that exposure at the most polluted sites declined 33%, from a W126 index of 20.12 ppm-hrs in 1992 to 13.5 ppm-hrs in 2012. The severity of foliar pollution damage at these sites also declined, from 43.9 on the 0-100 Ozone Injury Index (OII) scale to 34.2, a drop of 22%. At locations with lower O3 exposure, damage declined from OII of 16.9 to 9.2. Mean annual tree mortality rates over the 20 year period, calculated with a profile likelihood approach, were 0.5%/yr (95% CI 0.3 to 0.8 %/yr). This rate is similar to that of healthy canopy trees in similar unpolluted stands. However, low and declining tree growth rates reveal possible ecosystem impacts of prolonged exposure to pollution. Across affected sites, mean relative growth rates were 1.1%/yr in 1991-2000, and just 0.9%/yr in 2000-2011, a decline of 15.6% in the second decade. Initial analyses suggest that tree damage is positively correlated with June-October O3, as indicated by previous studies. Further analysis will explore the drivers of ecosystem impacts and roles of other natural and anthropogenic stressors, including variation in climatic water deficit. Understanding the consequences of prolonged O3 exposure on both individual trees and complex forest ecosystems helps identify the hidden environmental costs of tropospheric O3 and potential benefits of cleaner air.",

Because these factors can be of great importance to fault seismicity and reservoir integrity, it is important to constrain their evolution over the lifespan of a fault zone. The Moab Fault, SE Utah, is a prime location to address these questions, representing an exhumed fault system offsetting a package of paleo-reservoir rocks. We return to a well-studied segment linkage zone, Courthouse Junction, building upon detailed earlier work. Here, the fault zone contains multiple phases of structural deformation, expressed as distinct structural elements. Associated carbonate mineralization provides a record of past fluid flow through the fault zone. Earlier bulk and clumped isotope measurements of the carbonate have demonstrated a range of isotopic compositions and precipitation temperatures. In this work, we apply new carbonate isotope and trace element geochemistry, cathodoluminescence microscopy, and fluid inclusion analysis to synthesize the structural and diagenetic histories of the Moab Fault. Carbonate trace element signatures and clumped isotope-based precipitation temperatures allow us to identify variability in parent fluid composition and characterize fluid sources, constraining migration pathways through the fault zone. Distinct phases of carbonate deposition display different cathodoluminescence, allowing us to observe their textural relationships to the host rock and each other, as well as constrain the relative timing of episodes of carbonate deposition and structural deformation. Taken together, these data provide new perspective into the co-evolution of permeability and structural deformation in the Moab Fault by connecting variability in fluid transmission and source to changes in the style of structural deformation.",

Characterization of habitat preferences adds to our understanding of the ecosystem, and may improve forecasts of distribution for harvest management. The Project CROOS (Collaborative Research on Oregon Ocean Salmon) Chinook salmon catch data set represents an unprecedented high-resolution record of catch location and depth, with associated in-situ temperature measurements and stock identification derived from genetic data. Here we connect this data set with physical ocean observations to gain understanding of how circulation affects salmon catch distributions. The CROOS observations were combined with remote and in situ observations of temperature, as well as a data assimilative regional ocean model that incorporates satellite and HF radar data. Across the CROOS data set, catch is primarily located within the upwelling front over the seamounts and reef structures associated with Heceta and Stonewall Banks along the shelf break. In late September of 2014 the anomalously warm “blob” began to arrive on the Oregon coast coincident with a strong downwelling event. At this time the thermocline deepened from 20 to 40 m, associated with a deepening of salmon catch depth. A cold “bulb” of water over Heceta Bank may have provided a thermal refuge for salmon during the initial onshore movement of the anomalously warm water. These observations suggest that a warming ocean, and regional warming events in particular, will have large effects on fish distributions at local and regional scales, in turn impacting fisheries.",

Our previous analysis, using data from 2006-2010, found nearly uniform 1.2±0.2 nanostrain/yr (nε/yr) east-west extensional strain rate along 5 profiles spanning a ~1000 km region (Berglund et al., 2012). We have included data from 1996-2015, and more formally account for correlated noise in the time series, which reduces horizontal velocity uncertainties to ~0.06 mm/yr. Strain rate along the profiles across the RGR increases from 0.55±0.06 nε/yr in southern NM to as much as 1.05±0.06 nε/yr in southern CO before dropping to ~0 nε/yr, within error, in northern CO. In all 5 east-west profiles across the RGR, strain rate is higher along the profiles west of the fault-defined rift zone than it is to the east—an increase to 1.65±0.1 nε/yr in southern CO, for example. Results from Euler pole analysis of sites within the Colorado Plateau relative to stable North America are consistent with significant internal deformation within the plateau, and using a subset of sites, we infer an Euler pole located in northern Utah that is roughly consistent with geologically derived estimates of a Miocene clockwise rotation (Chapin and Cather, 1994). A 2-dimensional strain rate field shows little evidence for higher extensional rates directly across the surface faults bounding the RGR, but does suggest a higher concentration along the Jemez lineament, which is a linear series of the youngest volcanic activity in NM located primarily at the SE edge of the Colorado Plateau. Two zones of possible contraction exist north and south of the Jemez lineament, which may reflect uplift from the NE section of the Jemez lineament due to upper mantle buoyancy.",

In the coastal area of the Sea of Okhotsk in the east part of Hokkaido located to for subarctic zone, many brackish-water lakes are distributed. Lake Mokoto has two-layer structure of polyhaline surface waters and mixoeuhaline bottom water. The bottom water shows the anoxic conditions in summer season. In this reason, the sediments of Lake Mokoto consist of organic mud with the lamination. The 09Mk-1C and 09Mk-2C cores collected from Lake Mokoto at 2009. In the soft X-ray photograph, the cyclic lamina set is observed in their core. The cyclic lamina set consists of low-, intermedium- and high-density lamina. It is considered that this cyclic lamina set is the verve. According to the meteorological data in Abashiri region, the annually precipitation is high from August to September. Probably, the cyclic lamina set is formed by seasonal change of precipitation. In this study, we are discussed about the relationship between the high-density lamina and precipitation by sedimentologic and geochemical high-resolution analysis.\n The 09Mk-1C and 09Mk-2C cores collected from Lake Mokoto show the length of 1.78 to 3.87m, respectively. In 09Mk-2C core, Ta-a tephra (AD 1739) was observed at the 3.5m depths. The 09Mk-1C core consist of organic mud with the lamination in all cores. The core top 100 cm in this core shows the black (N1.5/0), and it seems to indicate the seasonal anoxic environment as present. The organic mud below 100cm depth shows black (10YR1.7/1). The sedimentation rate in 09Mk-1C core increase from late 1960’s for the age of cyclic lamina set. It is suggest that supply of sediment in Lake Mokoto is increasing by land development in drainage basin. Phosphorus flux in 09Mk-1C core increase from late 1950’s. The increasing of phosphorus flux may be caused by excess drainage of pollution from stock farm.\n In 2015, we were able to take the new core (15Mk-3C core). We have observed a new lamina set in detail, and compared with precipitation in Abashiri Region.",

            "abstract": "The Ångerman River is Sweden’s third largest river with over 50 regulation reservoirs, 42 hydropower stations and accounts for nearly 20% of the country’s hydropower production. In seasonally snow covered regions, such as the Ångerman river system, the winter precipitation is often temporarily stored in the snow pack during the colder months and released over a relatively short period of intense flows during in the warmer months. These spring flood events dominate the hydrology in these regions and as such reliable hydrological forecasts of these events are in great demand. However, it has been shown that the spread in the forecast error of operational hydrological forecasts in Sweden have not changed significantly over the last 25 years (Arheimer et al., 2012).\nBuilding on previous work by Foster et al. (2011) and Olsson et al. (2015), a multi-model hydrological seasonal forecast prototype has been developed for the Ångerman river system and applied to the spring flood season. The prototype employs different model-chain approaches: (1) a climatological forecast, where historical observations for the same period are selected to run the hydrological model, (2) a reduced historical ensemble, where analogue years from the historical observations dataset are selected to run the hydrological model, (3) using bias corrected meteorological seasonal forecasts from the ECMWF to force the hydrological model, and (4) statistical downscaling large-scale circulation variables from ECMWF seasonal forecasts directly to accumulated discharge. These different chains are combined into a multi-model ensemble forecast. The different approaches and the multi-model prototype are evaluated against the state-of-the-art operational system for the spring flood season for the period 1981-2014 in the Ångerman river system.\n",

            "abstract": "The Earth’s background seismic noise between ~1-30 seconds period is commonly dominated by microseisms that arise when oceanic wave energy and swell are converted to ground displacement as the waves crash and interact with the continental shelf. Peak power in the microseism bands at high-latitude stations typically coincides with large-scale extratropical cyclonic winter storm activity. However, due to the seasonal formation of sea ice around the continental shelves of polar regions, oceanic waves are impeded from efficiently exciting seismic energy, and annual peak microseism power thus occurs prior to the midwinter storm peak. We utilize recently collected seismic data from across the continent to show that power in three distinct microseism bands is found to be strongly anti-correlated with sea ice extent, with the shorter period signals being exceptionally sensitive to local conditions. Particular focus is given to the Antarctic Peninsula, the strongest source of microseism energy on the continent, where we note a significant increase in primary microseism power attributable to near coastal sources from 1993-2012. This increase correlates with regional sea ice loss driven by large-scale wind changes associated with strengthening of the Southern Annular Mode. Additionally, we use microseism analysis to explore changes in sea ice strength and extent relative to wave state and storminess in the Southern Oceans. Investigation of microseism seasonality, power, and decadal-scale trends in the Antarctic shows promise as a spatially integrated tool for monitoring and interpreting such sea ice strength and extent metrics through time.",

Continued increases in drainage intensity funnel more water into existing drainage ditches, resulting in higher flood stages, more erosive water velocities and decreased time for in-channel nutrient processing. The two-stage ditch is a type of in-stream restoration that involves modification of a trapezoidal drainage ditch to resemble more the features of a natural stream. The idea is to create or simulate extended benches on both sides of the ditch that would develop naturally over a period of time in a stream because of geomorphological processes. These in-channel flood plains provide a greater flow area during high flow events and offer the potential to reduce sediment load and extend the interaction time between water and vegetation on the benches, allowing larger uptake of nutrients and increasing the denitrification rates in the bench soil. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrologic model has recently been modified to represent the two-stage ditch as a conservation practice. Processes that are represented in the model include: velocity reductions due to the change in channel geometry, particle settling, plant nutrient uptake and denitrification on the benches of the two-stage ditch. The model is evaluated using data collected from a two-stage ditch constructed at the Throckmorton Purdue Agricultural Center (TPAC) near Lafayette, Indiana in September 2012. It drains an area of approximately 2.7 km2 of farmland used for corn and soybean production. Simulation results for 30 years of weather data indicated the impact of the two-stage ditch on reducing peak flow rates, flood stage and nutrient loads. For this 30 year period, 1985 – 2014, the results showed reductions of up to 40% of peak flow velocities, 35% reduction per km of two-stage ditch, of sediment basin output, 10 – 80% reduction in total phosphorus output and 0 – 15% reduction in total nitrogen.",

            "abstract": "The element Cr offers a redox sensitive isotopic proxy with potential for tracing past oxygen levels in the oceans. We examine this potential in a marine carbonate section deposited during Cretaceous Ocean Anoxic Event 2 (OAE 2) in the Western Interior Seaway, Colorado. Redox changes are the main source of Cr isotope fractionation in Earth surface environments. Cr(VI), in the form of the chromate oxyanion, is the thermodynamically favoured species in oxygenated seawater. Reduction of Cr(VI) causes light isotopes to partition into Cr(III), which is reactive and susceptible to removal into marine sediment. Therefore, widespread ocean anoxia should correlate with positive shifts in seawater chromate Cr isotope values (δ53Cr), assuming that all Cr input fluxes remained constant during the event. We find instead that inferred seawater δ53Cr values decreased during OAE 2. The minima of the sedimentary δ53Cr excursion coincides with the peak interval of anomalously enriched concentrations of Cr and other trace metals of basaltic affinity attributed to eruption of the Caribbean Large Igneous Province (CLIP). We propose that an anoxic, hydrothermal plume enriched in Cr(III) with low δ53Cr values characteristic of igneous rocks moved from deep waters of the CLIP eruption site in the eastern Pacific into deep waters of the proto-North Atlantic through an oceanic gateway in the Central Americas. Once inside, metal-rich waters upwelled against the surrounding continental margins. CLIP volcanism delivered a submarine weathering flux of Cr to the oceans during OAE 2 that was large enough to mask the expected isotopic response of the ocean Cr cycle to increasing anoxia, particularly in the proto-North Atlantic Ocean.",

Our water policy and management model for the Phoenix Metropolitan Area (hereafter “Phoenix”), termed WaterSim, represents one such bridging mechanism. We evaluated the effect of varying the length of drought on water availability for Phoenix. We examined droughts (starting in 2000) lasting 15, 25, and 50 years. We picked a 60-year window of runoff estimates from the paleo reconstruction data for the Colorado River (CO) (1121 through 1180 A.D.), and the two local rivers (1391 through 1450 A.D.), and assumed that the proportional difference in median flow between these periods and the long-term record represented an estimate of potential drought reductions on river flows. This resulted in a 12%, and 19% reduction in flows for the CO River and the Salt-Verde (SV) Rivers, respectively. WaterSim uses 30-year trace periods from the historical flow records to simulate river flow for future projections. We used each 30-year trace from the historical record (1906 to present, CO River; 1945 to present SV Rivers) , and default settings, to simulate 60 year projections of Lake Mead elevation and the accompanying Colorado River water shortages to Phoenix. Overall, elevations for Lake Mead fell below the 1st shortage sharing tier (1075 ft) in 83% of the simulations; 74% of the simulations fell below the 2nd tier (1050 ft), and 64% fell below the 3rd (1025 ft). Length of drought, however, determined the shortage tiers met. Median elevations for droughts ending in 2015, 2025, and 2050 were 1036, 1019, and 967 feet msl, respectively. We present the plausible water futures with adaptive anticipatory scenario planning for the projected reductions in surface water availability to demonstrate decision points for water conservation measures to effectively manage shortage conditions.",

In 2008, data that includes ~115 km of multichannel seismic reflection and ocean-bottom seismometer wide-angle reflection and refraction data was collected across the central Yakutat shelf in the Gulf of Alaska. We present a high-resolution two-dimensional P-wave velocity model of the glaciomarine sediment and underlying Yakutat basement in the area and compare to coincident seismic reflection profiles in order to determine lithologic boundaries and correlate with stratigraphic units observed onshore and in offshore boreholes. Detailed subsurface mapping of the offshore sedimentary units in and near Yakutat Bay is essential to understanding the long-term development of the central and northern Yakutat shelf as a depocenter, where more of the facies that record St. Elias orogenesis are preserved than onshore. The depositional environment transitions from a wide shelf incised by sea valleys that deliver sediment to slope aprons in the east to a narrow shelf across which sediment is transported to the Aleutian trench in the west. Our velocity profile used in conjunction with seismic reflection data shows transitions in dominant depositional processes over time in the central portion of the block. In Yakutat Bay, sediment velocities are high (~ 4 km/s) compared to velocities farther offshore (< 3 km/s), possibly indicating greater compaction of the sediments in the bay. In the central portion of the shelf, three distinct refractions from sedimentary layers are observed and are interpreted as the Yakataga, Poul Creek, and Kulthieth Formations. In the north, only two refractions from sedimentary layers are observed. Basement refractions are also observed in the north at close offsets in Yakutat Bay, evidence of shallow basement that could be indicative of uplift in the bay. Our detailed mapping of offshore sedimentary facies near the syntaxis provides a regional framework of the geometries of the sedimentary packages and their spatial relationship to major tectonic features.",

In order to better utilize this paleoclimate tool, outstanding questions regarding seasonal biases in soil carbonate formation and the relationship between soil carbonate formation temperatures (T(Δ47)) and surface temperatures must be resolved. We address these questions by comparing C, O, and clumped isotope data from Holocene/modern soil carbonates to modern meteorological data. The data were collected along a 170 km transect with >4 km of relief in central Chile (~30°S). Previous studies have suggested that soil carbonates should record a warm season bias and form in isotopic equilibrium with soil water and soil CO2. We identify two discrete climate zones separated by the local winter snow line (~3200 m). Below this boundary, precipitation falls as rain and soil carbonate T(Δ47) values at depths >40 cm resemble summer soil temperatures; at higher elevations, precipitation falls as snow and T(Δ47) values resemble mean annual soil temperatures. Soil carbonates from the highest sample site (4700 m), which is devoid of vegetation and located near perennial snow fields, yield anomalous δ18O, δ13C, and T(Δ47) values, indicative of kinetic isotope effects that we attribute to cryogenic carbonate formation. Our results suggest that soil carbonates from depths <40 cm are affected by large, high frequency variations in temperature and precipitation, and should not be used as paleotemperature proxies. These findings (1) highlight the role of soil moisture in modulating soil carbonate formation and the resulting T(Δ47) values, (2) underscore the importance of understanding past soil moisture conditions when attempting to reconstruct paleotemperatures using carbonate clumped isotope thermometry, and (3) suggest that soil carbonates from high elevation or high latitude sites may form under non-equilibrium conditions.",

Seismic interferometry was used to extract Green’s Functions (P and surface waves) from 21 days of continuous ambient seismic noise. With the advantage of S-velocity models estimated from surface waves, an ambient noise seismic reflection survey along a line (named Line 2), although with lower resolution, reproduced the results of the active survey, when the ambient seismic noise was not contaminated by strong cultural noise. Ambient noise resolution was less at depth (below 1000m) compared to the active survey. Useful information could be recovered from ambient seismic noise, including dipping features and fault locations. Processing method tests were developed, with potential to improve the virtual reflection survey results. Through innovative signal processing techniques, periods not typically analyzed with high frequency sensors were used in this study to obtain seismic velocity model information to a depth of 1.4km. New seismic parameters such as Green’s Function reflection component lateral variations, waveform entropy, stochastic parameters (Correlation Length and Hurst number) and spectral frequency content extracted from active and passive surveys showed potential to indicate geothermal favorability through their correlation with high temperature anomalies, and showed potential as fault indicators, thus reducing the uncertainty in fault identification. Geothermal favorability maps along ambient seismic Line 2 were generated considering temperature, lithology and the seismic parameters investigated in this study and compared to the active Line 2 results. Pseudo-favorability maps were also generated using only the seismic parameters analyzed in this study.",

            "abstract": "A bioenergetic and mercury (Hg) mass balance (BioHg) model is developed for the Sacramento blackfish (Orthodon microlepidotus), a filter feeding cyprinid found in northern California and Nevada. Attention focuses on the Lahontan Reservoir in northern Nevada, which receives a strong temporally varying load of dissolved methylmercury (DMeHg) from the Carson River. Hg loads are the result of contaminated bank erosion during high flows and diffusion from bottom sediments during low flows. Coupling of dynamic reservoir loading with periods of maximum plankton growth and maximum fish consumption rates are required to explain the largest body burdens observed in the planktivore. In contrast, the large body burdens cannot be achieved using average water column concentrations. The United States Bureau of Reclamation has produced future streamflow estimates for 2000-2099 using 112 CMIP3 climate projections and the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. These are used to drive a fully dynamic Hg transport model to assess changes in contaminant loading to the reservoir and implications on planktivorous bioaccumulation. Model results suggest the future loads of DMeHg entering the Lahontan Reservoir will decrease most significantly in the spring and summer due to channel width increases and depth decreases in the Carson River which reduce bank erosion over the century. The modeled concentrations of DMeHg in the reservoir are expected to increase during the summer due to a decrease in reservoir volume affecting the concentrations more than the decrease in loads, and the model results show that bioaccumulation levels may increase in the upstream sections of the reservoir while maintaining contamination levels above the federal action limit for human consumption in the lower reservoir.",

            "abstract": "We present numerical experiments to determine quantitatively the effects of mineral particle clustering on Mars spacecraft spectral signatures and to improve upon the values of refractive indices (optical constants n, k) derived from Mars dust laboratory analog spectra such as those from RELAB and MRO CRISM libraries. Whereas spectral properties for Mars analog minerals and actual Mars soil are dominated by aggregates of particles smaller than the size of martian atmospheric dust, the analytic radiative transfer (RT) solutions used to interpret planetary surfaces assume that individual, well-separated particles dominate the spectral signature. Both in RT models and in the refractive index derivation methods that include analytic RT approximations, spheres are also over-used to represent nonspherical particles. Part of the motivation is that the integrated effect over randomly oriented particles on quantities such as single scattering albedo and phase function are relatively less than for single particles. However, we have seen in previous numerical experiments that when varying the shape and size of individual grains within a cluster, the phase function changes in both magnitude and slope, thus the “relatively less” effect is more significant than one might think. Here we examine the wavelength dependence of the forward scattering parameter with multisphere T-matrix (MSTM) and discrete dipole approximation (DDSCAT) codes that compute light scattering by layers of particles on planetary surfaces to see how albedo is affected and integrate our model results into refractive index calculations to remove uncertainties in approximations and parameters that can lower the accuracy of optical constants. By correcting the single scattering albedo and phase function terms in the refractive index determinations, our data will help to improve the understanding of Mars in identifying, mapping the distributions, and quantifying abundances for these minerals and will address long-standing questions on fundamental physics in the martian surface (e.g., what is the fundamental scattering unit for closely packed dust or regolith grains?).\nThis work was supported by NASA’s Mars Fundamental Research Program and performed with the Pleiades cluster courtesy of NASA’s Advanced Supercomputing Division.",

            "abstract": "Although globally averaged sea level is rising at roughly 3 mm/yr (and is accelerating), rates of local sea-level change measured at coastlines may differ from this number by a factor of two or more; at some locations, sea level may even be falling. This is due to local processes that can match or even reverse the global trend, making it clear that reliable predictions of future impacts of sea-level rise require a firm understanding of processes at the local level. The history of local sea-level change and shoreline response is contained in the geologic record of shallow-water sediments. We report on a continuing study of sea-level history in sediments at the New Jersey continental margin, where compaction and glacial isostatic adjustment are currently adding 2 mm/yr to the globally averaged rise.\nWe collected 570 sq km of ultra-high resolution 3D MCS data aboard the R/V Langseth in June-July 2015; innovative recording and preliminary results are described by Nedimovic et al. in this same session. The goal was to provide regional context to coring and logging at IODP Exp 313 sites 27-29 that were drilled 750 m into the New Jersey shelf in 2009. These sites recovered a nearly continuous record of post-Eocene sediments from non-marine soils, estuaries, shoreface, delta front, pro-delta and open marine settings. Existing seismic data are good but are 2D high-resolution profiles at line spacings too wide to enable mapping of key nearshore features. The Langseth 3D survey used shallow towing of a tuned air gun array to preserve high frequencies, and twenty-four 50-m PCables each 12.5 apart provided 6.25 x 3.125 m common-midpoint bins along seventy-seven 50-km sail lines.\nWith this especially dense spatial resolution of a pre-stack time migrated volume we expect to map rivers, incised valleys, barrier islands, inlets and bays, pro-delta clinoforms, tidal deltas, sequence boundaries, debris flow aprons, and more. Seismic attributes linked to sedimentary facies and geochronology at Exp 313 drill sites will be extended throughout the volume to map the local response to global sea-level change. These analyses will provide an unrivaled opportunity to gauge the local expression of sea-level change for much of the last 40 Ma and lead to informed predictions regarding impacts of a global rise of sea level expected to continue well into the future.",

The motivations behind the study are that: 1) disordering induced by ion irradiation reduces the activation energy for anion vacancy migration, and the enhanced oxygen diffusion alters the pressure transition point of the material; and 2) a subsequent effect of pressure on ion-irradiated materials provides a unique way of creating a non-equilibrium states of matter, which can potentially yield a novel phase.\nThe study finds that the critical pressure transition point (crystalline to amorphous) of zirconate pyrochlores decreases by ~ 15 ± 4% after they had been disordered. This can be attributed to the bigger unit-cell volume of the ordered-pyrochlore structure, which allows more free space for compression. Ion irradiation also increases the coordination number around the B-site cation, which enhances the phase transition with increased pressure. For Er2Zr2O7, where the material initially has a disordered-fluorite structure from its small cation ionic radii ratio, rA/rB = 1.33, a reverse outcome is noticed i.e., the pressure transition point increases by ~ 5%. The increased compressibility may be due to the defects induced by swift heavy ions. A novel X-phase appears with high pressure in irradiated Nd2Zr2O7. The phase is determined to be similar to the Nd2O3 phase, and is comparable to that found in the previous study where an energetic ion irradiation was performed simultaneously with high pressure experiment. Although the X-phase is not quenchable, this study demonstrates that such a phase is accessible even without having to perform a simultaneous irradiation and pressure experiment.",

These experiments have motivated the 40Ar/39Ar community to reevaluate procedures and subsequent informal lab intercalibrations experiments are in better agreement, but discrepancies remain that need to be addressed. Experiment: In an effort to isolate the causes of these inconsistencies, an Argon Intercalibration Pipette System (APIS) was designed and constructed. The APIS system consists of three gas canisters; one containing atmospheric Ar and the other two canisters contain 40Ar/39Ar ratios that represent FC and AC. The volumes of the pipettes, bulbs and manifold are determined to within 0.4% and both systems were initially filled to the same pressure with Ar standard gases. Each canister has 4x10-10 moles of 40Ar, is equipped with a 0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 cc pipettes and can deliver increments from 0.1-0.7 cc. APIS-1 was designated as the traveling unit that is brought to participating labs, APIS-2 is the reserve/master standard. Early Results and Impressions: APIS-1 has been to four labs (Rutgers, LDEO, New Mexico Tech, and BGC) and is heading to ASU. Early APIS experimental data indicate that the inter-laboratory 40Ar/39Ar age results can meet or exceed the EARTHTIME goal of ±1‰ precision. The inter-laboratory comparisons are ongoing, and will include additional laboratories of opportunity. Lastly, the development of additional mineral standards that “fill in” the age gaps between the existing mineral standards would significantly improve attempting to achieve interlaboratory agreement at the ±1‰ level",

            "abstract": "The carbonation of magnesium silicate minerals within ultramafic rocks is one of the most promising routes to CO2 sequestration involving chemical reaction with natural materials. However, in practice the rate of magnesium silicate carbonation is very slow at ambient temperature. Although using smaller magnesium silicate grains with greater reactive surface area can enhance reaction rates, the coherency of ultramafic rock makes crushing the material an energy-consuming task in its own right. Instead of relying on a mineral forming reaction to capture carbon, it has been hypothesized that naturally occuring nanoporous materials may be used to capture and store carbon dioxide. Sepiolite-palygorskite clays are of interest because in addition to being common minerals in marine and lacustrine sediments, they are natural weathering products of ultramafic rocks, and are already used extensively in industrial scale applications. Due to the presence of nanoscopic channel structures in sepiolite-palygorskite clays these materials exhibit extremely high surface areas. However, in the native structure the channels are filled with water. In order for these minerals to act as efficient CO2 storage materials channel water must be displaced and replaced with CO2. Herein we present preliminary findings using molecular dynamics simulations to quantify the thermodynamic driving force for displacing channel bound water with CO2 and assess the feasibility of sepiolite-palygorskite clays to act as CO2 storage materials.",

We apply this technique with a field experiment using a GPS meteorology system installed on board the R/V Ronald Brown during the CalWater 2015 project. The goal of CalWater is to monitor atmospheric river (AR) events over the Eastern Pacific Ocean and improve forecasting of the extreme precipitation events they can produce. During the 30-day cruise, TPW derived from radiosonde balloons released from the Ron Brown are used to verify the accuracy of shipboard GPS TPW. The results suggest that ship-based GPS TPW offers a cost-effective approach for acquiring accurate real-time meteorological observations of TPW in AR’s over remote oceans, as well as near the coastlines where satellites algorithms have limited accuracy. The results have implications for augmenting operational observing networks to improve weather prediction and nowcasting of ARs, thereby supporting hazard response and mitigation efforts associated with coastal flooding events.",

AMR makes it possible to superimpose levels of finer grids on the global computational grid in an adaptive manner allowing for more accurate calculations locally. AMR codes rely on the fundamental concept that the solution can be computed in different regions of the domain with different spatial resolutions. AMR codes have been applied to a wide range of problem including (but not limited to): fully compressible hydrodynamics, astrophysical flows, cosmological applications, combustion, blood flow, heat transfer in nuclear reactors, and land ice and atmospheric models for climate.\nIn subsurface applications, in particular, reactive transport modeling, AMR may be particularly useful in accurately capturing concentration gradients (hence, reaction rates) that develop in localized areas of the simulation domain. Accurate evaluation of reaction rates is critical in many subsurface applications. In this contribution, we will discuss recent applications that bring to bear AMR capabilities on reactive transport problems from the pore scale to the flood plain scale.",

Therefore, we have conducted sensitivity experiments with the\natmospheric model ECHAM6 and the coupled version of it (MPI-ESM1) in which we enhance the formation of low-level stratus at the inversion layer in the low troposphere.\nThe impact of enhanced low-level clouds is compared to the standard version of the models. There is a direct cloud impact by reducing the incoming solar radiation at the surface.\nThe reduced incoming solar radiation leads to a cooling of SSTs in the eastern tropical Atlantic in the coupled atmosphere-ocean model. This in turn causes not only locally rainfall\nreductions in oceanic precipitation but also a remote precipitation enhancement over north east Brazil. These precipitation changes are associated with changes in the equatorial\nwind-stress forcing. The impact of the wind stress changes on the equatorial zonal SST-gradient and the seasonal cycle is also analysed.",

Indeed they are the most vulnerable pieces of the ice-sheet system as they are in direct contact with the ocean. Until now most of the studies carried out to better understand the ice-shelf dynamics use single geophysical methods only. In early 2014, we conducted a field study using 4 experimental coupled seismic-geodetic instruments installed for a month at the transition zone between an ice-rise promontory and the Roi Baudoin ice-shelf in East-Antarctica. These relatively low-cost, low-weight and low-consumption instruments originally designed for monitoring soil deformation in small (max 1 km) and dense (every 100 m) deployment were used here to detect continuously and simultaneously ice cracks-induced seismicity and surface ice displacements over a 100 km2 ice covered area. We found that while the horizontal displacement is found to be linear in space and time (with a maximum of 35 cm/day), strong periodicity is observed for vertical displacement correlating almost perfectly with regional tide height models and tide gauge observations a few hundreds of km away. Such a periodic vertical displacement (with a maximum of 1.5 m in 5 hours) can be associated with periodicity in the local seismicity which shows the largest amplitudes for the grounding line area explained by the tide-induced flexure of the ice-shelf. In addition fewer seismic events of larger amplitude are recorded on the 4 sites and are localized at the front of the ice-rise promontory. Due to their low frequency content and their occurence at the start of spring tides, they may be attributed to basal instabilities triggered by renewed infiltration of large amount of ocean water. Preliminary results from a complementary experiment carried out in early 2015 will also be presented from the analysis of 15 similar instruments installed further upstream on the main flow of the same tributary ice stream.",

These strategies are often based on design floods defined by return periods, which could be ill-defined if nonstationarity is present. Therefore it is crucial when analyzing existent flood time series to detect and, where possible, attribute flood nonstationarities to changing hydroclimatic and land-use processes. Moreover, the choice of model used to detect and model nonstationary flood regimes can have a profound impact on design flood estimates.\nThis work presents the preliminary results of applying different non-stationarity detection methods on annual peak discharge time series at more than 400 gauging stations in Austria. The type of nonstationarities analyzed include trends (linear and non-linear), change points, clustering beyond stochastic randomness, and detection of flood-rich and flood-poor periods. Austria has a wide variety of physiographic regions with distinct landscapes, elevations and climates which allows us to interpret the spatial patterns obtained with the nonstationarity detection methods in terms of the dominant flood generation mechanisms.",

            "abstract": "Urban lake sediments have the potential to be used for reconstructing history of aerosols, providing data before the start of urban air quality monitoring. In a previous study, the similarity between radionuclide and excess Pb inventories (57 g/m^2) in Central Park Lake (CPL) sediments and those same parameters in Central Park soils (CPS) was interpreted to indicate that urban lake sediment cores from CPL represent deposition of atmospheric aerosols over the history of the park, which was constructed in the 1860s. Furthermore, metal ratios and metal chronologies indicated that incineration was the major source of Pb to the NYC atmosphere over the 20th century. In this report, we compare the lake chronologies for metals to a set of archived air filters collected by the Department of Energy’s Environmental Measurement Lab (EML). These weekly filters of total suspended particulates (TSP) were collected by a high volume sampler located in lower Manhattan for radionuclides as part of the program focused on documenting radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing. Metal concentrations measured in subsamples of the EML filters collected between the 1970s to 1990s showed Pb decreasing more slowly than the records of Pb added to gasoline. Metal ratios in the filters were similar to the ratios measured in CPL sediments; the Pb to Sn ratios were roughly 20:1 and the Pb to Zn ratios were in close to 1. The similarity of the ratios provides additional solid support that the CP Lake sediment cores reflect atmospheric inputs. The enrichment of Pb in the large aerosol particle fraction (TSP), relative to fine PM2.5 fraction, demonstrates that the resuspended NYC soils and their historical contaminant burden, are the primary, current source of Pb to NYC air.",

The model consists of the deterministic part showing the monthly sensitivity plus a long-term forcing and the stochastic noise part implying short-time processes such as weather. The monthly stability, the magnitude of the noise and the long-term forcing are determined by the statistics deduced from the original data based on the assumption that there exists a clear distinction among time-scales in the data. The generally constructed model is applied to global and hemisphere- averaged surface temperature spanning 133 years. The non-autonomous stochastic model successfully obtains the seasonal statistics similar to those from the data and constructs the long-term forcing, which could be interpreted as an additional heat flux caused by on-going global warming. This result is very similar to that given by global climate models. In particular, the spectral analysis of the long-term forcing shows the characteristics of the flicker noise. It may suggest that the spatial and temporal distribution of the long-term heat flux can be explained by self-organised criticality. ",

Funded through NSF's EarthCube initiative, the GeoWS project aims to develop common web service interfaces for data access across hydrology, geodesy, seismology, marine geophysics, atmospheric science and other areas. The GeoCSV format is an essential part of delivering data via simple web services for discovery and utilization by both humans and machines. As most geoscience disciplines have developed and use data formats specific for their needs, tabular text data can play a key role as a lowest common denominator useful for exchanging and integrating data across sub-domains. The design starts with a core definition compatible with best practices described by the W3C - CSV on the Web Working Group (CSVW). Compatibility with CSVW is intended to ensure the broadest usability of data expressed as GeoCSV. An optional, simple, but limited metadata description mechanism was added to allow inclusion of important metadata with comma separated data, while staying with the definition of a \"dialect\" by CSVW. The format is designed both for creating new datasets and to annotate data sets already in a tabular text format such that they are compliant with GeoCSV.",

            "abstract": "As part of a NASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) award to the University of Central Florida and Deep Space Industries, we are developing a family of asteroid regolith simulants based on meteorite mineralogies but using terrestrial materials, to support NASAs exploration goals for asteroids. We are planning on developing five types of simulant based on the following meteorite types: CI-carbonaceous chondrite, CM-carbonaceous chondrite, Tagish Lake, L-ordinary chondrite, and iron. To the greatest extent reasonable (based on input costs and health/safety) we will duplicate the mineralogy, chemistry, oxidation state, hydration state, and particle size distribution found in regolith meteorites of each type. The major limitations on the fidelity of simulant will be health and safety issues for the users of the simulants. For example, much of the organic component of volatile-rich carbonaceous chondrites are in the form of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs). These are essentially combustion residues, possibly of complex regolith processing, with more carbon atoms than hydrogen. However, many PAHs are toxic, carcinogenic, and/or mutagenic. Several are banned in the European Union and California. This sort of material would endanger users, be impossible to distribute, and not make a useable regolith simulant. There are several reasonable, no-toxic alternatives to PAHs. We will report on the status of simulant development and the progress of our validation experiments.",

            "abstract": "Geologists routinely characterize soil and paleosol samples by their bulk elemental composition via X-ray diffraction or mass spectrometry. As a result, pedogenic weathering indices based on these bulk analyses, such as the chemical index of alteration, have been widely employed in paleosol studies in order to reconstruct paleoclimate variables such as mean annual temperature and mean annual precipitation. These pedogenic weathering indices provide valuable climate estimates for terrestrial environments where climate proxies are sparse. However, because soil properties are a function of a large number of environmental variables, pedogenic weathering indices tend to have only modest predictive power for individual climate variables. Past researchers have used various datasets to develop these climate functions, notably the Marbut (1935) dataset. In this study, we used the Smith at al. (2013) dataset to examine the effectiveness of these weathering indices in estimating current climate variables and soil properties. The Smith et al. dataset includes elemental analysis (via mass spectrometry) and mineralogical analysis (via X-ray diffraction) for A and C horizons for 4857 soils in the coterminous United States. The Smith et al. data was collected for baseline estimation of environmental contaminants, and lacks B-horizon characterization. The data was joined to climate variables calculated from the PRISM dataset, and to additional soil variables from the United States Department of Agriculture's SSURGO database. The data was divided into a training subset and a testing subset using generalized random tesselation stratified sampling. Correlations between pedogenic indices and climate variables are generally modest, indicating that much of the variability in climate data is not explained by these variables. Simple indices such as the chemical index of alteration tend to perform better than experimental pedogenic weathering indices that account for differences between the A and C horizon. There are large differences in model performance between the eastern and western United States, suggesting that models developed for the East may perform poorly in the West, and vice versa.",

The simulation computes electrostatic potentials by considering the hydrodynamics, chemical kinetics and charge transport for a distribution of particle sizes entrained in the expanding gas cloud. A separate hybrid fluid/kinetic plasma code is employed to simulate the avalanche breakdown between charge pockets.

The rest is taken up by vegetation and the ocean. The precise contribution of the two sinks, and their location and year-to-year variability are, however, not well understood. We use two different approaches, batch Bayesian synthesis inversion and variational data assimilation, to deduce the global spatiotemporal distributions of CO2 fluxes during 2009-2010. One of our objectives is to assess different sources of uncertainties in inferred fluxes, including uncertainties in prior flux estimates and observations, and differences in inversion techniques. For prior constraints, we utilize fluxes and uncertainties from the CASA-GFED model of the terrestrial biosphere and biomass burning driven by satellite observations and interannually varying meteorology. We also use measurement-based ocean flux estimates and two sets of fixed fossil CO2 emissions. Here, our inversions incorporate column CO2 measurements from the GOSAT satellite (ACOS retrieval, filtered and bias-corrected) and in situ observations (individual flask and afternoon-average continuous observations) to estimate fluxes in 108 regions over 8-day intervals for the batch inversion and at 3° x 3.75° weekly for the variational system. Relationships between fluxes and atmospheric concentrations are derived consistently for the two inversion systems using the PCTM atmospheric transport model driven by meteorology from the MERRA reanalysis. We compare the posterior fluxes and uncertainties derived using different data sets and the two inversion approaches, and evaluate the posterior atmospheric concentrations against independent data including aircraft measurements. The optimized fluxes generally resemble those from other studies. For example, the results indicate that the terrestrial biosphere is a net CO2 sink, and a GOSAT-only inversion suggests a shift in the global sink from the tropics/south to the north relative to the prior and to an in-situ-only inversion. We also find a smaller terrestrial sink in higher-latitude northern regions in boreal summer of 2010 relative to 2009.",

            "abstract": "As K12 teachers seek ways to provide meaningful learning opportunities for students to understand climate change, they often face barriers to teaching about climate and/or lack relevant resources on the topic. In an effort to better understand how to support K12 teachers in this role, a survey about “teaching climate change” was created and distributed. The results of the 2015 survey are presented, based on more than 200 teacher responses. Respondents included National Science Teachers Association (NSTA) members, 2015 STEM Teacher and Researcher (STAR) Fellows and science teachers from several U.S. school districts.\nThe survey identifies teachers’ perceived barriers to teaching climate change, for example difficulty integrating climate change concepts into specific core courses (i.e., biology), as well as desired classroom resources, such as climate change project-based learning (PBL) units that connect to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Survey results also indicate possible pathways for federal agencies, non-profits, universities and other organizations to have a more significant impact on climate literacy in the classroom.\nIn response to the survey results, a comprehensive guide is being created to teach climate change in K12 classrooms, addressing barriers and providing resources for teachers. For example, in the survey, some teachers indicated that they lacked confidence in their content knowledge and understanding of climate change, so this guide provides web-based resources to help further an educator’s understanding of climate change, as well as opportunities for relevant online and in-person professional development. In this quest for desired resources to teach climate change, gaps in accessible and available online resources are being identified. Information about these “gaps” may help organizations that strive to support climate literacy in the classroom better serve teachers.",

            "abstract": "Experimental evolution of microorganisms in controlled microenvironments serves as a powerful tool for understanding the relationship between micro-scale microbial interactions as well as local-to global-scale environmental factors. In response to iterative and targeted environmental pressures, mutagenesis drives the emergence of novel phenotypes. Current methods to induce expression of these phenotypes require repetitive and time intensive procedures and do not allow for the continuous monitoring of conditions such as optical density, pH and temperature.\nTo address this shortcoming, an Automated Dynamic Directed Evolution Chamber is being developed. It will initially produce Escherichia coli cells with an elevated UV-C resistance phenotype that will ultimately be adapted for different organisms as well as studying environmental effects.\nA useful phenotype and environmental factor for examining this relationship is UV-C resistance and exposure. In order to build a baseline for the device’s operational parameters, a UV-C assay was performed on six E. coli replicates with three exposure fluxes across seven iterations. The fluxes included a 0 second exposure (control), 6 seconds at 3.3 J/m2/s and 40 seconds at 0.5 J/m2/s. After each iteration the cells were regrown and tested for UV-C resistance. We sought to quantify the increase and variability of UV-C resistance among different fluxes, and observe changes in each replicate at each iteration in terms of variance.\nUnder different fluxes, we observed that the 0s control showed no significant increase in resistance, while the 6s/40s fluxes showed increased resistance as the number of iterations increased. A one-million fold increase in survivability was observed after seven iterations. Through statistical analysis using Spearman’s rank correlation, the 40s exposure showed signs of more consistently increased resistance, but seven iterations was insufficient to demonstrate statistical significance; to test this further, our experiments will include more iterations. Furthermore, we plan to sequence all the replicants. As adaptation dynamics under intense UV exposure leads to high rate of change, it would be useful to observe differences in tolerance-related and non-tolerance-related genes between the original and UV resistant strains.",

Cultivation-independent approaches allow us to extract this information through reconstruction of thousands of genomes from a microbial community. Analysis of these genomes, in turn, gives an indication of the organisms present and their functional roles. However, metagenomic analyses can currently deliver thousands of different genomes that range in abundance/importance, requiring the identification and assimilation of key physiologies and metabolisms to be represented as traits for successful simulation of subsurface processes.\nHere we focus on incorporating -omics information into BioCrunch, a genome-informed trait-based model that represents the diversity of microbial functional processes within a reactive transport framework. This approach models the rate of nutrient uptake and the thermodynamics of coupled electron donors and acceptors for a range of microbial metabolisms including heterotrophs and chemolithotrophs. Metabolism of exogenous substrates fuels catabolic and anabolic processes, with the proportion of energy used for cellular maintenance, respiration, biomass development, and enzyme production based upon dynamic intracellular and environmental conditions. This internal resource partitioning represents a trade-off against biomass formation and results in microbial community emergence across a fitness landscape.\nBiocrunch was used here in simulations that included organisms and metabolic pathways derived from a dataset of ~1200 non-redundant genomes reflecting a microbial community in a floodplain aquifer. Metagenomic data was directly used to parameterize trait values related to growth and to identify trait linkages associated with respiration, fermentation, and key enzymatic functions such as plant polymer degradation. Simulations spanned a range of metabolic complexities and highlight benefits originating from simulations including a larger number of organisms that more appropriately reflect the in situ microbial community.",

The capacity and mechanism of attenuation is explored in this sequential leaching study of different particle size fractions of chromium contaminated sediments and similar uncontaminated sediments from the regional aquifer near Los Alamos, New Mexico. Using this leaching protocol each sediment sample is split in two: one half is leached three times using a 0.1 M sodium bicarbonate/carbonate solution, while the second half is leached three times using a 0.01 M nitric acid, followed by two consecutively increasing magnitudes of nitric acid concentrations. Based on the amphoteric nature of chromium, alkaline leaching is used to establish the amount of Cr(VI) sorbed on the sediment, whereas acid leaching is used to establish the amount of Cr(III). The weak acid is predicted to release the attenuated anthropogenic Cr(III), without affecting Cr-bearing minerals. The sequential, stronger, acid is anticipated to leach Cr(III)-incorporated in the minerals. The efficiency and validation of the sequential leaching method is assessed by comparing the leaching behavior of bentonite and biotite samples, with and without loaded Cr(VI). A 97% chromium mass balance of leached Cr(VI)-loaded bentonite and biotite proves the viability of this method for further use on leaching contaminated sediments. By comparing contaminated and uncontaminated sediment leachate results, of chromium and other major and trace elements, the signature of anthropogenic chromium is determined. Further mineralogical characterization of the sediments provides a quantitative measure of the natural attenuation capacity for chromium. Understanding these results is pertinent in delineating the optimal procedure for the remediation of Cr(VI) in the regional aquifer near Los Alamos.",

            "abstract": "Endangered Central California Coast coho salmon benefit from summertime occurrences of fog and low cloud cover (FLCC). Watershed hydrology is a critical factor affecting population dynamics of coho and FLCC affects this in three ways. First, streams remain cooler in late summer when shaded by FLCC—high temperatures are lethal to coho. Second, more water reaches the stream when FLCC shades riparian vegetation thereby reducing evapotranspiration. Third, fog drip adds water directly into streams. The increased stream flow can be a critical resource in late summer when coastal watersheds are at their lowest subsurface discharge rate. Associated low stream flows can trap juvenile coho in pools, resulting in high rates of mortality due to higher predation exposure, overheating and, if the pool dries up, lack of habitat.\nThe 2012 National Marine Fisheries Service Final Recovery Plan identified 75 watersheds that historically supported coho salmon. The recovery team used biological and environmental metrics to identify subwatersheds where recovery action implementation had the highest probability of improving coho salmon population survival. These subwatersheds were classified into three categories: Core (n=89), Phase I (n=93), or Phase II (N=157) (CPP).\nDifferences among the CPP-rated subwatersheds were explored using FLCC frequency data, derived from a decade of hourly weather satellites, combined with groundwater recharge metrics from the Basin Characterization Model (BCM) to provide additional environmental dimensions. Average summertime (June, July, August, and September) FLCC in the subwatersheds ranged from 2.2 -11.3 hrs/day and cumulative groundwater recharge ranged from 6 mm -894 mm. A two dimensional scatterplot (x = FLCC; y = recharge) of subwatersheds divided into 4 quadrants , (low FLCC – low recharge, low – high, high – low, high – high, ) shows 11 Core, 6 Phase I, and 5 Phase II areas in the high – high quadrant. The majority of Phase I and II areas are in the low – low quadrant whereas the majority of Core areas are in low – high.\nFuture conditions will impact the capacity of these subwatershed areas to continue to support coho population. FLCC metrics for interannual variation and future forecasts of recharge and air temperatures were used to analyze the difference in capacity (resilience) among areas.",

            "abstract": "In the past decades air traffic has been substantially growing affecting air quality and climate. According to the International Civil Aviation Authority (ICAO), in the next few years world passenger and freight traffic is expected to increase annually by 6-7% and 4-5%, respectively. One possibility to reduce aviation impacts on the atmosphere and climate might be the replacement of fossil fuels by alternative fuels. However, so far the effects of alternative fuels on particle emissions from aircraft engines and their ability to form contrails remain uncertain.\nTo study the effects of alternative fuels on particle emissions and the formation of contrails, the Alternative Fuel Effects on Contrails and Cruise Emissions (ACCESS) field experiment was conducted in California. In May 2014, the DLR Falcon 20 and the NASA HU-25 jet aircraft were instrumented with an extended aerosol and trace gas payload probing different types of fuels including JP-8 and JP-8 blended with HEFA (Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids) while the NASA DC8 aircraft acted as the source aircraft for ACCESS-2. Emission measurements were taken in the DC8 exhaust plumes at aircraft cruise level between 9-12 km altitude and at distances between 50 m and 20 km behind the DC8 engines.\nHere, we will present results from the ACCESS-2 aerosol measurements which show a 30-60% reduction of the non-volatile (mainly black carbon) particle number concentration in the aircraft exhaust for the HEFA-blend compared to conventional JP-8 fuel. Size-resolved particle emission indices show the largest reductions for larger particle sizes suggesting that the HEFA blend contains fewer and smaller black carbon particles. We will combine the airborne measurements with a parameterization of deposition nucleation developed during a number of ice nucleation experiments at the AIDA chamber in Karlsruhe and discuss the impact of alternative fuels on the abundance of potential ice nuclei at cruise conditions.",

            "abstract": "Recent observational and modeling studies have shown that the diurnal cycle of radiation may be fundamentally linked to structural changes in the lifetime of a tropical cyclone. While these studies suggest that an underlying mechanism within the storm may exist, the dynamics for this response are still largely unexplained. Previous modeling studies were limited due to model configuration (e.g., initial and boundary conditions) as well as to radiative parameterization schemes. In this presentation, two new investigations are discussed to reexamine the role of the daily cycle of radiation on axisymmetric hurricane structure.\nIn the first study, a tropical cyclone lasting 324 days is generated in Cloud Model 1 (CM1, see Bryan and Rotunno 2009) to quantify a tropical cyclone diurnal signal. A coherent response is observed in the temperature, wind, and cloud ice fields that accounts for up to a third of the overall variance. Composite analysis of each hour of the day shows a diurnal cycle in the storm intensity that, relative to the mean, intensifies in the early hours of the morning and is consistent with observational studies. Examination of the radial and vertical wind suggests two distinct circulations forced by the diurnal cycle: (1) a radiatively-driven circulation in the outflow layer due to absorption of solar radiation, and (2) a convectively-driven circulation within the storm due to latent heating. These responses are coupled and are periodic with respect to the diurnal cycle.\nIn the second study, following the method of Pendergrass and Willoughby (2009) and Willoughby (2009), hypothesis tests using various prescribed, periodic heating distributions are performed to examine the dynamical response of the storm to radiation. Results reveal significant changes to the secondary-circulation structure of the storm, as well as to the intensification of the primary vortex. Sensitivity to the chosen heating distribution as well as to the initial vortex are discussed, and a possible explanation for the diurnal response in axisymmetric tropical cyclones is introduced.",

            "abstract": "Today, more than ever, an integrated cross-disciplinary approach is necessary to explain changes in the Arctic and understand their implications for the human environment. Advanced training and active involvement of early-career scientists is an important component of this cross-disciplinary approach. This effort led by the International Arctic Research Center at the University of Alaska Fairbanks (UAF) started in 2003. The newly supported project in 2013 is planning four summer schools (one per year) focused on four themes in four different Arctic locations. It provides the participants with an interdisciplinary perspective on Arctic change and its impacts on diverse sectors of the North. It is linked to other ongoing long-term observational and educational programs (e.g. NABOS, Nansen and Amundsen Basins Observational System; LTER, Long Term Environmental Research) and targets young scientists by using the interdisciplinary and place-based setting to broaden their perspective on Arctic change and to enhance their communication skills. Each course for 15-20 people consists of classroom and hands-on components and work with a multidisciplinary group of mentors on projects devoted to themes exemplified by the location. A specialist from the School of Education at UAF evaluates student’s progress during the summer schools. Lessons learned during the 12 years of conducting summer schools, methods of attracting in-kind support and approaches to teaching students are prominently featured in this study. Activities during the most recent school, conducted in Fairbanks and LTER Toolik Lake Field Station in 2015 are the focus of this presentation.",

            "abstract": "Volcanic ocean islands are well suited for studying climatic and tectonic influences on erosion because they often have homogeneous bedrock, dramatic rainfall gradients, and remnant surfaces that constrain their age, initial topography, and vertical motions relative to sea level. Because subsiding islands are inherently transient landscapes, island erosion should respond sensitively to climatic and tectonic forcing. However, island erosion also depends on intrinsic factors, such as the slope and geometry of the volcanic shield, and varies through time as island topography evolves. Understanding the temporal evolution of island landscapes is therefore required to isolate climatic and tectonic controls. We examine the relationship between erosion, vertical motion, and precipitation on 59 volcanic ocean islands worldwide, 47°S to 40°N, spanning 35 Myr in age. Erosion rates estimated from the volume of river canyons and the radiometric age of bedrock, normalized by initial island volume, decrease with island age. This timescale dependence is probably not due to episodic erosion since our measurements integrate over entire island landscapes rather than individual channel reaches that may be periodically alluviated. Instead, we posit that island erosion rates vary progressively through time in response to island-wide changes in slope. Rivers initially dissect gentle volcanic shields to produce steep topography. Once local relief begins to decline, slopes become gentler and erosion rates decrease. Erosion may be relatively insensitive to ongoing subsidence. Fractional island erosion shows no clear relationship with net subsidence recorded by the slope break formed at each island’s shoreline during shield building. Erosion rates and fluvial erosional efficiency K increase with mean annual precipitation. We use a landscape evolution model to test the relationships between climate, tectonics, and erosion suggested by our global island dataset.",

            "abstract": "The footwalls of active normal faults are often decorated with facet slopes: semi-planar, steeply dipping slopes made of bedrock, or bedrock thinly mantled by regolith, that rise up out of the fault trace. Here we test two hypotheses to determine whether normal-fault facet surfaces record information about the local fault slip rate on a 10-100 ky timescale. 1) If rock-mass strength is spatially uniform, relative variations in slip rate along strike of a normal fault can be estimated directly from facet slope angle. 2) If erosion rate is independently known, estimates of absolute slip rates can be obtained. These hypotheses are based on a simple mathematical model of footwall development that predicts that facet slope angle is set by the ratio of bedrock erosion rate to fault slip rate. We tested these hypotheses by first compiling data from the Wasatch Fault Zone (Utah, USA) where the rates of fault slip are unusually well known as a result of decades of intensive paleoseismology studies, and where millennial-scale erosion rates along the range front have been measured using cosmogenic radionuclides. We then mapped spatial variations in facet morphology along the entire length of the range front using 1 m resolution topographic data. We find a strong correlation between along-strike measurements of facet angle and Holocene slip rate. The mean facet steepness of each fault segment varies systematically from > 35 degrees in the center of the fault array to < 20 degrees at the southern end. Assuming characteristic fault dips of 50-60 degrees and erosion rates of 0.1-0.2 mm/yr, our predictions of absolute 100 ka average slip rates are consistent with estimates previously made from offset geomorphic features. These results demonstrate the feasibility of facet-slope analysis as a low-cost paleoseismology tool that can extract information about the rates of slip on range-bounding normal faults, and hence seismic hazard, directly from topography.",

            "abstract": "The exchange and transport of carbon in tidally driven, saline marsh ecosystems provide habitat and trophic support for coastal wildlife and fisheries, while potentially accumulating and storing carbon at some of the highest rates compared to other ecosystems. However, due to the predicted rise in sea level over the next century, the preservation and restoration of estuarine habitats is necessary to compensate for their expected decline. In addition, restoration of these marsh systems can also reduce the impacts of global climate change as they assimilate as much carbon as their freshwater counterparts, while emitting less methane due to the higher concentrations of sulfate in seawater. Unfortunately, in brackish marshes, with salinity concentrations less than 18 parts per thousand (ppt), simple relationships between methane production, salinity and sulfate concentrations are not well known.\nHere we present the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of carbon dioxide and methane, as calculated by the eddy covariance method, from a brackish marsh ecosystem in the San Francisco Estuary where salinity ranges from oligohaline (0.5-5 ppt) to mesohaline (5-18 ppt) conditions. Daily rates of carbon dioxide and methane NEE ranged from approximately 10 gC-CO2 m-2 d-1 and 0 mgC-CH4 m-2 d-1, during the winter to -15 gC-CO2 m-2 d-1 and 30 mgC-CH4 m-2 d-1, in the summer growing season. A comparison between similar measurements made from freshwater wetlands in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta found that the daily rates of carbon dioxide NEE were similar, but daily rates of methane NEE were just a small fraction (0-15%). Our research also shows that the daily fluxes of carbon dioxide and methane at the brackish marsh were highly variable and may be influenced by the tidal exchanges of seawater. Furthermore, the observed decline in methane production from summer to fall may have resulted from a rise in salinity and/or a seasonal decline in water and air temperatures. Our research goals are to provide insight into rates of plant productivity and uncertainty of methane production for brackish marsh systems that can help to inform policymakers of potential data gaps preventing inclusion of coastal wetland carbon sequestration in national inventories and greenhouse gas - offset markets.",

However, it is still undetermined if this event represents a widespread climate record since bog cores are prone to reflect localized anomalies. In order to obtain a widespread climate record, two lake sediment cores totaling 120 cm, were collected from Tres Lagunas during the summer of 2014. The samples were obtained using a Gravity Corer and a Livingston Modified Piston Corer. Sediment from the cores were subsampled and analyzed for magnetic susceptibility and charcoal in order to reconstruct natural range and variability of Páramo fire regimes. Pollen analysis and radiocarbon dating on pollen isolates will also be completed for the subsampled sediment. Additionally, X-ray fluorescence will be used to reconstruct the paleo geochemical environment. The goal of this study is to provide a widespread paleoclimate record of the region and extend upon the results of Jantz and Behling to determine if severe drought events occurred in the region.",

Our goal is to support public land managers determine if agency management policies are meeting objectives and where to focus attention. Monitoring in the field is becoming more and more limited in space and time. Remotely sensed data cover the entire allotments and go back in time, but do not consider the key issue of species composition. By estimating expected vegetative production as a function of site potential and climatic inputs, management skill can be assessed through time, across individual allotments, and between allotments. Here we present the use of Random Forest (RF) as the main ML technique, in this case for the purpose of regression. Our response variable is the maximum annual NDVI, a surrogate for grassland productivity, as generated by the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform based on Landsat 5, 7, and 8 datasets. PRISM 33-year normal precipitation (1980-2013) was resampled to the Landsat scale. In addition, the GRIDMET climate dataset was the source for the calculation of the annual SPEI (Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index), a drought index. We also included information about landscape position, aspect, streams, ponds, roads and fire disturbances as part of the modeling process. Our results show that in terms of variable importance, the 33-year normal precipitation, along with SPEI, are the most important features affecting grasslands productivity within the study area. The RF approach was compared to a linear regression model with the same variables. The linear model resulted in an r2 = 0.41, whereas RF showed a significant improvement with an r2 = 0.79. We continue refining the model by comparison with aerial photography and to include grazing intensity and infrastructure from units/allotments to assess the effect of management practices on vegetation production.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, there has been a growing interest among biologists in monitoring the short and long term health of the world’s coral reefs. The environmental impact of climate change poses a growing threat to these biologically diverse and fragile ecosystems, prompting scientists to use remote sensing platforms and computer vision algorithms to analyze shallow marine systems. In this study, we present a novel method for performing coral segmentation and classification from aerial data collected from small unmanned aerial vehicles (sUAV). Our method uses Fluid Lensing algorithms to remove and exploit strong optical distortions created along the air-fluid boundary to produce cm-scale resolution imagery of the ocean floor at depths up to 5 meters. A 3D model of the reef is reconstructed using structure from motion (SFM) algorithms, and the associated depth information is combined with multidimensional maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation to separate organic from inorganic material and classify coral morphologies in the Fluid-Lensed transects. In this study, MAP estimation is performed using a set of manually classified 100 x 100 pixel training images to determine the most probable coral classification within an interrogated region of interest. Aerial footage of a coral reef was captured off the coast of American Samoa and used to test our proposed method. 90 x 20 meter transects of the Samoan coastline undergo automated classification and are manually segmented by a marine biologist for comparison, leading to success rates as high as 85%. This method has broad applications for coastal remote sensing, and will provide marine biologists access to large swaths of high resolution, segmented coral imagery.",

Land surface spatial structure that captures spatial heterogeneity influenced by topography is expected to improve representation of land surface processes in land surface models. For example, land surface modeling using subbasins instead of regular grids as computational units has demonstrated improved scalability of simulated runoff and streamflow processes. In this study, a local classification method is applied to derive a new land surface spatial structure defined by further dividing subbasins into subgrid units based on elevation, topographic slope and aspect to take advantage of the emergent patterns and scaling properties of atmospheric, hydrologic, and vegetation processes in land surface models. For this purpose, a more consistent 90 meter resolution global surface elevation data has been developed by blending elevation data obtained from various sources. Taking the advantage of natural hydrologic connectivity of watersheds, new subbasin-based river routing and reservoir dependency datasets are being developed to improve representation of the managed hydrologic systems in the Community Land Model.",

            "abstract": "Wintertime sea ice extent around Antarctica has shown a positive trend during at least the past decade. The maximum northward expansion of sea ice is likely to be limited by the strong ocean temperature gradients associated with fronts of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). The ACC is, however, very dynamically unstable, with mesoscale eddies accounting for a large fraction of the variance in surface currents and sea surface temperature (SST). We combine satellite-observed sea-ice concentration, SST, and geostrophic eddy velocities to explore the hypothesis that dynamic and thermodynamic interactions between mesoscale eddies and sea ice exert an additional influence on the location of the winter sea ice margin. Advancing sea ice develops meridional deviations at horizontal scales of ~100 km, lengthening the perimeter of the ice-covered area by 30-70%. In many cases, this “scalloping” of the ice margin can be attributed to advection by eddy velocities. The effect varies regionally, depending on the proximity of the ice edge to the ACC. From the Amundsen Sea eastward through the Drake Passage the southern limit of eddy variability coincides with the northernmost extent of sea ice, and scalloping is common. By deforming the ice margin, eddies increase the potential for ice-edge melting and destruction by Southern Ocean surface wave action, while eddy-driven ice advection modifies the mean thermodynamic exchanges responsible for mass loss from the base of the ice pack. We use observations and models to estimate sea-ice loss caused by eddy/ice interactions.",

            "abstract": "Fault and fracture networks often control the distribution of fluids and heat in hydrothermal and epithermal systems, and in related geothermal and mineral resources. Additional chemical influences on conduit evolution are well documented, with dissolution and precipitation of mineral species potentially changing the permeability of fault-facture networks. Less well understood are the impacts of chemical alteration on the mechanical properties governing fracture growth and fracture network geometry.\nWe use double-torsion (DT) load relaxation tests under ambient air conditions to measure the mode-I fracture toughness (KIC) and subcritical fracture growth index (SCI) of variably altered rock samples obtained from outcrop in Dixie Valley, NV. Samples from southern Dixie Valley include 1) weakly altered granite, characterized by minor sericite in plagioclase, albitization and vacuolization of feldspars, and incomplete replacement of biotite with chlorite, and 2) granite from an area of locally intense propylitic alteration with chlorite-calcite-hematite-epidote assemblages. We also evaluated samples of completely silicified gabbro obtained from the Dixie Comstock epithermal gold deposit.\nIn the weakly altered granite KIC and SCI are 1.3 ±0.2 MPam1/2 (n=8) and 59 ±25 (n=29), respectively. In the propylitic assemblage KIC is reduced to 0.6 ±0.1 MPam1/2 (n=11), and the SCI increased to 75 ±36 (n = 33). In both cases, the altered materials have lower fracture toughness and higher SCI than is reported for common geomechanical standards such as Westerly Granite (KIC ~1.7 MPam1/2; SCI ~48). Preliminary analysis of the silicified gabbro shows a significant increase in fracture toughness, 3.6 ±0.4 MPam1/2 (n=2), and SCI, 102 ±45 (n=19), compared to published values for gabbro (2.9 MPam1/2 and SCI = 32).\nThese results suggest that mineralogical and textural changes associated with different alteration assemblages may result in spatially variable rates of fracture initiation and growth in different parts of hydrothermal systems. Contrasting fracture mechanical properties between alteration assemblages may constitute a new mechanism of chemical-mechanical feedback that contributes to the localization of conduits in hydrothermal systems.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGUposter.pdf\nThis research investigates a relatively unknown, basin-scale contamination hazard threatening the long-term sustainability of groundwater resources in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan (LPM). Many studies across LPM report elevated chloride concentrations ([Cl-]>250 mg/L) in the near-surface water, including the Michigan lowlands (west LPM), the Saginaw lowlands (east LPM) - where the upwelling of deep brines was inferred as the source - and at discrete points further inland. This begs the question: do the scattered occurrences of elevated [Cl-] share a common underlying mechanism, namely, the upwelling of brine? We addresses this question with data-driven modeling of the [Cl-] dynamics and hydrology across multiple scales, capitalizing on two massive statewide databases with water quality information from over 106 wells and static water levels (SWL) from roughly 500,000 wells. Long-term SWL were mapped at the basin-, regional-, and local-scale to identify recharge/discharge areas. Wells with elevated [Cl-] were overlaid to each map, revealing a consistent pattern of low [Cl-] in recharge areas and elevated [Cl-] in discharge areas. This multi-scale relationship provides compelling evidence for upwelling of brines, a concept supported by the analysis of 450 well samples collected in the Michigan lowlands which showed [Cl-] generally increases with depth. We assessed temporal trends by comparing field results to past records at 249 sampling locations. Most of the sites exhibit an increase of [Cl-] in recent years, which roughly coincides with a time period when Lake Michigan-Huron levels systematically decreased. Moreover, recent increases in [Cl-] are focused to areas where temporal analysis of SWL indicated increased well withdrawals. The results show that the contamination is caused by upwelling brines, and suggest that it is becoming more severe in recent years. Future work will integrate multi-scale, process-based groundwater modeling with further data collection/analysis to simulate the complex interplay of human activity, natural upwelling, and climate change. Insight from the modeling effort will be used to inform resource planners and policy makers of various groundwater management options available to vulnerable communities across the Lower Peninsula of Michigan in years to come.",

            "abstract": "Conventional instruction in science often proceeds from the general to the specific and from text to action. Fundamental terminologies, concepts, and ideas that are often abstract are taught first and only after such introductory processes can a student engage in research. Many students struggle to find relevance when presented information without context specific to their own experiences. This challenge is exacerbated for students whose social circles do not include adults who can validate scientific learning from their own experiences. Lamont-Doherty’s Secondary School Field Research Program inverts the standard paradigm and places small groups of students in research projects where they begin by performing manageable tasks on complex applied research projects. These tasks are supplemented with informal mentoring and relevant articles (~1 per week). Quantitative metrics suggest the approach is highly successful—most participants report a dramatic increase in their enthusiasm for science, 100% attend college, and approximately 50% declare majors in science or technology. We use one project, the construction of a microbial battery, to illustrate this novel model of science learning and argue that it should be considered a best practice for project-based science education. The goal of this project was to build a rechargeable battery for a mobile phone based on a geochemical cycle, to generate and store electricity. The students, mostly from ethnic groups under-represented in the STEM fields, combined concepts and laboratory methods from biology, chemistry and physics to isolate photosynthetic bacteria from a natural salt marsh, and made an in situ device capable of powering a light bulb. The younger participants had been exposed to neither high school chemistry nor physics at the start of the project, yet they were able to use the project as a platform to deepen their science knowledge and their desire for increased participation in formal science education.",

            "abstract": "Bedrock material strength properties heavily impact erosion rates in temperate glacial environments. We focus on the influence of localized tectonic crustal weakening in southeast Alaska on modern glacial erosion rates, thereby quantifying a primary feedback in tectonic/climatic coupling. Southeast Alaska, with its coincident high strain rates, vigorous glacial erosion and rapid sedimentation rates, provides an excellent setting in which to evaluate this interaction.\nTo characterize the relationship between fault damage and glacial incision, we collected data in transects across the strike-slip Fairweather Fault in Yakutat and Disenchantment Bays, in deglaciated valleys below the Mendenhall, Herbert, Ptarmigan, and Lemon Creek Glaciers on the perimeter of the Juneau Icefield, and on deglaciated nunataks on the Echo and Vaughan Lewis Glaciers in the interior of the Juneau Icefield. The mechanical properties of the bedrock are characterized by estimates of fault spacing and material cohesion. In structurally-controlled bedrock valleys exploited by glaciers, fracture spacing may vary by several orders of magnitude across fault damage zones, from more than 10 m to less than 0.1 m. Analysis of active and quiescent fault zones indicate that this variation approximates a power law relationship and correlates with a gradient in cohesive strength varying from greater than 50 MPa to less than 50 kPa between intact bedrock and the core of fault damage zones. The width and orientation of the damage zones is highly variable and we have chosen our field sites to sample zones of very large total displacement, up to kilometers along the Fairweather Fault, and substantially smaller displacements, down to centimeters for the Juneau Icefield locales.\nUsing a Cordilleran Ice sheet model to extend our modern observations into last glacial maximum conditions, we predict both erosion rates and sediment provenance for a material strength pattern influenced by tectonically induced fault damage. Compared to an earth model of homogeneous strength properties, our fault damage model predicts high spatial heterogeneity of erosion rates and sediment yield that changes as Cordilleran ice sheet thickness decreases from last glacial maximum to modern conditions.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the physics of magnetic reconnection in relativistic astrophysical jets, by means of first-principles particle-in-cell (PIC) kinetic simulations. In magnetically-dominated jets, magnetic reconnection is often invoked as a mechanism to dissipate the jet magnetic energy into plasma thermal energy, thus powering the observed emission. With 2D and 3D PIC simulations, we show that magnetic reconnection in relativistic astrophysical jets can efficiently accelerate the particles up to extreme energies, generating a flat power-law tail with slope between -2 and -1. We discuss the dependence of the particle acceleration efficiency on the flow magnetization (in the regime sigma>>1 of magnetically-dominated jets), the composition (electron-positron or electron-proton plasma) and the strength of the \"guide field\" orthogonal to the alternating fields. Our results place important constraint on the physics of magnetic reconnection in relativistic astrophysical jets.",

            "abstract": "The study of potential exoplanet biosignatures -- the global impact of life on a planetary environment -- has been informed primarily by the modern Earth, with little yet explored beyond atmospheric O2 from oxygenic photosynthesis out of chemical equilibrium, and its accompanying planetary surface reflectance feature, the vegetation “red edge” reflectance. However, these biosignatures have only been present for less than half the Earth’s history, and recent geochemical evidence suggests that atmospheric O2 may have been at very low - likely undetectable - levels, until 0.8 Ga (Planavsky et al., 2014, Science 346:635-638). Given that our planet was inhabited for very long periods prior to the rise of oxygen, and that a similar period of anoxygenic life may occur on exoplanets, more studies are needed to characterize remotely detectable biosignatures associated with more evolutionarily ancient anoxygenic phototrophs.\nOur measurements of the surface reflectance spectra of pure cultures of anoxygenic phototrophs revealed “NIR edge(s)” due to absorption of light by bacteriochlorophyll (Bchl) pigments. We used the pure culture spectra to deconvolve complex spectra of environmental samples of microbial mats. We observed multiple NIR edges associated with multiple pigments in the mats. We initially expected only to detect the absorption of light by the pigments in the surface layer of the mat. Surprisingly, we detected cyanobacterial Chl a in the surface layer, as well as Bchl c and Bchl a in the anoxygenic underlayers. This suggests that it does not matter “who’s on top,” as we were able to observe pigments through all mat layers due to their different absorption maxima. The presence of multiple pigments and thus multiple “NIR edges” could signify layered phototrophic communities and possibly strengthen support for the detection of a surface exoplanet biosignature. In general, the proposed work will inform the search for life on exoplanets at a similar stage of evolution or biogeochemical state as the pre-oxic Earth.",

Flow in porous media, diffusion of gases in complex pore structures and integrity of membranes in water desalination are examples of the application of this micro-scale parameter. The objective of this work was to obtain functional relationships that relate tortuosity to the geometrical and topological of porous media. High resolution 3D images of representative porous media were obtained using synchrotron computed tomography. Algorithms were developed to compute geometrical and topological parameters such as sphericity, angularity, porosity and grain size distribution. Tortuosity factors were computed from tortuous paths derived from 3D medial surface of the void space. The developed models serve as predictive tools to avoid expensive, time-consuming and difficult experiments",

Satellite data products are important for a wide variety of applications that can bring far-reaching benefits to the science community and the broader society. These benefits can best be achieved if the satellite data are well utilized and interpreted. Unfortunately, this is not always the case, despite the abundance and relative maturity of numerous satellite-borne sensors routinely measure aerosols. There is often disagreement between similar aerosol parameters retrieved from different sensors, leaving users confused as to which sensors to trust for answering important science questions about the distribution, properties, and impacts of aerosols. Such misunderstanding may be avoided by providing satellite data with accurate pixel-level (Level 2) information, including pixel coverage area delineation and science team recommended quality screening for individual geophysical parameters.\nNASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data and Information Services Center (GES DISC) have developed multiple MAPSS applications as a part of Giovanni (Geospatial Interactive Online Visualization and Analysis Interface) data visualization and analysis tool - Giovanni-MAPSS and Giovanni-MAPSS_Explorer since 2007. The MAPSS database provides spatio‐temporal statistics for multiple spatial spaceborne Level 2 aerosol products (MODIS Terra, MODIS Aqua, MISR, POLDER, OMI, CALIOP, SeaWiFS Deep Blue, and VIIRS) sampled over AERONET ground stations. In this presentation, I will demonstrate the improved features from Giovanni-MAPSS and introduce a new visualization service (Giovanni VizMAP) supporting various visualization and data accessing capabilities from satellite Level 2 data (non-aggregated and un-gridded) at high spatial resolution. Functionality will include selecting data sources (e.g., multiple parameters under the same measurement), defining area-of-interest and temporal extents, zooming, panning, overlaying, sliding, and data subsetting and reformatting.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU2015_KDJ_V7.pdf\nGrain size distributions of intertidal sediment in the Yellow Sea vary widely ranging from mud dominant to sand dominant with extensive seasonal changes. These are affected by tidal energy of the Yellow Sea, river flows, topography, shoreline gradient and human activities such as land reclamation, etc. Grain size of tidal flats are linked closely to fisheries, aquaculture and pollutant process. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor these areas continuously. It is, however, difficult to retrieve grain size information from remotely sensed data. Because the optical reflectance of intertidal sediment is not a function of single parameter but varies according to water content, grain size, topography, surface water, benthic algae and halophytes, etc. Among these parameters, grain size and water content play a key role in bare intertidal surface. Since water content of intertidal sediment are affected by tide, it is necessary to establish a water-independent grain size retrieval model. It is known that mud and sand sediment are well distinguished under dry condition on PCA (Principal Component Analysis) space but hardly distinguished under saturated condition. Here we introduce a new grain size retrieval model by removing the water content dependency from optical reflectance via a two-step PCA transform. To define the relationship between grain size, water content and optical reflectance, two different standard samples were made as per grain size by wet sieving. By exploiting simplified reflectance features of the standard samples, a two-step PCA transform model was established. This grain size retrieval model was applied to GOCI (Geostationary Ocean Color Imager) images for sediment classification within the Yellow Sea. The results demonstrate it might be possible to discriminate between sand-dominant and mud-dominant areas based upon the model. Seasonal changes of sediment distribution within the tidal flats are well observed from the results.",

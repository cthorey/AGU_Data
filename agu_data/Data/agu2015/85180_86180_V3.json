            "abstract": "Sea ice plays a significant role in the ecology of polar seas and a significant portion of the biological production in the Arctic occurs at ice edges. These environments are inherently variable in space and time and subject to climate variation as the summer ice extent changes. Recent field results from the northern Bering Sea suggest that the parameterization of ice edge production in coupled physical-biological models that ignore processes specific to the ice-melt environment will be insufficient to describe the variability and intensity of Arctic production. In addition to the stabilizing the surface layer, ice may contribute phytoplankton growth factors such as trace metals that have been derived from the regions of ice formation as well as aeolian deposition. Results of an analysis of sea ice formation, flow and melt suggests regions that are likely to receive trace metals from ice and has been validated with regions of known ice edge productivity in the Bering Sea. A similar analysis for the Chukchi Sea compared the likely ice-edge productivity regions between pre-2000 ice conditions and those in the more recent period of reduced summer ice cover. Changes are predicted in both the timing and distribution of these regions in proportion to the variations in the dominant ice flow patterns. Ways in which the non-local processes important to elevated ice edge productivity can be incorporated into couple arctic models will be discussed.",

After atmospheric correction and ground validation are performed, the gathered hyperspectral and topographic data can be assembled into a stack of layers for land cover classification. Data for this project were collected in multiple field campaigns, including the 2013 NSF NEON California campaign and 2015 NASA SARP campaign. Using hyperspectral and high resolution topography data, 25 discriminatory attributes were processed in Exelis' ENVI software and collected for use in a decision forest to classify the four major tree species (Blue Oak, Live Oak, California Buckeye, and Foothill Pine) at the San Joaquin Experimental Range near Fresno, CA. These attributes include 21 classic vegetation indices and a number of other spectral characteristics, such as color and albedo, and four topographic layers, including slope, aspect, elevation, and tree height. Additionally, a number of nearby terrain classes, including bare earth, asphalt, water, rock, shadow, structures, and grass were created. Fifty training pixels were used for each class. The training pixels for each tree species came from collected GPS points in the field. Ensemble bootstrap aggregation of decision trees was performed in MATLAB, and an arbitrary number of 500 trees were selected to be grown. The tree that produced the minimum out-of-bag classification error (4.65%) was selected to classify the entire scene. Classification results accurately distinguished between oak species, but was suboptimal in dense areas. The entire San Joaquin Experimental Range was mapped with an overall accuracy of 94.7% and a Kappa coefficient 0.94. Finally, the Commission and Omission percentage averages were 5.3% each. A highly accurate map of tree species at this scale supports studies on drought effects, disease, and species-specific growth traits.",

            "abstract": "A long-standing paradigm of river networks is that they are minor components in the global carbon cycle, passively connecting the land and ocean reservoirs. But recent research in the Amazon and globally show that the opposite is true- that fluvial systems are highly active, dynamic processors of organic carbon of terrestrial and aquatic origin, releasing CO2 back to the atmosphere. That said, knowledge of how the fluvial system processes carbon and nutrients requires being able to track carbon processes throughout a basin, not just at select points; i.e., how do the pathways and fluxes of organic matter, nutrients, and associated elements evolve through river corridors, from the land-water interface to the ocean? The problem in understanding fluvial carbon dynamics at scales larger than relatively easily measured discrete streams is determining the spatial and temporal distributions across such a range of environments. This is a mesoscale question, where it is necessary to understand the distribution of moisture regimes and biogeochemical processes at scales of ~10,000–100,000 km2 and up. Here we examine the spatial-temporal distributions of pCO2 across the Amazon River system. Because of the vast and remote nature of the Amazon basin, the logistics of establishing a comprehensive and representative sampling network are considerable. The Rede Beija Rio network was established to conduct such measurements, wherein each node is occupied by a team of researchers from that site. Results showed pronounced consistency. For example, pCO2 tracked the hydrograph at all sites, with maximum concentrations at high water, and minima at low. pCO2 at low water ranges from 500 μatm in the Rio Araguaia and Rio Ji-Paraná to 1000 μatm in the Rio Solimões, to 2000 μatm in the Rio Negro. High water concentrations exhibit a broader range and higher magnitude, from 3000 μatm (Rio Pimento Bueno) to 5000 μatm in the Rio Solimões and 7000 μatm in the lower Rio Negro. Interestingly, pCO2 in the far upper Rio Negro, where pH is in the 3.5 range, had lower concentrations than at the mouth. The highest observed values were 20,000 μatm in Campinas, a blackwater tributary of the Rio Negro. These patterns are reflected in major and minor ions, nutrients, sediments and sediment composition.",

Transforming our nation’s economic, energy, and environmental systems to in this way will require a sustained level of expertise, innovation, and cooperative effort unseen since the 1940s to meet the challenges involved. Education can – and must – help people understand the true connections, the linkages and interdependencies, between the environment, our energy sources and the economy which underpin and form the very foundation of the concept of a green and resilient economy. To produce such a literate future workforce and citizenry, the United States will need to make major new investments in our educational systems.\nTeachers across the nation are helping to increase science-based understanding and awareness of current and future climate change, enhancing climate and energy literacy in K-12 classrooms, on college and university campuses. There has been tremendous progress to date, but there is still more work to be done.\n\nThe new academic standards in mathematics and science (the Common Core State Standards in Mathematics and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)) represent a sea change from the nation’s previous sets of standards. Addressing these standards in the currently over 40 percent of the nation’s classrooms that have adopted or adapted the NGSS will demand that we prepare new and current teachers, who can effectively address the interdisciplinary nature of climate change and societal responses. To address this opportunity and need a collaboration between NOAA, TERC and CIRES has been established to develop an Educator Framework for Teaching Climate and Energy Literacy for K-12 teachers across the curriculum based on the NRC Framework for K-12 Science Education: Practices, Crosscutting Concepts, and Core Ideas. This collaboration is developing an effective way to frame the use of resources and practices to help teachers address the NGSS using the CLEAN (Climate Literacy and Energy Awareness Network, cleanet.org) and Climate.gov products and models to engage students as citizens of a low-carbon and climate-resilient future. The results of this collaboration will be discussed in the session.",

            "abstract": "Multi-stage incision/denudation history for the southwestern Colorado Plateau involved: carving of 70-30 Ma Laramide paleotopography controlled by strike valleys at the base of retreating cliffs, 25-15 Ma incision of an East Kaibab paleovalley that cut to about half the modern depth of eastern Grand Canyon, and 5-6 Ma integration of the Colorado River (CR) through Grand Canyon. A synthesis of Little Colorado River (LCR) incision history informs aspects of each episode. Refined evidence for the first two episodes is from new thermochronology modeling that shows post-Laramide NE cliff retreat and a 35-25 Ma LCR paleovalley that flowed NW across the Kaibab uplift. Next was 16-14 Ma playa/ marsh deposition of Lower Bidahochi Formation, 13-8 Ma non-deposition, and 6-8 fluvial upper Bidahochi Formation with base level defined by Hopi Buttes maars. Little denudation in the LCR valley from 16 to 6 Ma is documented by similar elevations of 16 and 6 Ma paleo baselevels. The third pulse of regional incision/denudation was associated with integration of the CR across the Vermillion Cliffs after 5-6 Ma. Earliest integration reoccupied the East Kaibab paleocanyon, inferred from thermochronology to have been at ~1500-1700 m elevation at 15 Ma. Topographically inverted dated basalt mesas in the LCR headwater region show steady incision of 43 m/Ma since 6 Ma. New 2 Ma sanidine ages for Crooked Ridge and Blue Point ash show ~100 m/Ma differential incision across the LCR knickpoint over the last ~ 2 Ma: ~400 m (~200 m/Ma) at the confluence, 400-500 m (200-250 m/Ma) at the projected confluence of Crooked Ridge and the LCR, 220 m (110 m/Ma) for topographically inverted basalt mesas in LCR tributaries in the central reaches, and 116-204 m (61-43 m/Ma) in the headwaters. Headwater uplift of the Rocky Mountains likely facilitated CR integration; post-2 Ma differential incision in the LCR may reflect a combination of regional mantle-driven epeirogenic uplift and additional mantle-driven headwater uplift of the Springerville volcanic field. Acceleration of incision in the last 100 ka is indicated by travertine U-series dating, but this may not have averaged out glacial-interglacial fluctuations. Proposed climate changes (e.g. 5-6 Ma and 2.5 Ma) likely amplified tectonic forcings.",

Super-parameterization impacts both the net radiative input to the land-surface and the partitioning of sensible and latent heating with a distinct signature. We separate the effects of atmospheric processes, especially cloud radiative properties, from land-surface processes, especially soil-moisture dynamics, using a series of free-running and hindcast simulations. Effects of SP include reducing the coupling strength in the Central Great Plain in American, and reverses the terrestrial segment coupling sign (from negative to positive) over India. Analysis of the triggering feedback strength (TFS) and amount feedback strength (AFS) shows SP can capture the patterns of these indices over North America, with probability of afternoon precipitation enhanced by high evaporative fraction along the eastern United States and Mexico, while conventional versions of CAM struggle to capture this signal.",

            "abstract": "Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are emitted by numerous anthropogenic and biogenic sources and undergo oxidative processing, as well as horizontal and vertical transport, in the troposphere. Understanding the dynamics of chemical and physical land atmosphere exchange processes and their impacts on atmospheric chemistry requires high temporal resolution of observations at multiple heights and the knowledge of the sources and sinks.\nWe measured dynamic composition changes of VOCs as a function of height (5 inlets from 10 to 525 m, switching every 2 minutes, full profile every 10 minutes) for more than a year using a PTR-QMS. Here, we focus on a multi-week period in February 2013 when simultaneous SRI-TOFMS and PTR-QMS took place.\nMore than 300 ions were detected within an m/z range of 0.000 – 400.000 Th and 260 ions were analyzed. Chemical formulas were assigned to more than 50% of these ions. Late winter is a period when anthropogenic influences are relatively high including remote sources in the Central Valley. Biogenic influences are low at this time of year, but were clearly observed. The average diurnal vertical gradients (Figure 1) showed trends and patterns and behavior consistent with boundary layer dynamics, wind profiles and source activity for a broad array of VOCs and source categories. Mass concentration of oxygenated VOCs with 2, 3 or more oxygens or with nitrogen+oxygen had an increasing tendency with height. The opposite was true for pure hydrocarbons and reduced nitrogen containing VOCs which generally decrease with height. The remaining species comprised halogenated as well as other volatile products. Average oxidation state ranged from -2.0 to 4.3.\nThese observations are useful to reflect the dynamics of VOCs at a rural site in the Central Valley and could be particularly useful for comparison with models of atmospheric chemistry that include PBL dynamics.\nFigure 1: Gradient concentration diurnal profiles for 48 selected ions, showing the complexity of VOC dynamics. The color maps represent concentration (ppb). The data shown cover the period of February 12 to February 20, 2013.",

            "abstract": "Ammonia loss from fertilizers can impact formation of atmospheric aerosols, as well as contribute to nitrogen (N) deposition in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Urea is the predominant form of N fertilizer used worldwide due to its high N content (46.6% N) and low cost. Once in contact with soil or vegetation, urea is hydrolyzed to ammonium via naturally occurring urease enzymes. Losses of N from surface applied urea as ammonia can exceed 30%. To address this issue, various physical and chemical mechanisms have been incorporated into granular urea. The most common approach is incorporation of urease inhibitors such as N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT). We have been investigating ammonia volatilization from urea granules (+/- urease inhibitors) in various field and laboratory controlled experiments for the past several years. Laboratory experiments are conducted with a customized growth chamber system designed to continuously measure ammonia volatilization. Field measurements are conducted using a passive sampler technology with an acid-coated trap in PVC cylinders, or annular denuder technology using flow-through PVC chambers. Daily exchanges of acid-coated denuder tubes enhance the sensitivity of ammonia volatilization measurements for the urease-inhibitor treated product. Loss of N from commercial urea granules has ranged from 6 - ~ 35%, depending on ambient temperature. This loss typically occurs within the first 5-10 days under field conditions. Some urease-inhibitors can minimize loss of N via volatilization (< 5%) for up to 20+ days in the absence of a rainfall event. Visual observations have confirmed that on bare soil, treated or untreated urea granules quickly “dissolve” and move into the soil. The accompanying urease-inhibitor formulation moves with the urea continuing to provide protection against reaction with naturally occurring urease enzymes. Use of urease-inhibitors does not guarantee increased crop yields or NUE, but the consistency of inhibitors incorporating NBPT suggest that these formulations represent a reasonable available control technology for use in agriculture to reduce ammonia emissions.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric composition measurements are an important tool to quantify local and regional emissions and sinks of greenhouse gases. Most in situ measurements are made at a point, but how representative are such measurements in an inhomogeneous environment? Open path Fourier Transform Spectroscopy (FTS) measurements potentially offer spatial averaging and continuous measurements of several trace gases (including CO2, CH4, CO and N2O) simultaneously in the same airmass. Spatial averaging over kilometre scales is a better fit to the finest scale atmospheric models becoming available, and helps bridge the gap between models and in situ measurements. In this paper we assess the precision, accuracy and reliability of long open path measurements by Fourier Transform Spectroscopy in the near infrared from a 5-month continuous record of measurements over a 1.5 km pathlength.\nDirect open-atmosphere measurements of trace gases CO2, CH4, CO and N2O as well as O2 were retrieved from several absorption bands between 4000 and 8000 cm-1 (2.5 – 1.25 micron). At one end of the path an in situ FTIR analyser simultaneously collected well calibrated measurements of the same species for comparison with the open path-integrated measurements. The measurements ran continuously from June – November 2014. We introduce the open path FTS measurement system and present an analysis of the results, including assessment of precision, accuracy relative to co-incident in situ measurements, reliability. Short term precision of the open path measurement of CO2 was better than 1 ppm for 5 minute averages and thus sufficient for studies in urban and other non-background environments. Measurement bias relative to calibrated in situ measurements was stable across the measurement period. The system operated reliably with data losses mainly due to weather events such as rain and fog preventing transmission of the IR beam. In principle the system can be improved to provide longer pathlengths and higher precision, and we present recent progress in improving the original measurements.",

            "abstract": "Observations show an increase in the melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) since the early 20th century with a significant acceleration over the past decade. Located next to two critical areas of deep water formation, the GIS has the potential to directly impact the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) via the freshening of surface waters in these regions. All the Earth System Models part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) project a significant decline in AMOC strength over the next 100 to 200 years under increased greenhouse gas concentrations; however none of these projections consider the impacts of the GIS. Previous modelling studies have investigated the response of AMOC to freshwater input in various hosing experiments, but the magnitude of the change in AMOC strength varies significantly between these studies. The uncertainty is likely a result of the wide range of experimental design, including various methods for imposing the freshwater forcing in the simulations and use of different global climate models which do not simulate realistic melt from the GIS. Here, we present results from experiments in which GFDL ESM2Mb is forced with realistic projections of freshwater discharge from the GIS under the RCP 8.5 scenario in order to investigate the impact of future melt of the GIS on the AMOC. The results presented here are a contribution to the AMOC Model Intercomparison Project (AMOCMIP), a community effort to investigate the impacts of GIS melt on AMOC.",

            "abstract": "The Pacific-North American plate boundary in Alaska is in the current scientific spotlight, as a highlighted tectonic region for integrated scientific investigation. It is timely, therefore, to step back and examine the previous numerical modeling studies of Alaska. Reviewing the numerical models is valuable, as geodynamic modeling can be a predictive tool that can guide and target field studies, both geologic and geophysical. This review presents a comparison of the previous numerical modeling studies of the Alaska-Aleutian subduction zone, including the mainland and extending into northwestern Canada. By distinguishing between the model set-up, governing equations, and underlying assumptions, non-modelers can more easily understand under what context the modeling predictions can be interpreted. Several key features in the Alaska tectonic setting appear in all the models to have a first order effect on the resulting deformation, such as the plate margin geometry and Denali fault. In addition, there are aspects of the tectonic setting that lead to very different results depending how they are implemented into the models. For example, models which fix the slab velocity to surface plate motions predict lower mantle flow rates than models that allow the slab to steepen. Despite the previous modeling studies, many unanswered questions remain, including the formation of the Wrangell volcanics, the driver for motion in western and interior Alaska, and the timing and nature of slab deformation. A synthesis of this kind will be of value to geologists, geodeticists, seismologists, volcanologists, sedimentologists, geochemists, as well as geodynamicists.",

Both 2014 and 2015 were low snow years, and 2015 was exceptionally warm and analogous to future years after climate change. The ASO uses an imaging spectrometer and LiDAR sensors mounted in an aircraft to collect snow depth and extent data, and snow albedo. By combining ground and modeled density fields, the ~weekly flights over the Tuolumne produced both basin-wide and detailed sub-basin snow water equivalent (SWE) estimates that were provided to Hetch Hetchy Reservoir operators. The data were also assimilated into an hydrologic simulation model in an attempt to improve the accuracy and timing of a runoff forecasting tool that can be used to improve the management of Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, the source of 85% of the water supply for 2.6 million people on the San Francisco Peninsula. The USGS Precipitation Runoff Modeling System was calibrated to the 1181 square kilometer basin and simulation results compared to observed runoff with and without assimilation of ASO data. Simulated and observed were also compared with observed with both single updates associated with each flight, and with sequential updates from each flight. Sequential updating was found to improve correlation between observed and simulated reservoir inflows, and there by improve the ability of reservoir operators to more efficiently allocate the last half of the recession limb of snowmelt inflow and be assured of filling the reservoir and minimizing ecologically-damaging late season spills.",

            "abstract": "The current status of Science, Technology and Natural Resources (STNR) policy in the United States provides an ideal context to examine the influence of committee seniority within the public policy process. Exemplars of the Policy Entrepreneur have been individuals in leadership positions, whether executive or legislative. The role of junior committee members in shaping policy innovation is less well understood, and is frequently masked either in cross-sectional research designs or in case studies. The House Natural Resources committee seniority patterns are compared to the House of Representatives Chamber data from 1975 to 2015. This expanse of congressional time captures both the policy innovation of the Class of 1974 who helped transform the public lands by pursuing a preservation agenda, along with the contemporaneous gridlock caused by disagreements about reducing the size of the federal government, a policy agenda championed and sustained by the Class of 1994.\nSeveral types of political actors have served as policy entrepreneurs, President Kennedy and Secretary of Interior Udall shepherding the Wilderness Act of 1964 from the Executive branch, or in the 111th Congress Committee chairmen Senator Christopher Dodd and Representative Barney Frank, having announced their retirements, spent their final Congress shaping the consensus that produced the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.\nA less studied policy phenomenon relies on “packing the committee” to outvote the leadership. This tactic can be used by the party leadership to overcome recalcitrant senior committee members, as was the case for Democrats in the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee shift to preservation in the 1970s, or the tactic can be employed from the grassroots, as may be happening in the case of the House Natural Resources Committee in the 114th Congress.\nA policy making process analog to rivers is more appropriate than a mechanistic model. As there are multiple causes for rivers reaching flood stage, there are multiple pressure points that can be applied to produce policy innovation. The better understood tactics are the orderly, polite activities of a policy monopoly. The more rough and tumble behaviors associated with gridlock may be just as important to understanding when policy innovation is likely to occur.",

The area is a key in understanding the evolution of basement of Madagascar and the reconstruction of the Gondwana supercontinent. These granitoids range from layered to massive and previously published U-Pb zircon dating yielded three distinctive Neoproterozoic magmatisms at 770 Ma to 820 Ma, ca. 660Ma, and ca 550Ma. However, it was unknown whether these ages represent distinct magmatic pulses or reflect a continuous granitoid emplacement. This work contributes to the knowledge of the Malagasy basement rocks and to explore and discuss the origin and petrotectonic evolution of the granites and granitoid-gneisses from this part of the Madagascar.\nThe rock samples are placed into three groups: group A and B for granitoid-gneisses and a third group for the granite layers. Group A and B are metaluminous and slightly peraluminous, respectively. All rocks have typical subduction zone calc-alkaline signatures. Group A is characterized by enrichment in large ion lithophile elements (LILE) but low U, LREE enrichment, depletion in the high field strength elements (HFSE). In contrast, Group B has REE patterns closely similar to Archean sediments. The granite layers show fractionated REE patterns in which HREE patterns show strong correlation with Zr abundances. Trends in major element variation diagrams and the enrichment of incompatible elements could be explained by simple fractional crystallization, while the overall geochemical signatures reflect either (1) melting of ancient crust or (2) crustal contamination of a more evolved magmas that are produced by differentiation of mantle-derived magma. Geochemical signatures of studied rocks reveal the contribution of old continental crust and the role of continental arc magmatism in the genesis of both granites and granitoid-gneisses of eastern central Madagascar.",

First, we present the changes in the characteristics of extreme precipitation (95th percentile of rain-days) over six regions in the reanalysis dataset on daily, monthly and annual time scales. Our analysis shows that the spatial extent of extreme precipitation events, defined as the area of contiguous grid points of daily extreme precipitation, has been decreasing by up to 5-fold over most regions since 1979. We investigate the thermodynamic and dynamic causes of this decreasing trend in the spatial extent. Additionally, we assess if a static separation of “local” and “remote” regions is valid for the analysis of moisture fluxes feeding an extreme precipitation event given the varying spatial extents over time. Moreover, we analyze the relatively finer resolutions of observed and dynamically downscaled datasets to allow us to further understand the physical causes driving changes in extreme events. This is achieved by identifying smaller spatial extents of extreme precipitation events in these datasets and quantifying their associated finer-scale moisture dynamics. Overall, this study allows us to understand the changes in extreme precipitation characteristics in the observed past and how changing moisture dynamics have shaped these characteristics.",

Electrical Resistivity and Seismic Refraction Tomography (ERT and SRT), as well as several pumping tests were performed to identify zones of heterogeneities and hydrogeophysical characteristics of a shallow unconfined aquifer. The combination of these methods was selected to study the local geology and the subsurface preferential pathways of groundwater flow. 22 Dipole-Dipole ERT transects with 56 electrodes each and 11 SRT transects with 24 geophones each were performed. Drilling logs of 5 observation wells located within the site were also used. All drilling logs showed clearly the heterogeneity of the aquifer when compared to each other. The combination of ERT and SRT indicated that a potential zone of preferential flow is present within the aquifer and can be accurately identified based on the approach adopted in this study. The drilling logs served to specifically identify the soil and the geological formations making the heterogeneity of the aquifer. 3D ERT and SRT block diagrams were generated to connect all formations shown in the 2D tomography profiles to visualize the pathways of preferential flow and non-conductive formations. While ERT has proven to show saturated areas of the subsurface, SRT was more effective in identifying the bedrock-soil discontinuity and other near surface formations contributing to the local heterogeneity.",

            "abstract": "During the 30th Annual Climate Diagnostics and Prediction Workshop at State College PA in 2005, Lisa Goddard originated an idea that after further development became the Post-docs Applying Climate Expertise (PACE) Program. The developmental process was considerably enhanced by participation on US CLIVAR committees; CLIVAR embraces a wide spectrum from basic understanding of how climate operates to the application of that understanding for human and environmental benefit. The basic structure and application process for PACE are described in other talks in this session. The program is currently supported by NOAA but the model is potentially applicable to a wide range of agencies. A key concept is the stipulation of deliberate co-production of knowledge and cross-culture fertilization, making this program especially attractive for agencies and groups operating in a public arena. The approach taken is more difficult to implement because of the two-stage process. The oversight committee, which includes recent participants, continues to tinker with ways to streamline and improve the rather unusual and more lengthy application process, which is considerably more complex than most post-doc applications. One issue that remains to be better resolved is what is meant by the term “climate expert,” a phrase that means different things to different people in the climate community itself, including the level of breadth and depth of a complicated subject like climate. The “graduates” of this program have considered PACE to be a positive and very worthwhile experience in terms of broadening their professional portfolio and conceptualization of the use of information from climate science and allied disciplines. The counterpart decision-making institutions have likewise been very supportive of the program and its outcomes.",

Geochemically-based hydrograph separation techniques in combination with glacier mass balance and runoff measurements can help refine our understanding of the contributing sources and therefore, support the refinement of both short-term flood forecasts and long-term runoff projections. Our study was designed to quantify the contribution of glacier melt, snow melt and rainfall to lowland streamflow of a sub-arctic basin and to assess hydrologic pathways of glacier wastage. Jarvis Creek watershed (634 km2), Interior Alaska, drains the north-facing Eastern Alaska Range, starting at the Jarvis Glacier (6.7 km2) and flows 69 km to its outlet in the Delta River, Delta Junction. Glacial contribution accounts for at least 15% of total runoff as estimated from measured glacier melt and lowland runoff. Daily stable water isotope samples near the Jarvis Creek outlet show distinct chemical signatures in contributing sources and large seasonal and interannual δ18O variability. For example, geochemical measurements from 2011 show low rainfall contribution into Jarvis Creek, whereas 2014 show high input of rainfall; and, unlike 2014, spring 2013 show a strong snowmelt contribution in late spring. Stable water isotopes will be the primary signature to inform our end-member volumetric mixing modeling efforts, while dissolved ion concentrations will support a differentiation between glacier- and groundwater sources. Ultimately, the combination of glacier mass balance, hydrological and geochemical measurements will allow us to gain a fundamental knowledge about the current regional hydrologic system.",

            "abstract": "We present and compare a carbon budget for the Brazilian Amazon Basin based on the Balanço Atmosférico Regional de Carbono na Amazônia (BARCA) aircraft program, which occurred in November 2008 & May 2009, to other published carbon budgets. In particular, we compare our budget and analysis to others also derived from aircraft observations. Using mesoscale meteorological fields from ECMWF and WRF, we drive the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model and couple the footprint, or influence, to a biosphere model represented by the Vegetation Photosynthesis Respiration Model (VPRM). Since it is the main driver for the VPRM, we use observed shortwave radiation from towers in Brazil and French Guyana to examine the modeled shortwave radiation data from GL 1.2 (a global radiation model based on GOES 8 visible imagery), ECMWF, and WRF to determine if there are any biases in the modeled shortwave radiation output. We use WRF-STILT and ECMWF-STILT, GL 1.2 shortwave radiation, temperature, and vegetation maps (IGBP and SYNMAP) updated by landuse scenarios modeled by Sim Amazonia 2 and Sim Brazil, to compute hourly a priori CO2 fluxes by calculating Gross Ecosystem Exchange and Respiration for the 4 significant vegetation types across two (wet and dry) seasons as defined by 10-years of averaged TRIMM precipitation data. SF6 from stations and aircraft observations are used to determine the anthropogenic CO2 background and the lateral boundary conditions are taken from CarbonTracker2013B. The BARCA aircraft mixing ratios are then used as a top down constraint in an inversion framework that solves for the parameters controlling the fluxes for each vegetation type. The inversion provides scaling factors for GEE and R for each vegetation type in each season. From there, we derive a budget for the Basin and compare/contrast with other published basinwide CO2 fluxes. ",

            "abstract": "It is widely appreciated that forest biomass dynamics do not follow smooth sigmoidal age response functions, yet accounting for realistic overshoot-and-collapse cycles remains a big challenge. Here, millions of observations of vital status at permanent sample plots from Canada and the U.S. were used to predict probability of tree mortality (Pm) based on segmented logistic regression functions of xylem water potential (WPX) derived from a simplified model of plant water transport for dominant boreal and temperate North American tree species. First, we demonstrate that hydraulic limits are clearly detectable from the increase of Pm at the lowest levels of WPX and that the relationship is strongly defined by increasing vulnerability (decreasing WPX) as tree height (h) increases. Second, we demonstrate the implications of representing water stress-induced mortality on regional simulations of net ecosystem biomass production (NEBP), drawing on examples of specific collapse events where we have observations of NEBP for comparison. Simulations suggest that extreme surface energy balance anomalies during 1981 and 1998 triggered catastrophic levels of mortality in regions of western North America. Yet, simulations may still greatly underestimate the impact of these collapse events if associations exist between WPX and insect outbreaks. Nevertheless, the models suggest that a combination of size-dependent hydraulic limits and low-frequency variability in the surface energy balance conspire to produce overshoot-and-collapse cycles that strongly shaped biomass dynamics in western North America over recent decades.",

Soil, as a critical component of the forest carbon stocks, has been sampled in about 10-year intervals in FIA with the re-measurement underway. However, the magnitude of detectable change in soil organic carbon (SOC) with the current sampling scheme is unknown. We aim to identify SOC variability and to best determine minimum detectable changes in SOC under the current sampling scheme. The project seeks to: identify statistical relationships between SOC and environmental covariates; normalize SOC data for main forest-type groups (FTGs) using identified covariates; and determine the minimum detectable change in the normalized SOC using power analysis. We investigated SOC variability for 8 FTGs: Oak-Hickory, Maple-Beech-Birch, Pinyon-Juniper, Loblolly-Shortleaf Pine, Aspen-Birch, Douglas-Fir, Fir-Spruce-Mountain Hemlock and Woodland Hardwoods. Relationships between SOC and environmental covariates (biomass/soil properties in FIA, PRISM climate data, and DEM-derived terrain attributes) are determined by multiple linear regression and are used to normalize SOC variability. The results showed that terrain attributes were not significant in explaining SOC in the FIA dataset and climate data were only significant in certain FTGs locations. Except for Oak-Hickory, Maple-Beech-Birch and Pinyon-Juniper groups, sample numbers are insufficient to detect a change in SOC less than 10 percent (%) of the mean. To guide future sampling efforts, we will continue our study on detecting minimal change in SOC and to explore sample number and sampling frequency scenarios to inform future soil sampling protocols.",

            "abstract": "The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) is being constructed by the National Science Foundation and is slated for completion in 2017. NEON is designed to collect data to improve the understanding of changes in observed ecosystems. The observatory will produce data products on a variety of spatial and temporal scales collected from individual sites strategically located across the U.S. including Alaska, Hawaii, and Puerto Rico. Data sources include standardized terrestrial, instrumental, and aquatic observation systems in addition to three airborne remote sensing observation systems installed into leased Twin Otter aircraft. The Airborne Observation Platforms (AOP) are designed to collect 3-band aerial imagery, waveform and discrete LiDAR, and high-fidelity imaging spectroscopy data over the NEON sites annually at or near peak-greenness.\nThe NEON Imaging Spectrometer (NIS) is a Visible and Shortwave Infrared (VSWIR) sensor designed by NASA JPL for ecological applications. Spectroscopic data is collected at 5-nm intervals across the solar-reflective spectral region (380-nm to 2500-nm) in a 34-degree FOV swath. A key uncertainty driver to the derived remote sensing NEON data products is the calibration of the imaging spectrometers. In addition, the calibration and accuracy of the higher-level data product algorithms is essential to the overall NEON mission to detect changes in the collected ecosystems over the 30-year expected lifetime.\nThe typical calibration workflow of the NIS consists of the characterizing the focal plane, spectral calibration, and radiometric calibration. Laboratory spectral calibration is based on well-defined emission lines in conjunction with a scanning monochromator to define the individual spectral response functions. The radiometric calibration is NIST traceable and transferred to the NIS with an integrating sphere calibrated through the use of transfer radiometers. The laboratory calibration is monitored and maintained through the use of an On-Board Calibration (OBC) system. Recent advances in the understanding of the NIS sensor that have led to improvements in the overall calibration accuracy are reported. In addition, the NIS calibration and data products are compared to Earth-observing satellite sensors.",

Holdridge in 1967, used to discern why plants have different adaptation mechanism to their surrounding environment. In this paper, the relation between potential evapotranspiration rate (ETr ), anual precipitation (P ) and biotemperature (Tb ) in the Holdridge triangle, is parametrized (P = (500/9)*ETr) to evaluate if the rain process is conserved in Colombia. Further, an adiabatic ascent of air with diurnal and interannual variability, and cluster analysis is view as a classification example of the advantage of using physical process to evaluate the plants adaptation mechanisms . The most inconsistency life zones are situated in the rainiest places of Colombian pacific costs in tropical latitudinal region, are non-exist places in holdridge triangle with annual biotemperature higher than 26◦ C, annual precipitation about 10.000mm and annual potential evapotranspiration rate about 0.1. The difference between Holdridge predicted precipitation and the precipitation measured with TRMM are about 5.000mm in these places. Classification systems based on an annual average, do not stablish adaptation as a function of diurnal variability, for example, the difference between valley sides vegetation could not being determined. This kind of limitations, added to a validation procces and the auscence of a physic procces in the variable interaction, make the Holdridge Life Zones a very useful tool, but physically inconsistent for caracterice vegetation as a function of precipitation. The rain process is very complex, depend of mass and energy exchanges and is still a controversial topic in atmospheric modeling, as a biotic pump.",

            "abstract": "Bankfull channel width measurements and bankfull stage-discharge relationships, coupled with published and/or collected channel depth sounding readings, were utilized to examine bankfull channel geometries (in the single-thread meandering channel reaches only) spanning from the fluvial ‘normal flow’ moving downstream through the tidal-fluvial ‘backwater’ hydraulic regime of two rivers that are micro- (lower Trinity River) and macro- tidally influenced (Chehalis River). This analysis reveals that moving downstream from the fully-fluvial ‘normal flow’ regime through to the tidal-fluvial ‘backwater’ regime, the micro-tidal lower Trinity River displays: (a) a decrease in bankfull channel width and an increase in bankfull channel depth, (b) a decrease in bankfull channel width/depth ratio, (c) a bankfull channel cross-sectional area that remains nearly constant, and (d) both measured and calculated bankfull discharge remains constant at approximately 900 m3sec-1. Conversely, the macro-tidal lower Chehalis River displays: (a) an increase in both bankfull channel width and depth, (b) bankfull channel width/depth ratios that remain constant, (c) a bankfull channel cross-sectional area that increases significantly, and (d) both measured and/or calculated bankfull discharge values range from approximately 800 (normal flow) to 10,000 m3sec-1 (downstream end of backwater regime). Importantly, along the Chehalis River a maximum of ~ 2,000 m3sec-1 of the total bankfull water discharge (10,000 m3sec-1), at the downstream end of the ‘backwater flow’ regime, can be accounted for by the Chehalis River proper and two tributary inputs. This suggests, at this channel cross-sectional location, that the additional 8,000 m3sec-1 of total bankfull water discharge must be supplied by the downstream tidally-sourced component of total water discharge. These results, coupled with the rates of change of measured and/or computed metrics from above, will be utilized to provide insight into the fluvial vs tidal dominance of ancient geologic deposits, such as the Cretaceous McMurray Formation, Alberta, Canada. \n            ",

            "abstract": "Vegetation three-dimensional (3-D) structure is inherently dynamic - plants alter both the allocation of resources within the canopy and branch/shoot morphology at short time-steps to acclimate to local environmental conditions and maximize photosynthetic potential. However, 3-D structure is often ignored in ecological studies because it is difficult to characterize using traditional field methods. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) is a rapidly maturing technique to complement and enhance traditional field methods for quantifying 3-D geometric properties of ecosystems. Two major limitations of TLS include the low temporal resolution that often exists between each data acquisition, and the relatively high cost of such systems (entry level systems cost >$40,000 USD) that puts this method out of reach for many potential users. Consequently, TLS is currently limited as a mainstream method for capturing 3-D geometric ecosystem dynamics. Over the last several years, we have been developing a field-ready autonomously operating terrestrial laser scanner (ATLS) capable of monitoring fine-scale changes in vegetation structure on a daily time-step. We will present an overview of recent findings using the ATLS to track changes in vegetation structure in low-stature ecosystems – from cropping system dynamics to Arctic tundra phenology. Further, we will discuss the potential for laser intensity return information from both an ATLS and TLS to track changes in plant phenology and physiology (Chlorophyll content, photoprotective mechanisms, moisture) that occur simultaneously – or prior to – changes in vegetation structure. Our results suggest that fine-scale mapping of plant structure, phenology, and physiology using information from TLS and ATLS could provide new insights into vegetation dynamics in space and time.",

Most of the flows were induced by shallow slide in the upstream. This disaster claimed 74 death, although this city experienced very similar disaster in 1999, claiming more than 30 residents lives. In the most severely affected debris flow torrent, more than 50 residents were killed. Most of the casualties arose in the wooden, vulnerable houses constructed in front of the exit of torrents. Points and lessons learnt from the disaster are as follows:\n1. Authors collected two types of sands from the source scar of the initial debris slides which induced debris flows. Tested by the ring shear apparatus under pore-pressure control condition, clear \"Sliding surface liquefaction\" was confirmed for both samples even under small normal stress, representing the small thickness of the slides. These results shows even instant excess pore pressure could initiate the slides and trigger slide-induced debris flow by\nundrained loading onto the torrent deposits.\n2. Apparently long-term land-use change since 1945 affected and raised the vulnerability of the community. Residential area had expanded into hill-slope (mountainous / semi-mountainous area) especially along the torrents. Those communities were developed on the past debris flow fan.\n3. As the devastated area is very close to downtown of Hiroshima city, it gave large societal impact to the Japanese citizens. After 1999 Hiroshima debris flow disaster, the Landslide disaster reduction law which intends to promote designation of landslide potential risk zones, was adopted in 2000. Immediately after 2014 disaster, national diet approved revision of the bill to promote rapid completion of the designation over the national territory. MLIT (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Tranportation and Tourism) decided to install X-band rain radars at more sites to cover whole city zones of the country. However, narrow extreme rain bands or spots which can not be detected effectively, often appear these years. It means more rain gauges conncted to the net should be implemented at upstreams of the communities facing torrent exits and on debris fan.",

These methods give cross-correlation functions with modified amplitudes, and tend to accentuate long duration signals, thereby biasing the dominant source direction. Here, to avoid introducing bias, the microseism source direction in the Cascadia region was determined from cross-correlation functions for OBS data using conventional pre-processing. No significantly dominant (in the sense of total energy) microseism source directions are detected.

Species distribution models of the vegetation types proved to over-predict the extent of occupied lands, compared to their mapped extents. Trait based components of the vulnerability assessment were far less influential on level of vulnerability than climate projection. Various cutoffs can be selected to describe refugia. Here we classed refugia as the 20% of climate conditions most frequently occupied by a type. Under CNRM CM5 RCP 4.5, of 70,143 km2 that are the most climate-insulated locations, 46,420 km2 move to higher levels of climate exposure. At the other extreme of climate projections tested, MIROC ESM RCP 8.5, 59,137 km2 are lost. Four macrogroups lose their refugia under CNRM 4.5: Pacific Northwest Conifer Forests, Mountain Riparian Scrub and Wet Meadow, Salt Marsh, and Great Basin Upland Scrub. Under MIROC 8.5 and additional 8 macrogroups lose the most commonly experienced climate: Subalpine Aspen Forests & Pine Woodlands, Non-Native Forest and Woodlands, North Coast Deciduous Scrub and Terrace Prairie, Coastal Dune and Bluff Scrub, Freshwater Marsh, Wet Mountain Meadow, Big Sagebrush Scrub, and Alpine Vegetation. These results raise interesting questions regarding the definition of refugia. We review the results and ask how appropriate they are for different ecosystem types.",

The code post-processes model results to produce V&V and UQ information. This information can be used to assess model performance. Automated information on code performance can allow for a systematic methodology to assess the quality of model approximations. The software implements common and accepted code verification schemes. The software uses the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS), the Method of Exact Solution (MES), Cross-Code Verification, and Richardson Extrapolation (RE) for solution (calculation) verification. It also includes common statistical measures that can be used for model skill assessment. Complete RE can be conducted for complex geometries by implementing high-order non-oscillating numerical interpolation schemes within the software. Model approximation uncertainty is quantified by calculating lower and upper bounds of numerical error from the RE results. The software is also able to calculate the Grid Convergence Index (GCI), and to handle adaptive meshes and models that implement mixed order schemes. Four examples are provided to demonstrate the use of the software for code and solution verification, model validation and uncertainty quantification. The software is used for code verification of a mixed-order compact difference heat transport solver; the solution verification of a 2D shallow-water-wave solver for tidal flow modeling in estuaries; the model validation of a two-phase flow computation in a hydraulic jump compared to experimental data; and numerical uncertainty quantification for 3D CFD modeling of the flow patterns in a Gust erosion chamber.",

We investigated the effects of soil warming and plant rhizosphere on decomposition of 13C-labeled roots buried at two soil depths at the field lysimeter facilities at Hopland Research and Extension Center, CA. The lysimeters contain soil columns 38-cm in diameter and 48-cm deep (0-15 cm A-horizon and 15-48 cm B-horizon, Laughlin soil) sown with an annual grassland mix. The experimental design includes three treatments: heated, ambient, and unplanted. In February 2014 we added 13C-labeled Avena fatua roots to either 8-12 cm or 38-42 cm. We measured loss of 13C in CO2 from the soil surface and in leachate as dissolved organic carbon (DOC) over two growing seasons. At the end of each growing season we recovered the 13C remaining in the soil. In addition, we monitored plant productivity and soil temperature and moisture.\nThe rates of both soil respiration and DOC losses were greatest in heated and least in unplanted plots, although respiration losses far outweighed leachate losses. Treatment affected timing of decomposition; added root litter was respired earlier in the ambient plots and later in the unplanted plots in both years. The litter addition stimulated native soil respiration in year 1 heated plots. The depth of the litter addition did not have an effect on soil respiration. However, after the first growing season, less added root litter remained in the A than in the B horizon (both in the visible root fraction and in the 2mm soil fraction), indicating lower overall decomposition rates at depth.\nThese results, including 13C recovery following the 2nd growing season and soil microclimate variables, will be used to develop a mechanistic understanding of the impacts of soil warming, the rhizosphere, and soil depth on root decomposition and soil organic matter dynamics, and should improve our predictions of the feedbacks between climate change and carbon cycling throughout the soil profile.",

            "abstract": "The mechanism for intermediate depth and deep earthquakes is still under debate. The temperatures and pressures are above the point where ordinary fracture ought to occur. Key to constraining this mechanism using seismological data is the precise determination of hypocentral depth and the robust estimation of source parameters. It is well known that depth phases can provide unique information, which not only allows for significant improvement in event depth determination, but also holds the key to better constraining source properties. Nevertheless, routinely and systematically picking such phases at teleseismic or regional distances is problematic due to poor signal-to-noise ratios around the pP and sP phases. To overcome this limitation we have started taking advantage of the availability of dense seismic arrays. We recently proposed a relative earthquake relocation algorithm based on the precise picking of the P and pP phase arrivals using array processing techniques. We further improve our algorithm by implementing source deconvolution to enhance the signal to noise-ratio of the pP phase, which significantly reduces the uncertainty in our estimate of pP-P arrival times. We are thus able to precisely map intermediate-depth and deep seismicity in regions where it is tightly clustered. As a byproduct of our relocation scheme we get array-based estimates of the source time function for every event-pair in the cluster. We explore the Bucaramanga nest in northern South America, arguably the densest and most active intermediate-depth earthquake nest in the world, and provide evidence for at least two clusters within the nest separated by a depth of no more than 5 km. We also map subduction zone earthquake clusters in Chile and Argentina (depth>100Km) and perform relative measurements of source parameters in an attempt to model the diversity of their source processes.",

As far as we have come, however, there are still great challenges that must be addressed. Determining the relative timing of the different events which comprise onset is perhaps key amongst these, but has proven to be particularly challenging. Here we use optical observations of the onset in white light (THEMIS-ASI) and the 630 nm “redline” (TREx/REGO) to explore the causal relationship between events preceding onset (seen indirectly via auroral streamers) and onset (seen via auroral brightening). To do this, we employ a new analysis technique, called the ‘circogram’, which focuses on the direction of propagation of information in sequences of auroral images.",

            "abstract": "Achieving emissions reductions consistent with a 2 degree Celsius global warming target requires nearly complete replacement of traditional fossil fuel combustion with near-zero carbon energy technologies in the United States by 2050. There are multiple technological change pathways consistent with this deep decarbonization, including strategies that rely on renewable energy, nuclear, and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. The replacement of coal-fired power plants with natural gas-fired power plants has also been suggested as a bridge strategy to achieve near-term emissions reduction targets. These gas plants, however, would need to be replaced by near-zero energy technologies or retrofitted with CCS by 2050 in order to achieve longer-term targets.\nHere we examine the costs and feasibility of a natural gas bridge strategy. Using the Global Change Assessment (GCAM) model, we develop multiple scenarios that each meet the recent US Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to reduce GHG emissions by 26%-28% below its 2005 levels in 2025, as well as a deep decarbonization target of 80% emissions reductions below 1990 levels by 2050. We find that the gas bridge strategy requires that gas plants be retired on average 20 years earlier than their designed lifetime of 45 years, a potentially challenging outcome to achieve from a policy perspective.\nUsing a more idealized model, we examine the net energy system costs of this gas bridge strategy compared to one in which near-zero energy technologies are deployed in the near tem. We explore the sensitivity of these cost results to four factors: the discount rate applied to future costs, the length (or start year) of the gas bridge, the relative capital cost of natural gas vs. near-zero energy technology, and the fuel price of natural gas. The discount rate and cost factors are found to be more important than the length of the bridge. However, we find an important interaction as well. At low discount rates, the gas bridge is more expensive and a shorter bridge is preferred. At high discount rates, the gas bridge is less expensive and a longer bridge is preferred. This result indicates that the valuation of future expenditures relative to present day expenditures is a major factor in determining the merits of a gas bridge strategy.",

Inconsistent with both hypotheses, evidence is found of a cold-MJO signal under horizontally homogenous SSTs. Apparently the intrinsic MJO signal in SPCAM3 is a surprisingly resilient mode that can survive both extreme cooling of the climate and a reversal of near-equatorial meridional MSE gradients. Column MSE analysis indicates a negative overall growth rate of MJO MSE in our coldest simulations, which is hard to reconcile with the survival of a cold MJO from a moisture mode view. A resilience of familiar features of the MJO-MSE budget in our simulations could indicate some other cause, beyond local column MSE dynamics, requires such phase relationships to exist.",

Hydrous mineral formation (e.g. chlorite and serpentine) at P, T conditions corresponding to the slab-mantle wedge interface is observed in experimental studies but has not yet been verified in natural high pressure orogenic peridotites, as there are few definitive tools to distinguish prograde hydrous mineral formation from those formed during exhumation, aside from petrographic textural studies. Here we investigate the boron isotopic composition of hydrous minerals in mafic-ultramafic lithologies both found in an exhumed slab-wedge interface, the Higashi-Akaishi peridotite body of the Sanbagawa metamorphic belt in southwest Japan. The quartz eclogite records peak metamorphic conditions of 2.3-2.4 GPa, 675-740 ºC (Miyamoto et al., 2007), whereas the garnet clinopyroxenite records higher peak conditions of 2.9-3.8 GPa and 700-810ºC, prior to rapid exhumation (Enami et al., 2004). Secondary ion mass spectrometry of paragonite inclusions in garnet porphyroblasts identified in the quartz eclogite yielded δ11B values of ~+5‰ with B concentrations of ~35 ppm. Chlorite is found in textural equilibrium with the anhydrous phases in the garnet clinopyroxenite and records very light B isotopic values (-21.5 ± 4.1‰) and relatively low B concentrations (~3 ppm). Our petrographic and boron isotopic observations in chlorite are consistent with its formation at relatively higher pressures than paragonite. Differences in protolith compositions are likely responsible for differences in B concentrations.\nEnami et al., J. Metamorphic Geol., 22, 1-15 (2004).\nMiyamoto et al., J. of Min. and Petro.

In the upper mantle, flow models and their associated assumptions can be tested and refined with observations of seismic anisotropy, which is treated as a proxy for flow direction. Beneath the transition zone, direct observations of seismic anisotropy are scarce, except for in the lowermost ~250 km of the mantle. In this study, we utilize a comprehensive, previously published (Ford et al., 2015) shear wave splitting study in order to test a three-dimensional global geodynamic flow model (Walker et al., 2011). Our study focuses on a region of the lowermost mantle along the eastern edge of the African Superplume beneath the Afar region. We find that our observations are fit by a model which invokes slip along the (010) plane of post-perovskite with flow directed down and to the southwest.

Measurements were taken from the ground to over 21 km in altitude, from 72 S Latitude to 90 N latitude on over 300 individual flights on NASA Research Aircraft.\nAerosol measurements were made with the University of Denver’s Nucleation-Mode Aerosol Size Spectrometer (NMASS), Focused Cavity Aerosol Spectrometer, and/or a low-pressure Condensation Particle Counter (CPC) depending on the specific campaign. The science payloads varied with the campaign objectives, but the aerosol data were invariably acquired in conjunction with measurements by other investigators placing them in the context of atmospheric composition. The archive includes location and time of the measurements along with the tropopause heights and selected atmospheric composition and state data such as ambient temperatures and pressures, abundances of ozone, N2O, oxides of nitrogen, water vapor, CO2 etc.\nThe data archive is stored in NetCDF format and includes all relevant metadata for measured quantities. This archive will be hosted by NASA and will be available to the public for model validation. The data includes indexing by scientific campaign, date, and spatial coordinates. This will facilitate comparisons across the available range of times, locations and related measurements.\nThis data set has been used for validation of satellite remote sensing data. Coincident measurements of aerosol size distributions were used to calculate extinction profiles which were compared to those retrieved with the SAGE II satellite. Agreement between extinctions derived from the in situ size measurements and those provided by SAGE II was good for the 452, 525, and 1020 nm wavelength channels, but poor for the 386 nm channel.\nProfiles of aerosol number concentrations measured over the altitude range from 4 to 20 km are provided for 11 locations ranging from Punta Arenas, Chile (53 S) to Kiruna, Sweden (67 N).

Some metals have long biological half-lives, and are present within fish for long periods after the fish leave the environments in which those signatures were attained. Within the Columbia River basin of western USA and Canada, tributaries have various elemental signatures of mining and industrial activity, which combined with isotopic signature of industrial elements (Hg, Cd, Pb, etc.) and natural geological isotopic variations of, e.g., Sr, allow life histories of fish to be delineated. Tributaries of the Columbia River flowing into the impounded waters above Grand Coulee Dam offer a record of contamination in fish tissues, which may be correlated with habitat signatures. Point sources, such as sulfide smelters and mining districts, allow particular streams and parts of streams to be identified from their Pb, Sr, and Cd isotopic and trace element concentration signatures. A greater number of elemental and isotopic methods employed in such studies increases the source habitat specificity of this method.",

            "abstract": "Preparing scientists and educators to create and promote practical science-based agricultural approaches to climate change adaptation and mitigation is a main focus of the Regional Approaches to Climate Change (REACCH) project. Social, political and environmental complexities and interactions require that future scientists work across disciplines rather than having isolated knowledge of one specific subject area. Additionally, it is important for graduate students earning M.S. or Ph.D. degrees in agriculture and climate sciences to be able to communicate scientific findings effectively to non-scientific audiences. Unfortunately, university graduate curricula rarely adequately prepare students with these important skills. REACCH recognizes the need for graduate students to have thorough exposure to other disciplines and to be able to communicate information for outreach and education purposes. These priorities have been incorporated into graduate training within the REACCH project. The interdisciplinary nature of the project and its sophisticated digital infrastructure provide graduate students multiple opportunities to gain these experiences. The project includes over 30 graduate students from 20 different disciplines and research foci including agronomy, biogeochemistry, soil quality, conservation tillage, hydrology, pest and beneficial organisms, economics, modeling, remote sensing, science education and climate science. Professional develop workshops were developed and held during annual project meetings to enhance student training. The “Toolbox” survey (\nhttp://www.cals.uidaho.edu/toolbox/\n) was used to achieve effective interdisciplinary communication. Interdisciplinary extension and education projects were required to allow students to gain experience with collaboration and working with stakeholder groups. Results of student surveys and rubrics developed to gauge success in interdisciplinary research and communication may provide a helpful starting point for future projects involving graduate student training.",

During this innovative study we measured d13C in plume gases at a frequency of 0.1 Hz over 5 days of measurements. Assuming two member mixing processes, the extrapolated carbon-isotope composition of the volcanic CO2 ranged from –1.3‰ to +1.5‰, with uncertainties in the repeated single measurements (i.e., made over periods from 4 to 20 min) that were generally <0.7‰, and surprisingly larger variations over the 5-day study period. The range of extrapolated d13C values mostly overlaps with that obtained by discrete sampling and using isotope-ratio mass spectrometry technique (–2.5‰ < d13C < –0.5‰). However, the particular conditions of volcanic activity during the campaign lead us to propose that the carbon-isotope composition of CO2 degassed from magma can reach values (up to +1.5‰), higher than previously reported.\nSimultaneous measurements of the CO2 and SO2 concentrations using the MultiGAS technique were also performed. The volcanic d13C and CO2/SO2 ratios exhibited similar trends over the 5 days of measurements, with the ratios of both tracers peaking on July 16, possibly as a result of the early degassing of CO2 while an eruption was ongoing at Mount Etna.\nNew questions about the variability of this geochemical tracer arise from the observed variations and the highest d13C values measured at Mount Etna during this campaign. The comparisons with the CO2/SO2 ratio also confirm that monitoring d13C in plume gases in real time, coupled to other geochemical tracers, is important for elucidating the magma dynamics at depth.",

Topographic transitions, coupled with surface morphology and underlying stratigraphy define the temporally and spatially integrated patterns of river behavior and sediment dispersal that characterize the delta system. These play important roles in the scale of natural hazards, such as flooding and storm surges, affecting the 150 million inhabitants of the GBMD.\nWithin the upland fan delta, aggradation of mobile braided channels within the active rivers support the wide-scale distribution of bed- and suspended-load sands that constitute nearly the entire underlying architecture of upper GBMD stratigraphy. Finer silt-dominated facies form on the floodplain from overbank deposition during waning stages of flow; however preservation is very low and localized because of the persistent lateral migration of braided channels. A differentiation in stream morphology and channel behavior is associated with a sharp decrease in stream gradient, channel avulsion and abandonment, and the transition across the backwater. Deposition and preservation of fine-grained mud and organic-rich successions are concentrated within broad interdistributary basins of the lowland fluvial plain or within tectonically subsiding Sylhet Basin. While ~15% of the 1 x 109 t yr-1 sediment load carried by the rivers is advected along shore and inland via tidal activity, a rapidly prograding subaqueous clinoform and the adjacent Swatch of No Ground canyon system offshore receive ~50% of the modern sediment load.\nThe overall stability of the GBMD landform, relative to many deltas, reflects the efficient, widespread dispersal of sediment by the large monsoon discharge and high-energy tides that affect this region. Understanding the processes that define inorganic and organic deposition and preservation is useful not only for delta development models, but also informing delta restoration efforts worldwide.",

            "abstract": "Nutrient export to streams and lakes from agricultural activities can result in significant deterioration of water quality and aquatic ecosystem health. In Western Canada, particular concerns arise for prairie agricultural systems, which are dominated by the effects of a cold climate. Insufficient attention has been given to understand the links between cold region watershed responses and nutrient concentration and a robust watershed-scale modeling framework is needed to simulate nutrient concentration and loads. Long-term, field observations of nutrient concentration-runoff relationships were used to develop nutrient concentration models for the Tobacco Creek Model Watershed (TCMW) which drains into the Red River basin. Field observations include streamflow concentrations of N and P at multiple scales from two headwater basins. Distinct nutrient concentration-runoff models for snowmelt, rain on snow (ROS) and rainfall runoff processes were developed from observed runoff-nutrient concentration relationships. Snowmelt runoff had a moderately positive correlation with particulate nutrient concentrations but no correlation with that of dissolved nutrients. ROS runoff had a weak relationship with both particulate and dissolved nutrient concentrations. Rainfall runoff had the strongest positive correlation with particulate nutrient concentrations but no association with that of dissolved nutrients. The modeling approach also identified a clear hysteretic behavior in the relationship between runoff and particulate nutrient concentration during the 2013 snowmelt runoff event at the basin outlet gauge. The models provide insight into the hydrological controls on nutrient export from cold regions watersheds and the strong effects of inter-annual climatic variability. Snowmelt runoff is a reliable exporter of large nutrient loads while nutrient export by rainfall runoff exceeded snowmelt runoff during hydrologically wet summers such as 2002, 2005, 2011 and 2013.",

            "abstract": "The Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica forms a prominent morphologic high along the Middle America forearc where the Cocos plate subducts beneath the Caribbean plate at 8.5 cm/yr. This emergent coastal landmass lies directly above the megathrust along a seismogenic zone that produces frequent major earthquakes. Along the Nicoya coast, Quaternary marine and fluvial terraces record net uplift in a pattern that shadows the peninsula's overall topographic form. Terrace mapping, surveying, and age dating (14C, OSL, TCN) reveal uplift variations that coincide with three contrasting domains of subducting seafloor (EPR, CNS-1, CNS-2). Uplift rates vary between 0.1-0.2 m/ky inboard of older EPR crust in the north; 0.2-0.5 m/ky inboard of younger CNS-1 crust along the central coast; and 1.5-2.5 m/ky inboard of CNS-2 seamounts impacting the peninsula’s southern tip. GIS digital terrain analysis reveals a deformation pattern consistent with field geomorphic and geologic observations. The two largest Nicoya earthquakes in the past century (1950 Mw7.8; 2012 Mw7.6) each generated decimeter-scale coseismic uplift along the central coast. The 2012 uplift pattern coincides with the area of pre-event locking, mainshock slip, prior 1950 rupture, and 1950 coseismic uplift. Most of the 1950 uplift was recovered by gradual interseismic subsidence during six decades of strain accumulation leading to the 2012 rupture. Paleoseismic sediment coring in Nicoya coastal wetlands reveals fragmentary stratigraphic evidence consistent with earlier Holocene earthquake induced changes in land level. While elastic strain accumulation and release produce short-term cycles of uplift and subsidence, long-term net uplift results in gradual coastal emergence and the growth of topographic relief. Net uplift along the central Nicoya segment may be the product of irrecoverable seismic cycle strain (shortening), coupled with tectonic erosion near the trench and subsequent underplating of eroded material at depth beneath the peninsula. Our results are consistent with geophysical observations that indicate along-strike segmentation of the Nicoya seismogenic zone and the presence of three principal source areas for large earthquakes: 1) Papagayo (1916, M>7.0), 2) Nicoya (1950, Mw7.8; 2012 Mw7.6), and 3) Cobano (1990 Mw7.3).",

            "abstract": "Correlating the spatial variation of hillslope sediment grain size with geomorphic process regimes is essential for understanding feedbacks between sediment production on hillslopes and channel processes. At our field site at Inyo Creek, California, an elevation gradient in the size of sediment produced on hillslopes has been quantified using cosmogenic nuclides and detrital thermochronometry with samples collected at the outlet. Here we report field measurements of surface sediment size from hillslopes within the catchment, which validate those findings. Specifically, we use multiple field methods to measure hillslope grain size distributions, and correlate size variations with geomorphic process regimes across an elevation gradient. We select sampling sites from maps of predicted grain size created by overlaying landscape attributes in GIS to delineate geomorphic landscape units (GLUs). Geomorphic process regimes include bare bedrock, angle of repose slopes of talus, landslide deposits and soil mantled convex hillslopes. We use tape transects and point counts to quantify size distributions of regolith covered slopes. We also analyze photographs using The Digital Grain Size Project software, and for sediments too small to be resolved in photos we collect bulk samples for sieve analysis in the lab. To measure joint spacing, and infer the initial size distribution of rock fragments produced by bare bedrock, we use combine photographs with measurements made with tape transects, and aerial photographs for inaccessible areas. Our findings indicate that higher elevation slopes do indeed supply coarser sediment. Lower elevations have bimodal size distributions composed of sand with scattered boulders, while at higher elevations, slopes are composed a unimodal distribution of gravel, cobbles, and boulders. While boulder density does not vary significantly with elevation, we find a highly significant linear increase in the fraction of gravel and cobble-sized particles with elevation. Bedrock exposure also increases with elevation, becoming the dominant land cover in the upper catchment; bedrock at lower elevations appears more weathered in comparison to bedrock at higher elevations. Ongoing work includes analysis of joint spacing, bulk samples, and correlation with geomorphic process regimes.",

            "abstract": "In the intermountain West, much like the rest of the world, agriculture is the oldest and largest water consumer. Particularly in the arid headwaters states of the intermountain west changing water demands are highlighting the importance of water use efficiency in agriculture. In flood irrigation an area is irrigated until saturation is achieved although crops only consume a portion of the total water applied. The remaining water eventually returns to streams or aquifers. Accurately quantifying the portion of applied water that is consumptively used—and its corollary in the form of return flows—represents an important avenue for potential water use reduction in the face of increasing demands from sundry downstream users.\nConsumptive use has historically been understood as the difference between the irrigation water applied and irrigation water returned to adjacent surface waters via quick or delayed return flow as well as overland flow. Penman-derived models, which calculate evapotranspiration based on meteorological data, are another widely recognized method for estimating consumptive use. We determined consumptive use on an agricultural field in northeastern Wyoming using both of these two traditional methods as well as a quantitative scintillometer-based estimate, which couples meteorological data with the latent heat flux across a field to measure evapotranspiration for a given area. Since the wider application of the scintillometer is limited by the instrument’s complexity and cost, a comparison of the resulting data with these two more customary methods provides critical insight in to where certain methods might under or overestimate consumptive use. The purpose of this comparison is twofold. First, the comparison of these three methods allows for the optimization of a reach-scale water budget that aims to better characterize and quantify return flow processes. Second, the addition of information that couples hydrology, meteorology, geophysics, and heat fluxes over one particular area enhances the corpus of comparative data from which academics and managers can refine extant strategies for consumptive use estimation.",

            "abstract": "Due to its high toxicity and mobility, U(VI) poses a major environmental threat to ecosystems. The ubiquitous aerobic bacterium Caulobacter cresecentus is an attractive candidate for U(VI) bioremediation because of its ability to survive in low-nutrient environments (5, 6), tolerate high U concentrations and mineralize U(VI) aerobically through the formation of uranyl phosphate (U-Pi) precipitates. Despite these attractive environmental properties, both a systems level understanding of the adaptive response pathways involved in U tolerance and the environmental conditions affecting the biomineralization process and stability of biogenic U-Pi minerals remain limited. By measuring changes in both mRNA and protein expression during exposure to high U levels, we have identified the core stress response pathways involved in U tolerance. Pathways associated with heat shock, lipospolysaccharide biosynthesis and transport, outer membrane lipoprotein transport and outermembrane assembly were highly induced at both the RNA and protein levels. Correspondingly, removal of integral components of proteolysis pathways including clpA, clpS and degP significantly reduced U tolerance under biomineralization conditions. Surprisingly, in contrast to many other heavy metals, U did not cause oxidative stress or DNA damage. Together, these analyses indicate that U predominately targets the outermembrane and causes mis-folding of both cytoplasmic and extracytoplasmic proteins. Efforts are currently underway to characterize the morphological and structural properties of biogenic U-Pi minerals and the environmental factors that influence their production and stability. Preliminary AFM studies suggest that U-Pi minerals formed under biomineralization conditions appear morphologically distinct from those formed abiotically between U(VI) and inorganic phosphate. Additionally, we observed that biomineralization tolerates a wide pH range (pH 6-9). Our long-range goal is the development of a conceptual model of the role of microbes in U cycling under oxidizing conditions across the DOE complex, and ultimately, provide DOE with the scientific basis to support decisions for the remediation of legacy sites.",

Scientists, practitioners, and firefighting agencies look forward to the widespread adoption of this powerful technology and its regular use. Similarly, the UAS industry awaits opportunities for commercialization. Our collaboration brings together UAS industry, research and management agencies, and universities in the USA and Canada to investigate the perceived effectiveness of UAS for wildland fire use, and the factors affecting their commercial-scale employment. Our current and future activities include market research, training and technology transfer, and deployment of UAS over fires to promote development of sensors as well as their safe integration into fire operations. We will present initial results, and as a part of our presentation we also invite participation of the AGU community for planned future project phases. We anticipate that the outcomes of our work will be useful to potential users who are unfamiliar with UAS, and to researchers and practitioners with experience or an interest in their use in fire and related natural-resource disciplines.",

To complement the continuous GPS measurements from the PBO network, we have conducted campaign-style GPS surveys of 19 benchmarks along Highway 78 in the years 2012, 2013, and 2014. We processed the campaign GPS data using GAMIT to obtain horizontal velocities. The data show high velocity gradients East of the surface trace of the Coyote Creek Fault. We also processed InSAR data from the ascending and descending tracks of the ENVISAT mission between the years 2003 and 2010. The InSAR data were corrected for atmospheric artifacts using an iterative common point stacking method. We combined average velocities from different look angles to isolate the fault-parallel velocity field, and used fault-parallel velocities to compute strain rate. We filtered the data over a range of wavelengths prior to numerical differentiation, to reduce the effects of noise and to investigate both shallow and deep sources of deformation. At spatial wavelengths less than 2km the strain rate data show prominent anomalies along the San Andreas and Superstition Hills faults, where shallow creep has been documented by previous studies. Similar anomalies are also observed along parts of the Coyote Creek Fault, San Felipe Fault, and an unmapped southern continuation of the Clark strand of the San Jacinto Fault. At wavelengths on the order of 20km, we observe elevated strain rates concentrated east of the Coyote Creek Fault. The long-wavelength strain anomaly east of the Coyote Creek Fault, and the localized shallow creep observed in the short-wavelength strain rate data over the same area suggest that there may be a \"blind\" segment of the Clark Fault that accommodates a significant portion of the deformation on the southern end of the San Jacinto Fault.",

            "abstract": "Progradation of coarse clastic material into distal foreland basins has been attributed to both 1) enhanced sediment production during rapid tectonic exhumation and 2) sediment reworking during tectonic quiescence. The Floresta and Medina basins in the Eastern Cordillera record deposition of alternating coarse- and fine-grained clastic strata in medial and distal (respectively) Cenozoic foreland basins. The Medina Basin records the continued eastward progradation of the deformation front in the Neogene. We use detrital zircon U-Pb (ZPb) and (U-Th)/He (ZHe) analyses from the Paleogene Floresta Basin and the entire Cenozoic Medina Basin record to evaluate the effects of episodic thrust-belt exhumation and wide-spread deposition of coarse-grained sediments in the adjacent foreland basin. Both ZPb and ZHe systems are applied to individual grains (double dating) to constrain source area and up-section variations in exhumation rates. Changes in exhumation rate or introduction of new sediment sources are recorded as changes in lag time (ZHe age – depositional age). Analysis of 6 samples from the Floresta Basin shows a decrease in lag time during deposition of the coarse-grained middle Eocene Picacho Formation and upper Paleocene Socha Sandstone suggesting that Paleogene deposition of coarse-grained intervals in this medial location corresponds to an increase in exhumation rate. However, initial results from the Medina basin are less clear as there is evidence for Paleocene volcanic input but no clear evidence for thrust-belt related sediment until the Oligocene-early Miocene. We interpret the evidence for different sediment sources for Eocene strata in the axial Eastern Cordillera (Floresta) versus the Eastern foothills (Medina) as indicative of separation of these two regions by an emergent forebulge. Exhumation rate and granularity appear to be inversely correlated in post-Oligocene strata, though confirmation of initial interpretations awaits larger samples sizes",

            "abstract": "Rapid warming in arctic and sub-arctic environments shifts plant community structure which in turn can alter carbon cycling by releasing large stocks of carbon sequestered in arctic soils. Much work has been done in sub-arctic peatlands to understand how shifts in dominant vegetation cover can ultimately affect global carbon balances, but less focus has been given to upland environments where similar changes are occurring. Recent circumpolar expansion of deciduous shrubs and trees in sub-arctic upland environments may alter carbon cycling due to shrubs and trees sequestering less C in soils than the heath plants they typically replace. In this study we explored the relationship between nutrient and carbon cycling and above-ground vegetation on six transects which traverse an ecotone gradient from heath tundra (dominated by ericoid mycorrhizal plants) through deciduous shrubs to deciduous trees (dominated by ectomycorrhizal plants) in upland environments of sub-arctic Sweden near Vassijaure (~850 mm precipitation) and Abisko (~300 mm precipitation). We collected soil and foliage for analysis of natural abundances of stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes (δ13C and δ15N), which can be a sensitive indicator of C and N dynamics. We also took high-resolution remote aerial imagery over the transects to calculate percent cover of vegetation types using GIS software. We concurrently estimated percent cover in smaller plots on the ground of three dominant species, Empetrum nigrum, Betula nana, and Betula pubescens, to serve as ground-truthing for the aerial imagery. Analysis of vegetation cover data shows significant differences in vegetation types along the transects. Preliminary multiple regression analysis of isotopes shows that δ13C in organic soil at the Vassijaure site is mostly controlled by distance along the transect, an interaction term between transect distance and soil depth, and δ15N (adjusted r2 = 0.85, p < 0.0001). Values of δ13C were lower in soils in the shrubs and forest than in the heath. In regression analyses, δ15N was primarily controlled by depth, and secondarily by heath cover (adjusted r2 = 0.68, p < 0.0001). These results suggest that trees and shrubs are sequestering carbon, and interactions between plants and belowground soil communities may be driving nitrogen dynamics.",

Recognizing this need, the President’s Climate Action Plan called for the creation of a coordinated national soil moisture network. In response, a team led by the National Integrated Drought Information System has completed a proof-of-concept pilot project. The pilot comprises both in-situ and assimilated soil moisture datasets. It focuses on providing real-time soil moisture data via standard web services to feed map-based visualization tools in order to meet the following use cases: operational drought monitoring, experimental land surface modeling, and operational hydrological modeling. The result of this pilot is a reference architecture that will inform the implementation of the national network.",

By using the the latest bibliometric indicators, the statistical analysis of the quantities and qualities was carried out for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau literature indexed by SCIE during 1900 and 2012. It focused on the published years, journals, countries, cities, research institutes, international cooperation, and subjects. Some statistical results were displayed and deeply analyzed by using the tools of mapping knowledge domain (MKD) and geographic information system (GIS). The results of the Bibliometric analysis indicate that the publication and citation of QTP researches have a jump after entering the 21st century. China, USA, India, Canada and France are the main coutries engaged in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau studies. Knowledge mapping results show that USA, UK and France have longer academic influential power of QTP researches, which indicates that these countries begin to study QTP early and the papers have longer permanent impacts. On the other hand, China, India and Japan have higher academic influential power in recent years, which indicate that these countries have more publications and higher impacts recently. The disciplines of QTP researches mainly focus on the geology, geochemistry &geophysics, environmental sciences &ecology, and so on. The spatial analysis indicates that the differences of the disciplines are emphasized by different countries. The above analysis results is hoped to integrate the new knowledge and reveal the development tendency of the QTP researches.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU2015_rev1.pdf\nThroughout the 20th century, trends in California Central Valley fog frequency have changed dramatically without explanation. While episodes of dense radiation fog, known regionally as Tule Fog, increased steadily from 1930-1970, analysis from both ground and remote sensing measurements confirm a 46-50% reduction in fog days in the last 30 years (Baldocchi and Waller, 2014, Herkes et al., 2014). The dominant hypotheses suggest that the recent decline in radiation fog can be explained by the rising temperatures associated with climate change or urban heat island effect. This assertion fails to explain the significant increase in Central Valley fog midcentury. Here we instead assert that changes in air pollution, rather than climate, better support this upward then downward temporal trend. Automobile use greatly increased emissions of nitrogen oxide (NOx) midcentury, followed by a large decrease in vehicle emissions due to statewide regulation from 1980 to present. In the Central Valley, NOx from automobile emissions contributes to the formation ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3), the dominant hygroscopic aerosol in the valley’s wintertime boundary layer that can act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) necessary for fog droplet formation. Thus, changes in air pollution not only affect the number of CCN, but may also impact the density and persistence of fog episodes. Using NOAA meteorological records throughout the twentieth century, we will show the correlation between fog frequency, air pollution, and climatic drivers. We conclude that fog trends are closely correlated with changes in air pollution, rather than solely climate change.",

However, clear spectral detections of ice are absent indicating that the uppermost material is dry. Further constraints on near surface ice come from detections of water vapor around Ceres by the Herschel telescope [3], which indicate production rates of 1026molecules per second.\nHere we build on the pioneering work of [4] and examine ground ice stability with the benefit of these new observations as well as accurate pole-vector determinations by Dawn. We model surface and subsurface temperatures on Ceres by balancing surface insolation, thermal emission and conduction to the subsurface. We estimate ice loss rates for both surface ice and ice covered with a low-thermal-inertia sublimation lag.\nDawn observations show no large high-albedo regions indicating pure surface ice. In the case where pore-filling ice (50% ice by volume) extends to the surface, average loss rates range from almost zero (mm/Gyr) at the poles to several decimeters per year at the equator. These loss rates are suppressed by 2-3 orders of magnitude when this pore-filling ice is covered by even a few centimeters of dry sublimation lag, which is expected to form on geologically short timescales. Assuming negligible internal heat flux, we estimate the outgassing of water molecules expected from buried ice at all latitudes and in combination with previous work [5,6] find that the observations of [3] cannot be due to global sublimation of buried ice.\nDawn observations also show the presence of small-scale high-albedo spots. Our models show that, if icy, the most prominent of these (in Occator crater) loses ~2cm/yr. Suggestively, the area and sublimation rates of the Occator bright spots match the observed vapor production rates of [3]. However, these high loss rates are difficult to reconcile with long-term spot persistence without a source of resupply. Continued monitoring by Dawn over the coming months in the high- and low-altitude mapping orbits will test for changes.\n[1] McCord and Sotin, J. Geophys. Res., 2005.

            "abstract": "Remote sensing data and climate model output are multi-dimensional arrays of massive sizes locked away in heterogeneous file formats (HDF5/4, NetCDF 3/4) and metadata models (HDF-EOS, CF) making it difficult to perform multi-stage, iterative science processing since each stage requires writing and reading data to and from disk.\nWe have developed SciSpark, a robust Big Data framework, that extends ApacheTM Spark for scaling scientific computations. Apache Spark improves the map-reduce implementation in ApacheTM Hadoop for parallel computing on a cluster, by emphasizing in-memory computation, “spilling” to disk only as needed, and relying on lazy evaluation. Central to Spark is the Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD), an in-memory distributed data structure that extends the functional paradigm provided by the Scala programming language. However, RDDs are ideal for tabular or unstructured data, and not for highly dimensional data.\nThe SciSpark project introduces the Scientific Resilient Distributed Dataset (sRDD), a distributed-computing array structure which supports iterative scientific algorithms for multidimensional data. SciSpark processes data stored in NetCDF and HDF files by partitioning them across time or space and distributing the partitions among a cluster of compute nodes.\nWe show usability and extensibility of SciSpark by implementing distributed algorithms for geospatial operations on large collections of multi-dimensional grids. In particular we address the problem of scaling an automated method for finding Mesoscale Convective Complexes. SciSpark provides a tensor interface to support the pluggability of different matrix libraries. We evaluate performance of the various matrix libraries in distributed pipelines, such as Nd4jTM and BreezeTM.\nWe detail the architecture and design of SciSpark, our efforts to integrate climate science algorithms, parallel ingest and partitioning (sharding) of A-Train satellite observations from model grids. These solutions are encompassed in SciSpark, an open-source software framework for distributed computing on scientific data.",

The precipitates in the hot spring are composed of large amounts of calcite, aragonite, and sulfur. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses revealed that the microbial mats were formed of various coccoid, rod-shaped, and filamentous microbes. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the intracellular sulfur granules were commonly associated with these microbes. A culture-independent molecular phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the majority of the bacteria in the spring were sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. In the spring water, H2S concentration was up to 60 ppm, while SO42- concentration was only about 10 ppm. We speculated that H2S might be utilized by sulfur-oxidizing bacteria in this hot spring water, leading to the intracellular formation of sulfur granules. In the meantime, this reaction increased the pH in the micron-scale microdomains, which fostered the precipitation of calcium carbonate in the microbial mats. The results of this study indicated that the sulfur-oxidizing bacteria could play an important role in calcium carbonate precipitation in slightly acidic hot spring environments.",

            "abstract": "Geochemical interactions during the withdrawal/injection of fluids into the subsurface can modify fracture apertures through dissolution and/or precipitation of minerals. Modification of fracture apertures during reactive flow is strongly affected by non-reactive, non-wetting fluids that limit the fracture surface area and void volume that can be affected by reactive phases. We present results on the effect of a non-reactive, non-wetting phase during reactive flow on the distribution of precipitates and channelization caused by dissolution in fractures.\nTransparent acrylic casts of a fracture in Austin chalk were used to image mineral precipitation during reactive flow. Initially, the fracture was saturated with a solution of 0.6mol/L NaHCO3 and 0.00085mol/L NaCl. Then, both the aqueous NaHCO3 - NaCl and a solution containing 3mol/L CaCl2 were pumped into the sample (0.5 ml/min) for 2 hrs. When the two solutions mix inside the fracture, CaCO3 precipitates form and CO2 bubbles are generated. CO2 bubbles affect the amount of precipitation. X-ray CT data show that precipitate thickness varies within the fracture, occurs on both fracture surfaces and also bridges the surfaces. In the test, where a CO2 bubble filled a void, precipitation did not occur. If the CO2 bubble was smaller than the pore, thin films of precipitates occurred on the fracture surfaces above and below the bubble. While fracture apertures controlled the mixing of the fluids, CO2 bubbles affected the thickness and distribution of the precipitates.\nFrom our numerical study, channelization in a fracture is affected by the presence of a non-wetting non-reactive phase (e.g. gas) during dissolution. A modified Navier-Stokes approach was used to calculate fluxes through spatially correlated aperture distributions as a function of gas saturation. Dissolution was taken to be proportional to flux. For gas saturations < 15%, channelization occurred along the dominant flow path. However, for gas saturations >25%, dissolution along the dominant flow path was prevented, a new dominant channel was formed and single phase flow rates decreased by a factor of 10.\nThis work was supported by Center for Nanoscale Control of Geologic CO₂ (NCGC) an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by DOE, Office of Science, BES under Award # DE-AC02-05CH11231",

The calibration of the observed non-gravitational accelerations requires determining a scaling factor and (at least) an offset for the observations in each of the three directions. We demonstrate in this presentation how small errors in the scale factors used to calibrate the accelerometer observations affect the noise level in the estimated temporal gravity field. We performed a parameter space search to find the optimal scale factors that generated the smallest prefit range-rate residuals and found that we can model the satellite orbits without the use of any empirical parameters, whilst still being able to identify the temporal gravity field signal in the prefit KBRR residuals. We will describe some physical conditions when the satellites are in the shadow of the Earth that we use to constrain the estimates of calibration biases and scales and show how the noise level of the estimated temporal gravity field varies with and without the use of the optimal calibration values for the accelerometer observations. A similar approach will be both required and effective to calibrate the accelerometers onboard the GRACE Follow-On mission.",

            "abstract": "Terrain aspect alters the spatial distribution of insolation across topography, driving eco-pedo-hydro-geomorphic feedbacks that can alter landform evolution and result in valley asymmetries for a suite of land surface characteristics (e.g. slope length and steepness, vegetation, soil properties, and drainage development). Asymmetric valleys serve as natural laboratories for studying how landscapes respond to climate perturbation. In the semi-arid montane granodioritic terrain of the Idaho batholith, Northern Rocky Mountains, USA, prior works indicate that reduced insolation on northern (pole-facing) aspects prolongs snow pack persistence, and is associated with thicker, finer-grained soils, that retain more water, prolong the growing season, support coniferous forest rather than sagebrush steppe ecosystems, stabilize slopes at steeper angles, and produce sparser drainage networks. We hypothesize that the primary drivers of valley asymmetry development are changes in the pedon-scale water-balance that coalesce to alter catchment-scale runoff and drainage development, and ultimately cause the divide between north and south-facing land surfaces to migrate northward. We explore this conceptual framework by coupling land surface analyses with statistical modeling to assess relationships and the relative importance of land surface characteristics. Throughout the Idaho batholith, we systematically mapped and tabulated various statistical measures of landforms, land cover, and hydroclimate within discrete valley segments (n=~10,000). We developed a random forest based statistical model to predict valley slope asymmetry based upon numerous measures (n>300) of landscape asymmetries. Preliminary results suggest that drainages are tightly coupled with hillslopes throughout the region, with drainage-network slope being one of the strongest predictors of land-surface-averaged slope asymmetry. When slope-related statistics are excluded, due to possible autocorrelation, valley slope asymmetry is most strongly predicted by asymmetries of insolation and drainage density, which generally supports a water-balance based conceptual model of valley asymmetry development. Surprisingly, vegetation asymmetries had relatively low predictive importance.",

            "abstract": "In a number of recent studies, errors in the downwelling shortwave irradiance (Qsi) have been shown to hinder the ability of physically-based land-surface models to simulate fluxes of energy and water and can lead to erroneous parameter values. However, the uncertainty in the forcing data, especially Qsi, is rarely considered, at least in part because the uncertainties in Qsi are not well-characterized over complex terrain.\nIn this study we provide a novel evaluation and diagnosis of error sources for 4 different methods for estimating Qsi: NLDAS, MTCLIM, CERES Synoptic Fluxes and Clouds, and output from a regional reanalysis. These methods are evaluated over a study area in California spanning the Central Valley and Sierra Nevada, which contains 73 sites that observe Qsi over the period of 2002-2012. This environment represents a particular challenge for estimating Qsi due to cloud patterns over fine temporal (e.g., afternoon thunderstorms) and spatial (e.g., valley fog) scales. Since observations are made with lower-quality instruments, limiting absolute accuracy at any individual site, we instead use the spatial coherence in bias magnitude and sign to characterize errors.\nThe absolute biases at all stations in the study domain over the study period are small (<20Wm-2). However, at the monthly scale, large biases between irradiance methods and groups of stations occur. Mountain stations west of the Sierra crest exhibit large (>40Wm-2) monthly biases while the stations nearby, but to the east of the crest, exhibit small, negative biases (<-20Wm-2). Valley stations have overall small errors during the winter, suggesting all methods capture the behavior of the persistent radiation fog that forms in the valley. In contrast, during late spring and summer, biases in Qsi increase dramatically (>80Wm-2), correlating with increasing aerosol optical depth. At high elevations the four methods disagree on the monthly mean of Qsi with a spread greater than 100Wm-2. Finally, we show how the choice of Qsi method impacts gradients of Qsi with elevation, mostly as a consequence of the method’s spatial resolution. These errors are attributable to differences in how each method estimates Qsi.",

Spectral features in shortwave radiation transmitted through clouds are sensitive to changes in cloud optical thickness, effective radius, and thermodynamic phase. The spectral features due to absorption and scattering processes by liquid water and ice cloud particles include shifts in spectral slopes, curvatures, maxima, and minima of cloud-transmitted radiance. These spectral features have been quantified by 15 parameters used to retrieve cloud properties from the 4STAR zenith radiances. Retrieved cloud optical thicknesses and effective radii based on transmitted shortwave radiation are compared to their counterparts obtained from reflected shortwave radiation measured above cloud with MODIS and with the enhanced MODIS Airborne Simulator (eMAS), the Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP), and SSFR operating aboard the NASA ER-2 aircraft.

The intentional and intelligent modification of human behavior to balance environmental impact with human wellbeing is seen as the key to entering what Jeffrey Sachs has called the ‘Age of Sustainable Development’.\nThere are mechanisms, legal, socio-cultural, religious, economic, and technological that may ameliorate to varying degrees the environmental impact of human activity. These mechanisms are explored at length in the literature and assessed by their capacity to encourage or compel compliant behavior. They rely heavily on individual and collective choices based on rational self-interest, which is in turn informed by knowledge.\nThe role of education in facilitating sustainable human activity is a key feature of many contributions to the literature. The alarming shortcoming in these discussions is the absence of an effective approach to learned sustainability that may achieve the necessary changes in human behavior and particularly adult choices with respect to daily acts of consumption. Sustainable practices and choices are most effectively produced through immersion in experientially based learning programs aimed at elementary and secondary school students. The experience of sustainable living during the critical phase of personal identity formation is the key to shaping behavior, and not just imparting knowledge.\nThis AGU education session, ED041: Teaching Sustainability and Human Impact through Collaborative Teaching Methods, explores the principles on which such experiential immersion learning contributes to genuine sustainable behaviors and choices through targeted, intelligently designed residential programs.",

Recently developed ion microprobe methods based upon measurement of doubly ionized species partially overcome the latter problem and have been applied to high K/Ca micas. The ability to interpret K-Ar and K-Ca results is limited due to uncertainty in the relative diffusion properties of Ca and Ar. To address this problem, we are performing Ar and Ca diffusion experiments and fluid-crystal Ar partitioning experiments with anhydrous F-phlogopite that is stable to 1390°C. As an additional check, we are comparing K-Ca and K-Ar ages from natural mantle phlogopites from a variety of settings to assess the relative retentivity of Ar and Ca. South African xenoliths tend to yield 40Ar/39Ar ages that are much older than K-Ca ages from the same phologopites. Possible excess 40Ar and high common Ca render the comparisons inconclusive, but this suggests that Ca diffuses more readily than Ar in phlogopite. Our most definitive K-Ca phlogopite results (i.e., least affected by common Ca) come from the Archean Seqi dunite of SW Greenland. The K-Ca ages of Seqi phlogopites is 927 ± 26 Ma (2s). Incremental heating 40Ar/39Ar results from the same sample yields a much older result with a terminal age of 3.5 Ga. However, the first 5-10% of 39Ar release are consistent with transient heating at ca. 900 Ma. Considered together, the K-Ca and 40Ar/39Ar results from the Seqi dunite locality strongly suggest that Ca diffusion is more rapid than Ar diffusion in phlogopite.",

Because natural gas (NG) methane is an energy resource, an economic commodity, a potential health hazard, and a potent greenhouse gas, it is important to identify and quantify and control both intentional venting, and un-intentional leakages. Here, we report results of an observational survey, measuring NG methane emissions across examples from subsectors of California’s natural gas infrastructure, ranging from production and processing, to transmission and distribution, and notably including examples from the consumption subsector. At regional scales, a combination of tower and aircraft measurements are used to estimate emissions of NG methane for the San Francisco Bay Area. At facility scales, aircraft mass balance measurements are applied to estimate NG methane emissions from associated with individual petroleum production fields, NG storage facilities, and petroleum refineries. At local scales, ground-based roadway surveys are applied to place lower limits on NG emissions from aggregate leakage sources in selected urban and suburban areas, a sample of NG fueling stations, and a small number of capped gas wells. For a subset of the consumption subsector, mass balance and CH4:CO2 emission ratio measurements are used to estimate leakage from a sample of quiescent residential buildings and example operating gas appliances. In general, CH4 emissions are found to grow with the NG throughput in a given area or facility, though the observed ratio of leakage to throughput varies by more than an order of magnitude for some cases (e.g., urban areas), presumably in response to varied infrastructure type, vintage, and maintenance. Taken in sum, preliminary results of this initial survey are consistent with the commonly held assumption that total NG methane emissions from California NG infrastructure are likely less than 1% of total gas consumption, though this study cannot place an all-encompassing upper-limit at this time. In any case, we expect that the techniques described here will provide useful for prioritizing future NG leakage mitigation activities.",

Climate information services have the potential to cushion rural households from extreme climate risks. However, most the probabilistic nature of climate information products is not easily understood by majority of smallholder farmers. Despite the probabilistic nature, climate information have proved to be a valuable climate risk adaptation strategy at the farm level. This calls for innovative ways to help farmers understand and apply climate information services to inform their farm level decisions. The study endeavored to co-design and test appropriate innovation systems for climate information services uptake and scale up necessary for achieving climate risk development. In addition it also determined the conditions necessary to support the effective performance of the proposed innovation system. Data and information sources included systematic literature review, secondary sources, government statistics, focused group discussions, household surveys and semi-structured interviews. Data wasanalyzed using both quantitative and qualitative data analysis techniques. Quantitative data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software. Qualitative data was analyzed using qualitative techniques, which involved establishing the categories and themes, relationships/patterns and conclusions in line with the study objectives. Sustainable livelihood, reduced household poverty and climate change resilience were the impact that resulted from the study.\n ",

We interpret these mudcrack-like patterns, found on many of the bedrock exposures imaged by Curiosity, as desiccation cracks that developed either of two ways: 1) at the soft sediment-air interface like common mudcracks, or 2) at or below the sediment-water interface by synaeresis or diastasis (involving differential compaction). In the context of recent studies of terrestrial mudcracks, and cracks formed experimentally in various wet powders as they loose moisture, these desiccation features reflect diverse aspects of the formative environment. If they formed as mudcracks, some of the lakes were shallow enough to permit the recurrent drying and wetting that can lead to the geometric regularity characteristic of several of sets of mudcracks. Moreover, the water likely contained little suspended sediment otherwise the mudcracks would be buried too rapidly for the crack pattern to persist and to mature into regular polygonal patterns. The preservation of these desiccation crack patterns does not require, but does not exclude, deep burial and exhumation. Although invisible from satellite because of their size, a multitude of Mastcam and Navcam images reveals these informative features in considerable detail. These images complement much evidence, mostly from HiRISE data from several regions, suggesting that potential desiccation polygons on larger scales may be more common on the surface of Mars than generally recognized.",

While there are no spacecraft to perform in situ measurements of the SW plasma and heliospheric magnetic field in the heliotail, it is of importance for the interpretation of measurements of energetic neutral atom fluxes performed by Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX). It has been shown recently that the orientation of the heliotail in space and distortions of the unperturbed LISM caused by its presence may be able to explain some features in the anisotropy map of TeV cosmic ray flux detected in air shower experiments. The SW flow in the heliotail is a mystery itself because it is strongly affected by charge exchange between the SW ions and interstellar neutral atoms. If the angle between the Sun's magnetic and rotation axes is constant, the SW in the tail tends to be concentrated inside the heliospheric magnetic field spirals deflected tailward, exhibiting a two-lobe structure similar to Yu (1974) and Opher et al. (2015). However, the twisted field soon becomes unstable and the reason for the SW collimation within a two-lobe structure vanishes. The resulting solution exhibits features typical of magnetic reconnection. We demonstrate that kinetic treatment of the H atom transport becomes essential in this case to explain the lobe absence further along the tail. If the angle between the Sun’s magnetic and rotation axes is not constant, the flow collimation becomes latitudinally dependent. We show that the heliotail flow is strongly affected by the solar cycle that eliminates artifacts typical of solutions based on simplifying assumptions. The heliopause in the tail is subject to Kelvin--Helmholtz instability, but its orientation and shape are determined by the ISMF direction and strength.",

            "abstract": "Low-temperature thermochronology was applied to constrain the Mesozoic and Cenozoic tectonic evolution of the continental margin of southeast Brazil. Using apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronology (AHe), we acquired data from 107 crystals of basement samples collected from a NW–SE transect in the Mantiqueira Mountains to the Guanabara Graben, as well as from the NE–SE transverse faults. The data range from 43.5 ± 1.9 Ma to 250.1 ± 8.7 Ma (2 σ) for corrected ages. The Neo-Cretaceous, Eo-Cretaceous, and Paleocene are the main recorded AHe ages, in order of importance. The Eo-Cretaceous ages indicate the occurrence of older thermal events related to a pre-rifting phase (~121 Ma). The Neo-Cretaceous ages signify the importance of tectonic and magmatic events, and regional uplifting for the thermal history of the study area, including ages related to the Serra do Mar Mountains uplift (~86 Ma). Paleocene ages seem to be related to the reactivation (~65 Ma), which was responsible for the continental rifts in the southeastern Brazil. Finally, the Eocene ages (49.7 Ma and 43.5 Ma), which are from samples restricted to the Resende Basin border faults, indicate a continental rift reactivation. Time–temperature (t–T) paths obtained from inverse modeling, performed using HeFTy (Ketcham, 2005) with a Radiation Damage Diffusion and Annealing Model (Flowers et al., 2009), suggests rapid cooling episodes for all samples. The main thermal events show a direct correlation with the timing of regional tectonic events: reactivation phases, continental margin uplift, and the sedimentary record. Apatite (U-Th)/He ages increase with distance from the coast and with elevation. However, these patterns are discontinued by samples of younger ages as a result of the reactivation process of pre-existing structures. The total estimated denudation range from 1.2 to 2.8 km. The erosion rates range from 15.2 to 35.3 m/My. Thus, the multi-episodic thermal events, which led to the formation of important regional tectonic and geomorphological features (Mantiqueira Mountains, Serra do Mar Mountains, grabens, and sedimentary basins), seem to play a fundamental role in the evolution of the Brazilian continental margin. The records can be found in the thermal history of rocks and its correlated deposits.",

Natural variability in precipitation phase due to elevation, micro-climate, and storm characteristics make it a challenge to predict phase. In addition, regional warming is expected to move the snow-rain elevation higher in the future, which has the potential to alter water availability. Despite this, there are few techniques for direct observation of precipitation phase and many predictive techniques apply simple temperature thresholds (i.e. 0 degree Celsius) to determine spatiotemporal patterns. In this paper, we asked two questions: 1) what is the optimum daily temperature for predicting snow-rain transitions in the mountains of the Western U.S.? and 2) what errors in precipitation phase estimation are associated with common temperature thresholds? We use 502 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations with data from 2004 to 2014 to determine rain versus snow using a combination of precipitation, snow depth, and SWE observations. From the observations, we determined that daily maximum temperature is a better predictor of rain and snow events than average temperature. The optimum temperature varied from -2.0 to 3 C, with an average of 0.3 C across ecoregions. The Northern Basin and Northern Cascades with lower average elevations had higher temperature thresholds and the Southern Rockies with highest elevations had the lowest thresholds. Developing a relationship based on station elevation improved the RMSE by 12%, whereas using an optimum temperature developed for each station improved the RMSE by 34% on average. While using optimum temperature thresholds reduce error in prediction, they do not eliminate misclassification of rain-show transitions. These results highlight a current weakness in our ability to predict the effects of regional warming that could have uneven impacts on water and ecological resource management across the Western U.S. Future efforts should consider including additional atmospheric information to improve the fidelity of precipitation phase prediction.",

The hydraulic properties are commonly measured for seived soils (i.e. particles < 2 mm), but many natural soils include rock fragments of varying size that alter bulk hydraulic properties. Relatively few studies have addressed this important problem using physically-based concepts. Motivated by this knowledge gap, we set out to describe soil hydraulic properties using binary mixtures (i.e. rock fragment inclusions in a soil matrix) based on individual properties of the rock and soil. As a first step of this study, special attention was devoted to the SWRC, where the impact of rock content on the SWRC was quantified using laboratory experiments for six different mixing ratios of soil matrix and rock. The SWRC for each mixture was obtained from water mass and water potential measurements. The resulting data for the studied mixtures yielded a family of SWRC indicating how the SWRC of the mixture is related to that of the individual media, i.e., soil and rock. A consistent model was also developed to describe the hydraulic properties of the mixture as a function of the individual properties of the rock and soil matrix.\nKey words: Soil hydraulic properties, rock content, binary mixture, experimental data.",

It is because of this that two methods are developed: one for the generation of flood threat maps for different return periods combining historical, geomorphological, and hydrological hydraulic methods assisted by remote sensors and SIG through the use of data acquired through field campaigns, official hydrological networks, orthophotos, multitemporal topographic maps, and ASTER, STRM, and LiDAR images. And another method in which categorical variables are established, linking local physical, social, economical, environmental and political-institutional factors that are explored through different media such as reports, news, databases, transects, interviews, community workshops, and surveys conducted at homes. Such variables were included within an analysis of multiple correspondence to conduct a descriptive study of the exposure, susceptibility, and capacity conditions and to create a vulnerability index that was spatially plotted spatially on maps. The uncertainty is reduced in the measure in which local knowledge is used as a source of information acquisition, of validation of what already exists, and of calibration of the proposed methods. This research was applied to the urban centers of Caucasia (Antioquia) and Plato (Magdalena), which have been historically affected by slow flooding of the Magdalena and Cauca river, it being especially useful in the selection of best alternatives for risk management, planning for development, and land use management, with the possibility of replicating it to benefit other municipalities that experience the same reality.",

            "abstract": "The Secondary School Field Research Program is a field and laboratory internship for high school students at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. Over the past 11 years it has grown into a significant program, engaging approximately 50 high school and college students each summer, most of them from ethnic and economic groups that are under-represented in the STEM fields. The internships are based on research-driven science questions on estuarine physics, chemistry, ecology and the paleo-environment. Field studies are linked to associated laboratory analyses whose results are reported by the students as a final project. For the past two years, we have focused on the transition to an institutional program, with sustainable funding and organizational structures. At a grant-driven institution whose mission is largely restricted to basic research, institutionalization has not been an easy task. To leverage scarce resources we have implemented a layered structure that relies on near-peer mentoring. So a typical research team might include a mix of new and more experienced high school students, a college student, a high school science teacher and a Lamont researcher as a mentor. Graduates of the program are employed to assist with administration. Knowledge and best practices diffuse through the organization in an organic, if not entirely structured, fashion. We have found that a key to long-term funding has been survival: as we have sustained a successful program and developed a model adapted to Lamont’s unique environment, we have attracted longer term core financing on which grant-driven extensions can be built. The result is a highly flexible program that is student-centered in the context of a broader research culture connecting our participants with the advantages of working at a premier soft-money research institution.",

Such models are primary means towards generating pollutant estimates in ungaged watersheds and respond well at watershed scales by capturing the variability in soils, climatic conditions, land uses/covers and management conditions over extended periods of time. This effort evaluates the performance of the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model as a watershed level tool to investigate, manage, and characterize the transport and fate of nutrients in Lower Bear Malad River (LBMR) watershed (Subbasin HUC 16010204) in Utah. Water quality concerns have been documented and are primarily attributed to high phosphorus and total suspended sediment concentrations caused by agricultural and farming practices along with identified point sources (WWTPs). Input data such as Digital Elevation Model (DEM), land use/Land cover (LULC), soils, and climate data for 10 years (2000-2010) is utilized to quantify the LBMR streamflow. Such modeling is useful in developing the required water quality regulations such as Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDL). Measured concentrations of nutrients were closely captured by simulated monthly nutrient concentrations based on the R2 and Nash- Sutcliffe fitness criteria. The model is expected to be able to identify contaminant non-point sources, identify areas of high pollution risk, locate optimal monitoring sites, and evaluate best management practices to cost-effectively reduce pollution and improve water quality as required by the LBMR watershed’s TMDL.",

This highly successful program involves students not only from physics but also from other STEM fields and non-STEM subjects, and as such acts as a unique outreach program for the department of physics. Examples of experiments performed with the balloon project are: 3D-acceleration measurements, altitude/pressure/temperature measurements, ozone monitoring, bio-aerosol collection, and solar panel performance output. All these experiment are designed and build by groups of students either as part of research projects or through class participation as the projects link with the curriculum in several courses.\nMost recently, a group of UVU students have initiated the implementation of small rockets capable of carrying payloads to this high-altitude program. Both balloon and rocket platforms are fundamental in-situ measuring techniques for numerous geoscience subjects, and are arguably best illustrated by the NASA balloon and sounding rocket programs.\nIn this presentation, we give an overview of the program and how it is 1) being implemented into the curriculum, 2) provide unique research opportunities for students, and 3) specific outreach activities.",

The most significant gap is a full description of vapor isotopes and transport in the marine boundary layer (MBL) connecting the sea surface and the free troposphere. Increasingly available vapor isotope measurements in the MBL highlight the need to fill this gap.\nWe introduce the first moderate complexity, vertically resolved MBL model that incorporates several important processes, including 1) entrainment of subsided mid tropospheric air with original mixing ratio rE, 2) height-dependent vapor diffusivity that is purely molecular at the surface and increases linearly with turbulence to a maximum Kmax in the mid MBL, and 3) vertical velocity wa.. Furthermore, the model does not require specification of either humidity or isotope ratios above the laminar layer, or kinetic fractionation within it. It computes all of these values as well as evaporation rate, isotopic profiles and fluxes, while the isotope flux ratios are the only output from earlier evaporation models.\nAnalytical solutions are found for the profiles of δD, δ18O, and d-excess in the MBL. Simulations coincide remarkably well with the region of the δD vs. δ18O plane populated by global marine observations. Numerical experiments create a family of straight lines in the δD vs. δ18O plane corresponding to different combinations of conditions. These “vapor lines” are mixing lines between isotopically enriched vapor above the laminar layer and depleted vapor in subsiding air. Their slope and/or extent are most strongly influenced by rE and Kmax, to a lesser extent by sea surface temperature (SST) and the fraction of subsided air in the MBL (α), and only slightly by other parameters. We show that these effects of rE, Kmax and SST on the δD vs. δ18O relationship result from their combined influence on (1) the thickness of the laminar layer, and (2) the relative amount of vapor from aloft.\nThe new model strengthens the inference of changes in climate from temporal and spatial variations in MBL water vapor. The model also provides initial conditions for the Rayleigh process that and governs vapor along its trajectories from their origin at the top of the MBL to precipitation sites.",

            "abstract": "Sulfate aerosols have crucial direct and indirect effects on climate from radiative cooling to modifying clouds by formation of cloud condensation nuclei. Secondary sulfate aerosols are formed by oxidation of SO2 and subsequent nucleation and growth and the characteristics of primary aerosol sulfate can be modified by oxidation of SO2. There are several known oxidation pathways for SO2; gaseous phase OH oxidation and aqueous phase H2O2, O3 and transition metal oxides oxidation. The SO2 oxidation pathway affects the characteristics of the aerosols formed. Stable isotope techniques are useful in determining the oxidation pathway of SO2 due to unique fractionation patterns (Harris et al., 2012). However, there are still gaps in our understanding of the oxidation pathways and fractionations affecting SO2 and secondary sulfate. A tracer experiment to investigate the oxidation of SO2 and fractionation using size segregated aerosols in the presence of different compounds is described. Two high volume samplers situated to measure background sulfate upwind, and the results of a tracer experiment, downwind, is described. After sufficient size segregated aerosol sulfate has been collected, a source of SO2 with known isotopic composition is introduced to the second high volume sampler. Changes in the isotopic composition for size segregated aerosol sulfate in comparison to the first high volume sampler are investigated. The amount of fractionation during heterogeneous oxidation of SO2 on pre-existing aerosols is calculated using the concentrations and known isotopic composition and compared to data from laboratory and field experiments. The experiment is performed downwind of sources of organic compounds such as pine forests, and characterized using co-located canister samples, to determine the effects of SO2 oxidation on secondary aerosol sulfate.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - DeLosReyes_AGUposter.pdf\nThe last three silicic eruptions at the Lassen Volcanic Center occurred at Lassen Peak (27 ka and 1915-17) and Chaos Crags (1103 yrs BP). Klemetti and Clynne (2014) showed that felsic eruptions at Lassen reflect remobilization of resident rhyodacitic crystal mush by intrusion of mafic magma. To better understand the rejuvenation and eruption triggering process, we calculate crystallization temperatures and pressures from clinopyroxene-liquid equilibria on mafic enclaves that provide our closest approach to the composition of mafic magmas delivered to the shallow system. Our goal is to examine whether and to what extent cooling and crystallization occur after recharge, which bears on whether recharge, mixing, or partial crystallization (and consequent vapor saturation) provide the trigger for eruption. We use results from the cpx-liq barometer (1.7 kbar) as input to calculate T for other phases (plagioclase, olivine and amphibole) found in mafic enclave samples. Cpx crystallizes at 1100-1150 oC and olivine precipitates at similar to slightly higher temperatures. Cpx and ol are followed by plagioclase (1000-1050 oC), amphibole (875-1000 oC), and Fe-Ti oxides (1030-1050 oC). These temperatures indicate that recharge magmas are incompletely crystallized as they enter the shallow reservoir of cooler (~725-750 oC, Quinn et al., 2013) felsic crystal mush, and that significant cooling of the mafic magma occurs during mixing and prior to eruption. Such cooling intervals indicate that recharge is not the proximal cause of eruption, but rather that vapor saturation, following a period of mixing and cooling, leads to increased magma overpressure that causes eruption. Interestingly, the Lassen Peak 27 ka volcanics (at 2.09 km3), have a greater volume than either of Chaos Crags (1.2 km3) and the 1915 (0.03 km3) eruption, but our results indicate that their thermal histories are similar. This suggests that while volumes of mafic recharge may control the degree of interaction with felsic crystal mush (e.g., Clynne, 1999), and eventually the volume of erupted magma, recharge volumes do not affect eruption triggering mechanisms.\nClynne MA (1999) J.

We measured BC inside and outside at four schools in Salt Lake City during two studies in 2011–2014. In addition, PM2.5 was measured indoor and outdoor at one school, and gaseous air toxics outdoor at one school. The schools are within 500 m of a planned major freeway, and two of them will adjoin the freeway. The objectives included determining the outdoor and indoor concentrations of BC, the likely sources of BC, and once the freeway is built, the change in ambient BC at the schools. We determined the current state of air quality outdoors at these schools, to provide baseline data for comparison when the major freeway is operational, and indoors as a baseline before installing improved filtration to reduce BC in classrooms. Using MATES IV cancer risk values, we found that diesel particulate matter, as indicated by ambient, outdoor BC measurements, was responsible for 84% of the cancer risk at the schools. The HVAC system was moderately effective at filtrating PM mass (73% reduction), but very poor at filtering BC (7%-34% reduction), indicating that air toxics risk is similar indoors and outdoors. Improved filtration devices could potentially mitigate this risk, and improved filtration systems have been recommended for the schools. Lastly, we used the difference in absorption at two Aethalometer channels to determine that the majority of BC (> 90%) during the spring through fall is from fossil fuel emissions.",

This presentation focuses on the shallow seismic stratigraphic architecture of the lake. Marchetti et al. (this meeting) focuses details of a shallow core collected in 2014. With a lake surface at 2700m, avg. depth of 27m (max 37m), the lake is flanked NW by a 15° slope up to a formerly glaciated Hightop plateau (3545m) and is bound to the SE by a 30° NW facing slope off the Mytoge crest (3050m). The drainage basin is 74 km2 with ~75% of the catchment draining the Hightop from four distinct streams. Pelican Canyon (glaciated) and Doctor Canyon (unglaciated) provide most drainage into the basin, with Bowery and Twin creeks draining only the slope. These streams flow through organic-rich meadows at the edge of the lake. Only one small stream drains NW into the lake from the small Crater Lakes graben (2850m) off the Mytoge. Bathymetric surveys in the lake highlight a submerged moraine to the NE, a gently sloping bottom that reaches maximum depth off the steep wall to the SE, and small delta-form features off each of the creeks on the NW edge. Chirp seismic surveys (2-16 kHz) consistently penetrate the upper 40-m (up to ~55m). The oldest visible reflectors rise into the submerged moraine to the NE, ending in a complex set of truncated and discontinuous beds eluding to soft sediment push at the front of the glacier. Along the edge near the creeks to the NW, multiple sets of downlapping reflectors, gas pockets, and chaotic beds with lobate tops define what we interpret as deltaic deposition, possible lower lake levels with marsh systems, and slope failures. The majority of the lake is underlain by flat-lying reflectors that bound sedimentary packages spanning the entirety of the basin interior. The uppermost layers have recently been cored where seismic reflectors are continuous, providing a good age model from the modern lakefloor, through the loose Holocene sediments, into the denser Pleistocene deposits. The next steps in this research are deeper seismic surveys and coring.",

            "abstract": "Significantly increased production of hydrocarbons in North America is being driven by the development of unconventional resources whose commercial viability, in many cases, depends upon massive subsurface injection of fluids. Although relatively uncommon, elevated pore pressure from fluid injection of any kind can induce earthquake activity by activating slip on a proximal fault. In the western Canada sedimentary basin (which follows the Rocky Mountain foothills region and straddles the border between Alberta and B.C.), we find that hydraulic fracture treatment, wherein fluids are injected under high pressure in long laterally-drilled wells in order to induce localized fracturing of a rock formation, is the primary triggering mechanism of induced seismicity. This contrasts with the central U.S., where most induced seismicity has been attributed to large-scale wastewater injection into deep disposal wells. Our findings are based on a comprehensive statistical analysis of seismicity at the M≥3 level since 1985, along with a complete well database for the region, containing information on many thousands of oil and gas wells. Since 2010, most of the regional earthquakes of M≥3 are correlated in both time and space with hydraulic fracturing. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the observed correlations are extremely unlikely (<<1%) to have been obtained by chance. Improved understanding of regional variability in fault activation processes, accounting for operational and geological factors, will aid in the development and validation of predictive models for the time-dependent hazards from induced earthquakes.",

AlI emission was observed on two separate runs, in 2008 and 2013, with tangent column densities of 2.4 and 3.0e+07 Al atoms cm-2 at altitudes of 1300 and 1850 km (1.1 and 1.5 RM), respectively. FeI emission has been observed once, yielding a tangent column of 6.2e+08 cm-2 at an altitude of 950 km (1.4 RM) in 2009. We also present observations of 3.5-σ CaII emission features near Mercury’s equatorial anti-solar limb in 2011, from which a stringent column abundance upper limit of 4.0e+06 cm-2 is derived for the Ca ion.\nA simple model for zenith column abundances of the neutral species yields 2.0e+07 Al cm-2, and 8.2e+08 Fe cm-2. The observations appear to be consistent with production of these species by impact vaporization, with a large fraction of the Al ejecta in molecular form, and that for Fe in mixed atomic and molecular forms. The scale height of the Al gas is consistent with a kinetic temperature of 4800-8200 K while that of Fe is 5000-13000 K. The apparent high temperature and low density of the Al gas would suggest that it may be produced by dissociation of molecules. A large fraction of both Al and Fe appear to condense in a vapor cloud at low altitudes.",

            "abstract": "Network Matched Filtering (NMF, commonly referred to as template matching), is a procedure which utilizes waveforms recorded from a cataloged seismic event (the “template event”) to find additional seismic events by cross-correlating the template event with continuous seismic data over the time period of interest. NMF has been successfully used to populate seismic catalogs for a wide variety of seismic signals which are difficult to identify, such as tectonic low frequency earthquakes, early or triggered aftershocks, and small magnitude induced seismic sequences. NMF provides robust event detection of signals with signal to noise ratios near one, and the output of the filter is largely independent of unrelated seismic noise, making it an ideal technique for identifying events during noisy time periods, such as immediately following a large earthquake or during a volcanic eruption. We also show how NMF can be used over longer time periods, with dynamic seismic network status, to more robustly compare time periods with disparate network geometries.\nHere, we present efforts to develop processing infrastructure for semi-automated execution of the NMF technique applied to volcanoes in the state of Alaska. We present a series of case studies involving both monitored and unmonitored volcanoes. Given the large scope of this endeavor, we focus our preliminary efforts on cataloging deep long period (DLP) seismicity, as DLP’s have high scientific interest (as well as providing a reasonable benchmark), have been cataloged at many of Alaska’s volcanoes, and yet are rare enough to speed up code development and testing. At Redoubt, for example, we use NMF to develop a catalog of ~300 DLP’s from 2008 through July 2015. Most cataloged DLP’s and new matches from NMF occurred close in time to the 2009 eruption, but we find that DLP activity has continued through July 2015. At Kasatochi, an unmonitored volcano which erupted in 2008, we show that NMF is more effective at cataloging seismicity utilizing only two regional broadband stations (about 100 km distant) than traditional analysis utilizing the short period network on Great Sitkin (<50 km away). At Trident, we catalog all shallow seismicity in an attempt to determine if there is a seismic expression of the discharge of volcanic gasses (sulfur) in July of 2013.",

            "abstract": "A tidal marsh at Discovery Bay, on the Strait of Juan de Fuca, has the longest record of tsunami deposition in Washington, with nine described tsunami deposits. One of the youngest continuous deposits Bed 1is likely from the 1700 A.D. M9+ Cascadia Earthquake, based on its stratigraphic position and radiocarbon age. Bed 1 is typically found at a depth of ~ 0.45 m, has a maximum thickness of 8 cm, and is composed grains of silt to fine sand. Ground Penetration Radar (GPR) is useful to study such tsunami deposits, because it can “see” characteristics of the deposits that could be missed in cores or outcrops. Tsunami deposits typically extend over wide areas. GPR imaging can trace a layer over a wide area in the subsurface of a tidal marsh. Correlation of layers between coring or outcrops is often difficult across distances in a marsh. GPR technology allows in situ correlation of potential tsunami deposits in the subsurface. We used GPR to map subsurface images of previously described tsunami deposits in the top 2 m at Discovery Bay. We used MALA 450 MHz antenna and recording unit, and ran the survey during the low tide time range (3-4 hours). After adjusting the soil velocity (dielectric constants) and scan parameters we ran various transects correlated the shallow soil cores in 0-1.5m of the soil column. Tsunami sand layer is relatively distinct among other layers on radargrams. Maximum penetration depth reached was about 2 meters and saltwater effect is dominant at 2 meters and greater depths. In addition to this success, there is also the potential to use GPR to“see” characteristic tsunami deposit features such as draping and infilling of low spots. This imaging could help guide locations to sample with strategic cores or pits.\nWe think that our preliminary results are promising,and plan to use the GPR technology to investigate potential tsunami deposits inPuget Sound and other coastal areas of Washington.",

            "abstract": "Methane (CH4) is the second most important greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. Quantitative understanding of the global CH4 budget is important in order to predict future contributions of global warming and to develop effective strategies for its mitigation. After a decade-long period of decreasing growth rates, atmospheric CH4 concentrations have risen in recent years raising concerns about its long-term stability. Despite much study there is no clear consensus about the causes of this increase. Some bottom-up inventories suggest that fugitive emissions from the fossil fuel industry may be increasing though there are considerable uncertainties in these estimates due in part to the variable nature of this source. To better understand the changing budget of atmospheric CH4, we performed a time-dependent retrieval of CH4 fluxes spanning nearly 30 years using global surface and isotopic CH4 measurements. An earlier inversion from our group suggested that fugitive fossil fuel emissions increased from 2000-2008, contributing to the recent rise. Here we extend this study to year 2015 using the most recent NOAA Global Monitoring Division (GMD) CH4 measurements and available δ13C -CH4 data along with a higher resolution version of the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem (2ox2.5o). The higher resolution grid allowed us to extract more information from the observations due to the improved ability of the model to simulate CH4 at each station and the decreased need to aggregate neighboring stations. This in turn increased the error reduction between the a priori and posterior emissions leading to more accurate estimates of the retrieved fluxes and improved understanding of the drivers underlying the current atmospheric record.",

Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) have erupted throughout the world’s oceans, creating important bathymetric expressions on the seafloor and temporally exposed land.\nGlobal plate tectonic reconstructions of mid-ocean ridges, LIPs, and plumes have demonstrated that the formation of LIPs repeatedly occur at specific ridge-plume interaction locations over periods of tens of millions of years. Due to the shallow depth of mid-ocean ridges relative to the abyssal plains, the formation of LIPs at these locations increases the likelihood of the creation of sub-aerial regions that exist for millions of years before subsiding. Here, we assess the time-varying size, shape, location and depth of LIPs globally and incorporate them into maps of predicted paleo-bathymetry. We focus on accurate estimation of the paleo-bathymetry of oceanic LIPs by taking into account the temporal plume swell that affects the wider region around each LIP, with a likely significant affect on the surface height of both onshore and offshore regions. We ground truth our estimations using a variety of marine data, particularly results from ocean drilling.\nOf particular interest is the present-day southern Indian Ocean (offshore eastern Antarctica) where the Bouvet, Marion and Kerguelen plumes interact with the Southwest Indian mid-ocean ridge. As West Gondwana broke apart, continental Antarctica slowly moved away from this stationary line of ridge-plume interactions, with the newly formed oceanic crust of the southern Indian and Atlantic Oceans overlying these locations instead. Thus, since the Jurassic parts of East Antarctica and the adjacent Atlantic and Indian oceans have been repeatedly affected by the formation of LIPs at ridge-plume interactions, and our results suggest the potential for landbridges or significant islands between Africa, India and Antarctica during the Cretaceous and Cenozoic.",

M. Ghil and associates (Ghil and Vautard 1991; Plaut et al. 1995, Science; Ghil et al. 2002, Rev. Geophys.), among others, have argued that this natural variability has some regularity embedded into it. Although the existence of such regularity on the interannual time scale is fairly well established by now, evidence for similar regularity on decadal and interdecadal time scales is more difficult to establish, due to the shortness of instrumental temperature data.\nTo identify spatio-temporal patterns, we rely on the method of multichannel singular spectrum analysis [M-SSA; see Ghil et al. (2002) for a review] and on its recent improvements that help separate distinct patterns (Groth and Ghil 2011, Phys. Rev. E; Groth and Ghil 2015, J. Climate). Results on the temperature field from the Simple Ocean Data Assimilation (SODA) reanalysis (Carton and Giese 2008, Mon. Wea. Rev.; Giese and Ray 2011, J. Geophys. Res.) will be shown and contrasted with results on the HadCRUT surface temperature dataset (Morice et al. 2012, J. Geophys. Res.). We will focus, in particular, on the robustness of the geographical distribution of long-term changes in both data sets and discuss the significance of superimposed natural regularities in the traditional context of red noise (Hasselmann 1976, Tellus A). Finally, we will discuss the extent to which these regularities could have contributed to the recent hiatus in the long-term changes, as predicted by Ghil and Vautard (1991).",

Observations from the A-Train sensors, especially, MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP), are synthesized to retrieve single-scattering albedo (SSA) and effective aerosol layer height (ALH) of BBS aerosols in the region. The retrieval algorithm extracts the absorption and height information about smoke aerosols, which is lumped into ultraviolet spectra at the top of the atmosphere, by taking the most reliable information contents that each satellite measurement can deliver. The results of retrieved SSA and ALH showed reasonable agreements with in-situ measurements, AEROsol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) data, and lidar-based observations. The uncertainty and sensitivity of the retrieval algorithm are also presented. The retrieved quantities are then used together with other satellite datasets to characterize the three-dimensional distributions of smoke aerosols over the Indochina Peninsular during the boreal spring time. Given the frequent horizontal collocations of smoke and clouds in the region, implication of smoke vertical distributions for long-range transports is also discussed.

The transition rates depend on the energy barriers, which are generally difficult to calculate. However, some simple results can be obtained for small magnetic fields. In a single-domain magnet with uniaxial anisotropy, a magnetic field at an angle to the easy axis makes the moments of the stable states and energy barrier states rotate; yet the effects of these rotations cancel out, leaving an expression that depends only on the zero-field states. Some of the cancellation occurs because, in general, there are two energy barriers, a fact that (to the presenter's knowledge) has been ignored in all previous calculations.\nIn a small static field, the relaxation rate is the same as the zero-field rate to first order; and also to first order, the blocking temperature is equal to the unblocking temperature.",

            "abstract": "The 1997 Kagoshima earthquake (M6.6) occurred in southern Kyushu, Japan, subsequently involving the largest aftershock (M6.4) two months later. The mainshock focal mechanism shows a lateral fault type with a tensional axis of NW-SE direction. This area is located in the Hokusatsu-bend area (Murata,1987), which is a regional bending structure of the Shimanto Supergroup strata, and furthermore, in the junction area of the south-western Japan and the Ryukyu arcs. However, the relationship between the crustal structure and the source fault still remains unknown. Here we approach the analyses of the aftershock relocation and the seismic reflection data, and clarify the existence of characteristic structure to control the fault rupture.\nWe have early aftershock data of the Kagoshima University and the catalog of NIED Hi-net, the nation-wide dense network established since 2000. Using a common velocity structure and a hypocenter determination method, we relocated the hypocenters of the both data. Also we have the data of the seismic survey, of which the survey line was designed in 2000, as crossing the near-vertical mainshock fault. We applied with the Multi Dip Reflection Surface method, resulting in clarifying the seismic image.\nThe comparison with the relocated hypocenters and the fault rupture (Horikawa, 2001) demonstrated the aftershock gap within the large slip area, while its surrounding area shows high seismicity. Interestingly, the high seismicity aftershock area includes some seismicity gaps like a band in places.\nThe seismic cross section shows two north dipping reflectors. The two reflectors become obscure around the source fault, where the aftershock seismicity is very low. This suggests that a north dipping layering structure may control seismic activity. It means that the subsurface structure related with the Hokusatsu-bend may influence on the rupture and its aftershock expansion.",

Across a vegetation coverage gradient in urban area, an empirical relationship is expected between EF and vegetation coverage, which provides the opportunity to quantify regional water flux. Here we deployed three eddy covariance (EC) systems to quantify the relationship between EF and vegetation coverage. First, two continuous systems were deployed at an industrial area with very low vegetation cover and another located in the orange orchid in Riverside, CA, to quantify the temporal dynamic of EF for the endpoints. Second, a mobile EC system was deployed to quantify the spatial distribution of EF across a gradient of vegetation coverage, during the summer time in Riverside, CA. These data showed the EF in high vegetation cover is 31.16±3.99%, but at the lower vegetation cover site EF is only 16.48±5.40%, which about 2 times lower in EF than the area with high vegetation cover. These results derived from the EC measurements provide essential data to quantify the temporal and spatial water fluxes in urban area and are needed to better understand and manage urban water use in response to drought.",

ISX is a collaborative effort between SRI International and Cal Poly.\nThis project addresses the science question: To what distance along a flux tube does an irregularity of certain transverse-scale extend? It has been difficult to measure the magnetic field-alignment of scintillation-scale turbulent structures because of the difficulty of sampling a flux tube at multiple locations within a short time. This measurement is now possible due to the worldwide transition to DTV, which presents unique signals of opportunity for remote sensing of ionospheric irregularities from numerous vantage points. DTV spectra, in various formats, contain phase-stable, narrowband pilot carrier components that are transmitted simultaneously. A 4-channel radar receiver will simultaneously record up to 4 spatially separated transmissions from the ground. Correlations of amplitude and phase scintillation patterns corresponding to multiple points on the same flux tube will be a measure of the spatial extent of the structures along the magnetic field. A subset of geometries where two or more transmitters are aligned with the orbital path will be used to infer the temporal development of the structures.\nISX has the following broad impact. Scintillation of space-based radio signals is a space weather problem that is intensively studied. ISX is a step toward a CubeSat constellation to monitor worldwide TEC variations and radio wave distortions on thousands of ionospheric paths. Furthermore, the rapid sampling along spacecraft orbits provides a unique dataset to deterministically reconstruct ionospheric irregularities at scintillation-scale resolution using diffraction radio tomography, a technique that enables prediction of scintillations at other radio frequencies, and potentially, mitigation of phase distortions.",

With their low DOC concentrations and high rates of respiration, headwater streams in the Luquillo Mountains have been previously characterized as energy-limited, suggesting that NH4+ uptake is dominated not by N demand but by energy demand. In the Rio Icacos watershed, high concentrations of NH4+ (>1 mg N/L) are found in groundwater adjacent to the streams, making high inputs of NH4+ to the stream channel via groundwater seepage likely. Stream nutrient spiraling metrics can be used to quantify uptake and retention rates of specific nutrients, and can be measured by solute additions. Tracer Additions for Spiraling Curve Characterization (TASCC) is a recently developed method (Covino et al. 2010) for quantifying nutrient uptake with a single slug addition of nutrient and conservative tracer. Here we present NH4+ uptake metrics from TASCC additions in three Luquillo streams of different sizes, ranging from 2nd to 4th order: the Rio Icacos, a larger, 3rd order tributary and a smaller 2nd order tributary. Background NH4+ concentrations vary by up to an order of magnitude, with highest concentrations (27 μg N/L) found in the smaller tributary. Background DOC concentrations are uniformly low and show no difference between the three streams (500-600 μg C/L). The smaller tributary has the shortest uptake length (155 m) and highest uptake velocity (2.9 mm/min) of the three streams. Unexpectedly, the Rio Icacos has a higher uptake velocity (1.7 mm/min) than the larger tributary (1.0 mm/min), despite having an uptake length more than double (1400 m) that of the larger tributary (596 m). Overall, NH4+ uptake is substantial in all three streams and varies with background concentrations, not stream size.",

            "abstract": "Impact of water availability on regional power system operations – A case study of ERCOT\nThermal power plants are the largest single source of water withdrawals in the United States, mainly for cooling purposes. The amount of water that is required for cooling is highly dependent on a number of factors including the generation technologies being used, the temperature of the input water, and the total electricity load in the system. During summer months, many of these factors coincide to greatly increase the demand for water in a power system. Electricity demand typically reaches its annual peak when temperatures are high due to increased air conditioning loads. Ambient water temperatures also increase, meaning that greater quantities of water are required to provide the same amount of cooling at thermal generation plants. Finally, water availability is generally constrained due to seasonal effects and potential droughts. This raises concerns that water scarcity may lead to forced de-rating at some power plants during periods of peak demand, resulting in a more vulnerable and less reliable energy system. While increasing attention has recently been given to the inexorable link between water and energy, most commercial power models do not explicitly account for water use when optimizing system operation. We apply the AURORAxmp power modeling software to a case study analysis of the ERCOT power system to determine the water requirements of the system during periods of peak power demand. We then analyze water availability by location and time to identify potential supply shortages, which may reduce actual power generation availability. These data are fed back into the power systems model and specific generation units are de-rated as necessitated by water constraints. We then analyze these results to determine how the optimal generation mix, system reliability, and wholesale electricity prices may be affected by when the ERCOT power system is operated under water constraints.",

Compatible with solutions listed in the (PA001) session description—federation, rigid standards and brokering/mediation—the framework can support tight or loose coupling, even with dependence on community-contributed software.\nHyrax is a Web-services framework with a middleware-like design and a handler-style architecture that together reduce the interoperability challenge (for N datatypes and M user contexts) to an O(N+M) problem, similar to brokering. Combined with an open-source ethos, this reduction makes Hyrax a community tool for gaining interoperability. E.g., in its response to the Big Earth Data Initiative (BEDI), NASA references OPeNDAP-based interoperability.\nAssuming its suitability, the question becomes: how sustainable is OPeNDAP, a small not-for-profit that produces open-source software, i.e., has no software-sales? In other words, if geoscience interoperability depends on OPeNDAP and similar organizations, are those entities in turn sustainable? Jim Collins (in Good to Great) highlights three questions that successful companies can answer (paraphrased here): What is your passion? Where is your world-class excellence? What drives your economic engine? We attempt to shed light on OPeNDAP sustainability by examining these.\nPassion: OPeNDAP has a focused passion for improving the effectiveness of scientific data sharing and use, as deeply-cooperative community endeavors.\nExcellence: OPeNDAP has few peers in remote, scientific data access. Skills include computer science with experience in data science, (operational, secure) Web services, and software design (for servers and clients, where the latter vary from Web pages to standalone apps and end-user programs).\nEconomic Engine: OPeNDAP is an engineering services organization more than a product company, despite software being key to OPeNDAP’s reputation. In essence, provision of engineering expertise, via contracts and grants, is the economic engine.\nHence sustainability, as needed to address global grand challenges in geoscience, depends on agencies’ and others’ abilities and willingness to offer grants and let contracts for continually upgrading open-source software from OPeNDAP and others.",

Obtaining stable and accurate numerical solutions can be challenging as the underlying equations are coupled, nonlinear, and non-self-adjoint. Currently, there is neither a robust computational framework available nor a reliable commercial package known that can handle various complex situations. Herein, the objective of this poster presentation is to present a novel locally conservative non-negative finite element formulation that preserves the underlying physical and mathematical properties of a general linear transient anisotropic ADR equation.\nIn continuous setting, governing equations for ADR systems possess various important properties. In general, all these properties are not inherited during finite difference, finite volume, and finite element discretizations. The objective of this poster presentation is two fold: First, we analyze whether the existing numerical formulations (such as SUPG and GLS) and commercial packages provide physically meaningful values for the concentration of the chemical species for various realistic benchmark problems. Furthermore, we also quantify the errors incurred in satisfying the local and global species balance for two popular chemical kinetics schemes: CDIMA (chlorine dioxide-iodine-malonic acid) and BZ (Belousov--Zhabotinsky). Based on these numerical simulations, we show that SUPG and GLS produce unphysical values for concentration of chemical species due to the violation of the non-negative constraint, contain spurious node-to-node oscillations, and have large errors in local and global species balance. Second, we proposed a novel finite element formulation to overcome the above difficulties. The proposed locally conservative non-negative computational framework based on low-order least-squares finite elements is able to preserve these underlying physical and mathematical properties. Several representative numerical examples are discussed to illustrate the importance of the proposed numerical formulations to accurately describe various aspects of mixing process in chaotic flows and to simulate transport in highly heterogeneous anisotropic media.",

The observed decline of sea ice in recent decades has affected Arctic ecosystems, transportation, and atmospheric processes. For these reasons, the development of skillful seasonal model predictions is essential, particularly for the early autumn when Arctic ice retreats to its minimum extent. However, a high degree of temporal and spatial variability has made sea ice predictions challenging. Arctic clouds become a large source of this variability by altering the amount of insolation and longwave radiation that is received at the surface. The goal of this research is to identify the predictive value of early summer cloud radiative effect (CRE) on autumnal sea ice extent. Absorbed solar radiation at the surface is most sensitive to cloud cover and composition during months of peak solar insolation, and may precondition the melting momentum of the sea ice in the subsequent months. Satellite data products, such as CERES, are used to investigate trends in cloud cover and radiative properties over the entire Arctic, as well as in several specific Arctic regions. This data, along with satellite sea ice concentration products, will be used to investigate the sensitivity of autumnal sea ice extent to changes in CRE throughout the melt season. The influence of relevant, larger-scale climate oscillations on atmospheric regimes and resulting cloud distribution will also be given consideration.",

For this, a severity assessment during several cyclonic events for selected catchments was estimated through the evaluation of a flash flood index recently proposed by Kim and Kim (2014). This classification is revised, considering the forcing and areal extent of torrential rainfall generated by the incidence of tropical cyclones on the studied catchments, enabling the further study of the flood regime in catchments located in tropical regions. The analysis incorporates characteristics of the flood hydrographs such as the hydrograph shape (rising curve gradient, magnitude of the peak discharge and flood response time) in order to identify flash-flood prone areas. Results show the Qp-A scaling relationship in catchments that were impacted by tropical cyclones, enabling their comparison against floods generated by other meteorological events (e.g. convective and orographic storms). Results will inform on how peak flows relationships are modified by cyclonic events and highlighting the contribution of cyclonic precipitation to flash-flooding susceptibility.",

No single, non-destructive and non-invasive technique currently exists to rapidly determine such state of preservation of the organic matter in relation to its geological and mineral environment. Due to its non-invasive nature, microRaman spectroscopy is emerging as a candidate technique for the qualitative determination maturity of organic matter, by correlating Raman spectral features and aromatic carbon cluster size. Here we will present a novel quantitative method in which before-neglected Raman spectral features are correlated directly and with excellent accuracy with the H:C ratio. In addition to providing a chemical justification of the found direct correlation, we will show its applicability and predictive capabilities in evaluating H:C in Archean kerogens. This novel method opens new opportunities for the use of Raman spectroscopy and mapping. This includes the non-invasively determination of kerogen preservation and microscale chemical diversity within a particular Earth analogue, to be potentially extended to evaluate Raman spectra acquired directly on Mars.",

The study area includes the Rasht and Alai valleys at the boundary between the Pamir Mountains and the Alai Range of the southern Tien Shan. Ongoing collision between the India and Eurasia plates has resulted in the Tien Shan orogenic belt and the Pamir Mountains. Thus the study area is one of the most seismically active regions in the world. Rapid uplift, erosion, and steep slopes give rise to widespread landsliding and massive rock slope failures in both the Pamir and Tien Shan Mountains. Our integrated data acquisition and interpretation plan used airborne and remote sensing methods including satellite based DEMs and high resolution imagery, LiDAR, aerial photography, and helicopter based electromagnetic resistivity (HEM). Analysis of these data sets allowed us to delineate potential geohazards through surficial geologic mapping. Initial desktop geohazard screening included 1:50,000-scale mapping for potential faults, landslides, and liquefiable deposits, which included traffic light-style susceptibility maps for route refinement and hazard mitigation. As part of detailed investigations, continuous HEM data was collected and processed at a spatial sampling interval of approximately 3m. Apparent resistivity was calculated for each of the five operating frequencies over the entire survey area. For the purposes of this study, resistivity values at 10 m and 20 m depths were sliced from the interpolated 3D Differential Resistivity model for use in the analysis. Using GIS, we compared these results with mapped Quaternary units and found good correlation between resistivity contrasts and the boundaries of mapped surficial units. With this confidence, the HEM measurements were further analyzed to identify subsurface features and to develop a 3D geologic model. Based on this analysis we provided a framework for an optimized geotechnical borehole program which can maximize the informational value of each borehole site compared to a traditional evenly spaced layout.",

However, Raman spectral measurements of individual aerosol particles typically require collection of samples in the field followed by offline Raman spectral measurements in a laboratory. The process requires considerable operator time. We report results obtained with an automated, single-particle Aerosol Raman Spectrometer built by Battelle, which is the core of Battelle’s Resource Effective Bioidentification System (REBS). This instrument collects aerosol particles onto a metallized polymer tape and simultaneously measures Raman spectra of particles obtained during the previous collection period. At the end of each collection period (typically 15 minutes), the tape is advanced and the next collection and measurement period is begun. In this way, particles are semi-continuously sampled and their Raman spectra are measured. We show laboratory data from different sizes of polystyrene latex spheres. We also show results from calcium sulfate particles, vehicular emission soot, and other particles. We discuss the influence of imaging time on the quality of the Raman spectra measured and on the ability of the instrument to resolve aerosol particles. Finally, we present results from an outdoor sampling period during the summer of 2015 where the instrument ran unattended for more than one week collecting particles and measuring their Raman spectra. We suggest that the routine use of such an automated particle-sampling instrument should increase our understanding of inorganic and organic aerosols including biological aerosols and sources and fates of these particles.",

These products have been created and served out publically with the hope of enhancing decision-making capabilities and potentially improving the use of climate change information in water-resource planning and management.\nTo date, all this work – used extensively to compute climate change threats and water-resource vulnerabilities – has been done for the contiguous U.S. (CONUS); these and most other tools and datasets produced by others have not been primarily concerned with the unique hydrometeorological problems in Alaska and Hawaii. However, the different hydroclimatic regions of both those states are especially sensitive to specific climate change threats made more difficult to characterize by the intense spatial climatic gradients tracked with sparse station networks there and the dominance of distinctive hydrologic processes relatively rare in the CONUS. Examples of those processes include glaciers and permafrost in Alaska; and volcanic subsurface hydrogeology, intense tropical rainfall, and high rates of evapotranspiration in Hawaii, to name but a few. To address these knowledge and capability gaps for these regions outside the CONUS, USACE and its partners are now developing new tools and datasets of current and projected future climatologies and hydrologies to provide enhanced streamflow simulations and support both climate risk assessments and climate adaptation strategies in Alaska and Hawaii.\nThis presentation will focus on our early stage analysis of historical hydroclimate variability in Alaska and Hawaii using the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model simulations and probabilistic interpolation of local gauge data in support of future new streamflow modeling. We will conclude with discussion of the ongoing and future research planned to better characterize and understand the sensitivity of the terrestrial component of the water cycle in Hawaii and Alaska to climate variability and change, and how this work can prepare for work in other similarly unique regions.",

Because of the rapid advancement of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing techniques, the production of crude oil and natural gas in US increased dramatically in recent years; and currently natural gas contributes to about 25% of total US energy consumption. Recent studies suggest that shale gas extraction facilities may emit Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), which could contribute to the formation of ozone and affect regional air quality, public health and climate change. In this study we visited 37 natural gas facilities in Denver-Julesburg and Uintah Basins from March to May, 2015. VOCs and methane concentrations were measured downwind of individual facilities with our mobile lab. In total 13 VOCs, including benzene and toluene, were measured by a SRI 8610C Gas Chromatograph. Similar measurements will be conducted in the Marcellus Shale in late August 2015. Preliminary results show that VOC emissions from individual shale gas facilities are variable, which suggests that a single VOC profile may not characterize all natural gas production facilities, though there may be some common characteristics. Measured VOC concentrations will be normalized to concurrently-measured methane emissions, and coupled with methane emission rates measured at these facilities, used to obtain VOC emission factors from natural gas production. This presentation will also compare VOC emission rates from the Marcellus shale with that from the Denver-Julesburg and Uintah basins.",

Plant physiological change might however precede the vegetation structural change by regulating leaf stomatal resistance. In this study, we tested whether plant physiological index can be used for early indicator of plant recession causing dust storm increase. For the purpose, satellite-based eco-physiological variables such as gross primary production (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET), and water use efficiency (WUE) were prepared and then, compared their spatial and temporal variability with Synop dust storm data for the Northeast Asia.

This difficulty can be partially attributed to the cost of installing networks of proprietary data loggers that monitor differences in the biophysical factors contributing to tree growth. Here, we describe the development and initial application of a network of open source data loggers. These data loggers are based on the Arduino platform, but were refined into a custom printed circuit board (PCB). This reduced the cost and complexity of the data loggers, which made them cheap to reproduce and reliable enough to withstand the harsh environmental conditions experienced in Ecohydrology studies. We demonstrate the utility of these loggers for high frequency, spatially-distributed measurements of sap-flux, stem growth, relative humidity, temperature, and soil water content across 36 landscape positions in the Lubrecht Experimental Forest, MT, USA. This new data logging technology made it possible to develop a spatially distributed monitoring network within the constraints of our research budget and may provide new insights into factors affecting forest productivity across complex terrain.",

Using surface temperature radiometers, continuously measuring LST on standardized asphalt, concrete, and turf grass surfaces across the climate gradient, we found a 7.2°C and 4.6°C temperature decrease from asphalt to vegetated cover in the coast and desert, respectively. There is 131% more temporal variation in asphalt than turf grass surfaces, but 37% less temporal variation in concrete than turf grass. For concrete and turf grass surfaces, temporal variation in temperature increased from coast to desert. Using ground-based thermal imagery, measuring LST for 24 h sequences over citrus orchard and industrial use locations, we found a 14.5°C temperature decrease from industrial to orchard land use types (38.4°C and 23.9°C, respectively). Additionally, industrial land use types have 209% more spatial variation than orchard (CV=0.20 and 0.09, respectively). Using a network of 300 Ta (iButton) sensors mounted in city street trees throughout the region and hyperspectral imagery data we found urban vegetation greenness, measured using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), was negatively correlated to Ta at night across the climate gradient. Contrasting previous findings, the closest coupling between NDVI and Ta is at the coast from 0000 h to 0800 h (highest r2 = 0.6, P < 0.05) while relationships at the desert are weaker (highest r2 = 0.38, P < 0.05). These findings indicate that vegetation cover in urbanized regions of southern California, USA decrease Ta and LST and spatial variation in LST, while built surfaces and land uses have the opposite effect. Furthermore these relationships are regulated by regional climate patterns, with decreases in Ta and LST being strongest in the coastal sub-region.",

The fossiliferous Plio-Pliestocene Chemeron Formation, within the BTB, contains geochemically analyzed outcrop tephras, 8 of which have 40Ar/39Ar dates of 3.2-2.35Ma. Tephras have been crucial in developing chronologies in human evolution, paleontology, archaeology, and rift basin development. The HSPDP paleo-lake cores provide a high resolution and continuous record of sedimentation, as well as additional tephras not found in outcrop. For BTB, approximately 20 vitric tephras have been logged in the cores, including several previously unobserved tephras, providing a more complete record of volcanic activity. Major element geochemical analyses of the BTB tephras collected from the cores are critical for establishing chronostratigraphic links to the outcrop stratigraphy of the Chemeron Formation, as well as correlations outside of BTB.\nThe Chemeron Formation, composed of alternating fluvial and lacustrine sediments, is associated with the onset and intensification of the Cenozoic Northern Hemisphere glaciation and encompasses the period of great hominin diversification of Paranthropus and Homo, as well as the earliest evidence for stone toolmaking. Within the Chemeron stratigraphy, there are sequences of diatomites that record a 23kyr-processional periodicity indicating a dominant climatic forcing. By correlating the BTB tephras, and thereby the BTB climate-forced lacustrine cycles, with other East African rift basins’ stratigraphy, we can determine if this climatic wet/dry pattern observed at BTB had occurred in other East African rift basins. This knowledge can help in understanding the influence of climate and tectonics on the evolution of hominins during the Plio-Pleistocene.",

The program has been offered for 25 years and provides a hands-on introduction to a broad suite of volcano monitoring techniques, rather than detailed training with just one. The course content has evolved over the life of the program as the needs of the trainees have changed: initially emphasizing very basic monitoring techniques (e.g. precise leveling, interpretation of seismic drum records, etc.) but, as the level of sophistication of the trainees has increased, training in more advanced technologies has been added. Currently, topics of primary emphasis have included volcano seismology and seismic networks; acquisition and modeling of geodetic data; methods of analysis and monitoring of gas geochemistry; interpretation of volcanic deposits and landforms; training in LAHARZ, GIS mapping of lahar risks; and response to and management of volcanic crises. The course also provides training on public outreach, based on CSAV’s Hawaii-specific hazards outreach programs, and volcano preparedness and interactions with the media during volcanic crises. It is an intensive eight week course with instruction and field activities underway 6 days per week; it is now offered in two locations, Hawaii Island, for six weeks, and the Cascades volcanoes of the Pacific Northwest, for two weeks, to enable trainees to experience field conditions in both basaltic and continental volcanic environments.\nThe survival of the program for more than two decades demonstrates that a need for such training exists and there has been interaction and contribution to the program by the research community, however broader engagement with the latter continues to present challenges. Some of the reasons for this will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "After decades of intensive exploration of Mars, fundamental questions about the origin and evolution of the martian moons, Phobos and Deimos, remain unanswered. Their spectral characteristics are similar to C- or D-class asteroids, suggesting that they may have originated in the asteroid belt or outer solar system. Perhaps these ancient objects were captured separately, or maybe they are the fragments of a captured asteroid disrupted by impact. Various lines of evidence hint at other possibilities: one alternative is co-formation with Mars, in which case the moons contain primitive martian materials. Another is that they are re-accreted ejecta from a giant impact and contain material from the early martian crust. The Pandora mission, proposed in response to the 2014 NASA Discovery Announcement of Opportunity, will acquire new information needed to determine the provenance of the moons of Mars. Pandora will travel to and successively orbit Phobos and Deimos to map their chemical and mineral composition and further refine their shape and gravity. Geochemical data, acquired by nuclear- and infrared-spectroscopy, can distinguish between key origin hypotheses. High resolution imaging data will enable detailed geologic mapping and crater counting to determine the timing of major events and stratigraphy. Data acquired will be used to determine the nature of and relationship between \"red\" and \"blue\" units on Phobos, and determine how Phobos and Deimos are related. After identifying material representative of each moons’ bulk composition, analysis of the mineralogical and elemental composition of this material will allow discrimination between the formation hypotheses for each moon. The information acquired by Pandora can then be compared with similar data sets for other solar system bodies and from meteorite studies. Understanding the formation of the martian moons within this larger context will yield a better understanding of processes acting in the early solar system, focusing in particular on Mars’ accretionary environment.",

            "abstract": "Debate over lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation has included heated discussion about appropriate policies and their cost and feasibility. One prominent policy mechanism, a carbon intensity standard, rates transport fuels based on analysis of lifecycle GHG emissions, and targets lower fuel pool carbon intensity through a market mechanism that uses a system of tradable, bankable credits and deficits. California instituted such a policy -- the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) – in 2010, which targets a 10% carbon intensity (CI) reduction by 2020. The program rolled out amid concerns over slow development of new fuels expected to be very low carbon (such as cellulosic) and has faced court challenges that added considerable policy uncertainty. Since the program’s start, state transport energy mix has shifted modestly but noticeably. Looking ahead, emerging issues for the program include amendments and re-adoption in response to a court ruling, potential interaction with California’s multi-sector cap on carbon emissions (which started covering transport fuels in 2015), and impacts from similar CI standards in other jurisdictions.\nThis study provides an analysis of fuel mix changes since the LCFS was implemented in 2011, and a discussion of emerging issues focusing on policy interaction. Descriptive statistics on alternative fuel use, available fuel pathways, and CI ratings are presented based on data from the California Air Resources Board (which runs the program). They document a shift towards more alternative fuels in a more diverse mix, with lower average CI ratings for most alternative fuel types. Financial incentives for various fuels are compared under the LCFS and the US federal Renewable Fuel Standard; disincentives from conceptually different carbon pricing schemes under the LCFS and the Cap-and-Trade are also outlined.\nThe results provide important information on response to an existing market-based policy mechanism for addressing GHG emissions in transportation, as other jurisdictions weigh similar climate policies and debate mechanisms and costs and California announced an ambitious target of halving petroleum use by 2030.",

We use six P-wave vertical velocity profiles averaged within 5 km × 10 km areas to estimate the porosity at depths from 0.4 km to 2 km. The profile regions cover on-axis, east and west flanks of the central Endeavour segment and three regions of the segment ends including the Endeavour-West Valley (E-WV) and the Cobb overlapping spreading centers (OSCs) and the relict Middle Valley. At the segment center, our calculated porosities on-axis and on the east and west flanks agree well with the apparent bulk porosities measured in Hole 504B at intermediate-spreading Costa Rica Rift [Becker, 1990] and decrease from 5-15% to 2-7% from 0.5 km to 1 km depth and seal by 2 km depth. At all depths, our calculated porosities on the east and west flanks are lower than those on-axis by ~1.3-3%. This indicates the infilling of cracks by mineral precipitation associated with near-axis hydrothermal circulation [Newman et al., 2011]. At the segment ends, upper crustal velocities are lower than those in the segment center at depths < 2 km. These lower velocities are attributed to higher porosities (10-20% at 0.4 km decreasing to 3-6% at 2 km depth). This may indicate that fracturing in the OSCs strongly affects porosity at shallow depths. Between 0.7 km and 1 km, porosities estimated in all regions using pore aspect ratios of 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 are higher than those from Hole 504B indicating that the aspect ratio of cracks may be smaller than 0.05. There also appears to be a spreading rate dependence to upper crustal porosity structure. On-axis at the Endeavour segment, the calculated porosities from 0.4 km to 2 km are higher than those at the Lucky Strike segment, a slow spreading center [Seher et al., 2010]. Specifically at 2 km depth the porosity is sealed (0%) at the Endeavour segment but is ~1-2.5% at the Lucky Strike. This may be related to the differences in upper crustal thickness or depth of the axial magma chamber between the intermediate and slow spreading ridges. These results illustrate how upper crustal porosities are controlled by a combination of tectonic, magmatic and hydrothermal processes.",

These oscillations show similar physical properties (such as period, decay time, and trigger) as those slow-mode standing waves previously detected by the SOHO/SUMER spectrometer in Doppler shift of flare lines formed above 6 MK. The multi-wavelength AIA observations with high spatio-temporal resolution and wide temperature coverage enable us to measure both thermal and wave properties of the oscillating hot plasma with unprecedented accuracy. These new measurements can be used to diagnose the complicated energy transport processes in flare plasma by a technique called coronal seismology based on the combination of observations and MHD wave theory. From a detailed case study we have found evidence for thermal conduction suppression in hot loops by measuring the polytropic index and analyzing the phase relationship between the temperature and density wave signals. This result is not only crucial for better understanding the wave dissipation mechanism but also provides an alternative mechanism to explain the puzzles of long-duration events and X-ray loop-top sources which show much slower cooling than expected by the classical Spitzer conductive cooling. This finding may also shed a light on the coronal heating problem because weak thermal conductivity implies slower cooling of hot plasma in nanoflares, so increasing the average coronal temperature for the same heating rate. We will discuss the effects of thermal conduction suppression on the wave damping and loop cooling based on MHD simulations.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU15_Mauro_Pau.pdf\nPockmarks are crater-like seabed depressions commonly resulting from focused fluid escape from soft, fine-grained sediments. Typically measuring 20–50 m across with depths of 2–10 m, these features often occur in extensive fields containing hundreds of them per square kilometre. They are prominent hazards for offshore installations such as oil rigs and pipelines, affecting vast areas worldwide. Besides, they represent a major geological source of methane, and their importance has been pointed out as contributors to the global climate variability.\nSedimentological and biostratigraphic analyses of sediment cores were coupled with shallow seismic images to investigate the origin and evolution of a pockmark field in the southwestern Barents Sea, an epicontinental sea part of the Arctic Ocean. The pockmarks formed as a result of reduced sedimentation above active gas seeps near the retreating edge of the Barents Sea ice sheet about 15,000 years ago. The seepage is ascribed to climate change-induced dissociation of methane hydrates. These findings strengthen the case that pockmarks, worldwide, recorded the release of massive quantities of methane from the seafloor into the ocean during the last deglaciation. No evidence was found for current upward methane flux, so the pockmarks in the study area appear as inactive seabed features.\nField measurements of currents and sediment fluxes in pockmarks in the Oslofjord, Norway, along with an experimental hydrodynamics study, provide insight into the mechanisms responsible for the long-term maintenance of inactive pockmarks. Near-bed currents may control the net sedimentation rate in these depressions by inhibiting the sedimentation from suspended transport. Enhanced turbulence and more intense biological activity suggest that the suspended fines are supported in the water column more easily in the pockmarks than on the surrounding bed, and can be transported away before settling. Moreover, upwelling generated by flow deflection over the pockmark morphology may winnow out the settling fine material. These mechanisms are proposed to be responsible for the lack of sediment infill that is often reported in inactive pockmarks, as well as for the frequently observed lag deposit of coarse material.",

            "abstract": "Quantification of evapotranspiration (ET) and its partition over regions of heterogeneous topography and canopy poses a challenge using traditional approaches. In this study, we report the results of a novel field experiment design guided by the Maximum Entropy Production model of ET (MEP-ET), formulated for estimating evaporation and transpiration from homogeneous soil and canopy. A catchment with complex terrain and patchy vegetation in South Australia was instrumented to measure temperature, humidity and net radiation at soil and canopy surfaces. Performance of the MEP-ET model to quantify transpiration and soil evaporation was evaluated during wet and dry conditions with independently and directly measured transpiration from sapflow and soil evaporation using the Bowen Ratio Energy Balance (BREB). MEP-ET transpiration shows remarkable agreement with that obtained through sapflow measurements during wet conditions, but consistently overestimates the flux during dry periods. However, an additional term introduced to the original MEP-ET model accounting for higher stomatal regulation during dry spells, based on differences between leaf and air vapor pressure deficits and temperatures, significantly improves the model performance. On the other hand, MEP-ET soil evaporation is in good agreement with that from BREB regardless of moisture conditions. The experimental design allows a plot and tree scale quantification of evaporation and transpiration respectively. This study confirms for the first time that the MEP-ET originally developed for homogeneous open bare soil and closed canopy can be used for modeling ET over heterogeneous land surfaces. Furthermore, we show that with the addition of an empirical function simulating the plants ability to regulate transpiration, and based on the same measurements of temperature and humidity, the method can produce reliable estimates of ET during both wet and dry conditions without compromising its parsimony.",

            "abstract": "Natural and human emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG’s)- carbon dioxide (CO2), methane gas (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O)- are important contributors to climate change. These GHG’s are released naturally from forested soils. Carbon dioxide flux tends to have a relatively low coefficient of variation (CV) compared to CH4 and N2O. Methane and nitrous oxide are often characterized by “hot spots” and “hot moments”, thus their CV are often very high compared to CO2, even in seemingly homogenous soil environments. The objective of this study is to determine the sampling intensity necessary for confidence estimates from forested soils of all three of these important GHGs. On July 2015, the emission of GHGs was measured from 36- randomly distributed soil flux- collars at the Howland Forest, Maine. A data analysis was run to determine how many chamber fluxes are needed to adequately estimate the mean and variance of GHGs fluxes. It was determined that both CO2 and CH4 had a 100% confidence estimate that a random 10,000 randomly sample group of an example of 8 fluxes had means within 50% of the full population mean and 14% confident for N2O. The confidence estimate that CO2, CH4, and N2O had means within 25% the full population mean was 97%, 92% and 9% and about 62%, 57% and 3% had means within the 10% full population mean. This analysis can be used to guide researchers when determining how many flux measurements may be necessary to achieve a desired level of confidence in their GHG estimates for their site.",

            "abstract": "Although the origins and processes of Martian aeolian features, especially dunes, have not been fully identified yet, it has been better understood by the orbital observation method which has led to the identification of Martian dune migration such as a case in Nili Patera (Bridges, 2012), and the numerical model employing advanced computational fluid dynamics. Specifically, the recent introduction of very high-resolution image products, such as 25 cm-resolution HiRISE imagery and its precise photogrammetric processor, allows us to trace the estimated, although tiny, dune migration over the Martian surface.\nIn this study, we attempted to improve the accuracy of active dune migration measurements by 1) the introduction of very high resolution ortho images and stereo analysis based on the hierarchical geodetic control (Kim and Muller, 2009) for better initial point settings; and 2) the improved sub-pixel co-registration algorithms using optical flow with a refinement stage based on a least squares correlation conducted on a pyramidal processor. Consequently, this scheme not only measured Martian dune migration more precisely, but it also achieved the extension of 3D observations combining stereo analysis and photoclinometry. The established algorithms have been tested using the HiRISE time series images over several dune fields, such as the Kaiser, Procter, and Rabe craters, which were reported by the Mars Global Digital Dune Database (Hayward et al., 2013). The detected dune migrations were significantly larger than previously reported values. The outcomes in our study will be demonstrated with the quantified values in 2D and volumetric direction. In the future, the method will be further applied to the dune fields in the Mars Global dune database comprehensively and can be compared with the improved General Circulation Model and the numerical simulation.\n ",

            "abstract": "Changes in the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) in the southern portion of the Gulf of California (GoC) can be caused by changes in primary productivity or by advection of water masses with low oxygen concentrations. To discern the acting mechanism, multiple and gravity cores (NH01-22 and NH01-25) comprising the Holocene (~4800 and ~6600 years, respectively) were collected in the OMZ of the GoC during the CALMEX NH-01 cruise. Sediments were collected on the eastern slopes of Pescadero (PB) and Carmen (CB) Basins, intersecting in both cases the GoC’s distinct OMZ. The cores were sectioned at 1-cm intervals and analyzed for total Mo (MoTotal), total Al and Fe-pyrite. With these values, Mo enrichment factors (EFMo) and degrees of pyritization (DOP) were calculated for each sediment interval. Average DOP values for CB and PB were 38%±11% (n=306) and 28.6%±6.5% (n=259), respectively, indicating that the sediments are not limited by the availability of reactive Fe. Higher average MoTOTAL values were measured in CB (0.22±0.04 µmol g-1) relative to PB (0.09±0.02 µmol g-1). As a result, EFMo values were high (14.5±3.4, range of 6.6-35.6) in CB and significantly lower in PB (4.5±1.1, range of 2.7-12.0). For CB, EFMO values are comparable to regions such as the west coast of Baja California, Mexico (EFMO=20±9) and the euxinic Black Sea (EFMO=27±8) and Saanich Inlet, British Columbia (EFMO=39±35) zones. In PB EFMO values were similar to those reported for well oxygenated marginal basins (e.g., Japan Sea; EFMO=2.5±1.5). DOP values for CB and PB are generally <40%, characteristic of oxic sedimentary environments. The DOP and EFMO conflicting results could indicate that the sediments are not completely pyritized because Fe is also associated with acid volatile sulfides (unlikely), or that values <40% are not necessarily associated with oxic sedimentary environments. However, for both basins, the persistence of laminations, the EFMo levels and the DOP values suggest variable oxic, anoxic and even euxinic paleoenvironmental conditions, which were intermittently present during the last ~6.6 ky BP in the GoC.",

            "abstract": "We conducted a geophysical study at a site proposed for a new dorm building prior to trenching planned as part of a separate fault investigation study. The study area was located on the south side of the CSU East Bay campus, roughly 100 – 300 m SSE of the current dorm complex. In addition to its proximity to the Hayward Fault, several smaller faults have been previously mapped within the proposed location, including the East and West Dibblee Faults. These faults are thought to represent contacts between the Leona Rhyolite and the Knoxville Formation. Data acquisition included seismic, resistivity, and GPS data collected in an effort to develop a better understanding of the geological and structural profile of this area, including the location of lithologic contacts, faults, and the thickness of soil and fill. Geophysical profiles were collected over the locations of future trenches.\nThe survey included geophysical lines that were located coincident with two planned trenching sites, which were chosen to intersect mapped faults. Survey positions were recorded using differential GPS. Seismic refraction and MASW (multichannel analysis of surface waves) surveys were performed over two of the planned trench sites using a 48-channel seismographic system with 4.5 Hz geophones and a 10-lb sledgehammer. For one of the lines, geophones were spaced every 3 m with a total spread length of 141 m and a shot spacing of 9 m. For the second line, geophones were spaced every 4 m with a total spread length of 188 m. Shots were taken every 12 m. Resistivity surveys were also performed along one of the line locations using both a capacitively-coupled dipole (CCD) system and 48-electrode system.\nGeospatial data for the survey area were compiled, including 0.3 m color orthoimagery and vector line files for geologic unit boundaries and presumed fault locations. The products of this study will include the geophysical response of geologic formations, location of unit contacts and faults, thickness of soil and fill, shear wave velocity (VS and VS30). The results of this study will enable improved seismic hazard assessment of the site and will contribute to a better understanding of the overall geologic profile of this area.",

            "abstract": "Scientists are often encouraged, and sometimes required, to standardize methods for collecting, analyzing, managing, and reporting data. Methods standardization within and between scientific domains is often considered beneficial for collaboration, developing scientific tools, and curation and sharing of data. However, efforts to standardize are often resisted for a range of social and technical reasons.\nHere we present findings from a case study of a domain characterized by high methodological diversity. This domain, the deep subseafloor biosphere, studies interactions between subseafloor microbial communities and the physical environment they inhabit. We have conducted 49 interviews and observed practice over a period of 18 months; the study is still ongoing.\nDomain scientists depend on core samples and data obtained from International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) cruises. During cruises, basic data are produced about the physical composition of cores, using standard methods. However, no comparable microbiological data is produced on cruises.\nMany leading deep subseafloor biosphere scientists are concerned that this lack of standardized microbiological data limits their domain’s scientific progress. They have identified heterogeneity of methods for microbiological analyses of cores as the major barrier to including such analyses on cruises. Among the actions these scientists have taken to promote methods standardization are journal articles and an international workshop.\nDespite these efforts, the community is not fully embracing standardization. One of the tensions is between perceived benefits for the community vs. a lack of incentives for individuals to perform necessary standardization work. This work includes meta-analyses to compare methods. However, the community lacks infrastructure and reward structures to support individuals to conduct such work.\nAnother tension is concern amongst some scientists that standardizing methods now will foreclose development of better methods in the future. At the individual level, scientists worry their past work may be marginalized if their preferred methods are not selected as the new standards. All parties involved have legitimate concerns about how to balance individual and community needs in advancing the domain's scientific goals.",

The population distribution of thecamoebian species within a lake can reveal such lake dynamics as trophic status, temperature, and acidity. Crystal Lake is a small alpine lake located in the San Gabriel Mountains of the coastal southwest United States. This project’s objective is to reconstruct a 1300 yr paleolimnological record for Crystal Lake using thecamoebian assemblages. The latter reconstruction will be examined in the context of paleoclimatological interpretations from the same core (Palermo et al., 2015) to determine to what extent – if any – changes in thecamoebian assemblages respond to, and record, paleoclimatological changes such as the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age. Core CLPC14-1 was extracted from Crystal Lake’s depocenter in May 2014. Grain size, magnetic susceptibility, and LOI 550°C and 950°C were measured at 1 cm contiguous intervals; additionally, C:N ratios and C and N isotopic analyses were measured every 2 cm (Palermo, 2015). Thecamoebian assemblages were analyzed in five modern surface samples, as well as throughout the core at 2 cm intervals (aligning with the other analyses performed). Statistical analysis was performed to determine significant patterns within the assemblages. Eleven AMS 14C dates of discrete organic matter (i.e. wood or charcoal) were used to generate an age model using Beacon v2.2; for the past 200 years, age control is based on correlation to Rothenberg et al. (2010) core ages (Palermo, 2015).",

            "abstract": "Submarine gullies are ubiquitous on continental slopes and steep areas of seafloor worldwide, but their role in sediment transport remains unresolved. Direct observation of flows in the submarine realm is rare and expensive, but by analyzing basic geometries of gullies in the sedimentary record, it is possible to gain insight into the behavior of the flows that formed them. In shallow 3D seismic reflection data from the Taranaki Basin, New Zealand, we document gullies preserved in a Pliocene-Pleistocene progradational margin sequence. These gullies commonly form aggradational complexes hundreds of meters thick, showing alternating periods of erosion, inactivity, and roughly self-similar aggradation in response to slope sedimentation. Erosional phases speak of modification by energetic turbidity currents, whereas sediment drapes point to extended periods of flow quiescence and hemipelagic deposition.\nWe pair these observations with morphometrics of over 600 gullies in seafloor bathymetry from continental margins worldwide. The slopes of these modern gullies and interfluves are both well described by a power-law decay with along-profile distance. The decay of slopes with distance (concavity) obtained from power-law relationships for interfluves and gullies are well correlated, although gullies attain higher slopes and are slightly more concave than neighboring interfluves.\nThe self-similar growth of gullies in the subsurface and the strong similarity between gully and interfluve profiles in all datasets suggests a link between the evolution of gullies and of the slopes on which they form. We conclude by presenting a conceptual model in which gully and slope morphology are tightly coupled.",

Volatility properties of biogenic SOA determine its concentration, reactivity, and lifetime, but are still largely unknown. As part of a larger study to assess the effect of biogenic SOA on aerosol optical properties, a set of instruments, including scanning mobility sizers (SMPS), single particle soot photometer (SP2), and a thermodenuder, was deployed during June 2015 at a Duke Forest site near Chapel Hill, NC. The site is characterized by a significant contribution of both biogenic and urban (mostly traffic) sources. Measurements of changes in aerosol volume and optical size upon heating in the thermodenuder at different temperatures are used to derive volatility properties of the ambient aerosol. A limited set of experiments was carried out using the tandem differential mobility analysis (TDMA) approach to investigate whether the ambient aerosol at the Duke Forest site is internally mixed with respect to its volatility properties. In this presentation we will discuss equilibrium and kinetic aspects of aerosol volatility observed during this study and implications of external vs. internal mixing for derivation of bulk volatility properties of ambient aerosol.",

The general distribution resembles the Pacific blocking, but more equatorward. The resolution sensitivity experiment suggests that, associated with the poleward shift of the subtropical jet stream, the blocking activity also moves northward with higher resolution, and converges between 60km and 30km. The blocking with finer resolution also shows a more realistic characteristic timesale. By utilizing the wave activity budget analysis, it is found that, in the decay stage, the effective diffusivity would be much larger, thus the blocking waves are absorbed more efficiently by the mean flow.",

            "abstract": "Although fault zones have been studied worldwide, there have been no global mapping, compilation and meta-analysis of interpretations of the fault zone permeability structures and/or methodological biases. To investigate biases in data collection sources we review ~2000 published studies and reports and summarize categorical data from over 600 cases, including ~200 studies with reported fault zone permeability, transmissivity, or diffusivity estimates from the fault damage zone, fault core, whole fault zone, and protolith. The data are categorized into fault zone permeability structures (e.g. barrier, conduit, barrier-conduit, etc.) and are evaluated with respect to the type of fluid flow or permeability observation, the data collection source (e.g. studies in structural geology, hydrogeology, tunneling, mining, engineering, etc.), and on the scale of measurement. Our results show that the combined conduit-barrier fault zone structure is observed in only 15-20% of the cases (but up to 60% of structural geology cases if paleo-conduit studies are included). The barrier structure is observed in ~30% of the faults in structural geology, hydrogeology, and mining studies, and in over 40% petroleum engineering studies, but in less than 10% in tunnel engineering and rarely in geothermal engineering. The barrier nature of faults is detected primarily with qualitative observations (water levels and pressures, water geochemistry), and is difficult to measure in the subsurface. Some hydrogeological observations favour the detection of hydraulic barriers or conduits, but not both equally. Therefore, the frequency of fault zone conceptual models (barriers/conduits) globally or within a region may be a result of measurement bias and not of actual conditions. We also compare reported permeability values at three scales of measurement: matrix permeability, small scale fractured bulk permeability, and whole fault zone permeability. The quantitative permeability anisotropy or scaling ratio between the fault core or fault damage zone and protolith is only reported in fewer than 30 studies (excluding numerical/parametric modelling with assumed permeability). We use the global data summaries and statistical comparisons to comment on the multidisciplinary understanding of fluid flow in fault zones.",

The relationship between FVC and vegetation indices is however variable depending on regional vegetation types and background soil types across different regions. In particular, arid and semi-arid region shows substantial uncertainty in the VI-FVC relations because of sparse vegetation cover and hence, important roles of local soil type in land-surface spectral reflectance. In this study, VI-FVC relations were investigated for arid and semi-arid regions of Mongolia. The FVC data was prepared from digital-camera image interpretation sheets taken at 160 sites in our field excursions from 2012 to 2014. In comparisons with visual inspections, the camera-based FVC showed good linear relations (r = 0.97, p < 0.001) with 6.83% of RMSE. Three satellite-based VIs were prepared, i.e. MODIS NDVI, EVI, and SAVI, which applied to produce linear regression models of FVC. The model parameters (i.e. slope and intercept) was obtained through iterated calculation process. Among the 160 sites, 120 sites were arbitrarily extracted to produce regression model and the remaining 40 sites were used for model validation. This iterated process were repeated 1,000,000 times and then, statistics were derived as averages of model (slope and interception) and validation (Pearson correlation coefficient and RMSE). In results, the regression models generally showed good agreements in model validations over r = 0.8 (p < 0.001). This study discussed problems in long-term FVC retrieval for the arid and semi-arid regions of Mongolia.",

            "abstract": "The Mono Craters, part of the Mono-Inyo volcanic chain in eastern California, comprise at least 27 high-silica Pleistocene to Holocene rhyolite domes, lava flows and tephra cones. The Holocene chronology of the Mono Craters is well constrained but only recently has 238U-230Th zircon and 40Ar/39Ar dating elucidated the Pleistocene eruptive history. We performed trace element analysis on dated zircon crystal rims and sectioned interiors (using SHRIMP-RG) from 3 rhyolite domes (21, 12.5, and 7 ka) with additional rim data on 5 ashes separated from juvenile pumice clasts in the correlative Wilson Creek Formation (spanning from 62 to 21 ka). Ti-in-zircon (TTi,zrc) thermometry (titania activity from coexisting Fe-Ti oxides) gives temperatures predominantly between 650°C and 750°C, similar to average zircon saturation temperatures (Tzrc,sat). The observation that Tzrc,sat ≈ TTi,zrc indicates that Mono Craters rhyolite magmas were zircon-saturated and erupted at these temperatures (near water-saturated granite eutectic). Variations in key trace elements are relatively limited overall and zircons display similar REE patterns with generally curved MREE to HREE patterns and prominent negative Eu anomalies. Most of the variation is observed in zircons from older eruptions (62-41 ka). Zircon rims from Ash 17 of the Wilson Creek Formation (59 ka) have elevated Th/U, Eu/Eu*, and Ti and lower Hf compared to Ash 19 (62 ka), which suggests a thermal rejuvenation event between these two eruptions. Zircon rims from Ash 15 (41 ka) are characterized by a trend toward high Hf, at relatively low and relatively constant Ti, and low Eu/Eu*, consistent with rhyolite magma undergoing eutectic-like crystallization just prior to eruption. Zircon surfaces and interiors for the 21, 12.5, and 7 ka dome eruptions have very similar Hf, low Eu/Eu*, low Ti, and low Th/U. This requires zircon crystallization in a very uniform thermal and chemical environment from the latest Pleistocene to Holocene (a feldspar-saturated, crystal mush?).",

            "abstract": "Deformation of lower mantle minerals has been studied experimentally in some detail, but the underlying physical processes that govern deformation are still not well understood. We have implemented the orthorhombic symmetry in the viscoplastic finite element code FEpX developed at Cornell University, making this code useful for understanding plasticity of mineral aggregates like bridgmanite (with perovskite structure) and ferropericlase, the main mineral components of the lower mantle.\nHigh pressure radial diamond anvil cell (rDAC) and large volume press (D-DIA) experiments suggest that CPO is much weaker in 2-phase aggregates compared to 1-phase aggregates. But so far this has not been modeled satisfactorily with polycrystal plasticity theory that assumes that grains deform homogeneously, such as the Taylor or self-consistent approaches. Since it is expected that local heterogeneity plays a crucial role in deformation of 2-phase aggregates, we use a finite element approach where each grain in the aggregate is composed of individual elements. The constitutive equations between stress and strain are solved for all the elements in the aggregate, taking the local environment of each element into account. The FEpX code models the mechanical behavior of a virtual polycrystal, generated by the Neper code, which deforms by dislocation slip over large strain paths. The slip systems for the orthorhombic perovskite structure have been implemented into the code and, in particular, the development of CPO due to different combinations of slip systems is examined in the 2-phase aggregate of bridgmanite and periclase.\nPreliminary results show that there is an important correlation between CPO of both bridgmanite and periclase with the relative volume fractions and the microstructure of the aggregate. If the soft periclase is interconnected it absorbs deformation by grain boundary sliding instead of by dislocation glide. Model results are compared with high pressure r-DAC experiments, where x-ray diffraction patterns are analyzed with the software MAUD to quantify CPO in the sample. Experimental CPO is compared with predictions from the FEpX model. With this approach we can draw conclusions about deformation processes in complex aggregates, which have a great significance in many geological processes.",

As dusts are transported long distances, aerosols such as black carbon can pollute the air mass along the transport path. Two mixing processes, externally and semi-externally (sticking) mixing may substantially affect the single-scattering and radiative properties of polluted dust particles compared to the unpolluted counterparts. This study focuses on quantifying the changes in the optical properties of dust aerosols due to black carbon contamination. The dust model we use is an irregular polyhedron, which is in good agreement with the laboratory measurement. The black carbon model is spherules aggregate defined with a cluster-cluster aggregation algorithm. Specifically, we define the degree of pollution in terms of two variables, the adhesion degree of pollutants and their mixing ratios, since both can alter the optical properties of polluted dust in different ways. By applying the Invariant Imbedding T-matrix Method (II-TM), we obtain the scattering phase matrix and other optical properties of dust aerosols with different degrees of contamination. Furthermore, the morphological effects on the optical properties of polluted dust are quantified by considering different fractal dimensions of black carbon as particles age. The overall changes due to different degrees of pollution by black carbon are investigated at various wavelengths.",

            "abstract": "Models for initiation of Vulcanian eruptions involve disruption of a conduit-sealing plug or dome and the downward propagation of decompression and fragmentation waves into the conduit. At this time, we have a limited understanding of the physical state of the magma prior to its disruption, including the range of viscosities and vesicularities and the extent to which brecciated, outgassed, degassed, and volatile-rich melt may be co-mingled. Current models propose that the dense, outgassed dome/plug overlies an orderly, predominantly horizontally layered conduit with pressure increasing with depth. The 1912 eruption of Novarupta, Alaska, U.S.A. provided a unique situation to study Vulcanian explosions because its proximal deposits are exceptionally well preserved. After 60 hours and three episodes of Plinian activity and caldera collapse 10 km from vent, a dacite dome was extruded and completely destroyed by a Vulcanian phase. The fifth and final episode comprised of extrusion of a rhyolite dome without explosive activity, thus allowing preservation of the Episode IV Vulcanian block apron. We have collected data on over 1,300 of the largest juvenile and lithic blocks within an ~2-3 km radius from vent, making Episode IV the best mapped Vulcanian deposit in the world to-date. Sectors rich in specific lithologies (pumice, dense dacite, flow-banded clasts or breccia, +/- breadcrusting) and/or of contrasting block size suggest multiple explosions. Vesicularities of breadcrust rinds preserve syn-eruptive vesicularities and volatile contents and suggest considerable heterogeneity on length scales down to mm. Their vesicularity range is between 0.5 and 55% whereas dense dacite blocks lie between 0 and 33%. On equally short length scales, similar broad ranges for porosity/permeability and contrasts in micro-textures indicate major physical and chemical heterogeneity reflecting very local variations in the extent to which the melt was degassed or outgassed. Our new data suggest (1) that different explosions tapped small yet diverse parts of the conduit’s architecture and (2) a scenario more complicated than a simple horizontally stratified magma-filled conduit that was progressively evacuated in a top-down fashion.",

All this makes true scientific reproducibility and collaborative integrated modeling impossible without some glue to piece it all together. Our Virtual Watershed Integrated Modeling System provides the tools and modeling framework hydrologists need to accelerate and fortify new scientific investigations by tracking provenance and providing adaptors for integrated, collaborative hydrologic modeling and data management. Under global warming trends where water resources are under increasing stress, reproducible hydrological modeling will be increasingly important to improve transparency and understanding of the scientific facts revealed through modeling.\nThe Virtual Watershed Data Engine is capable of ingesting a wide variety of heterogeneous model inputs, outputs, model configurations, and metadata. We will demonstrate one example, starting from real-time raw weather station data packaged with station metadata. Our integrated modeling system will then create gridded input data via geostatistical methods along with error and uncertainty estimates.

            "abstract": "ePoster - Brigham_Laurel_AGU_final.pdf\nIncreased instances of drought are predicted for tropical forests; therefore, it is important to better understand how drought will affect individual aspects of the forest carbon cycle. Through photosynthesis, CO2 is assimilated into sugars, a dominant portion of which goes to the stems where it is used for growth and cell maintenance. Both processes produce CO2 through respiration, which leaves the stem through the bark. This investigation focused on how stem CO2 efflux differs between two tree species in the tropical rainforest biome of Biosphere 2 in Oracle, Arizona—a species of legume (Clitoria racemosa) and a species of non-legume (Phytolacca dioica).\nA flexible chamber was strapped to each tree and the CO2 that diffused across the bark was measured with a LI-7000. A 4-week long drought was imposed in an effort to simulate future conditions resulting from climate change. It was found that C. racemosa had an overall higher CO2 efflux than P. dioica. C. racemosa has thinner bark than P. dioica, which displays a secondary thickening of its stem as a result of successive cambia; therefore, CO2 could more easily diffuse from the stems of C. racemosa. The results also indicate that decreased soil moisture, as a result of the drought, leads to a significantly lower CO2 efflux from C. racemosa whereas no significant change was observed in P. dioica. This suggests that C. racemosa is more sensitive to water stress than P. dioica, which may have greater water storage capabilities due to its successive cambia. The differing reactions of C. racemosa and P. dioica to decreased soil moisture could be important for calculating carbon stocks and modeling the response of tropical trees to drought.",

            "abstract": "On 25 April 2015, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake struck Nepal. Subsequently many large aftershocks shook the region, including one of magnitude 7.3. Much damage and over 4300 landslides were triggered. The landslides were mapped by a volunteer group who self organized to undertake an emergency response to the earthquake disaster. The number of landslides is fewer than expected based on total released seismic energy. This may be because of lack of a surface rupture and possibly also because of high surface-wave attenuation due to rugged surface topography or to the geological and geophysical characteristics of the upper crust. The observed landslides were primarily in the southern half of the Himalaya in areas where the steepest slopes occur and where peak ground accelerations were relatively high. The landslides are also concentrated on the tectonically downdropped block. However, the distribution is complex and varies dramatically from valley to valley. Furthermore, different types of landslides are concentrated in different geologic materials, which suggests local factors control the valley-scale attenuation or amplification of seismic waves or the way wave disturbances couple to the local geologic materials. Across the earthquake-affected zone on the regional scale, wave attenuation and also net downdrop and uplift may also explain as much about the distribution of landslides as slopes and distance from large slips on the fault. We will offer the regional distribution results and some specific case studies to illustrate a set of possible controlling factors.",

            "abstract": "Over the past fifteen years US vehicle emissions standards have dramatically improved, with the goal of reducing urban air pollution. Recent studies demonstrate secondary organic aerosol (SOA) to be the dominant contributor to urban organic aerosol, but controversy remains regarding the contributions of different vehicle types to SOA. Increased potency for SOA formation from non methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) from newer vehicles that meet tighter emission standards has also been observed. Both speciation and temporal resolution of vehicular emissions are critical for predicting SOA formation. The relative importance of diesel and gasoline emissions to SOA formation depends critically on speciation. Experiments were conducted at the California Air Resources Board Haagen-Smit Laboratory to better understand SOA formation for low, ultra-low, super ultra-low and partial zero emission vehicles (LEV, ULEV, SULEV, PZEV). Exhaust was sampled on filters and adsorbent tubes to measure intermediate-, semi-, and low-volatility NMHC (IVOC, SVOC, LVOC). A proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) measured volatile organics (VOC) emissions with high time-resolution. Analysis of filters and adsorbent tubes using gas chromatography with vacuum-ultra-violet ionization mass spectrometry provided unprecedented characterization of emissions according to degree of branching, number of cyclic rings, aromaticity, and molecular weight. ULEV vehicles show the composition distributions of primary particulate emissions peak for compounds in the SVOC range. PZEV vehicle emissions peak in the IVOC range. Diesel vehicles have up to ten times higher emissions than gasoline vehicles; their distributions have significant IVOC levels and peak in the SVOC/LVOC range. Our measurements are used to predict potential SOA formation by vehicle standard class and the relative SOA formation for diesel and gasoline vehicles. PTR-MS measurement show VOC emissions after cold start occur almost entirely in the first 30-60 seconds, and both their magnitude and duration consistently decrease with stricter standards.",

We performed a campaign of time-lapse MS monitoring at the National Crude Oil Spill Fate and Natural Attenuation Research Site (Bemidji, MN) between July 2011 and August 2015. This highly instrumented site has multiple boreholes installed through the free phase, dissolved phase and uncontaminated portions of the aquifer impacted by an oil spill resulting from a pipeline rupture in 1979. Magnetic susceptibility (MS) data acquired in 2011 showed that MS values in the smear zone are higher than in the dissolved phase plume and background, leading to the hypothesis that MS measurements could be used to monitor the long-term progress of biodegradation at the site. However, repeated MS data acquired in 2014 and 2015 showed strong changes in the character of the MS signal in the smear zone with multiple free phase contamination locations showing a strong suppression of the signal relative to that observed in 2011. Other locations in the dissolved phase of the plume show evidence for vertical migration of the zone of enhanced MS, possibly due to changes in the redox profiles driven by hydrology. Such changes in the MS signal are hypothesized to result from either variations in Fe(II)/Fe(III) ratios in the magnetite or changes in the magnetite concentration associated with coupled carbon and iron biogeochemistry. This work is generating a unique time-lapse geophysical dataset providing information on the spatial and temporal dynamics of iron mineral transformations associated with hydrocarbon degradation at the site.",

The two advanced instruments onboard GPM, namely, Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) and GPM Microwave Imager (GMI), can provide measurement of rainfall, snowfall, ice and other precipitation over most of the globe. As an integral part of all satellite precipitation missions, ground validation helps to quantify precipitation measurement uncertainty and provide insight into the physical and statistical basis of retrieval algorithms. Among various validation instruments, ground-based dual-polarization radar (at S, C and X band frequencies) has been shown to be a powerful tool to estimate surface rainfall.\nThis paper will present the concept of level one validation of GPM using high resolution precipitation observations from DFW network. The area of interest in this study is Dallas-Fort Worth (DFW) Metroplex, which hosts a network of six high-resolution dual-polarization X-band radars operated by the center for Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere (CASA) and the NWS WSR-88DP radar (i.e., KFWS radar). The DFW network QPE product has been shown to be of excellent quality, in terms of accuracy as well as space time resolution (Chen and Chandrasekar, Journal of Hydrology, May (2015)). Detailed comparisons will be conducted between GPM based rainfall estimates and ground radar observations collected during the GPM satellite overpasses over DFW region.

Understanding carbonate formation is an essential prerequisite to quantify the effect climate change and pollution have on marine population.\nWater is a critical component of the structure of ACC and the key component controlling the stability of the amorphous state. Addition of small amounts of magnesium (1-5% of the calcium content) is known to promote the stability of ACC presumably through stabilization of the hydrogen bonding network. Understanding the hydrogen bonding network in ACC is fundamental to understand the stability of ACC.\nOur approach is to use Monte-Carlo simulations constrained by X-ray and neutron scattering data to determine hydrogen bonding networks in ACC as a function of magnesium doping.\nWe have already successfully developed a synthesis protocol to make ACC, and have collected X-ray data, which is suitable for determining Ca, Mg and O correlations, and have collected neutron data, which gives information on the hydrogen/deuterium (as the interaction of X-rays with hydrogen is too low for us to be able to constrain hydrogen atom positions with only X-rays).\nThe X-ray and neutron data are used to constrain reverse Monte-Carlo modelling of the ACC structure using the Empirical Potential Structure Refinement program, in order to yield a complete structural model for ACC including water molecule positions.\nWe will present details of our sample synthesis and characterization methods, X-ray and neutron scattering data, and reverse Monte-Carlo simulations results, together with a discussion of the role of hydrogen bonding in ACC stability.",

Here, a statistical method is proposed to explain the subtropical cloud feedback in abrupt 4xCO2 experiments of 19 global climate models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5). First principles indicate that boundary layer cloudiness is largely controlled by sea surface temperature, the strength of the temperature inversion capping the clouds, horizontal surface temperature advection, free-tropospheric moisture, and subsidence. This motivates us to employ multi-linear regression to explain the subtropical cloud feedback in the CMIP5 ensemble using these parameters as predictor variables. We find that this linear framework is a valid approach to explain the shortwave cloud radiative effect feedback in models that realistically simulate interannual relationships between subtropical clouds and meteorology. These models produce a positive subtropical cloud feedback. Models that poorly simulate such relationships produce negative cloud feedbacks that are unlikely to occur in nature. Based on the observed cloud-meteorology relationships from two satellite cloud datasets and four atmospheric reanalyses, we conclude that the subtropical cloud feedback will likely be weakly positive due to an increase in sea-surface temperature in the perturbed climate, partially offset by a negative feedback that arises due to an increase in estimated inversion strength.",

            "abstract": "Supra-glacial lakes on the GrIS have become a focus of research relating to the contribution of the GrIS to sea level rise. Lakes have been observed to appear during the summer melt season. Though it appears that the quantity of water collected on the surface is small, it is thought that the fracture and drainage of these lakes delivers significant pulses of water to the ice sheet bed, influencing the dynamic movement of glaciers towards the sea. The pattern of this transport mechanism may be a central driver of its influence over dynamic losses, as the flow of the viscoelastic ice sheet will differ if the water is delivered in a short pulse or a slower constant supply. A number of studies have catalogued the traits of lakes with an aim to quantify lake areas, depths, and timing of formation and cessation using visible and near infrared remote sensing instruments mostly focused on the summer melt season. Little is known about the behaviour of the surface lakes over the winter. A recent examination of the over-wintering of surface lakes has been conducted by Koenig et al. [2015] using airborne radar. While the study is extensive in area covered, it is limited in its temporal resolution by the availability of Operation IceBridge data, typically at one pass per year. This study seeks to observe the development of lakes over the winter period. Sentinel-1A radar images are used to track the presence of surface lakes and their variation in three study sites on the Greenland ice sheet. The sites are as follows: upstream of Ryder glacier, upstream of Petermann glacier, and upstream of Jakobshavn glacier. Water masks are created based on summer Landsat-8 images following NDWIice  and then compared to Sentinel images at monthly temporal resolution through the winter of 2014-2015. These radar images show persistence of liquid water through the winter in agreement with previous research as well as variation in the buried lake area over the span of the year studied.",

            "abstract": "Mineral soils retain large amounts of organic matter through sorption on the surfaces of mineral soils, the largest pools of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in the forests of the northeastern U.S. In addition to determining organic matter storage, adsorption and desorption processes are important controllers of runoff chemistry. We are studying adsorption dynamics of mineral soils collected from a chronosequence of hardwood forest sites in the White Mountains, NH to determine how soils vary in their DOM adsorption capacities as a function of effective C and N saturation. We hypothesize that forest age determines proximity to saturation because young forests may need to mine soil organic matter (SOM) in mineral soils to obtain nitrogen to meet growth demands, while the soils of older forests have had time to reaccumulate SOM, eventually reaching C and N saturation. Consequently, we expect adsorption capacities to first increase with forest age in young forests, as the trees mine C and N from mineral surfaces. They will then decrease with forest age in older forests as mining slows and C and N begin to re-accumulate. Batch experiments were conducted with mineral soil samples and dilutions of forest floor leachate. However, preliminary results from a mature forest site (about 100 years old), which we predicted to be a low point of C and N saturation from decades of mining, contradict expectations. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) adsorption in its shallow mineral soil layers (0-3 cm below E or A horizons) are lower than younger sites ranging from 20 to about 40 years old. In addition to forest age, soil depths also affect N retention dynamics in forest soils. We hypothesized that deeper mineral soils might have greater adsorption capacities due to the fact that they are exposed to less DOC and DON leaching from organic layers and therefore less saturated. Results from the same mature forest site confirm this. Soils from 3-10 cm depth have more potential to adsorb DOC and DON than soils from 0-3 cm depth. For example, at 80 mg/L DOC, the >3-10 layer adsorbed 11.37 mg total N (TN)/g dry soil whereas the 0-3 layer adsorbed 2.13 mg TN/g dry soil. This project will also consider the effects of soil texture, soil C and N content, and Al and Fe oxide and hydroxide content.",

            "abstract": "Mapping evapotranspiration (ET) from agricultural areas in California’s Central Valley is critical for understanding historical consumptive use of surface and groundwater. In addition, long histories of ET maps provide valuable training information for predictive studies of surface and groundwater demands. During times of drought, groundwater is commonly pumped to supplement reduced surface water supplies in the Central Valley. Due to the lack of extensive groundwater pumping records, mapping consumptive use using satellite imagery is an efficient and robust way for estimating agricultural consumptive use and assessing drought impacts. To this end, we have developed and implemented an algorithm for automated calibration of the METRIC remotely sensed surface energy balance model on NASA’s Earth Exchange (NEX) to estimate ET at the field scale. Using automated calibration techniques on the NEX has allowed for the creation of spatially explicit historical ET estimates for the Landsat archive dating from 1984 to the near present. Further, our use of spatial NLDAS and CIMIS weather data, and spatial soil water balance simulations within the NEX METRIC workflow, has helped overcome challenges of time integration between satellite image dates. This historical and near present time archive of agricultural water consumption for the Central Valley will be an extremely useful dataset for water use and drought impact reporting, and predictive analyses of groundwater demands.",

A subset of tested wells was high emitting, with methane flux rates up to seven orders of magnitude greater than natural fluxes (up to 105 mg CH4/hour, or about 2.5LPM). These wells contribute disproportionately to the total methane emissions from abandoned oil and gas wells. The principles guiding the chamber design have been developed for lower flux rates, typically found in natural environments, and chamber design modifications may reduce uncertainty in flux rates associated with high-emitting wells. Kang et al. estimate errors of a factor of two in measured values based on previous studies. We conduct controlled releases of methane to refine error estimates and improve chamber design with a focus on high-emitters. Controlled releases of methane are conducted at 0.05 LPM, 0.50 LPM, 1.0 LPM, 2.0 LPM, 3.0 LPM, and 5.0 LPM, and at two chamber dimensions typically used in field measurements studies of abandoned wells. As most sources of error tabulated by Kang et al. tend to bias the results toward underreporting of methane emissions, a flux-targeted chamber design modification can reduce error margins and/or provide grounds for a potential upward revision of emission estimates.",

            "abstract": "Forest structure comprises numerous quantifiable components of forest biometric characteristics, one of which is tree architecture. This structural component is important in the understanding of the past and future trajectories of these biomes. Tropical forests are often considered the most structurally complex and yet least understood of forested ecosystems. New technologies have provided novel avenues for quantifying properties of forested ecosystems, one of which is LIght Detection And Ranging (lidar). This sensor can be deployed on satellite, aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and terrestrial platforms. In this study we examined the efficacy of a terrestrial lidar scanner (TLS) system in a tropical forest to estimate forest structure. Our study was conducted in January 2012 at La Selva, Costa Rica at twenty locations in predominantly undisturbed forest. At these locations we collected field measured biometric attributes using a variable plot design. We also collected TLS data from the center of each plot. Using this data we developed relative vegetation profiles (RVPs) and calculated a series of parameters including entropy, FFT, number of layers and plant area index to develop statistical relationships with field data. We developed statistical models using multiple linear regressions, all of which converged on statistically significant relationships with the strongest relationship being for mean crown depth (r2 = 0.87, p < 0.01, RMSE = 1.1 m). Tree density was found to have the least strong statistical relationship (r2 = 0.45, p < 0.01, RMSE = 160.7 n ha-1). We found significant relationship between basal area and lidar metrics (r2 = 0.76, p < 0.001, RMSE = 3.68 number ha-1). Models developed for biomass 1 had a higher r-squared value and lower RMSE than that of biomass2 (biomass1: r2 = 0.7, p < 0.01, RMSE = 28.94 Mg ha-1; biomass2: r2 = 0.67, p < 0.01, RMSE = 40.62 Mg ha-1). Parameters selected in our models varied, thus indicating the potential relevance of multiple features in canopy profiles and geometry that are related to field-measured structure. Our work indicates that TLS data can provide useful information on tropical forest structure.",

The size and distribution of the citizen scientist community around the world has tremendous potential both for documenting the visible manifestations of global space weather impacts as well as providing quality control on the reported sightings. Information with high spatial and temporal resolution of the largest, most dynamic and mysterious space weather events is made possible by this solution, and this data can be integrated with other ground and space based measures of auroral activity. We will present initial results during the large geomagnetic events of 2015 and comparison to other measures of auroral activity. Our findings indicate the prototype application can be a valuable tool for real-time aurora knowledge and should be included in discussions of real-time aurora nowcasting needs.

            "abstract": "Horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing have enhanced energy production but raised concerns about drinking-water contamination and other environmental impacts associated with unconventional energy development. The occurrence of fugitive gas contamination in drinking-water wells near unconventional natural gas development has been central to the debate about the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing, but still has a controversial origin that has variably been attributed to natural geogenic occurrences, poor well bore integrity, and crustal-scale migration of natural gas along natural deformation features. Differentiating amongst these possibilities is critical to ongoing efforts to understand the environmental implications for the presence of elevated methane and aliphatic hydrocarbons (ethane, propane, etc.) in drinking-water and a necessary step toward the development of implementable solutions that limit the occurrence of future fugitive gas events. Here we will expand upon our recent work in the Marcellus and Barnett gas fields (Jackson et al., 2013; Darrah et al., 2014; 2015) that developed noble gas techniques for distinguishing natural and anthropogenic mechanisms of natural gas migration by integrating the molecular and isotopic composition of non-hydrocarbon molecules (N2, H2S, CO2) in addition to compound specific isotopes of hydrocarbons (d2H of CH4 and d2H-C2H6 and d13C of CH4, C2H6, and C3H8) and non-hydrocarbon compounds (d15N-N2). The expanded data sets validate our initial study and support the hypothesis that a subset of drinking-water wells experience natural gas contamination following faulty well construction or poor well integrity amid a background of naturally occurring gas and salt-rich groundwater.",

Active gas vents from the seafloor have previously been reported worldwide at gas hydrate fields. Atmospheric methane (CH4), a major component of seep gases, is an important short-lived climate pollutant. Gas seeps may contribute to increase atmospheric gas concentration above the sea surface. Our objectives were to continuously measure and investigate the distribution of the atmospheric CH4 concentration over the sea surface at the gas hydrate fields along the eastern margin of Japan Sea. We used the R/V Kaiyo-Maru No.7 (Kaiyo Engineering Co., Ltd., Japan) for the survey in Japan Sea from mid April to early June 2014. Continuous measurement of atmospheric CH4 was performed on the ship using a wave-length-scanned cavity ring-down spectrometer (WS-CRDS) (model G2201-i, Picarro Inc., USA). Air sample was collected from an air intake at the top deck (approximately 8 m above sea level) of the ship using an air pump placed in the observation room. To our experience, the ship sailed at approximately 6 knot. Location data were obtained with the nautical GPS. Observed atmospheric CH4 concentration over the sea surface was approximately between 1.8-1.9 ppm in most sea areas, but exceeds 2.0 ppm in some areas.

SWEA's energy resolution (ΔE/E = 17%), large field of view (80% of the sky), and 2-sec (~8-km) measurement cadence provide a detailed picture of ionospheric structure and magnetic field topology to altitudes as low as 125 km. During the first months of the mission, periapsis sampled northern latitudes from 30 to 75 degrees and altitudes down to 150 km, including the dawn and dusk terminators, the day and night hemispheres, and regions with and without significant crustal magnetic sources. The interface between the ionosphere and the overlying magnetosheath is structured and variable. When present, crustal magnetic sources can trap ionospheric plasma and significantly influence this structure.\nOn the night hemisphere, suprathermal electrons are consistently observed down to the lowest altitudes reached by the spacecraft. Above ~200 km altitude, two sources of suprathermal electrons are observed: transport of ionospheric plasma from the day side and precipitation of electrons from the magnetotail. From 200 to 125 km altitude, the suprathermal electron density drops by more than a factor of 1000, as these electrons interact with the neutral atmosphere. At the lowest altitudes, the residual population peaks at 7 eV (see figure), where there is a local minimum in the total cross section for interaction with CO2. On the day hemisphere, the spacecraft reached altitudes as low as 140 km near the sub-solar point, close to where the photoionization and electron impact ionization rates are expected to peak. A local maximum in the 5-10-eV photoelectron flux is consistently observed at ~150 km, which is consistent with passage through this ionization rate peak.",

One column was designed to separate low boiling point NMHC(C2~C6), the other for high boiling point NMHC(C7~C12). 56 NMHC compounds were measured from 18th May to 12th June, 2015 at an urban site in hill top of Korea Institute of Science and Technology campus.\nDuring the observation period, sum of NMHCs ranged from 27.6 ppbv to 54.1 ppbv. Among them, the mean concentrations of ethane was the highest (7.0 ppbv), and propane(6.7 ppbv), toluene(4.9ppbv), n-butane(3.3 ppbv) were followed. These four species represented 54% of total NMHCs concentration. The detailed behaviors of NMHC species were discussed further.\n ",

We use sferic signals from both the World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) and the Earth Networks Total Lightning Network (ENTLN). Similar analyses have been done with the RHESSI and ADELE gamma-ray data and WWLLN radio data (Smith et al., 2014; Albrechtsen et al., 2015). GBM gamma-ray data that is temporally near sferics within GBM’s field-of-view is corrected for time of propagation of the signal to Fermi (light travel time), time-aligned to the radio signals, and stacked for plotting. This analysis is possible on data from late 2012 onward, as this is when the GBM Continuous Time-Tagged Event datatype became fully available. At least 250,000 WWLLN strokes and 600,000 ENTLN strokes are within the field-of-view of GBM each year, even with conservative distance cutoffs. Validation of the method is achieved by a test mode in which only sferics near already-known TGFs are selected, which reveals a very strong signal. Various selections are tried for the remaining sferics, e.g., altering the distance cutoff, geographic region, etc.",

Martis Valley, a high altitude, snow dominated watershed in the Sierra Nevada, California has both surface (river/reservoir) and groundwater resources that are utilized to meet demands within the valley. The recent drought and changing precipitation type (less snow, more rain) has stressed the regional surface water supply and has increased the reliance on groundwater pumping. The objective of this paper is to quantify how changes in climate and depletion of snow storage result in decreased groundwater recharge and increased groundwater use, and to assess if increased surface water storage can mitigate impacts to groundwater under historic and future climate conditions. These objectives require knowledge on the spatiotemporal distribution of groundwater recharge, discharge, and surface and groundwater interactions. We use a high resolution, physically-based integrated surface and groundwater model, GSFLOW, to identify key mechanisms that explain recent hydrologic changes in the region. The model was calibrated using a multi-criteria approach to various historical observed hydrologic fluxes (streamflow and groundwater pumping) and states (lake stage, groundwater head, snow cover area). Observations show that while groundwater use in the basin has increased significantly since the 1980’s, it still remains a relatively minor component of annual consumptive water use. Model simulations suggest that changes from snow to rain will lead to increases in Hortonian and Dunnian runoff, and decreases in groundwater recharge and discharge to streams, which could have a greater impact on groundwater resources than increased pumping. These findings highlight the necessity of an integrated approach for evaluating natural and anthropogenic impacts on surface and groundwater resources.",

Several physiological explanations resulting from the community existence of microbes have been offered to explain the recalcitrant nature of biofilms. Herein a biophysical aspect of biofilm recalcitrance is being reported. While optimal efficiency argument suggests that bacterial biofilms would be just strong enough to withstand the surrounding shear forces, our experimental findings reveal the biofilms to be at least 330 to 55000 times stronger. Additionally, Monte-Carlo simulations for biofilm detachment in drinking water systems were performed, which show that the existing flow velocities are insufficient for significant biofilm removal and warrant alternative detachment strategies. This emphasizes the importance of considering strategies for biofilm weakening (and subsequent detachment) in conjunction with or as an alternative to bacterial inactivation.",

Rock-armored disposal cell covers create favorable habitat for deep-rooted plants by reducing soil evaporation, increasing soil water storage, and trapping windblown dust, thereby providing water and nutrients for plant germination and establishment. DOE is studying the tradeoffs of potential detrimental and beneficial effects of plants growing on disposal cell covers to develop a rational and consistent vegetation management policy. Plant roots often extend vertically through disposal cell covers into underlying tailings, therefore, uptake of tailings contaminants and dissemination through animals foraging on stems and leaves is a possible exposure pathway. The literature shows that plant uptake of contaminants in uranium mill tailings occurs, but levels can vary widely depending on plant species, tailings and soil chemistry, and cover soil hydrology. Our empirical field study measured concentrations of uranium, radium, thorium, molybdenum, selenium, manganese, lead, and arsenic in above ground tissues harvested from plants growing on disposal cells near Native American communities in western states that represent a range of climates, cover designs, cover soil types, and vegetation types. For risk screening, contaminant levels in above ground tissues harvested from plants on disposal cells were compared to Maximum Tolerance Levels (MTLs) set for livestock by the National Research Council, and to tissue levels in the same plant species growing in reference areas near disposal cells. Although tailings were covered with uncontaminated soils, for 14 of 46 comparisons, levels of uranium and other contaminants were higher in plants growing on disposal cells compared to reference area plants, indicating possible mobilization of these elements from the tailing into plant tissues. However, with one exception, all plant levels were well below MTLs. Selenium, the only element that exceeded its MTL, likely originated in local seleniferous soil found both at reference areas and in disposal cell covers, and not in the underlying tailings. Our screening risk assessment suggests that allowing plants to grow on disposal cells appears to be safe.",

However, most attempts to explain the spatiotemporal variability in crop yields with weather data have relied on growth stage definitions that do not change from year-to-year, even though planting, maturity, and harvesting dates show significant interannual variability. We tested the hypothesis that quantifying temperature exposures over dynamically determined growth stages would better explain observed spatiotemporal variability in crop yields than statically defined time periods. Specifically, we used National Agricultural and Statistics Service (NASS) crop progress data to identify the timing of the start of the maize reproductive growth stage (\"silking\"), and examined the correlation between county-scale yield anomalies and temperature exposures during either the annual or long-term average silking period. Consistent with our hypothesis and physical understanding, yield anomalies were more correlated with temperature exposures during the actual, rather than the long-term average, silking period. Nevertheless, temperature exposures alone explained a relatively low proportion of the yield variability, indicating that other factors and/or time periods are also important. We next investigated the potential of using remotely sensed land surface phenology instead of NASS progress data to retrieve crop growth stages, but encountered challenges related to crop type mapping and subpixel crop heterogeneity. Here, we discuss the potential of overcoming these challenges and the general utility of remotely sensed land surface phenology in crop yield mapping.",

We seek to understand the role of glacial meltwater on velocity. Matanuska glacier, a land terminating glacier in Alaska, has been well-studied using traditional glaciological techniques, but new technology has emerged that allows us to measure melt and velocity more accurately. We employed high-resolution differential GPS to create surface velocity profiles across flow in the ablation zone during the summer of 2015. We also measured surface ablation using stakes and measured basal melt using phase-sensitive radar designed by the British Antarctic Survey. The positions acquired by differential GPS are obtained to a resolution of less than 0.5m, while feature tracking using time-lapse photography for the same time period yields positions with greater and more variable uncertainty. The phase-sensitive radar provides ice thinning rates. Phase-sensitive radar together with ground penetrating radar provides us with an understanding of the internal structure of the glacier. This suite of data allows us to determine the relative importance of surface melt, basal melt, and internal deformation on ice velocity in warm mountain glaciers.",

Nearly one hundred instruments assessing conceptual understanding in undergraduate science and engineering classrooms (often called concept inventories) have been published and are actively being used to investigate learning. The techniques used to develop these instruments vary widely, often with little attention to psychometric principles of measurement. This paper will discuss the importance of using psychometric principles to design, evaluate, and revise research instruments, with particular attention to the validity and reliability steps that must be undertaken to ensure that research instruments are providing meaningful measurement. An example from a climate change inventory developed by the authors will be used to exemplify the importance of validity and reliability, including the value of item response theory for instrument development. A 24-item instrument was developed based on published items, conceptions research, and instructor experience. Rasch analysis of over 1000 responses provided evidence for the removal of 5 items for misfit and one item for potential bias as measured via differential item functioning. The resulting 18-item instrument can be considered a valid and reliable measure based on pre- and post-implementation metrics. Consideration of the relationship between respondent demographics and concept inventory scores provides unique insight into the relationship between gender, religiosity, values and climate change understanding.",

The shape of the underside of an ice shelf is important, such that the presence of basal crevasses can significantly modulate the transfer of heat at the ice-ocean interface. In situ observations of basal crevasses are challenging to obtain, but surface-based ground penetrating radar (GPR) surveys can be used to determine crevasse location and orientation. Here, we use GPR methods to map the internal structures in the McMurdo Shear Zone (SZ) which marks the boundary between the Ross Ice Shelf and the slower-moving McMurdo Ice Shelf. Radar surveys with 200 MHz and 400 MHz antennas reveal the presence of crevasses both in the upper firn and within a zone of accreted marine ice at a depth of approximately 170 meters. A spatial correspondence between near-surface and basal crevasses suggests that both are formed locally by lateral shearing. A combination of three dimensional higher order and Shallow Shelf Approximation ice flow equations within the Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM) are used to test this hypothesis. This model estimates the detailed velocity field of the SZ and is constrained by GPS-derived observations of surface motion. The distribution and orientations of surface crevasses is consistent with the gradients in velocity field predicted by the model. Though a wider range of orientation angles exists for crevasses within the basal regime, the average strike angle is consistent with firn crevassing and we conclude that the marine ice coevally fractured with the firn layer.",

In these grassland ecosystems fire return intervals are between 1-3 years. Beginning in the 1500’s, Andalusian cattle began grazing in this region and the cattle industry began in earnest in the late 1800s/early 1900s. Today, Florida’s prairie region is largely occupied by cow/calf ranch operations and also occupies the Northern Everglades watershed where water quality/quantity issues are at the forefront of environmental concerns. Florida ranches are characterized by a gradient of management intensities, ranging from sown pastures (most intensively managed) to semi-native pastures with a mix of introduced and native grasses, and rangeland (least managed ecosystem). Located at Archbold Biological Station, MacArthur Agro-ecology Research Center, and University of Florida Range Cattle Research Center (www.maerc.org; www.rcrec-ona.ifas.ufl.edu), a primary goal of the Subtropical Grasslands US Department of Agriculture Long-term Agro-Ecosystem Research LTAR is to balance intensification of sown pastures while enhancing management of native systems in a way that maximizes other ecosystem services (regulating, supporting, cultural, biodiversity). Here, we describe our proposed experimental design to compare ecosystem delivery from conventional and aspirational management regimes in sown pastures and native systems. Aspirational management goals are to (i) maximize productivity in sown pastures with a neutral effect on other ecosystem services, and (ii) manage native systems in a way that maximizes regulating, supporting, and biodiversity ecosystem services by utilizing patch burn grazing. Ultimately, we will determine if enhanced production in sown pasture under the aspirational management system can offset any reduction in productivity in semi-native/native systems managed for services other than production. Cross-site analyses with other LTAR sites are planned to assess energy balance and gas exchange in croplands of the southeastern U.S. and to compare controlling factors and processes across humid, subtropical and sub-humid continental beef-grazing systems.",

            "abstract": "Classification has emerged as an important tool for evaluating the runoff generating mechanisms in catchments and for providing a basis on which to group catchments having similar characteristics. These methods are particularly important for transferring models from one catchment to another in the case of data scarce regions or paired catchment studies .In many cases, the goal of catchment classification is to be able to identify models or parameter sets that could be applied to similar catchments for predictive purposes. A potential impediment to this goal is the impact of error in both the classification technique and the hydrologic model.\nIn this study, we examine the relationship between catchment classification, hydrologic models, and model parameterizations for the purpose of transferring models between similar catchments. Building on previous work using a data set of over 100 catchments from south-east Australia, we identify several hydrologic model structures and calibrate each model for each catchment. We use clustering to identify groups of catchments with similar hydrologic response (as characterized through the calibrated model parameters). We examine the dependency of the clustered catchment groups on the pre-selected model, the uncertainty in the calibrated model parameters, and the clustering or classification algorithm. Further, we investigate the relationship between the catchment clusters and certain catchment physical characteristics or signatures, which are more typically used for catchment classification. Overall, our work is aimed at elucidating the potential sources of uncertainty in catchment classification, and the utility of classification for improving hydrologic predictions.",

            "abstract": "The U.S. arctic coast extends more than 50,000 km (tidally-influenced, 1:63,360 scale) along the Arctic Ocean (1 active tide station), Beaufort, Bearing and Chukchi Seas (3 stations), and includes the Aleutian Island Chain (5 stations). The best available vector that defines this regulatory, ecological and navigational boundary is a compilation of Mean High Water (MHW) features that have been visually interpreted from satellite or aerial imagery. Despite documented rates of rapid shoreline change in the arctic, the vast linear extent, remoteness, and limited ice-free season create unique challenges in maintaining an updated shoreline vector for the Alaska coast; this is compounded by a lack of high resolution digital elevation models (DEMs) and topography of the sea surface grids to conduct datum-derived shoreline mapping using elevation-intercept techniques widely employed elsewhere. Best-available shoreline positions in arctic Alaska span a wide temporal range with 32% dating from before statehood (1959), 33% from 1960-2010, 16% of unknown age, and only 19% of the total extent has been mapped since 2010. We present a hybrid approach to update shoreline vectors that uses co-registered orthoimagery and DEMs to obtain a local MHW tidal datum approximation by sampling the average elevation along a manually-digitized High Water Line (HWL) segment and applying appropriate corrections for beach slope and local wave climate. This elevation is used to conduct an automated, elevation-based shoreline extraction in the immediate vicinity of the sample and the process is iteratively repeated in segments along the coast. Preliminary results suggest that shoreline vectors derived in this manner are comparable to existing, contemporary MHW vectors (< 4 m horizontal offset in low-grade coastal environments); this technique can accelerate map updates and also produces a more repeatable shoreline position in data-sparse regions that are undergoing rapid change. Furthermore, by exploiting known relationships between HWL and the MHW datum (proxy-datum bias corrections), we can provide tidal to geodetic datum conversion approximations to areas without water level records for use in preliminary inundation modeling and coastal flood decision support.",

Ancient conical stromatolites are primarily carbonate-based whereas the few modern analogues in hot springs are either non-mineralized or mineralized by silica. A team from the 2015 International GeoBiology Course investigated carbonate-rich microbial cones from near Little Hot Creek (LHC), Long Valley Caldera, California, to investigate how conical stromatolites might form in a hot spring carbonate system.\nThe cones are up to 3 cm tall and are found in a calm, ~45° C pool near LHC that is 4 times super-saturated with respect to CaCO3. The cones rise from a flat, layered microbial mat at the edge of the pool. Scanning electron microscopy revealed filamentous bacteria associated with calcite crystals within the cone tips.\nPreliminary 16S rRNA gene analysis indicated variability of community composition between different vertical levels of the cone. The cone tip had comparatively greater abundance of filamentous cyanobacteria (Leptolyngbya and Phormidium) and fewer heterotrophs (e.g. Chloroflexi) compared to the cone bottom. This supports the hypothesis that cone formation may depend on the differential abundance of the microbial community and their potential functional roles.\nMetagenomic analyses of the cones revealed potential genes related to chemotaxis and motility. Specifically, a genomic bin identified as a member of the genus Isosphaera contained an hmp chemotaxis operon implicated in gliding motility in the cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme [1]. Isosphaera is a Planctomycete shown to have phototactic capabilities [2], and may play a role in conjunction with cyanobacteria in the vertical formation of the cones. This analysis of actively growing cones indicates a complex interplay of geochemistry and microbiology that form structures which can serve as models for processes that occurred in the past and are preserved in the rock record.\n",

            "abstract": "Oxygen isotope values from diatom silica have been used to determine past hydrological conditions in a variety of settings including differentiating summer monsoonal paleoprecipitation from winter frontal paleoprecipitation in the American southwest. Lacustrine cores from the Valles Caldera, New Mexico, show a distinct change in silica oxygen isotope values from glacial to interglacial as a switch from a purely winter frontal precipitation during the glacial to a mix of winter frontal and summer monsoonal precipitation during the interglacial. A relatively large (ca. 20‰) and rapid increase in δ18O following the glacial termination implies an abrupt onset of the North American monsoon. We plan to elaborate on this research to see if this is true elsewhere in the southwest.\nTwo lacustrine sediment cores (70 m deep and 30 m deep respectively) were recovered from Stoneman Lake, northern Arizona in October of 2014. With these cores we plan to determine regional hydroclimate variability between the Pleistocene-Holocene glacial transition ca. 14 ka. Oxygen isotope analysis from diatom silica will allow us to determine past sources of precipitation to the basin (Gulf of Mexico vs North Pacific), and paleoprecipitation variability. In conjunction with other proxies, we can determine if the onset of paleomonsoonal precipitation in central Arizona occurs immediately after the glacial termination as in NM, or if there is some component of monsoonal precipitation during the late glacial period. Diatom sampling was performed at approximately every 50 cm. To purify the diatoms, the samples are chemically and physically separated. The step wise fluorination and laser ablation technique are then applied to remove water & hydroxyl groups and to extract O2 & SiF4 respectively.\nIf results from the Stoneman Lake core are similar to that of the Valles Caldera core, we should expect to see a nearly 20‰ increase in δ18Olake water. This would suggest a: 1) collapse of the summer monsoon in this region, 2) southward shift of the southern polar front jet stream, 3) low ratio of evaporation compared to total water outflow from the lake. By collecting data from this lacustrine sediment, we will be able to better reconstruct atmospheric paleocirculation patterns of the southwestern United States.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen (N) availability is an important factor controlling productivity and thus carbon cycling in estuaries. The fate of N in estuaries depends on the activities of the microbes that carry out the N-cycle, which in turn depend on factors such as organic matter availability, dissolved inorganic N, salinity, oxygen, and temperature. Key microbial N transformations include nitrification (the aerobic oxidation of ammonia to nitrite and nitrate) and denitrification (the anaerobic reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen gas). While denitrification leads to N loss, nitrification is the only link between reduced N (produced by decomposition) and oxidized N (substrates for N loss processes), and both processes are known to produce nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas. Understanding controls of N-cycling in the San Francisco Bay-Delta (SFBD)—the largest estuary on the west coast of North America—is particularly important, as this urban estuary is massively polluted with N, even compared to classic “eutrophic” systems. Interestingly, the SFBD has been spared the detrimental consequences of nutrient enrichment, largely due to high suspended sediment concentrations (and thus low light penetration) throughout the water column, combined with high grazing pressure. However, the recent “clearing” of SFBD waters due to a sharp decrease in suspended sediments may significantly alter the ecology of the estuary, by increasing phytoplankton growth. Thus, the SFBD may be losing its historical resilience to eutrophication, and may soon be “high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll” no more. Elucidating the environmental factors affecting the community structure, activity, and functioning of N-cycling microbes in SFBD is crucial for determining how changes in turbidity and productivity will be propagated throughout the ecosystem. While substantial ecological research in the SFBD has focused on phytoplankton and food webs, bacterial and archaeal communities have received far less attention. Using a combination of molecular, biogeochemical, and ‘omics’ approaches, we have been examining how N-cycling microbial communities throughout the SFBD change in relation to environmental fluctuations—a critical step in understanding how microbial populations drive biogeochemical cycling in this estuary.",

            "abstract": "The composition of hydrogen and oxygen isotopes in rainwater (measured as δ18O and δD) provides vital information about current hydrological dynamics, and forms the basis for many paleoclimate reconstructions of hydroclimate variability. However, many factors – both local and remote – govern water isotope fractionation, complicating the interpretation of water isotope records. While Raleigh distillation serves as a key first-order driver of the well-noted “amount effect”, post-condensation evaporative processes are an important influence on intra-event isotope variations (e.g. Moerman, et al. 2013). To further resolve the processes driving this variability, rainwater isotopes from Gunung Mulu National Park in northern Borneo (4°N, 115 °E) were analyzed at one-minute intervals across nine rain events in 2012. To assess the influence of large-scale, remote fractionation processes versus those that act locally, our intra-event time series was compared to daily-resolved isotope records over the same time interval. We quantify a large range of water isotopic compositions over the sampling period (-13.1‰ to 0.2‰ in δ18O and -88.3‰ to -1.2‰ in δD). There is appreciable evidence for evaporative enrichment at our site, with δ18O vs. δD slopes significantly less than eight – the slope of the Global Meteoric Water Line. Large differences in the shape of the intra-event profile, ranging from monotonically increasing to “V-shaped” (e.g. Celle-Jeanton, et al. 2004) to monotonically decreasing isotopic values indicate that different precipitation regimes have a profound impact on water isotope evolution through a precipitation event. As such, we use a suite of meteorological data including in-situ observations, satellite imagery, model reanalysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and NOAA HYSPLIT water vapor back-trajectories to provide an interpretive framework for the observed intra-event isotopic variability. Our study demonstrates the utility of investigating the relationships between small-scale, local rainwater isotopic compositions and large-scale regional weather and climate patterns for resolving key dynamical processes driving tropical convection, in both the present and the past.",

The average heat flow is ~70 mW/m2 (50 mW/m2 is expected for the plate age), and small-scale (2 to 3 km) variations, whose peak value is >100 mW/m2, are embedded. In the area of high heat flow, a high Vp/Vs layer in the oceanic crust has been detected [Fujie et al., 2013]. The layer thickness is increased toward the trench axis. Fujie et al.[2013] interpreted this layer as a result of fracturing due to bending of the subducting plate. This layer may work as an aquifer in which heat is transported by fluid circulation.\nIn a previous study [Kawada et al., 2014], we constructed a model for aquifer thickening in order to explain the observed anomalous heat flow: a 500-m-thick aquifer 150 km seaward of the trench axis is gradually thickened to 3000 m toward the trench axis. We found that hydrothermal circulation within the thickening aquifer mines heat beneath its underlying part, and heat flow is elevated accordingly. Although the model can explain the observed high heat flow in an average sense, the origin of the small-scale heat flow variations remains to be solved.\nThis study expands the previous model by incorporating abrupt thickening of the aquifer to account for the small-scale heat flow. Typically, we consider a situation in which a permeable slot of 2000 m wide and 3000 m deep suddenly appears. This model results in a high heat flow peak of 100 mW/m2 above the permeable slot, which persists over hundreds of thousand years. Heat outside the slot is transported horizontally toward the slot by thermal conduction and then is transported vertically due to hydrothermal circulation within the slot. Because the volume of the permeable slot is smaller than its surrounding region, high heat flow above the slot lasts for a long time.",

            "abstract": "Ecotones – transitions between different biomes - often support greater faunal diversity than the adjacent ecological systems. For subseafloor microorganisms, defined geological and chemical gradients have been shown to affect population sizes and community structure, but the role that sediment interfaces play is still unclear. Here, we test the hypothesis that zones of transition between two distinct sediment types increase microbial diversity and change community composition. Concurrently, we explore those factors that drive deep-subsurface microbial community structure (e.g., depth, interstitial water chemistry, methane concentrations, clay content). Samples from IODP Expedition 349 - South China Sea Tectonics – had interfaces of either ash/clay or turbidite/clay boundaries sampled , DNA extracted, and the 16S rRNA gene analyzed on an Illumina MiSeq platform. Initial analyses reveal that microbial communities in sediment samples are distinct from communities in drilling fluid, indicating that contamination is unlikely. In four of the eight complete interfaces currently analyzed we found an increase in diversity (based on the chao1 index), in certain cases doubling the diversity of the adjacent rock types. The pattern was not uniform across all interfaces. While some posit that ecotones provide a mixing of the two adjacent communities, we were surprised to find an abundance (mean = 392 OTUs) of unique microbial taxa within the ecotone itself when compared to adjacent sediment (mean=282 unique OTUs). Thus while diversity was not uniformly increased in ecotones, the interface led to divergent microbial communities that were not simply mixtures of those adjacent. We will discuss the ability of abiotic factors in explaining the among ecotone variance that we observed. Our investigation helps to characterize the factors that drive microbial community structure of the subseafloor while highlighting the need to focus on habitat heterogeneity at a scale pertinent to bacteria and archaea in studies of microbial ecology.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Courtland Creek AGU Poster 2015 FINAL.pdf\nCourtland Creek is a channelized stream that traverses residential and industrial sections of East Oakland, California. Segments of the creek are exposed on the surface and have been designated as City of Oakland park land. Since 2012, the quality of creek waters has been monitored through measurement and analysis of nutrient and other possible contaminant levels in samples collected in these exposed segments. Throughout the three-year period during which monitoring efforts have been undertaken, high concentration levels of nitrate have been observed. The primary aim of our research is to gain an overall indication of creek health in relation to its surrounding environment through the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) analysis of nutrient concentrations at the four sites. Investigating the relationship between Courtland Creek and the environmental factors influencing its health will enable us to develop a better sense of the actions that can be taken by the City of Oakland to create sustainable park land and healthy communities. During the summer of 2015, our group continued to monitor levels of ammonia, phosphate and nitrate at four different sites along the creek, and benthic macroinvertebrates were sampled at one of these sites. Preliminary analysis of benthic macroinvertebrate data indicates that Courtland Creek is in poor health ecologically. Nitrate concentration levels measured during the study period were lower than those detected in previous years but still indicate inputs other than those associated with natural processes. The high nitrate concentration levels may be the result of human and animal waste pollution, as supported by data obtained during a recent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) - led E. coli survey that included the watershed within which Courtland Creek is situated.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater contamination associated with remediated uranium mill tailings is a challenging environmental problem, particularly within the Colorado River Basin. To examine the effectiveness of in-situ bioremediation of U(VI), acetate injection has been proposed and tested at the Rifle pilot site. There have been several geologic modeling and simulated contaminant transport investigations, to evaluate the potential outcomes of the process and identify crucial factors for successful uranium reduction. Ultimately, findings from these studies would contribute to accurate predictions of the efficacy of uranium reduction. However, all these previous studies have considered limited model complexities, either because of the concern that data is too sparse to resolve such complex systems or because some parameters are assumed to be less important. Such simplified initial modeling, however, limits the predictive power of the model. Moreover, previous studies have not yet focused on spatial heterogeneity of various modeling components and its impact on the spatial distribution of the immobilized uranium (U(IV)). In this study, we study the impact of uncertainty on 21 parameters on model responses by means of recently developed distance-based global sensitivity analysis (DGSA), to study the main effects and interactions of parameters of various types. The 21 parameters include, for example, spatial variability of initial uranium concentration, mean hydraulic conductivity, and variogram structures of hydraulic conductivity. DGSA allows for studying multi-variate model responses based on spatial and non-spatial model parameters. When calculating the distances between model responses, in addition to the overall uranium reduction efficacy, we also considered the spatial profiles of the immobilized uranium concentration as target response. Results show that the mean hydraulic conductivity and the mineral reaction rate are the two most sensitive parameters with regard to the overall uranium reduction. But in terms of spatial distribution of immobilized uranium, initial conditions of uranium concentration and spatial uncertainty in hydraulic conductivity also become important. These analyses serve as the first step of further prediction practices of the complex uranium transport and reaction systems.",

Snow and firn densities are needed to convert satellite- and airborne-derived snow thickness changes into surface mass changes. Moreover, density directly impacts SMB by influencing the amount of liquid water that can be stored in firn and snow at the ice sheet surface. Using recently updated density profiles from the SUMup community dataset, we examine spatial and temporal variations in measured densities over the GrIS and AIS, and evaluate modeled profiles from the Modèle Atmosphérique Régionale (MAR) RCM and the firn model of the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO2). The MAR model tends to underestimate densities in the first meter of the snowpack over both ice sheets, although the biases are spatially variable. We provide results regarding the relationship between modeled biases and parameters such as the time and location of the sample profile, and climatology at the profile location. We also explore whether recent increases in surface air temperature and melting over the Greenland ice have led to changes in simulated density profiles.",

            "abstract": "Inland waters emit a substantial amount of CO2 every year, most recent syntheses estimate (Raymond et al. 2013, IPCC 2013). However, eutrophic water bodies, which constitute the majority of inland waters, are underrepresented in these syntheses and may absorb rather than emit CO2 because of their high productivity (Balmer and Downing 2011, Pacheco et al. 2013). We did a survey of 19 urban and peri-urban lakes in India across a wide range of climates and with varying levels of eutrophication to get a snapshot of lake air-water CO2 exchange. A majority of the lakes (12 out of 19) were undersaturated with CO2 during daytime. Surface water pCO2 varied from 26 to 4600 ppm. Using estimates of gas transfer velocity from two different methods, we found the average daytime flux of CO2 in these lakes to vary from -3.11 mg C m-2d-1 to 36 mg C m-2 d-1.\nWeighted-averages of pCO2 and flux using lake area were 692 ppm and 2.33 mg C m-2 d-1, respectively. However, these values were dominated by one large coastal lake that was saturated with CO2. The other 18 lakes yielded averages pCO2 and flux of 282 ppm and -0.65 mg C m-2 d-1.\nEutrophication is one the biggest contemporary threats to the global freshwater supply, and is particularly severe in developing countries. This study, despite its limited scope, provides strong support to the fact that eutrophic lakes may act as CO2 sinks rather than sources. Follow-up studies on the diurnal and seasonal pCO2 trends and the metabolic characteristics of these lakes will reveal the determinants of their carbon metabolism.",

            "abstract": "Inundated vegetation and open water bodies are common features across the landscape and exert major impacts on hydrologic processes and surface-atmosphere carbon exchange. Their carbon emissions can have a large impact on global climate. It is therefore of great importance to assess their spatial extent and temporal variations in order to improve upon carbon balance estimates. Despite their importance in the global cycling of carbon and water and climate forecasting, they remain poorly characterized and modeled, primarily because of the scarcity of suitable regional-to-global remote sensing data for characterizing wetlands distribution and dynamics. Spaceborne microwave sensors are an effective tool for characterizing these ecosystems since they are sensitive to surface water and vegetation structure, and they can monitor large areas on a temporal basis regardless of atmospheric conditions or solar illumination. Optical sensors however provide much higher spatial resolution as well as information on water color.\nWe developed a methodology using data from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array L-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) to map wetland ecosystems at 100 meter resolution for target regions as well as SMAP radar data at 1 km resolution. We also used optical data from Landsat to map open water bodies and their color properties at 15 meter resolution. Inundation dynamics of these ecosystems was assessed using a coarser resolution, 25 km microwave product on surface water fraction, which was derived using combined active and passive microwave data from QuikSCAT and AMSR-E on a weekly basis. We compare information content and accuracy of the coarse resolution products to the PALSAR, SMAP and Landsat based datasets to ensure information harmonization. The combination of high and low resolution datasets will allow for characterization of wetlands and open water bodies and assessment of their flooding status.\nThis work has been undertaken partly within the framework of the JAXA ALOS Kyoto & Carbon Initiative. PALSAR data have been provided by JAXA/EORC. Portions of this work were carried out at City University of New York and JPL, Caltech, under contract with NASA.",

Streamlines are an effective method for visualization of flow, and they can be designed to clearly show the dynamic behavior of a fluidic system. We employ vector field editing and extraction software to examine the topology of velocity vector fields generated by a 3D global circulation model coupled to a one-layer atmosphere model simulating preindustrial and last glacial maximum (LGM) conditions. This results in a streamline-based visualization along multiple density isosurfaces on which we visualize points of vertical exchange and the distribution of properties such as temperature and biogeochemical tracers. Previous work involving this model examined the change in the energetics driving overturning circulation and mixing between simulations of LGM and preindustrial conditions. This visualization elucidates the relationship between locations of vertical exchange and mixing, as well as demonstrates the effects of circulation and mixing on the distribution of tracers such as carbon isotopes.",

Moreover, it contains appreciable U and Th, making it an ideal mineral for determining U-Th-Pb ages and Sm-Nd isotopic compositions, both of which are readily determined using in situ techniques with very high spatial resolution like LA-MC-ICPMS. Here, we present the results of laser ablation split stream analyses (LASS), which allows for simultaneous determination of the age and initial Nd isotopic composition in a single analysis. Analyses were done using a 20mm laser spot that allowed for detailed Nd isotope mapping of monazite grains (~30 analyses per ~250mm sized grain). Combined with LREE ratios (e.g., Sm/Nd, Ce/Gd, and Eu anomalies) these results yield important petrogenetic constraints on the evolution of peraluminous granites from the Old Woman-Piute batholith in southeastern California. Our findings also allow an improved understanding of the causes of isotope heterogeneity in granitic rocks.\nU-Th-Pb age mapping across the crystals reveals a single Cretaceous age for all grains with precision and accuracy typical of laser ablation analyses (~2%). In contrast, the concurrent Nd isotope mapping yields homogeneous initial Nd isotope compositions for some grains and large initial intra-grain variations of up to 8 epsilon units in others. The grains that yield homogeneous Nd isotope compositions have REE ratios suggesting that they crystallized in a fractionally crystallizing magma. Conversely, other grains, which also record fractional crystallization of both feldspar and LREE rich minerals, demonstrate a change in the Nd isotope composition of the magma during crystallization of monazite. Comparison of inter- and intra-grain Nd isotope compositions reveals further details on the potential mechanisms responsible for isotope heterogeneity present in single rock samples. This method highlights the potential of single grain isotope mapping of LREE phases such as monazite, allanite, and titanite for understanding both igneous and metamorphic petrogenesis.",

In order for this knowledge to be applicable to the monitoring of near-surface pollution from satellites, further analysis must be undertaken to understand variability in this relationship as the length of the vertical column is changed (for example, is the correlation still evident if we use total tropospheric columns?). Proposed analysis will use in-situ measurements of HCHO and O3 collected onboard the NASA P-3B and varying column depths to investigate this trend. This will necessitate an accurate approximation of the boundary layer height, as nearly all of the HCHO vertical column is contained therein. VOCs measured at surface sites during the California and Colorado employments will be used to analyze the contribution of different emissions sources over these study regions, which may provide valuable insight into variabilities into the HCHO/O3 column relationship. Furthermore, surface measurements of HCHO were taken at one site in Colorado, and will be used to analyze variability in the surface-column relationship for HCHO. An accurate understanding of the variabilities in these trends (i.e. the relationship between HCHO and O3 columns, the relationship between column densities and the contribution of different emission sources, and the surface-column relationship for HCHO) in the four DISCOVER-AQ study regions (Maryland, Houston, California, and Colorado) will provide insight into how effective HCHO could potentially be in understanding surface pollution during different seasons and under different atmospheric composition regimes.",

Turbulence can change the rate at which particles escape the mixed layer but mechanisms and magnitude of effects are not well understood for aquatic particles. Here we use a 3-pronged approach to study turbulence affects on sedimentation rates of non-spherical, marine-like particles. First, we apply an orientation-based kinematic model to track particles through turbulent flow. We then use a complex numerical model that solves the dynamical equation of motion for non-spherical particles embedded in turbulent flow. Finally we use a novel 3D particle-tracking tool to measure trajectories of diatoms in a turbulent flow and test predictions from numerical models. At the time of writing, preliminary results from numerical simulations indicate turbulent-altered settling for elongated (rod-shaped) particles at size, mass, and shapes similar to those measured for marine phytoplankton.",

            "abstract": "Terrestrial sediments are an important global reservoir for methane. Microorganisms in the deep subsurface play a critical role in the methane cycle, yet much remains to be learned about their diversity and metabolisms. To provide more comprehensive insight into the microbiology of the methane cycle in the deep subsurface, we conducted a genome-resolved study of samples collected from the Horonobe Underground Research Laboratory (HURL), Japan. Groundwater samples were obtained from three boreholes from a depth range of between 140 m and 250 m in two consecutive years. Groundwater was filtered and metagenomic DNA extracted and sequenced, and the sequence data assembled. Based on the sequences of phylogenetically informative genes on the assembled fragments, we detected a high degree of overlap in community composition across a vertical transect within one borehole at the two sampling times. However, there was comparatively little similarity observed among communities across boreholes. Spatial and temporal abundance patterns were used in combination with tetranucleotide signatures of assembled genome fragments to bin the data and reconstruct over 200 unique draft genomes, of which 137 are considered to be of high quality (>90% complete). The deepest samples from one borehole were highly dominated by an archaeon identified as ANME-2D; this organism was also present at lower abundance in all other samples from that borehole. Also abundant in these microbial communities were novel members of the Gammaproteobacteria, Saccharibacteria (TM7) and Tenericute phyla. Notably, a ~2 Mbp draft genome for the ANME-2D archaeon was reconstructed. As expected, the genome encodes all of the genes predicted to be involved in the reverse methanogenesis pathway. In contrast with the previously reported ANME2-D genome, the HURL ANME-2D genome lacks the capacity to reduce nitrate. However, we identified many multiheme cytochromes with closest similarity to those of the known Fe-reducing/oxidizing archaeon Ferroglobus placidus. Thus, we suggest that ANME2-D may couple methane oxidation to reduction of ferric iron minerals in the sediment and may be generally important as a link between the iron and methane cycles in deep subsurface environments. Such information has important implications for modeling the global carbon cycle.",

Current measurement techniques typically characterize CCN activation efficiency in terms of the single parameter hygroscopicity coefficient, κ, but these techniques do not account for how the chemical heterogeneity of marine aerosol particles translates to corresponding differences in their hygroscopicity. Here, we describe a methodology for assessing the distribution of super saturated hygroscopicities within the same aerosol population, in terms of a “κ basis set” analysis, and apply that methodology to model aerosol mixtures with prescribed mixing states. Moreover, the generalizability of this new analysis allows for application to hygroscopicity data sets that have been previously collected, as well as those outside of the marine environment. Development and application of the κ basis set analysis will be discussed.",

Northward (EC <1000 µS/cm, high HCO3- concentration, δ13C-depleted, δ18O/δ2H-enriched, and 14C ≥ 70 pMC) and southward (EC >6000 µS/cm, low HCO3- concentration, δ13C-enriched, δ18O/δ2H-depleted, and 14C ≤ 42 pMC) spatial changes in chemical and isotopic compositions of groundwater in the Quaternary aquifer are attributed to the contributions of the Ismailia canal in the north and the groundwater of the Miocene aquifer in the south, respectively. Temporal changes of isotopic composition of the Nile water in response to the construction of the Aswan High Dam are also detected and the information is used to evaluate the groundwater recharge processes from the Ismailia canal. Current contribution from the Ismailia canal (25%) is considered to be greatly enhanced through surface water diversion and related irrigation practices, i.e., freshwater ponds. Contribution of the groundwater from the Miocene aquifer was also detected locally, and it was thought to be related to the excessive pumping. Increase in nitrate concentrations, change in the stable isotopic composition of groundwater from wells adjacent to wastewater ponds, along with the information obtained from the analysis of city water balance and recent geophysical data show that local recharge from wastewater ponds (4%) occurs to the Quaternary aquifer system. The results are expected to be helpful for formulating appropriate protection and sustainable water management strategies.",

The ultimate goal of this national project is to increase the percentage of renewable energy (ex. geothermal energy) to generate electricity. An integrated team which consists of various specialties are held together to investigate I-Lan area comprehensively. For example, I-Lan geological data, petrophysical analysis, seismicity, temperature gradient and distribution, hydrology, geochemistry, and heat source study etc. The geothermal gradient measured at one drilling well (1200m deep) is up to 50˚C/km and the prediction of temperature based on fluid inclusion analysis could be up to 300˚C. The geothermal reservoir is expected to occur at a fractured geological formation, Siling sandstone layer.\nA 3D subsurface geological model is built mainly based on the seismic exploration of the subsurface structure and well log data. According to the current conceptual model, the target area is bounded by two main faults, Jiaosi and Choshui faults. The preliminary results from all the investigations are integrated and used as input parameters to create a realistic numerical reservoir model. Numerical simulator TOUGH2 is used to study the geothermal energy potential. The initial state of temperature distribution is simulated and compared to the high resolution of magnetotelluric (MT) data. Simulation results show that they have similar pattern and therefore the prediction of geothermal potential in this area would be more reliable. Based on the realistic initial state, sensitivity studies are performed to investigate effects of relevant parameters on temperature distribution.",

Because a large flux of CO2 is constantly assimilated into the world’s forests via photosynthesis, cutting off its return pathway to the atmosphere forms an effective carbon sink. The live trees serve as a ‘carbon scrubber’ or ‘carbon remover’ that provides continuous sequestration (negative emissions). The stored wood is a semi-permanent carbon sink, but also serves as a ‘biomass/bioenergy reserve’ that could be utilized in the future. We discuss the particular relevance of this strategy to the Amazon which is under the double threat of climate change and deforestation. As an alternative to REDD, we propose mixed-use of peripheral Amazon basin while keeping the core of the Amazon intact. We argue that this may be a more practical solution in light of the likely climate change impact and human activities.",

Pam caused the worst natural disaster in Vanuatu’s recorded history since severe tropical cyclone Uma in 1987. Eleven fatalities were directly attributed to cyclone Pam and mostly due to lack of shelter from airborne debris. On March 6 Pam formed east of the Santa Cruz Islands and intensified while tracking southward along Vanuatu severely affecting the Shefa and Tafea Provinces. An international storm surge reconnaissance team was deployed to Vanuatu from June 3 to 17, 2015 to complement earlier local surveys. Cyclone Pam struck a remote island archipelago particularly vulnerable to the combined cyclonic multi-hazards encompassing extreme wind gusts, massive rainfall and coastal flooding due to a combination of storm surge and storm wave impacts. The team surveyed coastal villages on Epi, the Shepherd Islands (Tongoa and Mataso), Efate (including Lelepa), Erromango, and Tanna. The survey spanned 320 km parallel to the cyclone track between Epi and Tanna encompassing more than 45 sites including the hardest hit settlements. Coastal flooding profiles were surveyed from the shoreline to the limit of inundation. Maximum coastal flood elevations and overland flow depths were measured based on water marks on buildings, scars on trees, rafted debris and corroborated with eyewitness accounts. We surveyed 91 high water marks with characteristic coastal flood levels in the 3 to 7 m range and composed of storm surge with superimposed storm waves. Inundation distances were mostly limited to a few hundred meters. Coral boulders of more than 1 m diameter were measured on Erromango and sediment samples were collected at key sites across the archipelago. Infrastructure damage on traditional and modern structures was assessed. Eyewitnesses were interviewed at most sites to document the chronology of the wind and coastal flooding events, survival strategies, cyclone and tsunami awareness, evacuation procedures, shelter locations and ancestral knowledge. The measured cyclone Pam high water marks will facilitate the interpretation of the collected sedimentary evidence and serve as benchmarks for modeling studies.",

During early stage of testing EEW systems from 2011 to 2013, we adapted ElarmS by UC Berkeley BSL to Korean seismic network and applied very simple criteria for event alerting with the combination of the numbers of station and magnitude. As a result of the testing we found out that the real-time test result of Earthquake Early Warning (EEW) system in Korea showed that all events located within seismic network with bigger than magnitude 3.0 were well detected. However, two events located at sea between land and island gave false results with magnitude over 4.0 related to the teleseismic waves and one event located in land gave false results with magnitude over 3.0 related to the teleseismic waves. These teleseismic-relevant false events were caused by logical co-relation during association procedure and the corresponding geometric distribution of associated stations is crescent-shaped. Seismic stations are not deployed uniformly, so the expected bias ratio varies with evaluated epicentral location. This ratio is calculated in advance and stored into database, called as TrigDB, for the discrimination of teleseismic-origin false alarm. We developed a method, so called ‘TrigDB back filling’, updating location with supplementary association of stations comparing triggered times between sandwiched stations which was not associated previously based on predefined criteria such as travel-time. Because EEW program assume that all events are local, teleseismic-relevant events can give more triggered stations by using back filling of the unassociated stations than the normal association. And we also developed a travel time curve (K-SEIS-1DTT2015) to reduce split event for EEWS. After applying the K-SEIS-1DTT2015 model, these teleseismic-relevant false events are reduced. As a result of these methods we could get more reliable location.",

            "abstract": "Fire is a major mediator of carbon (C) cycling in forests and can result in the formation of pyrogenic organic matter (PyOM). The biological reactivity of PyOM is largely dependent upon the physiochemical characteristics of source material and production temperature. As a result, PyOM can persist up to centennial time scales after deposition while simultaneously enhancing or suppressing the mineralization of native soil C (NSC).\nTo investigate the interactive effects of PyOM source and production temperature on NSC, we added 13C-enriched red maple (RM) or jack pine (JP) pyrolyzed at 200, 300, 450 or 600°C to a low C (0.5%;), near-surface soil (0–20 cm-depth) at 60% water holding capacity and 11% of native soil C and then incubated the samples in the dark at 25⁰C for 6 months.\nWe found that PyOM mineralization rates decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature for either species while NSC mineralization was suppressed across all treatments with the largest decrease observed in JP 300⁰C. RM mineralization rates were consistently greater (∼5 to ∼25%) than for JP <600⁰C during the first 17 days. Mean residence time (MRT) of PyOM-C was significantly higher in PyOM >300°C resulting in MRT of ~300 – 550 y compared to 8–30 y in lower temperature PyOM (0-300 °C). RM exhibited significantly lower MRT in 300°C PyOM than JP corresponding to differences observed in PyOM and NSC mineralization rates. The modelled active and slow pools of PyOM-C mineralized decreased with increasing combustion temperature. JP 300°C had a 20% smaller active pool when compared to RM suggesting that for both species, 300⁰C - 450⁰C represented a thermal transition point which was most evident in jack pine.\nThese results highlight how differences in PyOM physiochemical characteristics linked to a species thermal transformation threshold may be a predictor in determining its biological reactivity in soil.",

            "abstract": "The region of the Earth’s magnetosphere tailward of ~30 RE remains relatively unexplored. A better characterization of the processes taking place in the mid-to-distant magnetotail is critical to a more complete understanding of the coupling between the solar wind and the Earth’s magnetosphere. Similarly, an assessment of the magnetotail plasma encountered by the Moon will be valuable for understanding how the lunar environment is modified during these traversals. The THEMIS/ARTEMIS missions have returned sufficient data from this region of the magnetotail for a large-scale statistical survey to be undertaken with the publicly available data from NASA/CDAWeb. In this study various plasma moments are organized by occurrence frequency and location in the magnetotail. Further sorting is done to identify different regions within the magnetotail, such as the tail lobes and plasma sheet, and the physical processes taking place, such as reconnection. Additional sorting of the ion data has been required in order to identify intervals in the tail lobe where the signal-to-noise is so low that moments are erroneously calculated from just background counts. Initial results indicate that previous studies of the mid-to-distant magnetotail that were limited to using electron moments from the ISEE-3 mission overestimated Alfven Mach numbers. Super-Alfvenic flows, such as those associated with reconnection, are very rare in this region of the magnetotail. This survey is the first step in constructing a comprehensive large-scale picture of the energization, distribution, and transport of plasma in the mid-to-distant magnetotail, as well as characterizing the properties of the plasma environments encountered by the Moon during magnetotail traversals.",

Concentrations of CO and the number of particles were measured as well.\nTo analyze the aerosol’s spatial and vertical characteristics, 5 flight paths were designed and the main paths were a cross over above SMA and spatial and vertical profile paths over the Yellow Sea. The flight distance varied from 600 to 900km and the velocity was kept at around 200 to 250 km/hr.\nOn June 13 2015, the sky in SMA was densely fogged and the PM concentrations were relatively higher than usual.

            "abstract": "A major driver of soil formation is the colonization and transformation of rock by plants and associated microbiota. In turn, substrate chemical composition can also influence the capacity for plant colonization and development. In order to better define these relationships, a mesocosm study was set up to analyze the effect mycorrhizal fungi, plant density and rock have on root development, and to determine the effect of root morphology on weathering and soil formation. We hypothesized that plant-plant and plant-fungi interactions have a stronger influence on root architecture and rock weathering than the substrate composition alone.\nBuffalo grass (Bouteloua dactyloides) was grown in a controlled environment in columns filled with either granular granite, schist, rhyolite or basalt. Each substrate was given two different treatments, including grass-microbes and grass-microbes-mycorrhizae and incubated for 120, 240, and 480 days. Columns were then extracted and analyzed for root morphology, fine fraction, and pore water major element content.\nPreliminary results showed that plants produced more biomass in rhyolite, followed by schist, basalt, and granite, indicating that substrate composition is an important driver of root development. In support of our hypothesis, mycorrhizae was a strong driver of root development by stimulating length growth, biomass production, and branching. However, average root length and branching also appeared to decrease in response to high plant density, though this trend was only present among roots with mycorrhizal fungi. Interestingly, fine fraction production was negatively correlated with average root thickness and volume. There is also slight evidence indicating that fine fraction production is more related to substrate composition than root morphology, though this data needs to be further analyzed. Our hope is that the results of this study can one day be applied to agricultural research in order to promote the production of crops on traditionally un-arable land.",

            "abstract": "GRACE data has detected regional-scale coseismic and postseismic gravity changes after recent great earthquakes, including 2004 Mw9.2 Sumatra-Andaman, 2005 Mw8.5 Nias, 2007 Mw8.5 Bengkulu, 2010 Mw8.8 Maule, 2011 Mw9.0 Tohoku-Oki, 2012 Mw8.6 Wharton Basin (Indian Ocean), and 2013 Mw8.3 Okhotsk earthquakes. Those earthquakes caused abrupt gravity field changes and triggered gradual postseismic adjustment that are expected to continue for years to decades due to viscoelastic relaxation. Significant postseismic gravity changes were recorded in GRACE not only for megathrust ruptures (as large as Mw9.2), but also for non-megathrust earthquakes (as small as Mw8.1) with very different mechanisms and properties, such as strike-slip earthquakes (not causing large vertical motion, e.g., 2012 Wharton Basin earthquake) and normal faulting events (e.g., 2007 Kuril earthquake). The cumulative postseismic gravity change can be even larger than the coseismic change depending on the rupture mechanism and the Earth’s rheological structure around the region. The results from the newest GRACE Release-05 (RL05) Level-2 (L2) solutions found that the combined coseismic gravimetric signal from Mw8.3 Kuril thrust and Mw8.1 normal faulting events (doublet) was small but it produced substantial postseismic gravity change. Our preliminary results are consistent with the prominent influence of a biviscous asthenosphere underlying a thin elastic lithosphere in the Kuril trench.\nNow we have a unique opportunity to examine various types of earthquakes at time-scales from months to decades comprehensively using nearly 14 years of continuous gravity measurements from GRACE and to be extended for another decade or longer by GRACE-FO. In this presentation, we review the GRACE observations of postseismic gravity changes from those earthquakes and provide the numerical modelling results of gravity change anticipated from viscoelastic relaxation. By optimizing the model parameters, we will show the regional variability in the rheological structures along the plate boundaries.\nOur study will be indispensable not only for advancing earthquake physics but also for enabling climate investigations relying on GRACE data free of tectonic signals. We will discuss our progress to provide the optimized physical models of co- and post-seismic gravity changes to the GRACE Project and the broader science community for “earthquake corrections” to L1B and L2 data (just like “Atmosphere and Ocean De-aliasing”, AOD products) to improve quantification of secular trends of ocean, cryosphere, and hydrological mass transport from GRACE measurements.",

Such changes have forced the local water supply systems to update their water supply plans once in five years. Developments of such water supply plans not only require reliable assessment of water availability and demands but also incorporate uncertainties due to regional climate change projections.\nIn this study, we focus our analysis on one of the basins in the South Texas – Nueces River Basin (NRB) which provide inflows to the Choke Canyon - Lake Corpus Christi reservoir system. This reservoir system is the major freshwater source for the coastal communities in the basin and the Nueces Bay, which serve as a habitat for several key fish species such as blue crab, brown shrimp, and southern flounder. Freshwater inflows in the NRB have decreased in the past decades, resulting in increased salinity of the Nueces Bay, thus impacting the natural habitat for several fish species. Therefore, estimating the impacts of climate change in the NRB is critical to develop sustainable water resources management in the region. We will implement a physically based hydrologic model under historical climate change scenarios from multiple General Circulation Models (GCMs) over the past 30 years to understand how well we could have used large scale climate change projections in improving water resources management over the overlapping observations. A water management model will be developed for the Choke Canyon – Lake Corpus Christi Reservoir System, which will be ingested with inflow projections under multiple GCM scenarios over the past 30 years to incorporate uncertainty in water resources management. Finally, water management scenarios will be developed to minimize deficits between water availability and demands in the region.",

The procedure determines the relaxation time distribution (RTD) and two frequency-independent parameters that modulate the induced polarization spectra. The distribution of relaxation times quantifies the contribution of each distinct relaxation process, which can in turn be associated with specific polarization processes and characterized in terms of electrochemical and interfacial parameters as derived from mechanistic models. Synthetic tests show that the procedure can successfully fit spectral induced polarization (SIP) data and accurately recover the RTD. The procedure was applied to different data sets, focusing on environmental applications. We focus on data of sand-clay mixtures artificially contaminated with toluene, and crude oil-contaminated sands experiencing biodegradation. The results identify characteristic relaxation times that can be associated with distinct polarization processes resulting from either the contaminant itself or transformations associated with biodegradation. The inversion results provide information regarding the relative strength and dominant relaxation time of these polarization processes.",

The target asteroid is (162173) 1999 JU3, a C-type, small Near Earth Asteroid. The principal purpose of Hayabusa2 is to study the origin and evolution of the solar system, especially the origin of organic matters and waters on the earth.\nHayabusa2 will arrive at 1999 JU3 in June or July 2018, stay there for about one and half years, leave there at the end of 2019, and come back to the earth at the end of 2020. The main mission is the sample return, taking the surface materials of 1999 JU3 and bringing them back to the earth. We will try to get the samples not only from the surface but also from the subsurface by creating a small crater on the surface of the asteroid (see the figure).\nHayabusa2 has remote sensing instruments as follows: Optical Navigation Cameras (ONC-T/W1/W2), Near Infrared Spectrometer (NIRS3), Thermal Infrared Imager (TIR), and Laser Altimeter (LIDAR). It has also three small rovers (MINERVA-II-1A/1B/2), and one small lander (MASCOT), which was provided by DLR and CNES. Small Carry-on Impactor (SCI) is used to create a small crater and the impact event is observed by a deployable camera (DCAM3). Thus we can use a wide variety of data to study this C-type asteroid. And of course, we will analyze the samples in detail after the capsule of Hayabusa2 comes back to the earth.\nFor the science researches, we have Hayabusa2 science team in Japan. As for the international science discussions we organized Hayabusa2 Joint Science Team (HJST). HJST is presently consists of Japanese science members and European members who are mostly related MASCOT. We had four general meetings up to now. In this year (2015), NASA announced Hayabusa2 Participating Scientist Program. If US scientists are selected, they will be the members of HJST. In addition to this, we have started discussions with OSIRIS-REx team for the science collaboration. We hope that Hayabusa2 will produce much more scientific results by the international collaborations.",

Following cross-correlations the resulting coherent waveforms are then synthesized into a velocity estimate, often in the form of a dispersion image.

Additionally, this algorithm is embarrassingly parallel, and is significantly cheaper than the commonly used algorithms.\nWe demonstrate the algorithm on two field data sets: (1) a continuously recording linear trenched distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) array designed as a pilot test to develop a permafrost thaw monitoring system, and (2) the Long Beach Array, an irregularly spaced 3D array. These results show superior performance in both speed and numerical accuracy. An open-source implementation of this algorithm is available.",

An accurate velocity model is crucial for microseismic event location and focal mechanism inversion. For cost-effective long-term monitoring, the number of seismic stations are often limited, and their spatial distribution is usually sparse. To obtain an accurate velocity model for microseismic imaging, we develop a double-difference tomography method with a compressive sensing technique. The compressive sensing technique was developed to extract information from sparsely measured signals. We adapt this technique into double-difference tomography to alleviate inversion artifacts caused by the sparse distribution of seismic stations. We validate our new method using synthetic microseismic data and show that our new method significantly improves the accuracy of microseismic velocity inversion for a sparse seismic network.",

The task to ensure that rice production meets the demand of a growing population continues to engage the attention of national planners and policy makers. However, the adverse effects of climate change on agriculture production have presented Indonesia with yet another significant challenge. The exposure of rice crops to climate-related hazards such as temperature stress, floods, and drought, may lead to lower yield and self-sufficiency rate. This study explores the vulnerability of rice production to the effects of climate change in Indonesia. Considering the vast geographical span of the country and varying exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity to climate change at regional level, this study emphasize the importance of community-based adaptation.\nResults from a simulation based on production and climate data from 1984 to 2014 indicates that rice production is sensitive to variation in growing season temperature and precipitation. A projection of these climate factors in 2050 has a significant impact on the major rice crop. To manage the impact of climate change, this study turns to the potential roles of farmer organizations, such as Subak, in adaptation strategies. The Subak in Bali is recognized for its cultural and organizational framework that highlights the sharing of knowledge and local wisdom in rice production. This is demonstrated by its efficient community-based irrigation management system, leading to sustainable rice production.\nKeywords: rice production, climate change, community-based adaptation, Indonesia",

            "abstract": "Recent studies in the field of induced seismicity have shown high injection rates as the predominant driver of the recent increase in U.S. mid-continent seismicity. In regions with critically stressed, optimally oriented preexisting faults, well operation and the ability of a pore pressure perturbation to reach one of these faults governs the likelihood of an induced seismic event. Past case studies of hypothetical injections have simulated the pressure perturbation of single well injection systems, without considering the effect of pressure perturbation superposition in a multi-well injection system. In some regions where seismicity is suspected to be induced, the spatial density of injection wells can be greater than 5 wells per 5 km2, suggesting the effects of well superposition may be significant. In addition, induced earthquakes often occur on previously unrecognized faults, which leads us to aim towards minimizing the region of reservoir pressure perturbation above a designated critical pressure threshold. We test several well operational and hydrogeologic parameters that control the magnitude, timing and extent of pressure perturbation superposition in a hypothetical multi-injection well system. The parameters tested in the model are injection well spacing, injection rate as well as the permeability and storage coefficients of the injection reservoir. The magnitude, timing and extent of pressure perturbation superposition is highly dependent upon all tested parameters. Furthermore, optimal injection well spacing and optimal injection rates vary greatly based on hydrogeologic parameters. We compare the results of our hypothetical simulations to observed injection well spacing, injection rates and seismicity rates per unit area in regions prone to induced seismicity.",

With a range of hands-on learning experiences, Web materials and online , the program provided opportunities for students, educators, museums, science centers, the media, Web surfers and other members of the public to ride along on the first mission to Pluto and the Kuiper Belt.\nThe programs leveraged resources, materials and expertise to address a wide range of traditional and nontraditional audiences while providing consistent messages and information on this historic NASA endeavor. The E/C program included a variety of formal lesson plans and learning materials — based on New Horizons science and engineering goals, and aligned with National Research Council’s National Science Education Standards — that continue to help students in grades K-12 learn more about science, technology, engineering and mathematics. College students designed and built an actual flight instrument on New Horizons and held internships with the spacecraft integration and test team. New Horizons E/C programs went well beyond the classroom, from a chance for people to send their names to Pluto on board the New Horizons spacecraft before launch, to opportunities for the public to access milestone events and the first-ever close-up views of Pluto in places such as museums, science centers and libraries, TV and the Web — as well as thousands who attended interactive “Plutopalooza” road shows across the country.\nTeamed with E/C was the public affairs strategy to communicate New Horizons news and messages to media, mission stakeholders, the scientific community and the public. These messages include various aspects of New Horizons, including the progress of the mission and key milestones and achievements; the unique, long-distance operation of the spacecraft and its instruments; and the release of scientific data and results from New Horizons’ historic Pluto encounter. Through traditional and social media channels the mission reached billions of people worldwide – and likely inspired millions among the next generation of STEM professionals.",

The broadband radiative transfer code “mstrnX”, ,which was developed by Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute (AORI) and was implemented in several global and regional climate models cooperatively developed in the Japanese research community, for example, MIROC (the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate) [Watanabe et al., 2010], NICAM (Non-hydrostatic Icosahedral Atmospheric Model) [Satoh et al, 2008], and CReSS (Cloud Resolving Storm Simulator) [Tsuboki and Sakakibara, 2002]. In this study, we improve the gas absorption process and the scattering process of ice particles.\nFor update of gas absorption process, the absorption line database is replaced by the latest versions of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center, HITRAN2012. An optimization method is adopted in mstrnX to decrease the number of integration points for the wavenumber integration using the correlated k-distribution method and to increase the computational efficiency in each band. The integration points and weights of the correlated k-distribution are optimized for accurate calculation of the heating rate up to altitude of 70 km. For this purpose we adopted a new non-linear optimization method of the correlated k-distribution and studied an optimal initial condition and the cost function for the non-linear optimization. It is known that mstrnX has a considerable bias in case of quadrapled carbon dioxide concentrations [Pincus et al., 2015], however, the bias is decreased by this improvement.\nFor update of scattering process of ice particles, we adopt a solid column as an ice crystal habit [Yang et al., 2013]. The single scattering properties are calculated and tabulated in advance. The size parameter of this table is ranged from 0.1 to 1000 in mstrnX, we expand the maximum to 50000 in order to correspond to large particles, like fog and rain drop. Those update will be introduced to MIROC and adopted for CMIP6 experiment.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU Poster-Leading Edge - v4.pdf\nWe report on the development of a new oscillating hydrofoil technology for tidal flow energy harvesting. A series of flume experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations have been performed over a wide range of frequencies, f, heave amplitudes, h, and pitch angles, θ. The flume model has chord, c, of 10 cm and aspect ratio of 4.5. Mechanical power extracted is estimated from the foil trajectory, force and moment data. A robust real-time algorithm has been developed to identify the kinematics that optimizes either the total power or the Betz efficiency. Optimal efficiency is found when the pitch and heave cycles are 90 degrees out of phase, oscillating at a reduced frequency, fc/U, of approximately 0.15, with a heave amplitude of approximately 1c, and a pitch amplitude of θ=75 degrees. The high pitch amplitude and sharp leading edge of the foil generates a transient leading edge vortex on the suction side of the foil, significantly enhancing the vertical force and power. The optimal frequency ensures that the vortex generation and ultimate shedding maximize these unsteady hydrodynamic effects. The flume results, including power and efficiency, as well as flow visualization and particle image velocimetry (PIV) exhibit excellent agreement with the CFD. Furthermore, extensive CFD and physical experiments have been performed to investigate the effects of operating in confined or shallow channels. It is found that the efficiency and power generation can significantly increase in confined areas due to the acceleration of the freestream flow around the device. Finally, the Leading Edge team has designed, built, and as of this date, is currently field-testing a 1kW prototype device consisting of two foils operating in parallel. The prototype is attached to the underside of a pontoon boat, and testing is currently underway in the Narragansett Bay near Providence RI. On completion of the field tests, in October 2015, data from the prototype will be analyzed and compared with those from the flume experiments and CFD.",

These models are somewhat unique, in part because they were developed to overcome challenges of assimilating data across an international border, and in part because they are often an integral component of regional water budget models that also include simulations of over-lake precipitation and over-lake evaporation (both of which are, on annual time scales, of the same magnitude as runoff). Here, we present the next step in the evolution of GRIP (following GRIP-M, the first phase of the project that focused on Lake Michigan) with a comparison between different hydrological models (including GR4J and the NOAA large basin runoff model) and different regional precipitation data sources across the Lake Ontario basin. Results of our analysis provide insights that underscore the importance of the spatial and temporal resolution of a model domain and its forcings, along with their connections to model skill and selected objective criteria. Perhaps more importantly, our results are expected to assist in the advancement of regional hydrological models not only for improved forecasts of the Great Lakes water cycle, but in other large international freshwater basins as well.",

            "abstract": "The origin of observed high water vapor levels (exceeding 8 ppmv) over North America during summe in the observational record of the MLS satellite is in dispute. One hypothesis, based on an analysis of a Lagrangian chemical transport model validated with MLS data, is that the water vapor is the result of isentropic transport from lower latitudes that is associated with the Asian monsoon. Under this hypothesis, the observations are well-explained exclusive of any significant contribution from local mid-latitude deep convection. Conversely, measurements of isotopic analogs (isotopologues) of water vapor suggest different hypotheses about cross-tropopause water vapor transport that do not find the Asian monsoon as the dominant source for high LS water vapor over North America. Satellite measurements from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment-Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) sensor show elevated levels in the LS of the water vapor isotopologue HDO in the region of the North American monsoon relative to the region of the Asian monsoon, a finding in conflict with an Asian monsoonal source for the North American measurements. It has been argued that HDO is a very effective tracer for deep convection. Analysis of aircraft measurements of HDO had led to a competing hypothesis, that local mid-latitude deep convection is a significant source of elevated LS water vapor observed over North America.\nThis paper will examine the potential for using a case study approach within a trajectory modeling framework to clarify potential mechanistic and physical explanations for the disagreements in identification of the source of the observed high water vapor values. The potential contribution of diabatic heating at small scale to relevant trajectories will receive particular attention. Quantitative interpretation of the modeled test cases will be undertaken, based on a comparison of the final trajectory positions with the expected errors due to known limitations in trajectory models.",

Shore-zone surveys have been undertaken in proximity to the communities of Iqaluit and Qikiqtarjuaq, following earlier work in Clyde River. These support benthic habitat mapping, geological exploration, analysis of past and present sea-level trends, and assessment of coastal hazards relating to climate change and seabed instability. Outputs include a seamless topographic-bathymetric digital elevation model (DEM) of extensive boulder-strewn tidal flats in the large tidal-range setting at Iqaluit, supporting analysis of coastal flooding, wave run-up, and sea-ice impacts on a rapidly developing urban waterfront in the context of climate change. Seabed mapping of inner Frobisher Bay seaward of Iqaluit reveals a potential local tsunami hazard in widespread submarine slope failures, the triggers, magnitudes, and ages of which are the subject of ongoing research. In fjords of the Cumberland Peninsula, this project has mapped numerous submerged delta terraces at 19 to 45 m present water depth. These attest to an early postglacial submerged shoreline, displaced by glacial-isostatic adjustment. It rises linearly over a distance of 100 km east to west, where a submerged boulder barricade on a -16 m shoreline was discovered at a proposed port site in Broughton Channel near Qikiqtarjuaq. Palaeotopographic mapping using the multibeam data revealed an enclosed estuarine environment quite different from the present-day open passage swept by tidal currents. At Clyde River, combined seabed and onshore DEMs with geohazard mapping provided foundation data for community assessment and planning under a local knowledge co-production initiative. The geohazard work identified portions of the town-site more vulnerable to both coastal flooding and potential thaw subsidence, while the shallow delta terrace suggested a reversal from falling to rising relative sea levels. Overall, the coastal mapping results constitute baseline geoscience knowledge infrastructure for navigation, fisheries, port engineering, municipal planning, and informing sustainability initiatives in the isolated coastal communities of this Arctic region.",

            "abstract": "Forest succession theory maintains that trees drape existing landscapes as passive niche optimizers, but in the Luquillo Mountains in Puerto Rico, the forest exerts a powerful control on erosion. The Luquillo Critical Zone observatory is set in the Luquillo Mountains, an isolated massif at the northeastern tip of Puerto Rico Island which receives up to five meters of rainfall annually. Most of the rainfall received in the mountains is conveyed as quick flow through soil macropores, inhibiting soil erosion by overland flow. Physical erosion is kept low, occurring in the form of infrequent shallow landslides, thus increasing the residence time of minerals in the near-surface environment. The extensive chemical alteration of minerals generates a thick saprolite covered by fine-grained soil. Over the quartz diorite bedrock that characterizes the southern side of the mountains, the weathering process generates saprolite tens of meters deep that is almost completely devoid of weatherable minerals. Soils forming over this saprolite are nutrient-poor, forcing the rainforest to retrieve its nutrients from atmospheric fluxes, such as Saharan dust and marine aerosols. These atmospheric inputs are thus indirectly essential for the forest to be able to maintain slow erosion rates over the mountains. At lower elevation, using cosmogenic nuclide-derived denudation rates, we identified a wave of incision which has been propagating upstream over the past 4 My in the form of very steep and slowly migrating knickpoints. Bedrock abrasion and plucking are infrequent along the knickpoint faces, because the bedrock is massive and because rivers are bedload-starved. This situation is due to the highly weathered upland soils and slow erosion rates and high weathering rate upstream, which acts to reduce bedload grain size and limits bedload fluxes to the knickpoint, respectively. The soils change radically where the wave of erosion has passed and has increased erosion rates. There, nutrient-rich minerals make their way up into the soils, providing available cations to the forest. This is in turn has a measurable effect on forest biomass and on forest species composition.",

The Type-IV radio burst is observed between 10:39 – 11:00 UT in the frequency range of 300 – 20 MHz. From the radio heliographic observation, the radio source of the type-IV burst is traced and their sky plane speed is estimated as ~ 370 km/s. A plasmoid structure is ejected during the impulsive phase of the flare, at the same time of the type-IV burst and the structure is clearly observed at SDO/AIA 131 Å channel. From this, we find that the radio source moves with the plasmoid. The high brightness temperature profile in the range of 108 – 109 K and the moderate polarization between -50 – 30 % supports the plasma emission mechanism. Further the differential emission measure (DEM) analysis will be carried out and their results will be presented to provide more evidence of the emission mechanism.",

            "abstract": "Major climate and environmental changes occurred during late Oligocene to the late Miocene when atmospheric CO2 ranged between 500 and 300ppm, indicating threshold response of Antarctic ice sheets and climate to relatively modest CO2 variations. This implies that the southern high latitudes are highly sensitive to feedbacks associated with changes in global ice sheet and sea-ice extent, as well as terrestrial and marine ecosystems. This study focuses on two key intervals during the evolution of the Antarctic Ice Sheet: (1) The Late Oligocene and the Oligocene/Miocene boundary, when the East Antarctic Ice Sheet expanded close to present day volume following an extended period of inferred warmth. (2) The Mid-Miocene Climate Optimum (MMCO ~17-15 Ma), a period of global warmth and moderately elevated CO2 (350->500 ppm) which was subsequently followed by rapid cooling at 14-13.5 Ma. Reconstructions of climate and ice sheet variability, and thus an understanding of the various feedbacks that occurred during these intervals, are hampered by a lack of temperature and hydroclimate proxy data from the southern high latitudes.\nWe present proxy climate reconstructions using terrestrial and marine organic biomarkers that provide new insights into Antarctica’s climate evolution, using Antarctic drill cores and outcrop samples from a range of depositional settings. Bacterial ether-lipids have been analysed to determine terrestrial mean annual temperatures and soil pH (via the methylation and cyclisation indexes of branched tetraethers – MBT and CBT, respectively). Tetraether-lipids of crenarchaeota found in marine sediments sampled from continental shelves around Antarctica have been used to derive sea surface temperatures using the TEX86 index. Compound specific stable isotopes on n-alkanes sourced from terrestrial plants have been analysed to investigate changes in the hydrological and carbon cycles.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - WestBoulder_Poster_AGU.pdf\nMass wasting events are geologic hazards that impact human life and property across a variety of landscapes. These movements can be triggered by tectonic activity, anomalous precipitation events, or both; acting to decrease the factor of safety ratio on a hillslope to the point of failure. There exists an active hazard landscape in the West Boulder River drainage of Park Co., MT in which the mechanisms of slope failure are unknown. It is known that region has not seen significant tectonic activity within the last decade, leaving anomalous precipitation events as the likely trigger for slope failures in the landscape. Precipitation can be delivered to a landscape via rainfall or snow; it was the aim of this study to determine the precipitation delivery mechanism most likely responsible for movements in the West Boulder drainage following the Jungle Wildfire of 2006.\nData was compiled from four SNOTEL sites in the surrounding area, spanning 33 years, focusing on, but not limited to; maximum snow water equivalent (SWE) values in a water year, median SWE values on the date which maximum SWE was recorded in a water year, the total precipitation accumulated in a water year, etc. Means were computed and 99% confidence intervals were constructed around these means. Recurrence intervals and exceedance probabilities were computed for maximum SWE values and total precipitation accumulated in a water year to determine water years with anomalous precipitation. It was determined that the water year 2010-2011 received an anomalously high amount of SWE, and snow melt in the spring of this water year likely triggered recent mass waste movements. This data is further supported by Google Earth imagery, showing movements between 2009 and 2011. Return intervals for the maximum SWE value in 2010-11 for the Placer Basin SNOTEL site was 34 years, while return intervals for the Box Canyon and Monument Peak SNOTEL sites were 17.5 and 17 years respectively. Max SWE values lie outside the upper bound of the 99% confidence interval at all SNOTEL sites while precipitation accumulated in the form of rain is within the expected average, indicating an anomalously snow year and average amounts of rainfall during the same water year. This information can be used to better predict circumstances leading to slope failures in northern latitude alpine landscapes.",

            "abstract": "Most biogeochemical studies in forests have concentrated on nutrient pools and transformations occurring at relatively large spatial scales (i.e., stand or small catchment), over monthly or annual time scales. Many of these studies have also focused on the average or medial values observed across the spatial or temporal scale studied, discounting outliers. However, extremely high values found consistently (hot spot) or infrequently (hot moment) at a given soil microsite may be critical for nutrient acquisition by organisms and nutrient retention by terrestrial ecosystems. We have been evaluating soil nutrient hot-spot and hot-moment phenomena vertically (to a 60-cm depth) and horizontally (2-m sampling interval within a 6 m x 6 m grid) in two areas within a mixed-conifer, Sierran forest experiencing a Mediterranean-type climate. Nutrient fluxes in space and time were measured using ion exchange resin capsules placed at various depths and collected at two times (first significant precipitation in fall and post-snowmelt in spring) per year. Our previous work over a single year showed that fluxes of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in mineral soil were substantially greater in the spring than in the fall, suggesting that soil water was a major factor in controlling these nutrient fluxes. The opposite pattern was found for NH4+ and Na+, where greater fluxes occurred following the first precipitation event in fall. Here, we report new data over two additional years at these same sites. Over the entire 3-year study, nutrient fluxes were greater in the fall for all mineral soil nutrients except Ca2+ and Mg2+. Calcium fluxes were consistent with previous results; however, Mg2+ demonstrated no statistical significance between fall and spring sampling dates. Generally, the number of high statistical outliers persisted through time for Ca2+ and Mg2+, suggesting hot spots for these nutrients. In contrast, large seasonal and annual changes in the number of high statistical outliers occurred for NH4+, NO3-, and PO43-, nutrients whose availabilities are more mediated by microbial activity than base cations. Further elucidation of the mechanisms responsible for nutrient hot spot-hot moment phenomena within soil should be invaluable for improving the predictive capacity of biogeochemical models and for scaling these models across space and time.",

            "abstract": "The severe drought of 2011 killed millions of trees across the state of Texas. Drought-induced tree-mortality can have significant impacts to carbon cycling, regional biophysics, and community composition. We quantified canopy cover loss across the state using remotely sensed imagery from before and after the drought at multiple scales. First, we classified ~200 orthophotos (1-m spatial resolution) from the National Agriculture Imagery Program, using a supervised maximum likelihood classification. Area of canopy cover loss in these classifications was highly correlated (R2 = 0.8) with ground estimates of canopy cover loss, measured in 74 plots across 15 different sites in Texas. These 1-m orthophoto classifications were then used to calibrate and validate coarser scale (30-m) Landsat imagery to create wall-to-wall tree canopy cover loss maps across the state of Texas. We quantified percent dead and live canopy within each pixel of Landsat to create continuous maps of dead and live tree cover, using two approaches: (1) a zero-inflated beta distribution model and (2) a random forest algorithm. Widespread canopy loss occurred across all the major natural systems of Texas, with the Edwards Plateau region most affected. In this region, on average, 10% of the forested area was lost due to the 2011 drought. We also identified climatic thresholds that controlled the spatial distribution of tree canopy loss across the state. However, surprisingly, there were many local hot spots of canopy loss, suggesting that not only climatic factors could explain the spatial patterns of canopy loss, but rather other factors related to soil, landscape, management, and stand density also likely played a role. As increases in extreme droughts are predicted to occur with climate change, it will become important to define methods that can detect associated drought-induced tree mortality across large regions. These maps could then be used (1) to quantify impacts to carbon cycling and regional biophysics, (2) to better understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of tree mortality, and (3) to calibrate and/or validate mortality algorithms in regional models.",

A review of our current understanding of authigenic U enrichment mechanism into reducing sediments suggests that a revision of this interpretation is warranted. Specifically, the current interpretation of U isotope effects in suboxic vs. anoxic deposits has not taken into account the well-documented linear relationship with organic C burial rates. Although organic C rain rates (i.e., surface productivity) and bottom water oxygenation are clearly related, distinction between these two environmental controls is conceptually important as it relates to the mechanism of enhanced C burial and ultimately the strength of the biological pump. Here we will review new and existing data to test the hypothesis that the isotope composition of authigenic U in reducing sediments are best described by their relationship with parameters related to organic carbon delivery and burial, rather than bottom water oxygen concentration.",

            "abstract": "The pseudo point-source model is a source model for strong ground motion simulation proposed by Nozu(2012), originally for megathrust earthquakes. In this model, a simple source spectrum that follows the omega square model is given to each subevent without considering detailed spacio-temporal slip distributions; thus, the model is simpler compared to the characterized source model in which subevents are divided into subfaults. In the pseudo point-source model, the Fourier amplitude at a target station is evaluated by multiplying the path effect and the site amplification factor with the source spectrum explained above. Then, the waveform in the time domain is synthesized by inverse Fourier transform to the amplitude combined with phase characteristics properly selected from past records at the same station. The model has successfully been applied to several earthquakes in Japan including shallow crustal, subduction and intraslab earthquakes.\nIn this study, the pseudo point-source model was applied to the Mw5.9 Central Chiba earthquake of JULY 23, 2005 to check its validity for intraslab earthquakes occurring beneath the metropolitan area and to find possible error sources.\nThe overall result showed good agreement with the observations in terms of both Fourier spectrum and velocity time history (Figure); however, some unfavorable trends were found in the results. One was that the Fourier spectrum was underestimated at farther stations and at higher frequencies over 2 Hz. The discrepancy was significantly mitigated by revising the Q value from 100×f0.7 to 110×f1.0. The result indicates that the Q value has to be determined carefully when simulating ground motions in a wide area where the hypocentral distance exceeds 200 km. Another trend was the overestimation around 1 Hz at stations to the north of the epicenter. This could probably be attributed to the backward directivity effect or the variation in the site amplification factors and should be investigated further in the future study.",

Her) forests with contrasting annual precipitation (Wombat State Forest = 870 mm yr-1, Warra = 1700 mm yr-1). Both forests were continuous CH4 sinks with the Victorian site having a sink strength of -1.79 kg CH4 ha-1 yr-1 and the Tasmanian site having a sink strength of -3.83 kg CH4 ha-1 yr-1. Our results show that CH4 uptake was strongly controlled by soil moisture at both sites and explained up to 90% of the temporal variability in CH4 uptake. Furthermore, when soil moisture was expressed as soil air filled porosity (AFP) we were able to predict the CH4 uptake of one site by the linear regression between AFP and CH4 uptake from the other site. Soil temperature only had an apparent control over seasonal variation in CH4 uptake during periods when soil moisture and soil temperature were closely correlated. The fluctuation of the generally low soil nitrogen levels did not influence soil CH4 uptake at either site.",

Simulating these worst-case, most credible scenarios would provide an estimate of the resulting effects on coastal areas within the Caribbean. In the past few years, several publications have addressed this issue resulting in a collection of potential tsunami sources and scenarios. These publications come from a wide variety of sources; from government agencies to academic institutions. Although these provide the scientific community with a list of sources and scenarios, it was the interest of the WG2 to evaluate what has been proposed and develop a comprehensive list of sources, therefore leaving aside proposed scenarios. The seismo-tectonics experts of the Caribbean within the WG2 members were tasked to evaluate comprehensively which published sources are credible, worst-cases, and consider other sources that have been omitted from available reports. Among these published sources are the GEM Faulted Earth Subduction Characterization Project, and the LANTEX/Caribe Wave annual exercise publications (2009-2015). Caribbean tectonic features capable of generating tsunamis from seismic dislocation are located along the Northeastern Caribbean, the Lesser Antilles Trench, and the Panamá and Southern Caribbean Deformed Belts. The proposed sources have been evaluated based on historical and instrumental seismicity as well as geological and geophysical studies. This paper presents the sources and their justification as most-probable tsunami sources based on the context of crustal deformation due to Caribbean plate interacting with neighboring North and South America plates. Simulations of these sources is part of a subsequent phase in which effects of these tectonically induced tsunamis are evaluated in the near-field, and wave history snapshots are used to estimate arrival times and coastal effects at other locations within the Caribbean basin. This study is part of a contribution of the WG2 of ICG/CARIBE-EWS to UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission.",

The wide-scale observations necessary to test these model-derived hypotheses are not yet sufficient, but sedimentary depth transects represent a promising approach for making progress. Here we present paired stable isotopic (d18O, d13C) and trace metal data (Mg/Ca, B/Ca) from benthic foraminifera collected from a highly vertically-resolved depth transect from the mid-depth and deep SE Atlantic. These observations, which cover Marine Isotope Stages 5e, 5d, 5a, 4, and the Last Glacial Maximum, document the evolution of glacial conditions from the previous interglacial, and provide detailed observations regarding the magnitude and timing of changes in temperature and salinity within the deep ocean at key time points over the last glacial/interglacial cycle. Furthermore, the comparison between purely ‘physical’ tracers (i.e. Mg/Ca, d18O) and tracers sensitive to the carbon cycle (i.e. d13C and B/Ca) provides critical insight into the relationship between deep/mid-depth stratification and global carbon dynamics. Notably among our observations, the paired stable isotope and trace metal results strongly suggest that much of the ice-age cooling of deep South Atlantic occurred at the MIS 5e/5d transition, while the onset of salinity stratification in the mid-depth South Atlantic occurred at the MIS 5/4 transition.",

Our initial investigation of this subsurface ecotone in the Yucatan Peninsula (Mexico) provides stable isotope-based evidence that methane and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) are the primary sources of energy and carbon for the food web. However, the frequency of observations is sparse, leaving us ‘in the dark’ with respect to the temporal dynamics of the ecosystem function. In this study, we obtained undisturbed vertical profiles of methane, DOC and DIC concentration and isotopic composition with the ‘Octopipi’ water sampler from an anchialine cave located ~8 km from the coastline. To document the temporal variability of methane availability in the cave, we deployed an osmotically-driven pump (OsmoSampler). Data loggers recorded dissolved oxygen (DO), salinity, temperature and current velocities, and a rain gauge recorded precipitation. A high-methane water mass near the ceiling (up to 7795 nM) contained elevated concentration (900 µM), 13C-depleted (-27.8 to -28.2 ‰) DOC, suggesting terrestrial organic matter input from the overlying soils. Low-methane saline water (36 to 84 nM) had lower concentration DOC (15 to 97 µM) with a similar δ13C (-25.9 to -27.2 ‰), suggesting significant terrestrial organic matter consumption or removal with increasing depth, from fresh to saline water, within the water column. Our 6-month water chemistry record reveals high concentrations of methane in the wet season, especially following rainfall events, and relatively lower methane concentrations in the dry season. These observations suggest rain flushes methane generated in overlying anoxic soils into the cave. DO, water level, and groundwater flow patterns were also linked to the precipitation record. These data provide novel insight into the interconnections between external climate forcing and subterranean anchialine ecosystems within coastal aquifers.",

Considering the inherent constraints in visualization and measurements in porous media, the characterization has been performed using time resolved PIV in a randomly packed ordered array of spheres with uniform size. The size of the spheres are 15 mm and the pore Reynolds numbers are set to be 300, 500, and 900. The test bed has a cross-section of 70×70 mm and a height of 15mm. In addition to the difficult accessibility to the interrogation window, the challenges of visualizing the flow in this porous structure is matching of refractive indices of the fluid and solid phase as slight mismatches have been shown to cause significant tracking errors. The 2-D velocity field has been captured at discrete planar locations along the optical axis through the test bed to study the physics and statistics of the flow. Variations occur in the imaging magnification, and if not taken into consideration may lead to increased error. This study addresses three forms of error in PIV as they pertain to porous media flow: tracking error, bias error due to displacement gradients and perspective error. The bias error due to displacement gradients was evaluated from correlation peak width. Direct Numerical Simulation is also being performed to investigate the transitional and turbulent flow in porous media in detail.",

Carbonate mineral dissolution resulting from CO2-acidified fluids may actually create new storage capacity, but predicting the extent and location of enhanced storage is complicated by the presence of pore size distributions spanning orders of magnitude as well as common microfractures. To address this issue, core samples spanning a wide range of depths and predicted permeabilities were procured from wells drilled into the Weyburn-Midale reservoir from the IEA GHG's CO2 Monitoring and Storage Project, Saskatchewan, Canada; and from the Arbuckle dolomite at the Kansas Geological Survey's South-central Kansas CO2 Project. Our approach integrated non-invasive characterization, complex core-flooding experiments, and 3-D reactive transport simulations to calibrate relevant CO2 storage relationships among fluid flow, porosity, permeability, and chemical reactivity. The resulting observations from this work permit us to constrain (and place uncertainty limits on) some of the model parameters needed for estimating evolving reservoir CO2 storage capacity. The challenge remains, however, as to how to best interpret and implement these observations at the actual reservoir scale. We present our key findings from these projects and recommendations for storage capacity predictions.

            "abstract": "Recent studies have shown a wide range of decadal scale global biomass changes, with many boreal forests increasing in biomass, and tropical areas continuing to decline. A critical question that follows from this is whether or not these changes are having a measurable impact on the water balance. Here, we use a Budyko approach in combination with global datasets of precipitation (P), potential evaporation (PET), discharge (Q), and actual evapotranspiration (ET) to assess whether detectable trends in surface runoff exist, and whether this is consistent with the availability predicted by the Budyko water and energy balance. These trends are further complicated by the scaling of hydrological change with climate (PET/P), and the wide variation in climate trends, particularly P. Nonetheless, the detection of hydrological responses to vegetation change at the global scale is a large gap in our understanding of human impacts on the hydrological cycle, and this work seeks to clarify when and where such impacts may be present. This has important implications for future water resource availability, since biomass (or land cover) changes are not considered to the same extent as the potential impact of greenhouse gas emissions, and yet vegetation changes may have a far more direct and influential role in the hydrological cycle.",

These samples have been collected by Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs), divers, networked and autonomously deployed instruments, and rosettes. Subsequent measurements are used for scientific experiments, calibration of in-situ and remote sensors, monitoring of Marine Protected Areas, and environment characterization. Tracking the life cycles of these samples from collection to dissemination of results with all the pertinent documents (e.g., protocols, imagery, reports), metadata (e.g., location, identifiers, purpose, method) and data (e.g., measurements, taxonomic classification) is a challenge. The initial collection of samples is normally documented in SeaScribe (an ROV dive logging tool within ONC’s Oceans 2.0 software) for which ONC has defined semantics and syntax. Next, samples are often sent to individual scientists and institutions (e.g., Royal BC Museum) for processing and storage, making acquisition of results and life cycle metadata difficult. Finally, this information needs to be retrieved and collated such that multiple user scenarios can be addressed. ONC aims to improve and extend its digital infrastructure for physical samples to support this complex array of samples, workflows and applications. However, in order to promote effective data discovery and exchange, interoperability and community standards must be an integral part of the design. Thus, integrating recommendations and outcomes of initiatives like the EarthCube iSamples working groups are essential. Use cases, existing tools, schemas and identifiers are reviewed, while remaining gaps and challenges are identified. The current status, selected approaches and possible future directions to enhance ONC’s digital infrastructure for each sample type are presented.",

Furthermore, three-dimensional rain drop and even fog information should be essentially important for understanding the wet deposition processes, since the initial drizzle is not measured by the tipping bucket-type raingauge.\nWe have developed various meteorological information links (http://www.chikyu.ac.jp/akiyo/firis/) and original radar and precipitation data will be released from the page. Here we present various radar images that we have prepared for March 2011. We prepared three-dimensional radar reflectivity of the C-band radar of JMA in every 10 minutes over all Kanto Plain centered at Tokyo and Fukushima prefecture centered at Sendai. We have released images of each altitude (1km interval) for 15th - 16thand 21th March (http://sc-web.nict.go.jp/fukushima/). The vertical structure of the rainfall is almost the same at 4km with the surface and sporadic high precipitation is observed at 6 km height for 15-16th. While, generally precipitation pattern that is similar to the surface is observed at 5km height on 21th.\nOn the other hand, an X-band radar centered at Fukushima university is also used to know more localized raindrop patterns at zenith angle of 4 degree. We prepared 10-minutes/120m mesh precipitation patterns for March 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 20th, 21th, 22th and 23th. Quantitative estimate is difficult from this X-band radar, but localized structure, especially for the rain-band along Nakadori (middle valley in Fukushima prefecture), that is considered to determine the highly contaminated zone, is observed with only this X-band radar in the mid-night (JST) of 15th. We will show the movie of how precipitation systems were moved at the meeting.\nWe are preparing rain/snow amount information and fog information during March 2011, and are going to compare them with atmospheric electricity fields that can be used for the index of dry deposition. The comprehensive datasets will reveal how the pollutants were moved and deposited, and will be used to improve atmospheric transport models.",

The recent study by Baranowski at al (2015) have shown that the propgation of Kelvin waves through the Maritime Continent is strongly influenced by the interaction of the waves with the diurnnal cycle of convection over the land which can either amplify or supress the convective forcing of the wave. This suggests that inorder for the wave to cross the Maritime Continent it has to be in phase with local convection. Another possible mechanism through which the Maritime Continent can influence approaching Kelvin waves and MJO's is their interacton with cyclonic disturbances generated by the lee vortices at the tips of Sumatra. Both of these mechanisms can be misrepresented by dynamic models and contribute to predictability barrier in this region\nThese equatorial modes ate examined in Navy models forecasts of DYNAMO MJOs and n idealized experiments. While the models appear to predict the MJO and Kelvin wave approach to the Maritime continent their propagation is too slowa andn westward propagating disturbance are often too strong. We examine the contribution of lee vortices and local diurnal convection variability to this process",

In this model, the atmosphere deviates from a moist adiabat—and, therefore, has positive CAPE—because entrainment causes evaporative cooling in cloud updrafts, thereby steepening their lapse rate. This has led to the proposal that CAPE increases with global warming because the strength of evaporative cooling scales according to the Clausius-Clapeyron (CC) relation. However, CAPE could also change due to changes in cloud buoyancy and changes in the entrainment rate, both of which could vary with global warming. To test the relative importance of changes in CAPE due to CC scaling of evaporative cooling, changes in cloud buoyancy, and changes in the entrainment rate, we subject a cloud-resolving model to a suite of natural (and unnatural) forcings. We find that CAPE changes are primarily driven by changes in the strength of evaporative cooling; the effect of changes in the entrainment rate and cloud buoyancy are comparatively small. This builds support for CC scaling of CAPE.",

Gauging the responses of these agroecosystems in the presence of extreme events and new market demands requires a fresh approach. This approach requires better comprehension of the interactions and feedback processes that either sustain or deplete both natural (e.g., soil productivity) and human (e.g., net income) capital. Because soil quality defines land productivity and long-term prosperity, we focus on the cascading effects that soil quality has on other ecosystem properties, profit, farmer decision making in mitigating soil degradation, and development of environmental policies. We argue that land use decision-making must not only be strictly based on socioeconomic and environmental criteria, but should also consider farmer/ farm characteristics, personal beliefs, and the support network that is needed for promoting and implementing conservation practices. Current approaches for adopting conservation do not fit into this paradigm. We develop an Agent Based Model Framework that incorporates novel aspects of ecological, socioeconomic and behavioral modeling to facilitate interactions of the farmer and its land through a multi-objective, maximization utility function. This function is continuously informed and updated by the improved modeling framework. This study is developing measures of sustainability for lags, hysteresis, tipping points, and adaptive capacity.\nWe examine the complex relationship between farmer decision-making and the landscape in two contrasting systems in Iowa and Tennessee with unique distributions of characteristics in terms of climate, soil properties, and landscape patterns that regulate not only the type of farming practiced, but also the degree of soil erosion in each system. Central to this investigation is identifying and quantifying trade-offs among non-pecuniary and pecuniary objectives given alternative scenarios about driving forces and stakeholder preference. Trade-offs among the various products and services produced by landscapes are required and finding the proper balance presents a continual challenge for policy-makers and land managers when it comes to placing best management practices in a watershed.",

This study evaluates the Zanskar River, a large rain shadow tributary to the Indus River system, to establish how monsoonal precipitation controls erosion patterns, sediment yield, and sediment composition in the Himalayan rain shadow.\nBulk sediment petrography and U-Pb detrital zircon ages demonstrate that Zanskar River sands are overwhelmingly dominated by 600–850 Ma zircon, which is consistent with material eroding from Greater Himalayan lithologies. In particular, modern sediment production appears to be heavily concentrated in the wettest and most glaciated subcatchment. River terrace sands indicate that no significant change in the area of sediment production and basin-wide provenance signal has occurred since ~11.5 ka, despite changes in monsoon strength. Variability in subcatchment provenance signals, however, do shift locally with enhanced precipitation around the time of the Monsoon Maximum (10–8 ka). Detrital apatite fission track ages suggest rates of erosion typical for the northwest Indian Himalaya for the last 6.4 M.y. in Zanskar, in spite of the changing monsoonal climate. Together these data indicate most sediment in the Zanskar River is freshly-eroded and transmitted immediately downstream into the Indus River with only modest buffering in terraces.",

            "abstract": "On regulated rivers, restoring flow regimes is a process-based restoration approach that may strongly affect downstream ecosystems. Developing realistic flow targets with meaningful geomorphic and ecological benefits, however, is challenging. For instance, hydraulic, geomorphic and biological processes are affected by more than manipulating water release—sediment supply and transport conditions also require consideration. Also, funding and programmatic directives rarely require the monitoring necessary to adaptively manage environmental flow programs. Recent research in the Willamette River basin in support of the Sustainable Rivers Project (SRP) demonstrates how such a monitoring program can be implemented. At the reach scale, initial efforts have assessed geomorphic and vegetative changes in alluvial sections of the Middle Fork Willamette and McKenzie Rivers using repeat mapping from aerial photographs and flow analyses. Overall, both rivers are largely stable because of reduced discharge, bed-material supply and local revetments, but some reaches of the McKenzie River are more dynamic, perhaps reflecting greater inputs of sediment from unregulated tributaries and higher magnitude peak flows. Repeat, reach-scale mapping on the Middle Fork Willamette River shows that frequent bankfull flows are able to scour minimally vegetated gravel bars and sustain a patchwork of actively shifting bed-material sediment. Repeat mapping on the McKenzie River in summer 2015 will reveal insights about the geomorphic effectiveness of bankfull flows. At the site scale, monitoring at two bars in summer 2015 is linking streamflow with the establishment of black cottonwood. Lastly, a review of hydrographs from 2000-2015 and retrospectively applying stakeholder-defined flow targets showed substantial variability in meeting objectives for the timing and types of flows under traditional regulated conditions and the SRP. Altogether, these related efforts help link streamflow, geomorphic processes, and black cottonwood establishment over three decades, and help refine ongoing and future environmental flow releases to achieve the goals of the SRP.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - GC51A-1080.pdf\nThe significant correlation between dropping temperatures throughout the Pliocene and the concomitant explosive expansion of the Hominid brain has led a number of workers to postulate climate change drove human evolution. Our brain (that of Homo sapiens), comprises 1-2 percent of our body weight but consumes 20 -25 percent of the body’s caloric intake. We are “hotheads”. Brains are extremely sensitive to overheating but we are endowed with unparalleled thermal regulation, much of it given over to protecting the Central Nervous System (CNS). Will there be reversed trends with global warming? The human brain has been shrinking since the end of the Ice Ages, losing about 150cc over the past 10,000 years. Polar bear skulls have been downsizing as well. Almost all mass extinctions or evolutionary upheavals are attributed to global warming: e.g. the Permian/Triassic (P/T) event, i.e., “The Great Dying”, 250 million years ago (~90% of all life forms wiped out); the Paleocene/ Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) 55 million years ago. They may be analogs for what might await us. Large creatures, whose body size inhibits cooling, melted away during the PETM. Horses, initially the size of dogs then, reduced to the size of cats. An unanticipated hazard for humans that may attend extreme global warming is dumbing down or needing to retreat to the Poles as did those creatures that survived the P/T event (some references:\nhttp://johnhawks.net/research/hawks-2011-brain-size-selection-holocene\n; Kandel, E. et al Principles of Neural Science 4th ed.

Here we assess the prediction of pH from aircraft data, report pH as a function of geographical location and altitude for different seasons, and investigate causes for variability in pH-dependent aerosol components, such as nitrate. pH is generally predicted with a thermodynamic model since it is difficult to measure directly. We used ISORROPIA-II with particle and selected gas inorganic species, along with RH and T as inputs to calculate aerosol pH. Data are from three aircraft studies: WINTER (2015 Feb-Mar) and NEAQS (2004 July-Aug), both over the northeastern US, and SENEX (2013 Jun-July) over the southeastern US. pH was validated by comparing measured and predicted partitioning of ammonia and nitric acid. The effect of inevitable sample heating associated with aircraft measurements was minimal since partitioning of measured semi-volatile components based on ambient T and RH were accurately predicted. Overall, pH determined from WINTER, NEAQS, and SENEX for altitudes up to 5000 m ranged between -0.4 and 1.9 (10-90% percentiles, mean±SD=0.9±1.0), similar to what we have observed at ground-based sites in the southeastern US. Coupling between water vapor concentrations, temperature, particle composition, liquid water content and particle pH on partitioning of nitric acid-nitrate observed during the WINTER campaign will be investigated.",

A mobile solar tracker is simultaneously coupled to a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTS) and a UV-Vis Spectrometer allowing to measure ammonia (NH3), ethane (C2H6), formaldehyde and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) along the direct solar beam. The fast scanning mobile solar tracker contains a motion compensation system and imaging feedback loop making it possible to operate autonomously and to track the sun at high precision; 0.052° has been verified comparing quantitatively the column measurements of NO2 from the UV-Vis spectrometer with measurements from the Multi Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectrometer (MAX-DOAS), the third remote sensing instrument deployed in the mobile laboratory. The solar tracker enables direct sun observations providing high photon flux such that the FTS and UV-Vis spectrometer measure at high temporal resolution of 2 seconds. Driving the mobile lab yields high spatial resolution. The suite of remote sensing instruments aboard the mobile laboratory allows quantifying emissions applying the Solar Occultation Flux method. This method applied to the column measurements is complementary to in-situ observations in obtaining trace gas fluxes and eventually trace gas production rates from a source when driving around or upwind and downwind of that target source. This presentation characterizes the FTS by comparing it with a high resolution FTS at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, and describes the first application to measurements of NH3 emissions from agricultural sources and C2H6 emissions from oil and natural gas.",

However, global warming is affecting the health and functionality of these ecosystems.

When the coral dies, the skeleton begins to be colonized by algae, sponges, bacteria and others, forming a highly diverse biofilm. We analyzed the metagenomes of the dead A. palmata rubbles from Puerto Morelos, in the Mexican Caribbean. Also, we quantified the elemental composition of biomass and measured nitrogen fixation and emission of greenhouse gases over 24 hrs.

            "abstract": "This study investigated the effects of thinning intensities on stand transpiration and productivity of 50-year-old Korean pine forests for three years. Forest thinning, which remove some fraction of trees from stand, alters the microclimatic conditions such as radiation distribution within canopy, vapor pressure deficit, and amount of available soil water. These changes influence on the tree water use, and related tree growth. Thinning was conducted on March, 2012 with two intensities (Control, Light-thinning, and Heavy-thinning). Transpiration was estimated from sap flux density, which was measured with Granier-type thermal dissipation sensors. Tree diameter growth was measured with dendrometer, and converted to tree productivity using allometric equations developed specifically in our study sites.\nThe climatic conditions showed remarkable differences among three years. In 2012, total precipitation was highest but spring was dry. 2013 was normal year with frequent rain events. In contrast, 2014 was hot and extremely dry. Stand transpiration was initially decreased ca. 20% and 42% on light-thinning and heavy-thinning stand, respectively. In second year, it gradually recovered in both thinning intensities, and was 19% and 37% lower on light-thinning and heavy-thinning stand, respectively. However, the recovery trends were different between two thinning intensities. Transpiration of heavy-thinning stand was recovered slowly than that of light thinning stand. In 2014, heavy-thinning stand transpired ca. 5% more than control plot in early growing season, but severe drought had negative effects that caused reduction of stand transpiration in thinned stand on late growing season. The tree-level productivity was increased initially ca. 24% and 28% on light-thinning and heavy-thinning stand, respectively. During the following growing seasons, this thinning-induced enhancement of productivity was diminished in light-thinning stand (21% in 2013 and 20% in 2014), but was increased in heavy-thinning stand (49% in 2013 and 56% in 2014). In addition, the relationship between tree diameter and relative growth rate showed opposite trends between heavy thinning and light thinning stands. These results indicate that there are differences in biological reactions with thinning intensities.",

            "abstract": "As the awareness of water pollution, eutrophication and other water related environmental concerns grows, the significance of sediment in the transport of nutrients and contaminants from agricultural areas to streams has received increasing attention. Both the physical and geochemical properties of suspended sediment are strongly controlled by sediment sources. Thus, tracing sources of suspended sediment in watersheds is important for the design of management practices to reduce sediment loads and contributions of sediment-adsorbed nutrients from agricultural areas to streams. However, the contributions of different sediment sources to suspended sediment loads within intensively managed watersheds in the Midwest still remain insufficiently explored.\nThis study aims to assess the provenance of suspended sediment and the relation between channel morphology and production of suspended sediment in the Upper Sangamon River Basin, Illinois, USA. The 3,690-km2 Upper Sangamon River Basin is characterized by low-relief, agricultural lands dominated by row-crop agriculture. Sediment source samples were collected in the Saybrook from five potential sources: farmland, forests, floodplains, river banks, and grasslands. Event-based and accumulated suspended sediment samples were collected by ISCO automatic pump samplers and in situ suspended sediment samplers and from the stream at watershed outlet. A quantitative geochemical fingerprinting technique, combining statistically verified multicomponent signatures and an un-mixing model, was employed to estimate the relative contributions of sediment from five potential sources to the suspended sediment loads. Organic matter content, trace elements, and radionuclides from soil samples were used as potential tracers. Our preliminary results indicate that the majority of suspended sediment is derived from floodplains in the downstream portions of the watersheds, while only minor amounts of suspended sediment are derived from upland areas and banks. These results suggest that floodplain erosion during high flow events contributes to the suspended sediment.",

However, the production of H+ ions during calcification (HCO3 + Ca+ —> CaCO3 + H+) has resulted in localized acidification around coccolithophore blooms. It has been hypothesized that under the correct light conditions photosynthesis could proceed at a rate such that CO2 is removed in amounts equimolar or greater than the H+ produced by calcification, allowing stable or increasing alkalinity despite ongoing calcification. Previously, this effect had not been demonstrated under laboratory conditions. Fifteen Emiliania huxleyi cultures were separated into equal groups with each receiving: 0, 6, 12, 18, or 24 hours of light each day for 24 days. Daily pH, cell density, and temperature measurements revealed a strong positive correlation between light exposure and pH, and no significant decline in pH in any of the cultures. Alkalinity increases were temperature independent and not strongly correlated with cell density, implying photosynthetic removal of carbon dioxide as the root cause. The average pH across living cultures increased from 7.9 to 8.3 over the first week and changed little for the reminder of the 24-day period. The results demonstrate coccolithophorids can increase alkalinity across a broad range of cell densities, despite the acidification inherent to the calcification process. If the light-alkalinity effect reported here proves scalable to larger cultures, Emiliania huxleyi are a strong candidate for carbon sequestration via targeted ocean fertilization. ",

Numerous small earthquakes take place in this region presently, making it one of the most active seismic zones in Guangdong. To investigate the present seismicity and associated fault zone structure, we deployed a temporary seismic network, including a dense linear array across the Ren-Zi-Shi fault southwest to the reservoir. The temporary network is consisted of 42 stations that are operated in the field for more than one month. Because of the mountainous terrain, it is impossible to deploy broadband sensors. Here we use DDV-5 seismometer with a central frequency of 120Hz-5s that is independent on external GPS and battery. During our deployment, numerous earthquakes were recorded. Preliminary results of travel time analysis have shown the characteristic of low velocity fault zone. More detailed analysis, including relocation of earthquakes, ambient noise cross correlation, and modeling body waves, will be presented.",

We develop a variety of smart microcapsules that can deliver and release specific substances to the target location in the porous medium, and therefore change the fluid property or medium geometry at certain locations. In this talk, I will present two types of smart capsules for (a) delivering surfactant to the vicinity of oil-water interface and (b) delivering microgels to the high permeability region and therefore blocking the pore space there, respectively. We also show that flooding these two capsules into porous media effectively reduces the trapped oil and improves the homogeneity of the medium, respectively. Besides of its industrial applications, this technique also opens a new window to study the mechanism of two-phase flow in porous media.",

            "abstract": "The open-pit Grasberg mine, located in the highlands of Western Papua, Indonesia, and operated by PT Freeport Indonesia (PT-FI), is among the world’s largest in terms of copper and gold production. Over the last 27 years, PT-FI has used the Ajkwa River to transport an estimated 1.3 billion tons of tailings from the mine into the so-called Ajkwa Deposition Area (ADA). The ADA is the product of aggradation and lateral expansion of the Ajkwa River into the surrounding lowland rainforest and mangroves, which include species important to the livelihoods of indigenous Papuans. Mine tailings that do not settle in the ADA disperse into the Arafura Sea where they increase levels of suspended particulate matter (SPM) and associated concentrations of dissolved copper. Despite the mine’s large-scale operations, ecological impact of mine tailings deposition on the forest and estuarial ecosystems have received minimal formal study. While ground-based inquiries are nearly impossible due to access restrictions, assessment via satellite remote sensing is promising but hindered by extreme cloud cover.\nIn this study, we characterize ridgeline-to-coast environmental impacts along the Ajkwa River, from the Grasberg mine to the Arafura Sea between 1987 and 2014. We use “all available” Landsat TM and ETM+ images collected over this time period to both track pixel-level vegetation disturbance and monitor changes in coastal SPM levels. Existing temporal segmentation algorithms are unable to assess both acute and protracted trajectories of vegetation change due to pervasive cloud cover. In response, we employ robust, piecewise linear regression on noisy vegetation index (NDVI) data in a manner that is relatively insensitive to atmospheric contamination. Using this disturbance detection technique we constructed land cover histories for every pixel, based on 199 image dates, to differentiate processes of vegetation decline, disturbance, and regrowth. Using annual reports from PT-FI, we show that the changing extent and spatial patterns of riparian vegetation disturbance directly correlate with yearly tailings production rates. While the rate of vegetation disturbance decreased after 1998, SPM levels along the Arafura coast increased, suggesting the failure of PT-FI to fully confine tailings to the ADA.",

These changes are directly linked to ice-ocean interaction beneath ice shelves, but existing observations of the spatial distribution, timing, and magnitude of ice shelf basal melt are very limited.\nWe generated ~2 m/px DEMs for all available 2010-2015 high-resolution stereo satellite imagery (WorldView-1/2/3 and GeoEye-1) of the West Antarctic coast (excluding the Ross and Ronne-Filchner ice shelves). Annual and sub-annual DEM mosaics were produced for the Amundsen Sea sector, with focus on the Pine Island Glacier (PIG). We integrated SPIRIT ~40 m/px DEMs to extend the PIG time series to 2007/2008, and incorporated surface velocity maps from TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X from 2009-2015.\nWe use these products to compute ice thickness, Eulerian dH/dt, and Lagrangian DH/Dt, which capture evolving grounding line position, shelf thickening/thinning, and upstream ice dynamics. Ice shelf basal melt rate estimates are derived from both lagrangian DH/Dt and dense flux gate mass budget analysis. We document the spatial and temporal evolution of melt rates for the 2008-2015 period, and compare with existing ICESat (2003-2008) melt estimates and oceanographic observations. Finally, we compare observed melt vs. depth relationships with existing ice flow model parameterizations.\nEstimated basal melt rates are >100-150 m/yr within the PIG inner cavity, with significantly lower rates of <50 m/yr beneath the outer shelf. Eulerian dh/dt observations show significant thinning (>5-10 m/yr) upstream of the PIG grounding line following the ~2008-2009 ungrounding of the PIG “ice plain,” with additional thinning along lateral margins in subsequent years. A combination of reduced melt rates and increased flux resulted in ice shelf regrounding on a large transverse seabed ridge and significant ice shelf thickening.\nThese new data provide critical observations that improve our understanding of ocean forcing, ice-ocean interaction, and resultant mass loss in the Amundsen Sea region.",

A major clue to the cause of the torus modulation was provided by the discovery of the key modulation of the hot electron (i.e. ∼ 100s eV) population, at both the System III (magnetic rotation period) and System IV (∼ 3% longer than System III) period [Steffl et al., 2008]. However, very little progress has been made in explaining the origin of these hot electron modulations. Using a new two-dimensional (coupled radial and azimuthal dimensions) physical chemistry model for the plasma torus, we present sensitivity studies of torus properties (e.g., composition, density, and temperature) to: a) variations in System III and IV hot electron populations, b) specified radial profiles of subcorotation, and c) subcorotation determined by local mass loading rates and ionospheric Pedersen conductance. We also explore a possible feedback between hot electron production and local radial transport rates following the suggestion of Hess et al., [2011] regarding the origin of System IV hot electrons.",

            "abstract": "The Tarim Basin, located in NW China, is the largest inland basin in the world. Since 1970s, the basin became modernized agriculturally through unprecedented reclamation which were controlled by the Chinese government to promote cotton production. In 2013, 40% of China’s cotton production is harvested in the Tarim Basin, representing 15% of world production. However, these large scale land use transformations lead to overuse of water resources in the upper and middle reaches for irrigation, with severe unintended ecological consequences in the lower reaches. The lower reaches of the Tarim River dried up gradually during the 1970s. In 2000, a water release project was launched to meet the ecological water demands of the river’s lower reaches. So far there have been 15 water releases with 1.7 billion USD invested.\nThis work aims to improve our understanding of the impacts on the hydrologic cycle from land-use/land-cover change activities in the Tarim Basin by bridging boundaries between different disciplines and integrating them to portray all the key processes involved. This multidisciplinary approach includes analysis of remotely sensed imagery, application of a dynamic crop modelling framework, and simulation analyses with a transient, 2D, variably-saturated groundwater model. My primary findings show that in 2006, about 25820 km2 were identified as irrigated field. This is a 41% increase from 1970s, when the total irrigated area was only 18250 km2. The rapid expansions in irrigate fields, together with climate change, have affected the partitioning of water between the land surface and the lower atmosphere through changing evapotranspiration patterns. Approximately 7 km3 of water entered the atmosphere through crop evapotranspiration in 1971, but by 2006 this value had increased to nearly 11 km3. But changes in climatic conditions accounted for only 20% of the total increase in ET. In terms of ecological restoration, the study shows the current water releases project can maintain the current habit for Populus euphratica, but are not sufficient to expand habitat for Populus euphratica. This research addresses the hydrological and ecological implications of agricultural expansion and identifies sustainable strategies to reverse these negative environmental effects in the Tarim Basin.",

            "abstract": "Background/Issue\nThere currently exists no comprehensive metric to measure and value anthropogenic changes in carbon flux between geospheric carbon sinks. We propose that changes in carbon residence time within geospheres be used as a metric to assess anthropogenic changes in carbon flux, and the term ‘carbon quality’ (cq) be used to describe such changes. Carbon residence time represents the inverse of carbon flux; as carbon flux increases, the corresponding cq will decrease, and vice versa.\nFocusing on atmospheric carbon emissions as a measure of anthropogenic activity on the environment ignores the fungible characteristics of carbon that are crucial in both the biosphere and the worldwide economy. The ubiquitous carbon molecule enables the enormous diversity in the biosphere, as well as the widespread, strategic economic presence of carbon in the world economy. Focusing on a single form of inorganic carbon as a proxy metric for the plethora of anthropogenic activity and carbon compounds will prove inadequate, convoluted, and unmanageable. A broader, more basic metric is needed to capture the breath and scope of carbon activity.\nResults/Conclusions\nWe propose a logarithmic vector scale for cq to measure anthropogenic carbon flux. The distance between vector points, e.g. the starting and ending residence times, would represent the change in cq. A base-10 logarithmic scale would allow the addition and subtraction of exponents to calculate changes in cq.\nAs carbon moves between carbon reservoirs, the change in cq is measured as: cq = b ( log10 [mean carbon residence time] ) where b represents the carbon price coefficient for a particular country. For any country, cq measures the climate change potential for any organic carbon when converted to inorganic CO2, or to any lower residence time carbon state. The greater the carbon fees for a country, the larger the b coefficient would be, and the greater the import fees would be to achieve carbon parity on imports from countries with lower carbon fees.\nBy assessing embodied carbon within imports for carbon parity with domestic production, cq would eliminate the incentives to use spatial shifts in carbon emissions to avoid carbon fees. Similarity, cq would temper the incentives to use temporal displacement of carbon emissions, such as with biomass or CCS, to reduce carbon fees.",

This proxy-climate model mismatch could be caused by 1) a deficiency of climate models in capturing real long-period variability in the climate system or 2) biases in the proxy systems that amplify long-period variance. In this study we use proxy system models for oxygen isotopic systems (speleothem, ice core, tree-ring cellulose) to determine how much of the proxy-climate model mismatch is due to filtering of the climate signal by these proxies. We focus on the region impacted by the Indian summer monsoon and use output data from isotope-enabled climate models to drive our proxy system models. We find that much but not all of the proxy-climate model mismatch can be explained by biases in the proxy systems. Speleothem systems exhibit much stronger biases than tree-ring cellulose and ice cores due to significant reservoir times for water in karst. Even after using proxy system models to create pseudoproxies, the paleodata tend to have greater long-period variance (longer, more severe droughts and pluvials) than do the forward modeled pseudoproxies. However, access to long runs for isotope-enabled models from more modeling agencies is required before generalizations can be made about such model-proxy comparisons.",

            "abstract": "In the geosciences, interoperability is a fundamental requirement. Members of various standards organizations such as the OGC and ISO-TC 211 have done yeomen services to promote a standards-centric approach to manage the interoperability challenges that organizations face today. The specific challenges that organizations face when adopting interoperability patterns are very many. One approach, that of mandating the use of specific standards has been reasonably successful. But scientific communities, as with all others, ultimately want their solutions to be widely accepted and used. And to this end there is a crying need to explore all possible interoperability patterns without restricting the choices to mandated standards. Standards are created by a slow and deliberative process that sometimes takes a long time to come to fruition and therefore sometime feel to fall short of user expectations. It seems therefore that organizations are left with a series of perceived orthogonal requirements when they want to pursue interoperability. They want a robust but agile solution, a mature approach that also needs to satisfy latest technology trends and so on.\nSustainable interoperability patterns need to be forward looking and should choose the patterns and paradigms of the Web 2.0 generation. To this end, the key is to choose platform technologies that embrace multiple interoperability mechanisms that are built on fundamental \"open\" principles and which align with popular mainstream patterns.\nWe seek to explore data-, metadata- and web service-related interoperability patterns through the prism of building solutions that encourage strong implementer and end-user engagement, improved usability and scalability considerations, and appealing developer frameworks that can grow the audience. The path to tread is not new, and the geocommunity only needs to observe and align its end goals with current Web 2.0 patterns to realize all the benefits that today we all take for granted as part of our everyday use of technology.",

These records provide opportunities to ‘ground-truth’ the paleo-record, fill in gaps in the historical record, and more confidently extent the paleo-record into deeper time. Here we present isotopic results from a stalagmite collected in northern Vietnam spanning 1200 to 1950 CE, a period with a rich historical record in Vietnam. This sample adds significantly to the relatively sparse paleoclimate record from Southeast Asia.\nThe record includes several multi-decadal positive excursions of ≥1 per mille in calcite δ18O. A preliminary age model, based on six U/Th ages, suggests possible correspondence to noted droughts from the historical record, including the Angkor Droughts, the Ming Dynasty Drought, the Strange Parallels Drought, and the Victorian Holocaust Drought. As modeling studies indicate a strong correlation between rainfall δ18O and both the intensity of summer monsoon winds and summer rainfall over northern Vietnam (e.g., Liu et al., 2014), these excursions are consistent with a decrease in regional precipitation.\nThe Vietnam record shows an overall negative trend during the Little Ice Age. The study site is located well south of the westerly wind belt, ruling out a shift between monsoonal and mid-latitude circulation systems as a likely explanation for the northern Vietnam record.

            "abstract": "The quantification of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere is important for monitoring imbalances in their global budgets between sources and sinks and their changes in time. Nitrous oxide (N2O) is a strong radiative trace gas with a GWP of ~300 times CO2 over a 100 year period and an atmospheric lifetime of ~100 years. The preindustrial revolution background concentration of N2O was ~270 ppb. Today, the concentration is ~330 ppb. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) is another potent greenhouse gas with a long lifetime (800 to 3200 years) and very large GWP (~23000 times CO2 over a 100 year period). Its current atmospheric concentration is low (~8 ppt today). Direct measurements of N2O and SF6 in air prior to the mid-1990s are few. Over 200 archived atmospheric gas samples collected at Cape Meares, Oregon between 1977 and 1998 were analyzed for their N2O and SF6 concentrations using an Agilent (model 6890 N) gas chromatograph fitted with an electron capture detector using a two column “heart-cut” technique. Precision of measurement of N2O and SF6 is calculated at 0.13% (1σ) and 1.35% (1σ) respectively. N2O concentrations in the late 1970s and early 1980s average around 303 ppb, rising to 309 ppb in the early 1990s. Between 1980 and 1990, the increase in N2O concentrations is found to be ~0.5 ppb/yr. SF6 concentrations during the late 1970s and early 1980s average around 0.9 ppt and rise slowly, reaching 1.6 ppt in the 1990s. We find that the increase in SF6 between 1980 and 1990 to be ~0.07 ppt/yr. We also discuss sample integrity in storage and observed temporal trends of N2O and SF6.",

            "abstract": "Surface wave tomography using ambient noise sources has found broad application at the regional scale but has not been adopted fully for geotechnical applications despite the abundance of noise sources in this context. The recent development of Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) provides a clear path for inexpensively recording high spatial resolution (< 1m sampling) surface wave data in the context of infrastructure monitoring over significant spatial domains (10s of km). Infrastructure monitoring is particularly crucial in the context of high-latitude installations where a changing global climate can trigger reductions in soil strength due to permafrost thaw. DAS surface wave monitoring systems, particularly those installed in/near transport corridors and coupled to ambient noise inversion algorithms, could be a critical “early warning” system to detect zones of decreased shear strength before failure.\nWe present preliminary ambient noise tomography results from a 1.3 km continuously recording subsurface DAS array used to record traffic noise next to an active road in Fairbanks, AK. The array, depolyed at the Farmer's Loop Permafrost Test Station, was designed as a narrow 2D array and installed via trenching at ~30 cm. We develop a pre-processing and QC approach to analyze the large resulting volume of data, equivalent to a 1300 geophone array sampled at 1 khz. We utilize automated dispersion analysis and a quasi-2D MC inversion to generate a shear wave velocity profile underneath the road in a region of discontinuous permafrost. The results are validated against a high-resolution ERT survey as well as direct-push data on ice content. We also compare vintages of ambient noise DAS data to evaluate the short-term repeatability of the technique in the face of changing noise environments. The resulting dataset demonstrates the utility of using DAS for real-time shear-modulus monitoring in support of critical infrastructure.",

            "abstract": "Urban ecosystems are unique earth environments because both their physical and social components contribute to the overall dynamics of the system. Up-to-date, remote sensing data (e.g. optical and LiDAR) allowed researchers to monitor the development of impervious surfaces however, it was not adequate to detect associated social dynamics. Geo-located social media (e.g. Twitter) provides a data source to detect population dynamics and understand the interaction of people with their physical environment. Although, integrating social media with remote sensing data has been hindered by large volumes of data and the lack of models for integrating remote sensing products with unstructured social media data. In this research work, we leveraged the NSF chameleon cloud computing platform to provide virtual clusters and elastic auto-scaling of resources that are needed for the synthesis of landuse and geo-located Twitter data. In this context, data synthesis was used to address research questions related to population dynamics in major metropolitan areas. We provide an overview of a cloud computing workflow comprised of a set of coupled scalable synthesis modules for: a) preprocessing data, which includes storage and query of heterogeneous data streams, b) spatial data integration, which matches geo-located Twitter data with user defined landuse maps based on a conceptual model of human mobility and c) visualization of urban mobility patterns. Our results demonstrate the flexibility to connect data, synthesis methods and computing resources using cloud computing, which would be otherwise very difficult for untrained scientists to setup and control. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capabilities of CyberGIS-based workflow using the case study of comparing commuting distances across major US cities from 2013 through the present. We demonstrate how our workflow will support discoveries in urban ecological studies as well as linking human and physical dimensions in environmental research.",

These reanalyses were explicitly designed to achieve improved homogeneity through assimilation of a fixed subset of (mostly surface) observations. We apply structural breakpoint analysis to evaluate inhomogeneity of the surface air temperature in these reanalyses (1851-2011). For the modern satellite era (1979-2013), we intercompare their inhomogeneity to that of all eleven available satellite reanalyses. Where possible, we distinguish between breakpoints that are likely linked to climate variability and those that are likely due to an artificial observational network shift. ERA-20C is found to be the most homogenous reanalysis, with 40% fewer artificial breaks than 20CR V2c. Despite its gains in homogeneity, continued improvements to ERA-20C are needed. In this presentation, we highlight the most spatially extensive artificial break events in ERA-20C.",

            "abstract": "The Steens Basalt (~16.7 Ma) of SE Oregon is the oldest member and contains the most mafic compositions of the Columbia River Flood Basalt (CRB) event. The lower Steens lavas are more mafic and incompatible element poor than upper Steens flows, which are less magnesian, mildly alkalic, richer in incompatible elements, and mainly basaltic andesites, much like the CRB proper.\nAt Steens Mountain, the lower Steens are thickest and comprise 35-40 mainly compound flows with modest soil development between, suggesting a period of slower effusion rate transitioning to high effusion rates as represented by stratigraphically higher flows that make up the prominent cliffs of the range. Stronger soil development between the uppermost flows implies a waning effusion rate.\nWhole rock major element data define two distinct trends in the lower Steens; the first has increasing Al2O3 with decreasing MgO at relatively low FeO, whereas the second exhibits increasing Al2O3 with decreasing MgO until an inflection point (~8 wt.% MgO), at which both Al2O3 and MgO decrease. Plagioclase mode is not coupled with Al2O3. MELTS closed system fractionation models across a range of pressures cannot reproduce these trends, suggesting open-system processes were at work.\nOlivine is homogeneous in some flows (~Fo80-78), but heterogeneous in others (~Fo84-62). Fo range does not correlate with whole rock MgO; two different flows with >10 wt.% MgO have Fo85-70 and Fo84-82. Plagioclase composition is restricted within and between flows (~An75-60). All these data suggest lower Steens magmas underwent large amounts of crystal fractionation and recharge with modest assimilation. Some assimilation requires an aluminous contaminant other than simple plagioclase accumulation. During other periods, magma mixing must have been efficient. Magma Chamber Simulator modeling will provide quantitative estimates for the roles of fractionation, recharge and assimilation in the lower Steens magma system.",

Black Carbon (BC), Brown Carbon (BrC) and dust are considered of great climatic importance and are the main absorbers of sunlight in the atmosphere. Furthermore, wet and dry deposition of light absorbing particles (LAPs) on snow and ice cause reduction of snow and ice albedo. LAPs have significant radiative forcing and effect on snow albedo. There are high uncertainties in estimating radiative forcing of LAPs. We studied the potential effect of LAPs from different emission source regions and sectors on snow albedo in the Arctic. The transport pathway of LAPs to the Arctic is studies for different high pollution episodes. In this study a modeling framework including Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) and the University of Iowa's Sulfur Transport and dEpostion model(STEM) is used to predict the transport of LAPs from different geographical sources and sectors (i.e. transportation, residential, industry, biomass burning and power) to the Arctic. For assessing the effect of LAP deposition on snow single-layer simulator of the SNow, Ice, and Aerosol Radiation (SNICAR-Online) model was used to derive snow albedo values for snow albedo reduction causes by BC deposition. To evaluate the simulated values we compared the BC concentration in snow with observed values from previous studies including Doherty et al. 2010. ",

However, the behavior of these transient poloidal waves that are driven by wave-particle interaction has not been studied well. In this presentation, we have conducted three-dimensional MHD simulations in dipole geometry to investigate the time-dependent behavior of the local wave fields at various locations. We examine how the time evolution of the wave modes varies when local sources are assumed with different widths. Here, a localized impulsive wave source represents a particle injection in a limited region, and thus its width can be indicative of differential azimuthal states. Our results show that the poloidal mode remains for a longer period of time when the perturbation is imposed in a narrower region in local time, which is consistent with previous studies that the poloidal mode with higher m has longer lifetime than lower m. We also present the effect of the prolonged interaction during which the waves are excited by particles on lifetime of the poloidal mode. It is suggested that the temporal variation of the observed transient poloidal mode waves can imply how they interact with the high-energy particles.",

It is important to understand how much slip occurs and how slip migrates after the earthquakes. M6.8 Chengkung earthquake is one of largest earthquakes in Taiwan in recent years. Previous studies estimate accumulative afterslip distribution from 3 to 6 months after the main shock. However, the inferred slip distributions are inconsistent. Here we analyze the postseismic slip evolution of the Chengkung earthquake by using time series from about 40 stations. The GPS data are from the Taiwan GPS website service of the Taiwan earthquake research center. We first fit secular velocity, antenna changes, coseismic displacements, and a presumed logarithmical pattern to each GPS time series by using a MCMC metropolis algorithm. Then we remove secular velocity and instantaneous signal offsets from the time series. In addition, we construct 3D fault geometry based on relocated ambient seismicity and regional tomography. We use a modified Network Inverse Filter to estimate spatiotemporal slip migration directly from GPS time series. This method can allow temporal smoothing parameter changes and simultaneously solve for slip and common model errors. With this method, we can imagine spatiotemporal slip evolution of afterslip postseismic deformation.",

            "abstract": "River and stream ecosystems experience highly variable inputs of water, nutrients, organic matter, heat, and light over the scales of hours to storms to seasons. Despite the unstable physical and chemical environments of such ecosystems, benthic and pelagic communities persist and even thrive. Whole-stream metabolism estimates allow us to quantify the overall activity of these diverse and responsive communities. They also provide a holistic way to assess how the temporal patterns of that activity are structured by streams’ dynamic hydrology and resource availability. We synthesized continental-scale datasets of high-frequency dissolved oxygen, discharge, water temperature, and light to estimate metabolism in over 200 streams to answer the question, “What are the drivers of synchrony and divergence in the temporal patterns of metabolism among streams of North America?” We find that short-term disturbances in the form of storms and cloudy days have strong proximate, dampening effects on whole-ecosystem metabolism; however, despite these strong proximate effects, streams with similar resource and discharge regimes are largely synchronous in their overall seasonal patterns. The median date of peak gross primary productivity is close to the summer solstice in June, while ecosystem respiration has two most-common annual peaks, one in early spring and another in mid fall. These differences in peak timing point to systematic differences at the continental scale in the timing of light versus organic matter availability, with consequent seasonality in net ecosystem productivity.",

            "abstract": "Designing sustainable water resources systems is challenging given the natural scarcity of this resources in certain region and the increasing anthropogenic water demand for economic purposes. The overall goal of this study is to develop an empirical hydrologic model (one bucket model) that can adequately represent the hydrology and water resources management in the Apurimac River Basin (ARB) in Peru. The specific objectives are to: (a) develop the empirical hydrologic model, calibrate and validate it (b) build a water allocation model (c) evaluate their water supply performance with different series of scenarios (i) current and future water demands, (ii) with and without the construction of the reservoir under different hydrologic conditions (normal, dry and wet). Water Evaluation And Planning (WEAP) was used to build the model and evaluate different water allocation strategies, new infrastructure, and assess current and future water needs based on the requirement of the Regional Government of Cuzco and Arequipa. The proposed hydrologic model is a one-bucket model, where the processes of direct runoff, interflow and baseflow are represented and the process of groundwater recharge is the vertical outflow from the bottom of the bucket. Also, this model includes groundwater component which is an imperative process to consider in the valley of this basin because it provides adequate results, as shown later for this basin. Water allocation model estimate the quantity of water available to different demand sites within a river basin at different times. This study explains their impact in the analysis of the water availability and water supply for current and future water demands in the ARB with and without reservoir.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the processes by which pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) are emplaced is crucial for volcanic hazard prediction and assessment. Snow and ice can facilitate PDC generation by lowering the coefficient of friction and by causing secondary hydrovolcanic explosions, promoting remobilisation of proximally deposited material. Where PDCs travel over snow or ice, the reduction in surface roughness and addition of steam and meltwater signficantly changes the flow dynamics, affecting PDC velocities and runout distances. Additionally, meltwater generated during transit and after the flow has come to rest presents an immediate secondary lahar hazard that can impact areas many tens of kilometers beyond the intial PDC. This, together with the fact that deposits emplaced on ice are rarely preserved means that PDCs over ice have been little studied despite the prevalence of summit ice at many tall stratovolcanoes. At Ruapehu volcano in the North Island of New Zealand, a monolithologic welded PDC deposit with unusually rounded clasts provides textural evidence for having been transported over glacial ice. Here, we present the results of high-resolution multiphase numerical PDC modeling coupled with experimentaly determined rates of water and steam production for the Ruapehu deposits in order to assess the effect of ice on the Ruapehu PDC. The results suggest that the presence of ice significantly modified the PDC dynamics, with implications for assessing the PDC and associated lahar hazards at Ruapehu and other glaciated volcanoes worldwide.",

            "abstract": "Climate model simulations are used to understand the evolution and variability of earth’s climate. Unfortunately, high-resolution multi-decadal climate simulations can take days to weeks to complete. Typically, the simulation results are not analyzed until the model runs have ended. During the course of the simulation, the output may be processed periodically to ensure that the model is preforming as expected. However, most of the data analytics and visualization are not performed until the simulation is finished. The lengthy time period needed for the completion of the simulation constrains the productivity of climate scientists. Our implementation of near real-time data visualization analytics capabilities allows scientists to monitor the progress of their simulations while the model is running. Our analytics software executes concurrently in a co-scheduling mode, monitoring data production. When new data are generated by the simulation, a co-scheduled data analytics job is submitted to render visualization artifacts of the latest results. These visualization output are automatically transferred to Bellerophon’s data server located at ORNL’s Compute and Data Environment for Science (CADES) where they are processed and archived into Bellerophon’s database. During the course of the experiment, climate scientists can then use Bellerophon’s graphical user interface to view animated plots and their associated metadata. The quick turnaround from the start of the simulation until the data are analyzed permits research decisions and projections to be made days or sometimes even weeks sooner than otherwise possible! The supercomputer resources used to run the simulation are unaffected by co-scheduling the data visualization jobs, so the model runs continuously while the data are visualized. Our just-in-time data visualization software looks to increase climate scientists’ productivity as climate modeling moves into exascale era of computing.",

With adding GOSAT retrievals to the flux estimation, we found enhanced fluxes in tropical Africa (17% from a priori and 10% from flux estimates using ground-based observations only, called Inv.GB), tropical and subtropical South America (12% and 9% respectively), and East Asia (21% and 6% respectively), but lowered fluxes in South and Southeast Asia (12% and 14% respectively). Overall, a larger year-to-year variation of estimated fluxes was found in Inv.GG. In 2010, raging fires occurred in Brazil and Bolivia under severe drought, and the highest biomass burning fluxes in central part of South America were estimated in 2010 during the simulation period 2010-2012. The intensity of the 2010 biomass burning flux was enhanced in Inv.GG compared with a priori of GFED v3.1 and Inv.GB. In Russia, two fire events occurred in 2010 and 2012 under very hot and relatively dry condition. The 2010 fires occurred over European Russia, and a large departure from the GFED estimates was not shown in both Inv.GB and Inv.GG. For the 2012 fires in eastern and central Russia, the severity was explained by the 2012 highest biomass burning fluxes over Siberia during the simulation period 2010-2012. The biomass burning fluxes in Inv.GG were similar to a priori, but lower than Inv.GB (particularly in the eastern part of Siberia). In Inv.GG, the Jun-Aug biomass burning fluxes account for ~14% of the annual mean Siberian total flux in 2010-2012.",

            "abstract": "The systems of algebraic equations arising from implicit (backward-Euler) finite-volume discretization of the conservation laws governing multiphase flow in porous media are quite challenging for nonlinear solvers. In the presence of counter-current flow due to buoyancy, the coupling between flow (pressure) and transport (saturations) is often the cause of nonlinear problems when single-point Phase-Potential Upwinding (PPU) is used. To overcome such convergence problems in practice, the time step is reduced and Newton’s method is restarted from the solution at the previous converged time step. Here, we generalize the work of Lee, Efendiev and Tchelepi [Advances in Water Resources, 2015] to propose an Implicit Hybrid Upwinding (IHU) scheme for coupled flow and transport. In the pure transport problem, we show that the numerical flux obtained with IHU is differentiable, monotone and consistent for two and three-phase flow. For coupled flow and transport, we prove saturation physical bounds as well as the existence of a solution to our scheme. Challenging two- and three-phase heterogeneous multi-dimensional numerical tests confirm that the new scheme is non-oscillatory and convergent, and illustrate the superior convergence rate of our IHU-based Newton solver for large time steps.",

            "abstract": "Megadrought is one of the most significant and costly climate extremes, and one that stakeholders (e.g., water and other resource managers) the world over wish to understand better; in particular, they need estimates of the risk of severe droughts as a function of drought frequency, severity, duration, and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration. In many dry-climate regions of the globe, megadrought is synonymous with multi-decadal drought. However, in other regions, megadrought can be defined as extended drought, mostly not seen in the period of instrumental observations, and that would have large impacts if it were to occur in the future. New and published paleoclimatic observations allow us to understand the spectrum of drought in many regions of the globe; droughts exceeding 50 years have occurred in recent Earth history in southwestern North America, sub-Saharan Africa, the Mediterranean and Australia, whereas shorter megadroughts have occurred in Monsoon Asia, Amazonia and elsewhere. Data-model comparisons for regions with sufficiently long (e.g., 1000-2000 years) records of observed hydroclimatic variability suggest that state-of-the-art models can provide realistic estimates of interannual to decadal drought risk, but underestimate the risk of megadrought. Likely reasons for this shortcoming are the lack of sufficient multi-decadal variability in simulations of the past and future, plus an underappreciated understanding about how temperature variability and land-surface feedbacks interact with hydrological and ecological drought, as well as the roles played by unusually wet hydroclimatic extremes (e.g., ENSO related) in ending droughts of long duration. Paleoclimatic records also provide the opportunity to estimate how much models underestimate megadrought risk as a function of locale, frequency, severity, duration, and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration; they also aid in providing stakeholders with bias-corrected estimates of megadrought risk.",

In the first case, we learned how to extract one coordinate, azimuth information, on the occurrence of an earthquake based on the processing of mono-polar pulses received at a single station. A two dimensional geometry was implemented through triangulation and we showed the use of this technique to find out where a future epicenter would occur. Recently, we have obtained compelling evidence that the pressure points leading to the determination of future epicenters originate at a plane, inclined with the same angle as the subduction zone, a three-dimensional position of the future hypocenter. Hence, an image of the subduction zone or interface between the Nazca plate and the continental plate in the northern area of Lima, Peru, has been obtained, corresponding to the subduction zone obtained by traditional seismic methods.\nOur work with magnetometers deployed along part of the Peruvian coast since 2009, has shown that it is possible to measure, with significant precision, the azimuth of electromagnetic pulses propagating from stress points in the earth’s crust due to the subduction of tectonic plates, as to be able to determine precisely the origin of the pulses. The occurrence of earthquakes approximately 11 to 18 days after the appearance of the first pulses and the recognition of grouping of such pulses, has allowed us to determine accurately the direction and the timing of future seismic events. Magnetometers, donated by Quakefinder and Telefonica del Peru were then strategically installed in different locations in Peru with the purpose of achieving triangulation. During two years since 2013, about a dozen earthquakes have been associated with future seismic activity in a pre or post occurrence way.\nOur presentation will be based on animated data in video form and as events occur day by day, depicting the formation of the future epicenter and the 3-D position of pressure points on the subduction zone, as a dozen earthquakes occur during 2013 and 2014 in Central Peru.\nTriangulation of pulses for EQs in 2013- 2014 Image of subduction zone from the same data points 20",

Susquehanna River, the bay’s largest tributary, has drawn attention because SS load from behind Conowingo Dam (near the river fall-line) has risen dramatically recently. To better understand these changes, we evaluated decadal-scale (1986-2013) history of concentrations and fluxes using data from sites above and below the reservoir. First, observed concentration-discharge relationships show declined SS and TP concentrations at the reservoir inlet under most discharges in recent years, but such changes have not been propagated to emerge at the outlet, implying recently diminished reservoir trapping. Second, best estimates of loadings show declined net depositions of SS and TP in recent decades, which occurred under a range of discharges, with the 75th~99.5th percentile of Conowingo discharge dominating such changes and carrying most sediment/nutrient loadings. Finally, stationary models that better accommodate effects of riverflow variability also show diminished reservoir trapping of SS and TP, which occurred under a range of flows including those well below the literature-documented scour threshold. These findings have significant implications in regard to our understanding and management of this major reservoir and illustrate the value of long-term monitoring programs.",

Existing missions, such as OCO-2, may also require high turn-around time for processing different science scenarios where on-premise and even traditional HPC computing environments may not meet the high processing needs.\nWe present our experiences on deploying a hybrid-cloud computing science data system (HySDS) for the OCO-2 Science Computing Facility to support large-scale processing of their Level-2 full physics data products. We will explore optimization approaches to getting best performance out of hybrid-cloud computing as well as common issues that will arise when dealing with large-scale computing. Novel approaches were utilized to do processing on Amazon’s spot market, which can potentially offer ~10X costs savings but with an unpredictable computing environment based on market forces. We will present how we enabled high-tolerance computing in order to achieve large-scale computing as well as operational cost savings.",

            "abstract": "Terpenes are a category of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) produced by many plants, most notably coniferous plants. Commonly, these terpenes are aromatic compounds. The intensity of terpene emission varies depending greatly on light and temperature. Through remote sensing data as well as ASD spectroradiometry data this study focuses on locating sources of terpene emissions in the Teakettle Experimental Forest. These emissions are of particular concern because of their influence on the chemical concentration of the lower troposphere, as well as being an indicator of tree health.\nA novel approach has been designed through this study in order to locate and further understand these terpene emissions. Terpenes such as camphene have been reported to have subtle spectral features located at around 1.7 μm. For the first time, a map of terpene sources has been constructed by accentuating this particular feature. A continuum interpolated band ratio (CIBR) was used in order to compute a relative abundance of terpenes from the AVIRIS data. The CIBR equation showed promise, as terpenes were most strongly concentrated in areas of coniferous vegetation (a primary source of terpenes) and were less prominent over bodies of water or industrialized areas. The greatest concentrations were focused over treetops and other woody vegetation.\nAlthough it is known that terpenes have weak absorption features in the SWIR, there is little information available regarding the mapping of terpene emissions. This project addresses a novel approach to observing biochemical components in the lower troposphere and could potentially give more information to explain the health of forest ecosystems.",

Variations in wedge geometries provide an opportunity to evaluate the effects of sediment supply versus accommodation on foreland basin stratal architecture. There is an increase in eastward progradation rate between the Lower and Upper Castlegate Sandstone. However, the progradation rate decreases in the overlying Bluecastle and Price River formations, as well as the laterally equivalent Farrer and Tuscher formations. Rapid progradation during Upper Castlegate deposition may be caused by increased sediment supply from either rapid exhumation of the Sevier thrust belt or changes in the sediment source. Alternatively, reduced accommodation within the proximal foreland basin from uplifts associated with Laramide deformation, or a transition from flexural to dynamic subsidence, could produce the same observed rapid wedge progradation. We identify changes in sediment provenance and source-area exhumation rate using detrital zircon geochronology. Initial detrital zircon U-Pb data reveals a significant up-section and spatial shift in provenance between all wedge boundaries. Quantitative comparisons between new and previously published detrital zircon U-Pb provenance data indicates an overall up-section decrease in thrust-belt-sourced Mesozoic eolianite and North American passive-margin source areas coupled with an increase in southern magmatic arc and Mogollon Highland source. We observe an east-west diachroneity in the arrival of the southern-sourced sediment, but little to no variation from samples along a north-south transect. Initial results suggest the shift in sediment source is not consistent with an increased exhumation rate of the source area, although further work using thermochronology is required to better understand the exhumation rate.",

We use this approach to investigate how differences in vegetation/land cover at three different field sites in Caribou Bog, Maine may alter such gas dynamics. The three study sites are characterized by: [1] a site amid standing pools of water with approximately 6 m of peat overlying an esker deposit, [2] a site dominated by low shrubs near the pools with peat down to 6.75 m, and [3] a site consisting of shrubs and trees with peat down to 6.4 m. A time-lapse series of GPR common offset (CO) and common midpoint (CMP) data were collected within hours of each other at all three sites using 100 MHz antennas during July 2013. In many cases, reciprocal data (transmitter and receiver positions switched) were also collected to gain insight on systematic errors. Water level variations and other environmental parameters were logged continuously at or near the sites, and limited gas sampling data were collected at sites [2] and [3].\nVertical 1D distributions of gas content with depth from each GPR dataset were estimated through CMP velocity analysis and application of a three component mixing model. These results were compared with CO data to observe changes in gas content along transects at each site. Preliminary results suggest site [1] (the pools site) has the highest overall gas content and exhibits the most variability in gas content through time. Despite several failed attempts to automate data acquisition in the field, manual acquisition still proves immensely valuable for quantitatively estimating spatiotemporal variability of gas content in a rapid and efficient manner in peatland ecosystems. In this case, the non-invasive monitoring of gas content variations demonstrates how free phase gas dynamics in peatlands varies with vegetation composition.",

Given the importance of Zn in the modern oceans, we developed a Zn isotope approach to track the extent of Zn limitation and eukaryotic production through Earth’s history. Specifically, we use the isotopic systematics of the pyrite (δ66Znpyr), rock extracts (bitumen) and kerogen pyrolysate (δ66Znorg) within euxinic black shales. We show that δ66Znpyr of euxinic core-top muds from the Cariaco basin capture the global deep seawater signature, validating its use as a seawater proxy. Additionally, we propose that Δ66Znpyr-org can be used to track surface water zinc bioavailability. Detailed studies of short-lived oceanic anoxic events such as Cretaceous OAE2, which punctuate an otherwise dominantly oxic Phanerozoic world, exhibit dramatic shifts in seawater δ66Zn and organic bound zinc. Such perturbations are consistent with the demise of eukaryotes under a nitrogen stressed regime, in which cyanobacteria carry the competitive advantage. Contradictory to previous models, however, our data suggest that zinc remained largely bioavailable throughout these anoxic intervals despite significant drawdown of the global reservoir. The framework developed from studies of the modern, Cenozoic, and Mesozoic can be used to track the Precambrian evolution of the marine Zn cycle and the rise of eukaryotic algae to ecological dominance.",

            "abstract": "Arc magmatic processes, from differentiation to emplacement, depend crucially on the rate at which heat and magma are supplied to the arc crust. In active arcs, the total heat flow can be estimated relatively directly by measuring and quantifying the amounts of heat lost via conduction, hydrothermal circulation, and eruption. This total heat flow can be used to calculate the implied magmatic flux at depth. Alternatively, magmatic flux in active arcs can be estimated from measured rates of volatile emissions, usually SO2. Unfortunately, heat flow and volatile flux data sufficiently detailed to make these calculations exist for only a handful of active arcs. In the geologic record, rates of arc magmatic flux have most frequently been estimated by measuring the preserved volumes of intrusive and extrusive products and dividing by the geochronologically determined duration of arc activity. This can be converted to heat flow by assuming a certain amount of heat carried per volume of magma.\nThe ranges of magmatic flux estimated via either heat flow or SO2 are similar for modern arcs, but, on average, estimates from the geologic record are lower by about a factor of three (Fig. 1). This discrepancy may indicate that the assumption that preserved igneous rock volumes represent the total advective flux is a poor choice when interpreting the geologic record. Recycling of early solidified magma and loss of cumulates to the mantle may be important, i.e., the time-integrated advective flux might significantly exceed the net preserved intrusive volume. This is also supported by other lines of evidence, including geochemical mass-balance arguments, thermal models of basalt flux needed to allow substantial assimilation and/or crystal fractionation in the lower crust, high-temperature thermochronology in arcs, and thermal models of the conditions necessary to cause large, explosive eruptions from upper crustal magma chambers. Substantial recycling or convection within the arc crust is needed to sustain the heat flows required by these constraints and observed in the most active of modern arcs.",

            "abstract": "Thirty years have now passed since the discovery of the Antarctic ozone hole, and despite comprehensive international agreements being in place to phase out CFCs and halons, polar ozone losses generally remain severe. The relevant halogen compounds have very long atmospheric lifetimes, which ensures that seasonal polar ozone depletion will likely continue for decades to come. Changes in the climate system can further impact stratospheric ozone abundance through changes in the temperature and water vapor structure of the atmosphere and through the potential initiation of solar radiation management efforts. In many ways, the rate at which climate is changing must now be considered fast relative to the slow removal of halogens from the atmosphere. Photochemical models of Earth’s atmosphere play a critical role in understanding and projecting ozone levels, but in order for these models to be accurate, they must be built on a foundation of accurate laboratory data. ClOOCl is the centerpiece of the catalytic cycle that accounts for more than 50% of the chlorine-catalyzed ozone loss in the Arctic and Antarctic stratosphere every spring, and so uncertainties in the ultraviolet cross sections of ClOOCl are particularly important. Additionally, the equilibrium constant of the dimerization reaction of ClO merits further study, as there are important discrepancies between in situ measurements and lab-based models, and the JPL-11 recommended equilibrium constant includes high error bars at atmospherically relevant temperatures (~75% at 200 K). Here we analyze available data for the ClOOCl ultraviolet cross sections and equilibrium constant and present new laboratory spectroscopic results.",

            "abstract": "In June of 2014, pāhoehoe lava flows from the Puʻu ʻŌʻō eruption began threatening communities and infrastructure on eastern Hawaii Island. During the subsequent declared state of emergency by Hawaii Civil Defense and temporary flight restriction by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), we used a small fixed-wing Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) to collect high spatial and temporal resolution imagery over the active flow in support of natural hazard assessment by emergency managers. Integration of our UAS into busy airspace, populated by emergency aircraft and tour helicopters, required close operational coordination with the FAA and local operators. We logged >80 hours of UAS flight operations between October 2014 and March 2015, generating a dense time-series of 4-5 cm resolution imagery and derived topographic datasets using structure from motion. These data were used to monitor flow activity, document pre- and post- lava flow damage, identify hazardous areas for first responders, and model lava flow paths in complex topography ahead of the active flow front. Turnaround times for delivered spatial data products improved from 24-48 hours at the beginning of the study to ~2-4 hours by the end. Data from this project are being incorporated into cloud computing applications to shorten delivery time and extract useful analytics regarding lava flow hazards in near real-time. The lessons learned from this event have advanced UAS integration in disaster operations in U.S. airspace and show the high potential UAS hold for natural hazards assessment and real-time emergency management.",

            "abstract": "During episodic tremor and slip (ETS) events in the Cascadia subduction zone, tremor is accompanied by very low frequency earthquakes (VLFEs) that are responsible for the majority of the total moment release during an ETS event [Ghosh et al., GRL, 2015]. VLFEs characteristically emit energy in the 20-50s frequency range, but release minimal energy in higher frequency bands [e.g., Ito and Obara, GRL, 2006]. They can occur up- and downdip of the seismogenic zone [e.g., Walter et al., GRL, 2013; Asano et al., EPS, 2008] and are thought to be a result of the shear slip process on the subduction fault [Ghosh et al., GRL, 2015]. This study attempts to improve the efficiency and ability to detect VLFEs in Cascadia using a match filter technique [e.g., Shelley et al., Nature, 2007] that can detect events in data despite low signal to noise ratios. VLFE templates are selected from a 2011 ETS event. These template events are identified using a grid-search centroid moment tensor (CMT) inversion method [e.g., Ito and Obara, GRL, 2006], and typically consist of Mw 3.3 - 3.7 events with focal mechanisms consistent with the Cascadia subduction fault [Ghosh et al., GRL, 2015]. The templates are cross-correlated to continuous waveforms from the August 2011 ETS event. Candidate events are identified using six times the median absolute deviation. After eliminating the time windows with earthquakes listed in the Advanced National Seismic System composite catalog, the preliminary findings include a significant number of additional events. To further validate the match filter technique results, a grid-search CMT inversion algorithm is applied, providing focal mechanisms and source locations. Most of the events occur within or south of the Straight of Juan de Fuca, near the template event locations. Candidates with inconsistent focal mechanisms and low variance reduction values are discarded. Because these events have been confirmed with a match filter technique, visual inspection, and finally a CMT method, they can be used in future studies as additional templates to detect other VLFEs for a more robust VLFE catalog. Such a catalog can serve as a resource for a spatial-temporal analysis of their distribution, to inquiry further into the cause and mechanisms involved in slow earthquakes, and to investigate the relationship between tremor and VLFEs.",

            "abstract": "The microbial communities transported by Asian dust events have attracted much attention as bioaerosols because the transported airborne microbes may strongly influence the downwind ecosystems and potentially human health in East Asia. Bioaerosol study has received relatively little attention and their characterization and risk assessments remain poorly developed. We used high throughput 16S rRNA gene targeted pyrosequencing and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) to monitor airborne bacterial communities and assess their potential risk. We monitored microbial communities in bioaerosol in Seoul between 2011 and 2013 using high volume air samplers. Six samples were collected during Asian dust (AD) events and the other 34 samples were urban air collected during non-Asian dust (non-AD) events. According to the qPCR result, the gene copy numbers of 16S rRNA genes were significantly higher during the AD events (P < 0.05) and their abundances were positively correlated with PM10 concentrations and bacterial diversities. The most abundant bacterial members (genus level) in the AD samples were Bacillus, Neisseria and E.coli/Shigella. To identify pathogenic populations, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and virulence tests were applied using culture methods. 16S rRNA gene sequences of several pathogens were detected and their relative abundances appeared to have increased with increased concentrations of PM10. About 1% of Bacillus isolates were identified as known pathogenic B. cereus, confirming their presence in Asian dust samples. The qPCR detection of bceT gene, which codes for an enterotoxin in B. cereus group, was significantly increased in the AD dust samples over the non-AD samples. The following MLST assessment and virulence test of cultivated Bacillus isolates showed that B. cereus, B. licheniformis and B. mycoides were identified as pathogenic bacteria, and these pathogenic bacteria were usually more abundant during AD events. To assess the possible associations of identified pathogens on the hospital stroke admissions of residents in Seoul, we identified sixteen bioaerosol episodes using Poisson regression and calculated relative risk. The findings are useful in building a database for bacterial pathogens in AD events.",

            "abstract": "Volcanoes emit gases continuously with significant pre-post-eruption changes, mainly H2O and CO2, plus SO2, and others. The SO2/CO2 ratio changes within volcanic life cycles making it an indicator of oncoming eruption phases: it can dip weeks to months before eruptions, then increase, and decrease back to background after eruptions. Over the last five years, we have made an effort to develop small and inexpensive lighter-than-air and fixed wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms in Costa Rica at Turrialba Volcano. Turrialba is an appropriate natural laboratory to test and prove platforms and instrumentation in low-level steady state volcanogenic gas and aerosol emissions at moderate altitudes (<12Kft ASL), where good technical infrastructure exists, with good physical access to the volcano. Our program in Costa Rica includes: (1) systematic monitoring of Turrialba from orbit with the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection radiometer (ASTER), with its thermal infrared (TIR) camera for SO2 retrieval, and more recently with GOSAT and OCO-2 for CO2; (2) in situ observations from aerostats and UAVs during ASTER overpasses, and (3) reconciliation of the orbital results with in situ data to validate mass retrieval and transport models. As part of the NASA HyspIRI Preparatory Airborne Activities program, we will conduct similar observations at Kilauea volcano using small UAVs and for both SO2 and CO2 in situ. One of the salient characteristics of the long lived Kilauea eruptions since 1983 has been the emission of SO2 in significant amounts, generating environmental stresses on local inhabitants due to lowered air quality, and stress on vegetation. Kilauea volcanic plumes, as with Turrialba, are mainly gases and liquid--SO2 is hydrolyzed to H2SO4 and the resulting highly acidic liquid aerosol is termed “vog,” an environmental health hazard. Measurement of the diffuse CO2 emissions at Kilauea will also be of interest. Such measurements at Turrialba, indicate summit CO2 concentrations of up to 4000ppmv, and flank CO2 values of up to1500ppmv. We will discuss our SO2 and CO2 results at Turrialba and in Italy, and plans for Hawaii. Work presented here was done, in part, under contract to the NASA Earth Surface and Interior Focus Area, at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Poster_PEIsabelle_AGU_2015.pdf\nThe boreal forests are the predominant landscape of Canada, occupying 49% of its boreal zone or 27% of the country. Despite the tremendous amount of literature on such ecosystems, some gaps persist in our understanding of boreal forest evapotranspiration (ET), given that direct measurements are costly to obtain and therefore scarce in these remote territories. This is especially the case on sloped terrain, since the eddy covariance method is not traditionally used in such situations. These gaps lead to the implementation of the EVAP experimental project, which intends to produce a major leap in our understanding of the water and energy budgets of a sloped boreal forest. Starting in summer 2015, we heavily instrumented a watershed in the Montmorency Forest (47°17’ N; 71°10’ W), Quebec, Canada. Located in the Laurentian Mountains, the forest has a mean elevation of 750 m with peaks at 1000 m. The setup includes a 20-m flux tower with two separate sets of eddy correlation and net radiation measurements facing opposite directions, located over an almost mature boreal forest (logged ~20 years ago, 8-10 m trees). Eddy fluxes are also measured under the canopy with a similar setup, while a sub-watershed is instrumented with a 10-m flux tower using homologous instruments, this time on a much younger forest stand (logged ~10 years ago, 4-5 m trees). Both sites are characterized by a significant slope (~20%), facing northeast for the 20-m tower and west for the 10-m tower. With several other instruments, we are measuring every major components of both water and energy budgets, including the outgoing discharge of the watershed and subwatershed. The different slope orientations and local topography of both sites allow us to quantify the relationships between solar exposition, topographic shading and ET rates; these relationships being transposable to other mountainous forested catchments. We also investigate the presence of slope flows and assess their impact on local ET. Furthermore, this study evaluates ET differences between an actively growing forest and a mature one, providing insights on the effects past disturbances (e.g. fire, insects, logging, etc.) can have on ET rates as the forest grows.",

            "abstract": "In southeast and south Asia, the previous satellite observations suggest that the methane emission from rice paddies is significant and important source of methane during rainy season. Since it is difficult to measure methane stably and continuously at rural areas such as the paddy fields in terms of infrastructures and maintenances, there are large uncertainties in quantitative estimation of methane emission in these areas and there are needs for more certification between satellite and ground based measurements. To measure methane concentrations continuously at difficult situations such as the center of paddy fields　and wetlands, we developed the continuous in-situ measurement system, not to look for your lost keys under the streetlight.\nThe methane gas sensor is used an open-path laser based measurement instrument (LaserMethane, ANRITSU CORPORATION), which can quickly and selectively detect average methane concentrations on the optical path of the laser beam. The developed system has the power supply and telecommunication system to run the laser gas sensor in rural areas with poor electricity infrastructure.\nThe methane measurement system was installed at paddy fields of Sonepat, Haryana on the north of Delhi in India and has been operated from the end of 2014. The air sampling along with our measurement has been carried out once a week during daytime to calibrate the laser instrument. We found that the seasonal variation of methane concentrations was different from the satellite observations and there were significant diurnal variations, which it was difficult to detect from occasional air samplings. We will present details of the measurement system and recent results of continuous methane measurements in India.",

            "abstract": "Climate sensitivity is the change in global equilibrium surface temperature per doubling of atmospheric ρCO2. Modern climate sensitivity, based on paleoclimate data and fast-feedback processes (Charney sensitivity), is observed to be ~3°C per doubling of CO2. However, Charney sensitivity may not be representative of ice-free hothouse states that have dominated most of Earth history where sensitivity may be higher. Few opportunities exist to empirically determine climate sensitivity during a hothouse state based on contemporaneous observations of ρCO2 and temperature. Here we present evidence for tight coupling between ρCO2 and temperature during the Late Triassic (end-Norian through Rhaetian) from the Newark basin and Lagonegro/Sicani basins, respectively. Detailed magnetostratigraphy and biostratigraphy allows for correlation between the Lagonegro and Sicani basins (Italy), which are magnetostratigraphically correlated to the Newark basin. Temperature is calculated from δ18O values of conodont apatite published from the Lagonegro and Sicani basins, while ρCO2 estimates are from pedogenic carbonates in the Newark basin. We find a distinct rise and subsequent fall in atmospheric ρCO2 that is precisely mirrored by a contemporaneous rise and fall in temperature. Between 212-209 Ma, we observe a concomitant increase in ρCO2 (1900 to 4800 ppm) and temperature (20 to 27°C), followed by a more protracted concomitant decrease in atmospheric ρCO2 (4800 to 2200 ppm) and temperature (27 to 21°C) from 209-202 Ma. We use simple numerical methods to calculate climate sensitivity for the Late Triassic from these complementary data sets and find that sensitivity through both a doubling and subsequent halving of pCO2 are on the order of 5°C, in close agreement with empirically based model assessments from younger sections. We note sensitivities as high as 7°C/doubling are observed when using the lowest pCO2 estimate allowed by the formal error window assigned to the paleosol data. These are the oldest contemporaneous and tightly coupled ρCO2 and temperature estimates, and among the only empirical indications of enhanced Earth System Sensitivity in a demonstrably ice-free world, confirming previous findings that climate sensitivity is enhanced during a hothouse state when compared to the modern.",

However regional studies have shown that there is variability in the location and rate of strain accumulation which appears to be driven by Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT) geometry and convergence obliquity. GPS illuminates the modern interseismic strain rate and the historical record of great earthquakes elucidates variations in strain accumulation over 103 years. To connect these patterns with the 106 year structural and thermochronometric geologic record we examine normalized river channel steepness (ksn), a proxy for rock uplift rate, which develops over 104 – 105 years. Here we present a ksn map of the Himalaya and compare it with bedrock geology, precipitation, the historic earthquake record, GPS, seismicity, and seismotectonic models. Our map shows significant along strike changes in the magnitude of channel steepness, the areal extent of swaths of high ksn channels, and their location with respect to the range front. Differences include the juxtaposition of two narrow (30 – 40 km) range parallel belts of high ksn in west Nepal and Bhutan coincident with MHT duplexes and belts of microseismcity, with a single broad (70 km) swath of high ksn and microseismicity in central and eastern Nepal. Separating west and central Nepal a band of low ksn crosses the range coincident with the West Nepal Fault (WNF) and the lowest rate of microseismicity in Nepal. To the west the orogen is obliquely convergent and has less high ksn channels, while the orthogonally convergent region to the east contains the highest concentration of oversteepened channels in the Himalaya supporting the idea that the WNF is a strain partitioning boundary. The syntaxes are characterized by locally high channel steepness surrounded by low to moderate ksn channels consistent with the hypothesis that rapid exhumation within the syntaxes is sustained by an influx of lower crust.",

This is allowing elastic strain build up on blind thrusts beneath the city to be accurately evaluated using GPS.\nOil Fields.\nPumping and repressurization of oil fields have generated substantial displacement in metropolitan Los Angeles, causing Beverly Hills, downtown, and Whittier to subside at 3-10 mm/yr and Santa Fe Springs and La Mirada to rise at 5-9 mm/yr.\nAquifers.\nDisplacements of the Santa Ana and San Gabriel Valley aquifers accumulate in response to sustained changes in groundwater over periods of either drought or heavy precipitation. Santa Ana aquifer has subsided nearly 0.1 m in response to lowering of the groundwater level by about 25 m over the past 18 years.\nAnthropogenic Vs. Tectonic Motion.\nWe are assessing horizontal motions due to changes groundwater using an empirical relationship established on the basis of seasonal oscillations of Santa Ana aquifer. Anthropogenic horizontal motion is estimated to be proportional to the directional gradient in vertical motion inferred with InSAR. We are finding this rough approximation to be quite useful for evaluating deviations of GPS positions from a constant velocity. We are also constructing Mogi models of volume change in oil fields to evaluate GPS deviations.\nEarthquake Strain Buildup on Blind Thrust Faults.\nNNE contraction perpendicular to the big restraining bend in the San Andreas fault is fastest not immediately south of the San Andreas in the San Gabriel Mountains, but instead 50 km south of the fault in northern metropolitan Los Angeles. An elastic model of interseismic strain accumulation fit to GPS data and incorporating a 1D approximation of the rheology of the Los Angeles basin indicates the deep segment of the Puente Hills (–upper Elysian Park) Thrust to be slipping at 9 ±2 mm/yr beneath a locking depth of 12 ±5 km. Please see also our complementary study [Rollins et al., AGU 2015] exploring elastic models with 3D geometry. This 9 mm/yr geodetic slip rate for the Puente Hills Thrust system is faster than the 3-5 mm/yr cumulative geologic slip rate for the upper Elysian Park and Puente Hills Thrust, indicating that M 6.5 and M 7 earthquakes in metropolitan Los Angeles are more frequent than forecast.",

Glacial movement, specifically that involving supra/under glacial hydrological channel activities, may hold the key for understanding the acceleration of Greenland’s ice sheet change and needs to be investigated in depth and established as an integrated model. The test area on which the above studies were conducted was in the Russell glacier in western Greenland, where glacial change has been obvious for the last century and significant fluvial flows occur in meltwater outflow channels, such as the Akuliarusiarsuup Kuua and Qinnguata Kuussua rivers.\nAll tasks in the study were conducted in three stages: 1) collecting 3D migration vectors combining C and L band differential interferometric SAR (D-InSAR) analysis, together with the in-house pixel tracking method employing optical flow and sub-pixel refinement; 2) a 2D hydrodynamic simulation based on the channel bathymetry, which was driven from calibrated LANDSAT images together with along-track stereo DTM; and 3) the model inversion to extract the bedrock height and the physical processes under the glaciers. Throughout those approaches, the researchers intended to identify firstly the interconnected processes between subglacier melt water flow and glacial migration, and also the model establishments of the involved processes.\nConsequently, the study revealed highly important clues about glacial migration. First of all, the importance of hydrological channel morphology as a governing factor over glaciers’ outflowed total melt water was identified. Also, it became clear that the reconstruction of sub glacial processes and morphology are feasible by employing remote sensing observations and model inversions. Those experiences will naturally lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the processes on the terminus of glacier.\nThe overall results from these approaches were compared and validated against published bedrock heights and ice thicknesses. Based on the output of this study, the proposed method will be extended to a scheme to tackle the issues of ice sheet change occurring in the Greenland costal area.",

Solar storms and solar wind charged particles (plasma) cause \"space weather\" via their interaction with Earth's protective magnetic shield, the magnetosphere. The Planeterrella uses magnetized spheres in a vacuum chamber to demonstrate solar wind energy transfer to Earth and planets, with polar localization of aurora due to charged particles traveling along geomagnetic field lines. The Planeterrella provides a unique opportunity to experience and manipulate plasma, the dominant form of matter in our universe, yet seldom observable on Earth. Severe space weather events produce spectacular auroral displays as well as devastating consequences: radiation exposure to air and space travelers, prolonged radio blackouts, and damage to critical GPS and communications satellites.\nWe will (1) discuss ways in which the Planeterrella may be most useful in classroom settings, including large lecture halls, laboratories, and small discussion sessions; (2) provide information on how instructors can produce their own Planeterrella for their courses; and (3) invite meeting attendees to engage in a discussion on how we might be able to improve on the current design of the Planeterrella, and how to reach students in more parts of the world.",

Computational simulations are often employed to study both the velocity field within and immediately above wind farms. In many computational studies, wind turbines are modeled as stationary, porous actuator discs. A wind tunnel study is done in order to compare the wakes within an array of porous discs and an equivalent array of model wind turbines. To characterize the wakes within a 4×3 model wind farm, stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (SPIV) is employed. SPIV measurements focus on the region along the centerline of the array upstream and downstream of the center turbine in the fourth row. The computed mean flow fields and turbulent stresses provide a basis to compare the near and far wakes of the turbines with those of the porous discs. The detailed analysis of the wakes for each case focus on the mean kinetic energy budget within the wakes. Examining the mean kinetic energy budget is done via computing the mean kinetic energy, flux of kinetic energy, and production of turbulence which are analogous to a measure of extracted power.",

            "abstract": "While much attention has been focused on large scale forest disturbances such as fire, harvesting, drought and insect attacks, small scale forest disturbances that create gaps in forest canopies and below ground root and mycorrhizal networks may accumulate to impact regional scale carbon budgets. In a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest near Fox Park, WY, clusters of 15 and 30 trees were removed in 1988 to assess the effect of tree gap disturbance on fine root density and nitrogen transformation. Twenty seven years later the gaps remain with limited regeneration present only in the center of the 30 tree plots, beyond the influence of roots from adjacent intact trees. Soil respiration was measured in the summer of 2015 to assess the influence of these disturbances on carbon cycling in Pinus contorta forests. Positions at the centers of experimental disturbances were found to have the lowest respiration rates (mean 2.45 µmol C/m2/s, standard error 0.17 C/m2/s), control plots in the undisturbed forest were highest (mean 4.15 µmol C/m2/s, standard error 0.63 C/m2/s), and positions near the margin of the disturbance were intermediate (mean 3.7 µmol C/m2/s, standard error 0.34 C/m2/s). Fine root densities, soil nitrogen, and microclimate changes were also measured and played an important role in respiration rates of disturbed plots. This demonstrates that a long-term effect on carbon cycling occurs when gaps are created in the canopy and root network of lodgepole forests.",

            "abstract": "The platinum group element (PGEs: Pt, Pd, Rh, Ir, Os, and Ru) accumulation in ancient polar archives have been argued to trace cosmic dust and “smoke” from larger meteors but the PGE concentration data lack specificity. For example, the extent to which the terrestrial volcanism/dust has contributed to the PGE inventory of polar ice cannot be readily evaluated. Since the Os isotope compositions (187Os/188Os ratio) of the terrestrial and extraterrestrial sources are distinctly different from each other, the PGE concentrations when combined with Os isotope composition have the potential to untangle contributions from these sources. Platinum group element concentration determinations in polar ice cores are highly challenging due to their extremely low concentrations (down to 10-15 g/g or fg/g). Here, a new procedure is presented that allows PGEs and Os isotope compositions to be determined from a ~50 g sample of polar ice. Decontaminated ice-melt is spiked with 101Ru, 106Pd, 190Os, 191Ir, and 198Pt and frozen at -20 °C in quartz-glass ampoules. A mixture of purified HNO3 and H2O2 is then added and the sample is heated to 300 °C at 128bar using a High Pressure Asher. This allows all spikes to be equilibrated with the sample PGEs and all Os species are oxidized to OsO4. The resulting OsO4 is extracted using distillation, purified, and measured using negative thermal ionization mass spectrometry. PGEs are then separated and purified using two stage column chromatography and their concentrations determined by isotope dilution using a triple quadruople inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer coupled to an Apex de-solvation nebulizer. The developed method was applied to modern Greenland firn and snow. The PGE concentrations of the firn are 4.0 fg/g for Ir, 20 fg/g for Ru, 590 fg/g for Pt, 38 fg/g for Pd, and 1.3 fg/g for Os, while those of the snow are 3.0 fg/g for Ir, 53 fg/g for Ru, 360 fg/g for Pt, 32 fg/g for Pd, and 0.4 fg/g for Os, respectively. A comparison with previous procedures shows that our method yields higher PGE concentrations. The 187Os/188Os ratios for firn and the ice are 0.45 and 0.30, respectively, indicating unradiogenic aerosols as potential PGE source. Implications of these data and other data will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Estimates of soil bulk density (Db) are critical for accurate estimates of soil carbon (C) stocks, and thus, greatly influence the balance and interpretation of soil C budgets at plot, regional, and national scales. Large scale soil C investigations in the United States (US) almost always utilize a compilation of more than 20,000 Db observations across the US within the USDA-NRCS National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) database. NCSS observations can be manually extracted as point data and then stratified or modeled by a variety of soil taxonomic, geographic, and environmental factors to estimate Db across large scales. NCSS observations also underpin the popular Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) database which provides continuous Db estimates across most of the US. Here, for the first time, we evaluate the precision and accuracy with which NCSS data can estimate forest soil Db across the southeastern United States and explore how using these observations impacts soil C budgets in forests across the region.\nWe analyze and compare nearly 3,000 Db observations from the NCSS database to nearly 1,500 Db observations from the PINEMAP Tier II Network (325 experimental forest plots) across the southeastern US. We model all NCSS observations and 70% of the PINEMAP Tier II observations (a calibration dataset) separately with Random Forest algorithms to create a variety of Db predictive models at 0-10, 10-20, 20-50, and 50-100 cm depths. We validate all models against 30% of the PINEMAP Tier II observations (a validation dataset). As indexed by the mean prediction error (MPE), NCSS observations tend to over predict forest soil Db across the validation dataset by an average of 0.20 g/cc. Incorporating this positive bias of NCSS Db predictions into C stock estimates in the top 100 cm of soil across the PINEMAP Tier II network inflates C stock estimates by an average of 13 Mg/ha. Our findings identify significant potential for NCSS observations to over predict soil Db, and thus soil C stocks, in forests across the southeastern US. We suggest that similar results might be found for forest soils elsewhere in the US due to an inherent agricultural bias of NCSS data, and conclude that the potential for artificially high stock estimates warrants consideration when forest ecosystems and NCSS Db observations are included in regional soil C analyses.",

These project was supported by the Joint Funds CONACyT-Veracruz state government.\nIt was developed a probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (henceforth PSHA) in the central area of Veracruz State, mainly in a region bounded by the watersheds of the rivers Jamapa and Antigua, whit the aim to evaluate the geological and hydrometeorological hazards in this region. The project pays most attention to extreme weather phenomena, floods and earthquakes, in order to calculate the risk induced by previous for landslides and rock falls.\nIn addition, as part of the study, the PSHA was developed considered the site effect in the urban zones of the cities Xalapa and Orizaba; the site effects were incorporated by a standard format proposed in studies of microzonation and its application in computer systems, which allows to optimize and condense microzonation studies in a city.\nThe results obtained from the PSHA are presented through to seismic hazard maps (hazard footprints), exceedance rate curves and uniform hazard spectrum for different spectral ordinates, between 0.01 and 5.0 seconds, associated to selected return periods: 72, 225, 475 and 2475 years.",

The March 17, 2013 large storm provided an excellent opportunity to observe these mass transfer processes using a number of ground and in-situ sensors.\nWe examine dusk sector (20 MLT) plasmasphere erosion during the 17 March 2013 storm (Dst ~ \u0001130 nT) using simultaneous, magnetically aligned direct sunward ion flux observations at high altitude by Van Allen Probes RBSP-A (at ~3.0 Re) and at topside ionospheric heights (~840 km) by DMSP F-18, along with direct F region ionospheric observations using the subauroral Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar system. Plasma erosion occurs at both high and low altitudes where the subauroral polarization stream flow overlaps the outer plasmasphere. At ~20 UT, RBSP-A observed ~1.2E12 m\u0001-2 s\u0001-1 erosion flux, while DMSP F-18 observed ~2E13 m-\u00012 s\u0001-1 sunward flux. We find close similarities at high and low altitudes between the erosion plume in both invariant latitude spatial extent and plasma characteristics.\nOther incoherent scatter radar facilities at Poker Flat, along with both the mainland Europe and Svalbard EISCAT radars, also have observations available during this period. We use these combined, multi-scale data sets in comparison to model predictions of SAPS, e.g. BATSRUS/RAM, OpenGGCM-RM. We will highlight successes and areas where progress is needed in the quantitative understanding of cold ionospheric origin mass flow through the geospace system and its direct impact on energy coupling to the solar wind.",

            "abstract": "A simplified multiscale model of the interactions between the atmosphere and ocean is developed. Two coupled nonlinear equatorial β-plane shallow water equations are used. The nonlinearities are of two types: advective and atmosphere-ocean coupling related. To mimic the main differences between the fast-atmosphere and the slow-ocean, multi-space and multi-time scalings are adopted. Three possible regimes have been discussed: intradiurnal/synoptic/intraseasonal (ISIn), synoptic/intraseasonal/interannual-El Niño (SInEN) and intraseasonal/El Niño/decadal (InEND) regimes. Special attention is given to the SInEN regime, where simplified physical parameterizations for the atmosphere-ocean coupling are developed. In this regime, the synoptic scale is the fastest atmospheric scale, the intraseasonal is the intermediate atmosphere-ocean coupling scale and the El Niño refers to the slowest inter-annual ocean scale. Analytical solutions of the SInEN equations reveal that the slow wave amplitude evolution depends on both types of nonlinearities. Nonlinear interactions of synoptic scale atmospheric waves force intraseasonal variability not only in the atmosphere but also in the ocean through wind stress. Intraseasonal ocean temperature perturbations coupled with the atmosphere through evaporation force higher order atmospheric variability and the wave-convection coupling provides another source of higher order atmospheric variability. In the ocean, nonlinear interactions of intraseasonal ocean perturbations force interannual oceanic variability. The slowest inter-annual variability in the SInEN regime is associated with either nonlinear wind stress and advective nonlinearity.",

            "abstract": "The collisionless coupling of an expanding diamagnetic cavity to a magnetized, ambient plasma is studied in a laboratory environment using a laser-produced plasma (LPP). The seed LPP rapidly expands with velocities up to the background Alfvén speed, vexp ≤ vA. The boundary layer of the expansion is characterized with in situ diagnostics as a cylindrical version of the Ferraro-Rosenbluth current sheath. Maintenance of quasi-neutrality in this sheath forms an electric field opposing the cross-field expansion which simultaneously drives the electron current that forms the diamagnetic cavity, decelerates the LPP ions to stagnation, and accelerates ambient ions inward. The field topology across the background magnetic field is identical to that described by Bernhardt, et al. [1] for the AMPTE magnetotail barium releases. The boundary along the magnetic field, however, is shown to contain an electric field with E·B ≠ 0, which is absent in simple fluid models of diamagnetic cavities. The electric fields at this boundary help explain previous observations in the experiment of the ejection of suprathermal electrons and return currents that generated whistler- and Alfvén-wave radiation in the ambient plasma. Magnetic loops and an emissive probe measure the magnetic field and electrostatic potential along 3 dimensions while a laser-induced fluorescence scheme measures the cross-field flow of the ambient argon ions as they penetrate the diamagnetic cavity. Particle orbit solvers employing the measured fields corroborate the flow diagnostic and predict strong outflows of ambient ions with higher charge to mass ratios after diamagnetic cavity collapse. This experiment was conducted in the Large Plasma Device at the Basic Plasma Science Facility and funded by grants from the US Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation.\n[1] P.A.

            "abstract": "ePoster - Schliemann.pdf\nThe alpine ecosystem is a dynamic network of heterogeneous soil and vegetation patches. Microsite characteristics are controlled by site geomorphology, underlying bedrock, and landscape position. These microsite characteristics create a complex mosaic of soil moisture and temperature regimes across the landscape. To investigate the relative influences of soil moisture and soil temperature on soil respiration in these varied microsites, 12 study sites were established in June of 2015 in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. Sites were distributed across 3 plots with distinct vegetation and soil regimes: 1) Conifer forest at the upper limit of the tree line 2) Tundra characterized by shallow soil and minimal vegetation consisting of herbs and lichen 3) Tundra characterized by organic-rich, deep soil and abundant vegetation consisting of grasses and sedges. Soil respiration, soil temperature, and soil moisture were measured weekly throughout the snow-free period of 2015. Soil moisture was negatively correlated with soil respiration and soil temperature was positively correlated with soil respiration across the study sites (p <0.001). Soil respiration rates were significantly different from one another in all plots and were highest in the forest plot (maximum 9.6 µmol/ m2/sec) and much lower in the two tundra plots (< 4.5 µmol/ m2/sec) (p < 0.001). These data suggest that as the alpine climate warms, an increase in soil temperature and a longer snow-free period may result in an overall increase in the rate of soil respiration, which could alter the soil carbon pool. In addition, as temperatures rise, the tree line may migrate to a higher elevation. The results of this study suggest that with such a movement, the soil respiration rate will also increase. However the net change in soil organic matter in the newly established forest would not only depend on the soil respiration rate, but on the overall capacity of the new forest soil to retain carbon, especially recalcitrant forms.",

The DPG tsunami records across the entire array show multiple large-amplitude, coherent phases arriving one hour to more than 36 hours after the initial tsunami phase. Analysis of the DPG recordings reveals possible locations of the geographical sources that contributed to secondary tsunami arrivals in southern California. A beamforming technique is applied to the DPG data to determine the azimuths and arrival times of scattered wave energy. In addition, a backward ray tracing procedure is applied to a wide range of back azimuth starting values from the DPG array to map possible source locations. The results show several possible candidates of secondary tsunami source structures. These include the Alaskan Peninsula island chain producing a tsunami arrival ~60 minutes after the first arrival, and the Hawaiian Islands producing an arrival ~170 minutes after the first arrival. The results are mapped into modified tsunami warning messages to show how a time-varying hazard could be communicated with more effective message format and content. The results are demonstrating the effects of including clearly described locations, time of impact, and hazard impact consequences on message perception among the public.",

            "abstract": "The 1.073 million km2 Murray-Darling River Basin (MDB) drains 14% of Australia’s landmass, incorporates Australia’s most economically important agricultural region, and presents one of Australia’s most important and contentious water security challenges. The twin Murray and Darling catchments extend from the sub-tropics to the mid latitudes, with catchment precipitation driven by synoptic-scale oceanic-atmospheric processes that include the Australian Monsoon, SAM, IPO, PDO, IOD and ENSO. In this study we report the discovery of a hitherto unrecognised terminal palaeo-lake system ‘Lake Mannum’ that existed during the middle to late Holocene, as evidenced by an extensive sequence of laminated muds. The deposit contains gray laminae enriched in smectite and Nd/Ti, diagnostic of palaeo-discharges originating from the Darling catchment. These gray laminae are set within olive-black background muds enriched in illite, K and Rb, diagnostic of palaeo-discharges originating from the Murray Catchment. The deposit reflects the hydrological regime of the MDB, representing the first in-situ palaeo-discharge record for the MDB and a proxy record for south-eastern Australia’s precipitation and hydroclimate. Given the strong influence of major oceanic-atmospheric synoptic circulation over the river system, variability in MDB discharge and delivery of suspended sediment flux to the continental shelf have been used as proxy indicators for south-eastern Australia’s palaeo-climate during the Holocene. The existence of palaeo-lake Mannum at the terminus of the MDB suggests that discharge of terrigenous sediment to the Southern Ocean was strongly suppressed during this time, meaning that Holocene climate reconstructions which rely on the marine sediment record require re-evaluation.",

            "abstract": "In a recent study, we interpreted ~ 100-km-deep seismic reflections to be the base of the Pacific oceanic plate as it subducts beneath southern North Island, New Zealand*. The top of the plate is at a depth of ~ 25 km, and thus the total thickness of the subducted plate is ~ 75 km and significantly thinner than that predicted by plate cooling models for 120 Ma lithosphere. It is, however, consistent with observations of the depth to the G-discontinuity beneath the Pacific plate, which has a weak correlation with age. Recent work shows that the G-discontinuity corresponds to a change in radial anisotropy, believed to be linked to the compositional differences as the plate is created at a mid-ocean ridge. Our study imaged not one, but two, parallel, and distinct reflectors at the 100 km depth, defining a channel ~10 km thick, that lies parallel to the top of the plate (dipping ~15°). The frequency of our seismic reflections sets an important limit on the “sharpness” criterion for the boundary that generates the reflected energy. Namely, the transition zone for the acoustic impedance contact can be no thicker than about half a wavelength, or ~300 m. We argue that this is too abrupt a transition to be due to a change in radial anisotropy, and instead requires a change in phase from rock, to rock with melt and/or water. Moreover the simplest explanation of an ~10 km thick channel with sharp acoustic boundaries at top and bottom is a weak zone with a significant melt fraction (~2%) in a zone of enhanced mantle shear, although other interpretations ( e.g. elastically accommodated grain-boundary sliding) are possible. If we are imaging the G-boundary, then it is both sharp and likely to be actively accommodating some relative plate motion, as the plate slides over the underlying mantle.\n* Stern T.A. et al (2015).

In some cases, river meanders confined between valley walls display distinctive angular bends in a dynamic equilibrium such that their size and shape persist as the meander migrates. In other cases, meander geometry is more varied and changes as the meander migrates. The ratio of channel to valley width has been identified as a useful parameter for defining confined meanders, but is not sufficient to distinguish cases in which sharp angular bends are able to migrate with little change in geometry. Here, we examine the effect of water and sediment supply on the geometry of confined rivers in order to identify conditions under which meander geometry reaches a persistent dynamic equilibrium. Because channel width and meander geometry are closely related, we use a numerical meander model that allows for independent migration of both banks, thereby allowing channel width to vary in space and time. We hypothesize that confined meanders with persistent angular bends have smaller transport rates of bed material and that their migration is driven by erosion of the cutbank (bank-pull migration). When bed material supply is sufficiently large that point bar deposition drives meander migration (bar-push migration), confined meander bends have a larger radius of curvature and a geometry that varies as the meander migrates. We test this hypothesis using historical patterns of confined meander migration for rivers with different rates of sediment supply and bed material transport. Interpretation of the meander migration pattern is provided by the free-width meander migration model.",

These ponds which are co-seismic subsidence areas have continuous muddy sediment stratigraphy and sporadic tsunami induced coarse material. Well controlled age data has been collected from the core-sample that contains plant remains under anoxic sedimentary environment .\nTotal 21 cores collected from two coastal ponds Ashihama-ike and Zasa-ike which locate behind beach-ridge along southeastern coast of Kii Peninsula under Tokai/Tonankai Earthquake assumption areas. Tsunami events are recognized after eighty AMS C-14 dating through recent (core top) to 7300 yBP interval. Among these interval, two remarkable events found in sediment, which are 2050yBP to 2300yBP (=2K event) and 1000yBP to 1100 yBP. 2k event consists thick sand, well rounded gravel in chaotic mud and wood fragment derived from forests surrounding lakes. Later event is correspond to the historical Ninna Nankai earthquake (AD887, 26 August under the old lunar calendar).　Rather small events are occurred in 3500yBP and 1100yBP. These events are found from both of two ponds which has two kilometers in distance each other. Cores bottom are composed of 7400yBP huge-tsunami event caused simultaneously by the Kikai-caldera eruption (over 170 cubic km ejecta) is just covered with the Kikai-Akahoya (K-Ah) tephra.\nThe 2K and volcanic tsunami events have also found widely, not only Kii Peninsula but southern Shikoku (Tokushima Pref. and Kochi Pref.) and Kyushu through the Nankai Trough.",

            "abstract": "Over the past 2 years a series of tracer tests designed to estimate rates of methane formation via acetoclastic methanogenesis in the active layer of permafrost soils were conducted at the Barrow Environmental Observatory (BEO) in northernmost Alaska. The tracer tests consisted of extracting 0.5 to 1.0 liters of soil water in gas-tight bags from different features of polygons at the BEO, followed by addition of a tracer cocktail including acetate with a 13C-labeled methyl group and D2O (as a conservative tracer) into the soil water and injection of the mixture back into the original extraction site. Samples were then taken at depths of 30 cm (just above the bottom of the active layer), 20 cm, 10 cm and surface flux to determine the fate of the 13C-labeled acetate.\nDuring 2014 (2015 results are pending) water, soil gas, and flux gas were sampled for 60 days following injection of the tracer solution. Those samples were analyzed for concentrations and isotopic compositions of CH4, DIC/CO2 and water. At one site (the trough of a low-centered polygon) the 13C acetate was completely converted to 13CH4 within the first 2 days. The signal persisted for throughout the entire monitoring period at the injection depth with little evidence of transport or oxidation in any of the other sampling depths. In the saturated center of the same polygon, the acetate was also rapidly converted to 13CH4, but water turnover caused the signal to rapidly dissipate. High δ13C CO2 in flux samples from the polygon center indicate oxidation of the 13CH4 in near-surface waters. Conversely, CH4 production in the center of an unsaturated, flat-centered polygon was relatively small 13CH4 and dissipated rapidly without any evidence of either 13CH4 transport to shallower levels or oxidation. At another site in the edge of that polygon no 13CH4 was produced, but significant 13CO2/DIC was observed indicating direct aerobic oxidation of the acetate was occurring at this site. These results suggest that a longer thaw season resulting from a warming climate may increase the net CH4 flux from saturated polygonal features, but that effect may be minimized by increased drainage due to degradation of low-centered centered polygons.",

            "abstract": "As we increasingly embrace deep shale gas deposits to meet global energy demands new and dispersed local and regional policy and planning challenges emerge. Even in regions with long histories of energy extraction, such as coal, shale gas and the infrastructure needed to produce the gas and transport it to market offers uniquely complex transformations in land use and landcover not previously experienced. These transformations are fast paced, dispersed and can overwhelm local and regional planning and regulatory processes. Coupled to these transformations is a structural confounding factor. While extraction and testing are carried out locally, regulation and decision-making is multilayered, often influenced by national and international factors.\nUsing a geodesign framework, this paper applies a set of geospatial landscape ecological planning tools in two shale gas settings. First, we describe and detail a series of ongoing studies and tools that we have developed for communities in the Marcellus Shale region of the eastern United States, specifically the northern tier of Pennsylvania. Second, we apply a subset of these tools to potential gas development areas of the Fylde region in Lancashire, United Kingdom.\nFor the past five years we have tested, applied and refined a set of place based and data driven geospatial models for forecasting, envisioning, analyzing and evaluating shale gas activities in northern Pennsylvania. These models are continuously compared to important landscape ecological planning challenges and priorities in the region, e.g. visual and cultural resource preservation. Adapting and applying these tools to a different landscape allow us to not only isolate and define important regulatory and policy exigencies in each specific setting, but also to develop and refine these models for broader application. As we continue to explore increasingly complex energy solutions globally, we need an equally complex comparative set of landscape ecological planning tools to inform policy, design and regional planning. Adapting tools and techniques developed in Pennsylvania where shale gas extraction is ongoing to Lancashire, where industry is still in the exploratory phase offers a key opportunity to test and refine more generalizable models.",

The goal of this work is to compare the leak detection capabilities of a surface ERT array and a downhole ERT array. In this study several plausible 3D electrical conductivity models were created that simulated a contaminant plume evolving over time, using realistic contaminant concentrations, plume geometries, water saturation profiles, and seasonal temperature profiles.

            "abstract": "Martian upper atmosphere directly interacts with the solar wind, since Mars does not possess the intrinsic global magnetic field. This interaction forms a transition region between the shocked solar wind (magnetosheath) and the ionosphere, in which characteristic boundary structures are embedded. Previous studies have shown existence of the induced magnetosphere or magnetic pileup region in the transition region. Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) observed the magnetic pileup boundary (MPB), a boundary between the magnetosheath and the magnetic pileup region by its magnetometer and electron reflectometer [e.g., Vignes et al., 2000, Trotignon et al., 2006]. On one hand, Phobos 2 and Mars Express (MEX) observed the ion composition boundary (ICB) by their ion mass analyzer [e.g., Breus et al., 1991, Dubinin et al., 2006], where the ion composition changes from the solar wind origin to planetary origin dominant. Due to the lack of continuous simultaneous observations of the magnetic field and ion composition, however, relations between MPB and ICB are far from understood. In this study, we investigate relative locations and characteristics of MPB and ICB and their dependence on solar wind parameters, utilizing a full package of plasma instruments onboard Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN).\nWe conducted a statistical analysis of the ion, electron, and magnetic field data obtained by MAVEN from November 2014 to March 2015 in order to investigate relations between MPB and ICB. We identified MPB from the electron and magnetic field data by inspection based on Trotignon et al. [2006]. We calculated the density ratio between the planetary heavy ions and the solar wind protons to investigate the ion composition around MPB. Results show that there is a north-south asymmetry in locations of MPB and ICB. Observations also indicate that the relative location of MPB and ICB has deference between dayside and nightside. The MPB locations also depend on the solar wind parameters. We will also report on the dependence of MPB and ICB on the solar wind velocity, density, and dynamic pressure.\n",

            "abstract": "Surface deformation after major earthquakes shows an ongoing transient signal known as post-seismic relaxation, which extends thousands of kilometers from the rupture area and continues in time for up to decades. The magnitude of this transient motion violates the secular/linear assumption made in current terrestrial reference frame definitions, which have significant ramifications for regional tectonic interpretations and global studies such as sea level rise that require reference frame accuracy greater than this level. In this study we show the importance of accounting for the post-seismic relaxation signal in GPS time series when defining a stable reference frame and estimating inter-seismic velocities. We investigate by means of long-term GPS time series analysis the far-field post-seismic effect of Sumatra Mw 9.1 and Macquarie Ridge Mw 8.1 earthquakes and show how deformation from great earthquakes can introduce a change in the long-term horizontal velocity rate of up to 5mm/yr. We show also how post-seismic deformation can affect regional tectonic interpretations and the detection of low strain fault zones in rapid rotating micro-plates. We highlight the role of post-seismic deformation on the characterization of the earthquake cycle as seen from long-term GPS time series.",

            "abstract": "In March and April, 2014, an unprecedented experimental “pulse flow” with a total volume of over 100 million cubic meters (81,000 acre-feet) of water was released from Morelos Dam into the normally dry lower Colorado River below Yuma, Arizona, for the primary purpose of restoring native vegetation and habitat. Significant infiltration and attenuation of the flood peak occurred within the limitrophe reach that forms the US-Mexico border, with total volume reduced to 57 million cubic meters at the southerly international boundary at San Luis Rio Colorado, Sonora, Mexico (32 kilometers downstream). Groundwater levels in piezometers adjacent to the stream channel rose as much as 10 meters, and surface water/groundwater connection was established throughout the reach, despite depths-to-water greater than 15 meters prior to the pulse flow. Based on groundwater levels, a groundwater mound remained in the vicinity of the stream channel for several months but had largely dissipated into the regional groundwater system by fall 2014. Ultimately, a large amount of water was moved from storage in an upstream reservoir (Lake Mead), where it is potentially available to many users but where evaporation losses can be high, to the regional aquifer in the Yuma–Mexicali area, where the water could be available to local users but cannot be precisely quantified as it moves through the groundwater system. During a time of drought, tradeoffs between local vs. upstream storage, and reservoir vs. subsurface storage, will likely be increasingly important considerations in planning future experimental floods on the Colorado River.",

            "abstract": "We examined climate controls on fire emissions and trace gas variability using three distinct conceptual models of fire emissions that draw upon different types of remote sensing information. The three approaches were derived from satellite-derived observations of active fires, satellite-derived estimates of fire radiative power, and daily emissions estimates from the Alaska Fire Emissions Database model (AKFED). In our analysis, we assessed the relative importance of different climate variables and fire weather indices in explaining the temporal variability of satellite-detected fire thermal anomalies and emissions within the state of Alaska during the summer of 2013. We evaluated the performance of each emissions model using trace gas observations from the CARVE (CRV) tower in Fox, Alaska. In our approach we used an inverse atmospheric transport model, the coupled Weather Research and Forecasting/Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (WRF-STILT) model, to link the fire emissions with the trace gas observations. MISR plume observations were used to inform the injection height distribution in WRF-STILT and CRV-derived estimates of CO/CO2 emission ratios were used to convert modeled carbon emissions into trace gas fluxes. Local climate variables had varying levels of influence on fire dynamics in interior Alaska, with vapor pressure deficit explaining more variability than temperature or relative humidity alone. Combined use of the emissions products and WRF-STILT allowed us identify fire contributions to the CRV time series on a daily basis, and to isolate contributions from individual fires that had different temporal dynamics and interactions with atmospheric transport. Both hourly and daily observed CO mole fractions were highly correlated with the emissions models convolved with WRF-STILT (r2 values up to 0.63), providing some confidence in the ability of satellite-constrained models to capture daily and synoptic patterns in fire emissions.",

But as cyberinfrastructure advances to support such work, scientists in many fields lack sufficient computational skills to participate in interdisciplinary, data-intensive research. In response, we developed innovative training workshops for early-career scientists, in order to explore both the needs and solutions for training next-generation scientists in skills for data-intensive environmental research. In 2013 and 2014 we ran intensive 3-week training workshops for early-career researchers. One of the workshops was run concurrently in California and North Carolina, connected by virtual technologies and coordinated schedules. We attracted applicants to the workshop with the opportunity to pursue data-intensive small-group research projects that they proposed. This approach presented a realistic possibility that publishable products could result from 3 weeks of focused hands-on classroom instruction combined with self-directed group research in which instructors were present to assist trainees. Instruction addressed 1) collaboration modes and technologies, 2) data management, preservation, and sharing, 3) preparing data for analysis using scripting, 4) reproducible research, 5) sustainable software practices, 6) data analysis and modeling, and 7) communicating results to broad communities. The most dramatic improvements in technical skills were in data management, version control, and working with spatial data outside of proprietary software. In addition, participants built strong networks and collaborative skills that later resulted in a successful student-led grant proposal, published manuscripts, and participants reported that the training was a highly influential experience.",

This SMSLMN system integrated various sensors, including space-borne, airborne, in-situ and underground sensors, which can quantitatively monitor the slide-body and obtain critical information of movement in high frequency with high resolution. Observation capabilities indicators for different sensors were proposed in order to obtain the optimal sensor combination groups and observation strategy. Meanwhile, adaptive networking and reliable data communication methods were developed to apply intelligent observation and sensor data transmission. Some key technologies, such as intelligence extraction technology, data access frequency adaptive adjustment technology, different sensor synchronization control technology were developed to overcome those problems in complex observation environment. The collaboratively observation data have been transferred to the remote data center where is thousands miles away from the giant landslide spot.\nThis SMSLMN framework mainly concentrates on constructing a monitoring network with four hierarchies of observation: (1) space-borne sensors including VHR optical images (P5, IKONOS, WorldView-1, 2 and ZY-3) and a series of high resolution X-band TerraSAR-X SAR images; (2) aerial observations by a group of UAV scanning schemes with the ground-based controlling platform, the produced the 1:2000 scale DOM mosaic images and the generated high resolution DTM; (3) a series of ground-based sensors involving in-situ sensors such as inclinometers and piezometers with smart self-forming seamless real-time data communication and terrestrial remote sensing platform of laser scanning; and (4) internal investigation from geophysical approaches such as seismological and electromagnetic analyses. This SSN-based monitoring system for Xishan Village landslide based on multiple surveying and mapping approaches is expected to provide solid monitoring data for landslide models and data assimilation for potential landslide hazard prediction and risk assessment in the near future.",

            "abstract": "Because zircon crystals commonly display high natural U/Pb ratios and excellent resistance to weathering, paleomagnetic data collected from zircons potentially enjoy the benefits of excellent age controls and minimal remagnetization from infiltrating fluids. We present rock magnetic and paleomagnetic experiments on two sets of zircons with contrasting geologic histories to determine the viability of zircons as paleomagnetic recorders.\nFirst, we characterize primary zircons from the Bishop Tuff, a pyroclastic deposit formed at 767±1 ka in a magnetic field of 43±3 µT. Magnetic field maps with ~10 µm resolution obtained with the nitrogen vacancy (NV) diamond magnetometer indicate that most ferromagnetic sources are situated within zircon interiors, suggesting a primary origin (Fig. 1A). Stepwise thermal demagnetization reveals well-defined components of magnetization blocked in most samples up to 580˚C, indicating the dominance of magnetite, which is the expected primary phase. The intensity of natural remanent magnetization (NRM) is typically 10-12 Am2. Ongoing Thellier-Thellier dual heating experiments will evaluate the accuracy of recovered paleointensities.\nSecond, we study Hadean and Archean detrital zircons from the Jack Hills. In contrast to the Bishop Tuff samples, magnetic microscopy and stepwise thermal demagnetization demonstrate that the remanent magnetization of >80% of Jack Hills zircon are carried exclusively by secondary hematite situated on grain surfaces (Fig. 1B). NRM intensities range between 10-15 and 10-12 Am2 and decrease by a factor of several upon chemical removal of secondary hematite.\nOur analyses reveal a diversity of ferromagnetic mineralogies and distribution in natural zircons. While some zircon populations carry reliable paleomagnetic information, others are dominated by secondary ferromagnetic phases. Without the application of high-resolution magnetic microscopy techniques to identify the main ferromagnetic carrier, it is difficult to establish that Jack Hills zircons retain a credible primary record of the Hadean and Archean geomagnetic field.",

            "abstract": "The efficiency with which clouds precipitate is believed to influence climate by modifying cloud lifetime and, ultimately, cloud amount. Aerosols can influence this linkage by reducing the effective radii of cloud droplets and suppressing precipitation. This relationship, however, is not unidirectional. Cloud precipitation efficiency can also regulate particle concentrations, since precipitation effectively scavenges aerosols from the atmosphere. One challenge in studying how aerosols, clouds, and precipitation processes interrelate is that observational constraints are difficult to attain. This work evaluates the ability of isotope ratios in water vapor to quantify cloud precipitation efficiency across the tropical and subtropical oceans. Theory suggests isotope ratios will record the precipitation efficiency of a convective plume, since heavier isotopologues precipitate preferentially; and a recent analysis of in situ measurements from the Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO, Hawaii, USA) verifies this to be the case. The challenge now lies in understanding whether satellite retrievals of isotope ratios in water vapor are sensitive enough to track precipitation efficiency globally. To answer this question, vertical profiles of the D/H ratio derived from NASA’s Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) are first compared with the MLO in situ measurements. A qualitative match indicates the satellite retrievals can distinguish high from low precipitation efficiency convection. To expand the analysis geographically, TES profiles between 40°S and 40°N are compared with estimates of precipitation efficiency derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and ECMWF’s ERA-Interim. Retrievals are binned by lower-tropospheric humidity and by vertical velocity in order to minimize large-scale thermodynamical influences. Co-located cloud retrievals provide the context necessary to evaluate the utility of these new estimates in elucidating cloud feedbacks on climate.",

            "abstract": "We apply an enhanced revision of a Bayesian un-mixing framework for estimating sediment source contributions to an intensively managed watershed in the US Midwest that is characterized by spatiotemporal heterogeneity. The framework has two key parameters, namely a and b, that account for spatial origin attributes and the time history of sediments delivered to the watershed outlet, respectively. The probabilistic treatment of these parameters incorporates variability in source erosion processes, as well as the delivery times and storage of eroded material within the watershed. Uncertainty in source contribution estimates in our approach is quantified naturally through the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations for estimating the posterior probability density functions. The studied watershed is the 26 km² South Amana Sub-Watershed located within the Clear Creek Watershed (CCW), IA, which is part of the Critical Zone Observatory for Intensively Managed Landscapes (IML-CZO). Utilizing stable isotopes of C and N, the Bayesian framework predicted trends in mean source contributions and uncertainty that were in agreement with observations from other studies. Terrestrial sources were found to dominate sediment contributions in the earlier stages of the growing season when land cover was small and the hydrologic forcing was large. Instream sources became more dominate during the latter stages when land cover was well-established and more extensive. Also, the effects of spatial heterogeneity and sediment travel time and delivery on uncertainty in sources contribution estimates were adequately captured. The results clearly showed a reduction in uncertainty when watershed connectivity was greatest and considerable amounts of material were delivered to the collection point at the outlet. On-going application of the framework to the Upper Sangamon River Basin (USRB), which also part of the IML-CZO and has distinct features from CCW, is expected to shed more light on the effects of connectivity and other landscape attributes on sediment source dynamics over the growing season.",

In addition, rainfall events exacerbate the effects of tillage by the impact of raindrops, which break down aggregates that encase carbon and dislodge and entrain soil particles and aggregates along the downslope. The redistribution of soil and carbon can have huge implications on biogeochemical cycling and overall carbon budgeting. In this study, we provide some rare field data on the mechanisms impacting aggregate stability, enrichment ratio values to estimate fluxes of carbon, as well as lignin chemistry to see influences on oxidation/mineralization rates. Rainfall simulation experiments were conducted within agricultural fields. Experiments were performed on the midslope (eroding) and toeslope (depositional) sections of representative hillslopes, under a variety of land managements, including row crop (conventional and conservation) and restored grasslands. Sensors were utilized to capture the evolution of soil moisture, temperature, microbial respiration pulses, and discharge rates to identify pseudo-steady state conditions. Samples collected at the weir outlet were tested for sediment concentrations and size fractions, as well as carbon and lignin fluxes. Preliminary findings show that conservation management practices have higher aggregate stability and decreased mass fluxes of carbon in the downslope than conventional tillage techniques.",

The effect of light elements on density and bulk modulus of liquid iron is necessary for estimating of these core compositions. Sound velocity of liquid iron alloys is also important for identifying light elements in the core by comparison with observed seismic data. We have measured sound velocity and density of liquid Fe-C simultaneously at high pressure. High pressure experiments were performed using a DIA-type cubic anvil press (SMAP-180) at BL22XU beamline, SPring-8 synchrotron in Japan. Sound velocity (VP) was measured using pulse-echo overlapping method (Higo et al., 2009). Density (ρ) was measured using X-ray absorption method (Katayama et al., 1993). We measured velocity and density of liquid Fe-C between 1.1-5.8 GPa and 1480-1700 K. Obtained density and velocity of Fe-C was found to increase with pressure. This study shows the VP of liquid Fe-C decreased with increasing temperature. Previous study of liquid Fe-S shows little change with increasing temperature at all pressure conditions (Nishida et al., 2013, Jing et al., 2014). We fit the relationship between VP and pressure using Murnaghan’s equation of state. We obtained KS0 = 102.5(1.2) GPa, K’S = 5.2(0.4) at 1700 K. Comparison of the present data with previous study, KS is similar to liquid Fe but liquid Fe-S is small. We compared the relation between density and sound velocity of liquid Fe-C. We have found that the behavior of liquid Fe-C is similar to that of liquid Fe in the Birch’s plot. The effect of carbon on liquid Fe is small on Birch’s plot.",

The two cases represent (1) shallow cumulus clouds occurring in a cold-air outbreak behind a cold front, and (2) stratocumulus clouds occurring when the region was dominated by a high-pressure system. Observations and MERRA reanalysis are used to derive specifications used for large-eddy simulations (LES) and single-column model (SCM) simulations. The LES captures the major differences in horizontal structure between the two low-cloud fields, but there are unconstrained uncertainties in cloud microphysics and challenges in reproducing W-band Doppler radar moments. The SCM run on the vertical grid used for CMIP-5 runs of the GCM does a poor job of representing the shallow cumulus case and is unable to maintain an overcast deck in the stratocumulus case, providing some clues regarding problems with low-cloud representation in the GCM. SCM sensitivity tests with a finer vertical grid in the boundary layer show substantial improvement in the representation of cloud amount for both cases. GCM simulations with CMIP-5 versus finer vertical gridding in the boundary layer are compared with observations. The adoption of a two-moment cloud microphysics scheme in the GCM is also tested in this framework. The methodology followed in this study, with the process-based examination of different time and space scales in both models and observations, represents a prototype for GCM cloud parameterization improvements.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the land surface in promoting or inhibiting convective development and precipitation. At the same time, fire represents a dramatic, instantaneous shift in energy and mass fluxes at the surface. We examine the role that fires play in modifying subsequent precipitation on seasonal timescales across sub-Saharan Africa. Using MODIS burned area product and TRMM daily precipitation we find that fire suppresses total wet season accumulated rainfall in arid and semiarid regions. In the regions receiving less than 500 mm of mean annual precipitation (MAP) this suppression amounts to deficits of up to 30% of MAP. This observed pattern is consistent between drylands in both hemispheres. We consider the possible mechanisms of fire-induced rainfall suppression, including changes in albedo and reduced evapotranspiration. We propose a novel feedback between rainfall and fire that is manifested by an oscillation between low rainfall and high rainfall years. Observational evidence supports this hypothesis. Finally, using MODIS land cover data we find that the regions where we observe fire-induced rainfall suppression are comprised of a higher than expected proportion of croplands and cropland mosaic. We highlight the possibility of a novel anthropogenic influence on hydrologic cycling in regions where water resources are scarce.",

More recently, sea ice variability has also been implicated as a potential driver of winter weather and extremes, leading to a number of studies comparing the impact of prescribed sea ice and snow cover anomalies. Whilst many GCMs have the inbuilt functionality to prescribe sea ice and SSTs, this is generally not the case for snow. It is therefore important to establish a realistic and consistent method of prescribing snow anomalies. We report on a suite of GCM experiments that investigate the sensitivity of the atmospheric response to the timing of a single, large anomaly of snow water equivalent. Albedo and surface fluxes in these perturbed snow experiments are compared to observations from daily MEaSUREs snow extent and AMSR-E/Aqua snow water equivalent. We then use wave flux and atmospheric mode (e.g. the NAO) diagnostics to track the response of the troposphere to the timing of these anomalies.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, record high temperatures combined with extreme precipitation deficits have led to record-breaking droughts that have affected the Southern Plains. The 2011 drought and heat wave caused over $12B in damages across the SP region. Here, we combine station data with reanalysis to identify the hottest summers in the last 30 years. Consistent with previous analysis, we find that very hot temperatures over the region are highly correlated both precipitation as well as soil moisture deficits.\nAtmospheric circulation in the SP region during summer is generally dominated by the North Atlantic Subtropical High (NASH), which extends westward from its winter position over the Atlantic. The anticyclonic circulation could play a role in reducing convective precipitation as well as preventing disturbances from moving into the SP region. Examining the NARR reanalysis for the hottest summers of record, we find that the anticyclonic circulation associated with the NASH extends over the SP region relatively earlier in the summer and results in a comparatively stronger anticyclonic circulation, which in turn seems to be influenced by the large-scale climate variability. Specifically, the negative phase of the Pacific/North American (PNA) teleconnection pattern is characterized by high pressure anomalies across the southeastern and south central U.S. during summer. The two hottest years in the last three decades (1980 and 2011) also correlate with the two strongest negative PNA phases over that time.\nOne of the anticipated impacts of human-induced climate change is the increased risk of hot and potentially dry summers across the SP region. For that reason, we also assess to what extent CMIP5 models are able simulate the large-scale processes that, according to reanalysis, are closely related to extreme hot and dry summer conditions over the Southern Plains. Composite maps of extreme heat years simulated in the models do display a stronger-than-average anticyclonic circulation that intensifies during summer, although the amplitude is much less than the reanalysis data. How the climate models simulate the relationship of the PNA to the temperature and precipitation over the SP region and whether/how it could be related to projected changes in future extreme summers will be also discussed.",

Nearly all of our knowledge of surface mass variability comes from snow pit and ice core stratigraphy, providing annual resolution with relatively large uncertainties that are inadequate for constraining meteorological models. Further, little information is available on how the density of the firn layer changes with time, hampering efforts to estimate mass change from altimetry measurements. Since the spring of 2012 we have obtained continuous measurements of changes in firn column density and, since spring 2015, mass balance at multiple sites in the percolation zone of the Jakobshavn Isbrae catchment in western Greenland. Surface mass balance is obtained from both snow scale and cosmic ray sensors, providing cross-validation. Following a description of the multiple technologies employed, we assess variations in compaction and surface mass balance in relation to meteorological variables. We then compare our measurements to model estimates and conclude with recommendations for continued and expanded observational activities.",

            "abstract": "The principal issue with respect to marine impulsive sources to acquire seismic data is if the emission of acoustic energy inflicts harm on marine mammals or not, since the volume of the source signal being released into the marine environment could be so large compared to the sound range of the mammals. We propose a marine seismic vibrator as an alternative to the impulsive sources to mitigate a risk of the impact to the marine environment while satisfying the necessary conditions of seismic surveys. These conditions include the repeatability and the controllability of source signals both in amplitude and phase for high-quality measurements. We, therefore, designed a towed marine seismic vibrator (MSV) as a new type marine vibratory seismic source that employed the hydraulic servo system for the controllability condition in phase and in amplitude that assures the repeatability as well. After fabricating a downsized MSV that requires the power of 30 kVA at a depth of about 250 m in water, several sea trials were conducted to test the source characteristics of the downsized MSV in terms of amplitude, frequency, horizontal and vertical directivities of the generated field. The maximum sound level satisfied the designed specification in the frequencies ranging from 3 to 300 Hz almost omnidirectionally. After checking the source characteristics, we then conducted a trial seismic survey, using both the downsized MSV and an airgun of 480 cubic-inches for comparison, with a streamer cable of 2,000m long right above a cabled earthquake observatory in the Japan Sea. The result showed that the penetration of seismic signals generated by the downsized MSV was comparable to that by the airgun, although there was a slight difference in the signal-to-noise ratio. The MSV could become a versatile source that will not harm living marine mammals as an alternative to the existing impulsive seismic sources such as airgun.",

            "abstract": "The Hydrologic Simulation Program Fortran (HSPF) model is a conceptual based model, in contrast to the alternative grid-based hydrologic models. In its application, the HSPF model has been applied almost exclusively to watersheds scales larger than HUC 14. We applied the HSPF model to a small forested watershed located at the Marcell experimental forest in north-central Minnesota. The watershed has an area of 9.7 hectares and is one of six experimental watersheds managed by the U.S. Forest Service. These experimental watersheds have been in operation since 1955. While some of the experimental watersheds have experienced environmental disturbance (e.g., clear-cutting), the S2 watershed has been in continuous forested condition for the last century. The S2 watershed is composed of forested upland hillslopes that connect to a raised bog area. The forest is aspen (Populus sp.) and birch (Betula papyrifera) on uplands and spruce (Picea mariana) on a 3.2 ha central bog. The upland soils are composed of a shallow sandy loam overlying clay loam which impedes vertical water movement. Water input to the peatland is either from direct precipitation or from the upland hillslopes. Water flux from the bog is either through ET, groundwater seepage losses, or surface discharge to a stream network. Streamflow is measured at a v-notch weir. Within the watershed two upland hillslopes have been isolated to monitor surface runoff and subsurface flow since the 1980’s. The HSPF model was applied to the watershed using precipitation and other meteorological data collected within the watershed or nearby on the Experimental Forest. The model representation of the watershed included one element for the upland hillslope area, and one element for the bog area. Daily flows from water years 1991 to 1995 were used to calibrate the model. An equal period of time was used to validate the model from 1996 to 2000. Nash-Sutcliffe values were very good for both calibration and validation. Calibration monthly and daily NS were 0.86 and 0.80, respectively. Validation monthly and daily NS were 0.85 and 0.71, respectively. The calibration time period overestimated flow by 0.33% while the validation period overestimated flow by 2.69%. Reduction of model accuracy was mainly related to the intermittency of the upland runoff and bog outflows.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the response of ecosystems to past climate is critical for evaluating the impacts of future climate changes. A relatively abrupt vegetation shift in response to the late Holocene gradual climate changes has been well documented for the Sahara-Sahel ecosystem. However, whether such threshold shift is of universal significance remains to be further addressed. Here, we examine the vegetation-climate relationships in central Asia based on four newly recovered Holocene pollen records and a synthesis on previously published pollen data. The results show that the orbital-induced gradual climate trend during the Holocene led to two major abrupt vegetation shifts, and that the timings of these shifts are highly dependent of the local rainfall conditions. Instead, the mid-Holocene vegetation remained rather stable despite of the changing climate. These new findings demonstrate generally significant threshold and truncation effects of climate changes on vegetation, as are strongly supported by surface pollen data and LPJ-GUESS modeling. The results also imply that using pollen data to reconstruct past climate changes is not always straightforward. Our findings have important implication for understanding the potential effects of global warming on dryland ecosystem change.",

It is not clear what is the pathway of ionospheric oxygen to the ring current and what are the mechanisms responsible for their transit from the ionosphere in the time scales observed. A more complete understanding of the nature of this transport mechanism for ions, in particular of O+, is essential to understanding plasmasheet and ring current dynamics. We present a modeling effort based on a 3D MHD global magnetosphere code (LFM), coupled with a guiding center test particle code to explore an O+ activity-dependent transport path from the ionosphere to the plasmasheet and the effects of the O+ in transit between these two regions during transitions from quiet to storm times. The overarching scientific objective of this investigation is to understand and quantify through test particle simulations the dynamics of this transport. A better understanding of this transport mechanism could improve large-scale magnetospheric models that can in turn be used to investigate the effects of energetic O+ on ring current dynamics.",

A precision-ground specimen of this material, sleeved in Pt tubing within a mild-steel jacket, was tested in torsional forced oscillation at seismic frequencies (mHz-Hz) and temperatures to 1200 °C, under 200 MPa confining pressure. The shear modulus was observed to decrease systematically with increasing oscillation period and temperature, accompanied by monotonically increasing dissipation, which are characteristic of absorption band or high-temperature-background behaviour. In a previous preliminary report, the new data were compared with the model of Jackson and Faul (Phys. Earth Planet. Interiors, 2010) for a suite of essentially anhydrous Ti-free olivine polycrystals, evaluated at the 25 μm grain size of the hydrous titaniferous olivine specimen, showing that the latter is vastly more dissipative than its anhydrous equivalent (by an order of magnitude at 1200 °C) and correspondingly lower in shear modulus. The results of additional experiments now better constrain the mechanical behaviour of the enclosing Pt sleeve and allow direct comparison with data for an anhydrous titaniferous olivine of comparable grain size. The latest results confirm a very strong influence of water on seismic wave attenuation, even under the water-undersaturated conditions expected to prevail in the Earth’s upper mantle.",

Even though urban forests stored a relatively small proportion of the total terrestrial C, they also provide other important ecosystem services such as improving air quality, cooling effect in buildings and aesthetics. Thus in view of these environmental services the quantification of urban tree is increasingly viewed as essential to the understanding of how these ecosystem services can be optimized. The aims of this paper are to: i) quantify the spatial-temporal distribution of urban forests in Northwest Sydney using remote sensing techniques; ii) determine the total urban C-storage over many decades; iii) apply UFORE model to estimate air pollutant removal ability of urban forest. The results revealed the estimated total trees in Northwest Sydney in 2011was approximately 2.3 million. These urban forests potentially store an estimated 1.3 million tons of carbon in various forms such as biomass, soil carbon, etc. The relative carbon sequestration rate of these trees was estimated to be about 20,500 tC/yr (equivalent to $AUD 467,000/year). Furthermore, the results show that trees near buildings can potentially avoid $AUD 12.9 million of energy cost every year and 70000 tons of carbon emission, the latter which is equivalent to additional savings of nearly $AUD 1.6 million per year. We also estimated that urban forests in the study area could potentially remove about 44,600 tons of pollutants (mainly greenhouse gases) annually equivalent to a saving of about $AUD 409 million per year. Thus the results reveal the spatial-temporal variation of urban vegetation in the last twenty year between 1991 and 2011. The study has showcased the importance and potential role of urban forests in preserving carbon and thus reducing GHG emissions into atmosphere. Furthermore, these results highlight the significant value of urban forests in term of pollutant removal. The significance of these outcomes, if extrapolated to other cities of Australia and the world, is huge.",

The project has identified 5 sites along the river to track bacterial loads. In the tropics, Enterococcus faecalis is an important indicator for fecal contamination in surface waters as it does not reproduce as quickly soils as E. coli. A combination of EPA 1600 and 9230B from Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater for identification of E. faecalis were utilized. The assay is a four step procedure that identifies the four criteria of bacteria in the group D Streptococcus system. The criteria require that the bacteria are Gram-positive cocci and Esculin-positive. There also must be growth in Brain Heart Infusion Broth at 35C and 45C as well as growth in Brain Heart Infusion broth + 6.5% NaCl. Further research will be conducted at North Carolina State University to ascertain the vertebrate species that is the source of the contamination through the use of qPCR.",

The most significant climate warming manifestation would be a change in the distribution of precipitation and evaporation, and the exacerbation of extreme hydrologic events. Due to this phenomenon and the fact that precipitation is the most important component of the water cycle, the assumption of its stationarity for water management and engineering design should be examined closely. The precipitation Annual Maximum Series (AMS) over some stations in Virginia based on in situ data were been used as a starting point to examine this important issue.\nWe analyzed the AMS precipitation on NOAA data for the stations close to Fairfax VA, looked for trends in extreme values, and applied our new method of Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) theory based on quadratic forms to address changes in those extreme values and to quantify non-stationarities. It is very important to address the extreme values of precipitation based on several statistical tests to have better understanding of climate change impact on the extreme water cycle events. In our study we compared our results with the conclusion on NOAA atlas 14 Ap.3 which found no sign of precipitation non-stationarity. We then assessed the impact of this uncertainty in IDF curves on the flood map of Fairfax and compared the results with the classic IDF curves.",

            "abstract": "In our previous study, we have observed trace element concentrations in groundwater increased when groundwater temperature was increased with constant thermal loading using a 50-m long vertical heat exchanger installed at Saitama University, Japan. During the field experiment, 38 degree C fluid was circulated in the heat exchanger resulting 2.8 kW thermal loading over 295 days. Groundwater samples were collected regularly from 17-m and 40-m deep aquifers at four observation wells located 1, 2, 5, and 10 m, respectively, from the heat exchange well and were analyzed with ICP-MS. As a result, concentrations of some trace elements such as boron increased with temperature especially at the 17-m deep aquifer that is known as marine sediment. It has been also observed that the increased concentrations have decreased after the thermal loading was terminated indicating that this phenomenon may be reversible. Although the mechanism is not fully understood, changes in the liquid phase concentration should be associated with dissolution and/or desorption from the solid phase. We therefore attempt to model this phenomenon by introducing temperature dependence in equilibrium linear adsorption isotherms. We assumed that distribution coefficients decrease with temperature so that the liquid phase concentration of a given element becomes higher as the temperature increases under the condition that the total mass stays constant. A shape function was developed to model the temperature dependence of the distribution coefficient. By solving the mass balance equation between the liquid phase and the solid phase for a given element, a new term describing changes in the concentration was implemented in a source/sink term of a standard convection dispersion equation (CDE). The CDE was then solved under a constant ground water flow using FlexPDE. By calibrating parameters in the newly developed shape function, the changes in element concentrations observed were quite well predicted. The model developed in this study is a novel attempt to simulate changes in groundwater quality during thermal loading to the subsurface. Although more experimental and theoretical studies need to be done, the results of this study at least provide some good insights regarding behavior of trace elements in groundwater when temperature is changing.",

Heat flow in the continental slope was collected for the first time and is rather higher than those from deep boreholes (up to a few km below the seafloor) in the continental shelf. However, the smaller geothermal gradient and thermal conductivity were observed from sites along a transect line across permafrost limit on the eastern slope of the trough. It is noted that geothermal gradients are relatively constant in the vicinity of permafrost limit but are much smaller (even minus) only at deeper depths with positive bottom water temperature. Reason for such distribution is unclear yet. Based on observed geothermal gradient and bottom water temperature, permafrost table shown in subbottom profile seems to be controlled not by temperature. On the other hand, our finding of permafrost evidence on the other subbottom profile located landward may support that permafrost limit in the trough is along with ~100 m isobath.",

            "abstract": "Streambank erosion is a common non-point source contributing to suspended sediment and nutrient loading of waterways, and recently has been estimated to account for 30-80% of sediment loading into receiving waters. There is interest in developing reliable methods to quantify bank erosion in watersheds, so effective management strategies can be devised. However, current methods can be either cost prohibitive or unreliable. Direct measurement approaches (surveys and erosion pins) are labor intensive and yield site-specific measurements that are limited for extrapolation to larger scales. Similar issues arise with analytical methods such as slope stability analysis, which require material parameters that are resource intensive to determine. Newer approaches such as use of aerial LiDAR data have proved effective for watershed level assessment, but come with long turnaround times and high cost. Terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) is also effective and offers high accuracy, however collection over large areas is impractical and post-processing is labor intensive. New technology in the form of unmanned aerial systems (UAS) has the potential to significantly enhance the ability to monitor channel migration and quantify bank erosion at variable scales.\nIn this study, 20 km of the Mad and Winooski Rivers in Vermont were flown using a senseFly eBee UAS. Flights were made in spring and fall 2015 in leaf-off conditions with selected portions also flown after large storms in the summer. Change in bank profiles between spring and fall flights provide a comprehensive estimate of bank erosion along the study reaches. Six sites with varying bank heights, erosion sensitivity, and vegetation conditions were selected for simultaneous surveying using a TLS. Point cloud data from both the TLS and UAS were compared to assess the accuracy of the UAS for capturing the bank profile. Changes in bank cross-sections and in volumes calculated from 3D digital surface models were used to compare the UAS and TLS methods. Ascertaining the accuracy of UAS in measuring streambank profiles will determine the appropriateness of the technology for long-term monitoring of bank erosion. The ability for rapid deployment, covering large areas, and fast post-processing allow for more comprehensive monitoring of streambank erosion in river systems.",

Such electrical activity poses serious risks to any Human exploration of the planet and the lack of sufficient data to characterize any such activity has been identified by NASA’s MEPAG as a key human safety knowledge gap. There are three key elements in the characterization of Martian electrostatic discharges: dependence on Martian environmental conditions, frequency of occurrence, and the strength of the generated electric fields. We will describe a proposed program using NASA’s Deep Space Network (DSN) to carry out a long term monitoring campaign to search for and characterize the entire Mars hemisphere for powerful discharges during routine tracking of spacecraft at Mars on an entirely non-interfering basis. The resulting knowledge of Mars electrical activity would allow NASA to plan risk mitigation measures to ensure human safety during Mars exploration. In addition, these measurements will also allow us to place limits on presence of oxidants such as H2O2 that may be produced by such discharges, providing another measurement point for models describing Martian atmospheric chemistry and habitability. Because of the continuous Mars telecommunication needs of NASA’s Mars-based assets, the DSN is the only instrument in the world that combines long term, high cadence, observing opportunities with large sensitive telescopes, making it a unique asset worldwide in searching for and characterizing electrostatic activity at Mars from the ground.",

Lefsky (2010) first utilized the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) on the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to generate a global forest canopy height map in 2010. Simard et al. (2011) integrated GLAS data and other ancillary variables, such as MODIS, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (STRM), and climatic data, to generate another global forest canopy height map in 2011. Los et al. (2012) also used GLAS data to create a vegetation height map in 2012.Several studies attempted to compare these global height maps to other sources of data., Bolton et al. (2013) concluded that Simard’s forest canopy height map has strong agreement with airborne lidar derived heights. Los map is a coarse spatial resolution vegetation height map with a 0.5 decimal degrees horizontal resolution, around 50 km in the US, which is not feasible for the purpose of our research. Thus, Simard’s global forest canopy height map is the primary map for this research study. The main objectives of this research were to validate and calibrate Simard’s map with airborne lidar data and other ancillary variables in the southern United States.\nThe airborne lidar data was collected between 2010 and 2012 from: (1) NASA LiDAR, Hyperspectral & Thermal Image (G-LiHT) program; (2) National Ecological Observatory Network’s (NEON) prototype data sharing program; (3) NSF Open Topography Facility; and (4) the Department of Ecosystem Science and Management at Texas A&M University. The airborne lidar study areas also cover a wide variety of vegetation types across the southern US.\nThe airborne lidar data is post-processed to generate lidar-derived metrics and assigned to four different classes of point cloud data. The four classes of point cloud data are the data with ground points, above 1 m, above 3 m, and above 5 m. The root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination (R2) are used for examining the discrepancies of the canopy heights between the airborne lidar-derived metrics and global forest canopy height map, and the regression and random forest approaches are used to calibrate the global forest canopy height map. In summary, the research shows a calibrated forest canopy height map of the southern US.",

            "abstract": "Numerical models that predict channel evolution through time are an essential tool for investigating processes that occur over timescales which render field observation intractable. However, available morphodynamic models generally take one of two approaches to the complex problem of computing morphodynamics, resulting in oversimplification of the relevant physics (e.g. cellular models) or faithful, yet computationally intensive, representations of the hydraulic and sediment transport processes at play. The practical implication of these approaches is that river scientists must often choose between unrealistic results, in the case of the former, or computational demands that render modeling realistic spatiotemporal scales of channel evolution impossible. Here we present a new modeling framework that operates at the timescale of individual competent flows (e.g. floods), and uses a highly-simplified sediment transport routine that moves volumes of material according to morphologically-derived characteristic transport distances, or path lengths. Using this framework, we have constructed an open-source morphodynamic model, termed MoRPHED, which is here applied, and its validity investigated, at timescales ranging from a single event to a decade on two braided rivers in the UK and New Zealand. We do not purport that MoRPHED is the best, nor even an adequate, tool for modeling braided river dynamics at this range of timescales. Rather, our goal in this research is to explore the utility, feasibility, and sensitivity of an event-scale, path-length-based modeling framework for predicting braided river dynamics. To that end, we further explore (a) which processes are naturally emergent and which must be explicitly parameterized in the model, (b) the sensitivity of the model to the choice of particle travel distance, and (c) whether an event-scale model timestep is adequate for producing braided channel dynamics. The results of this research may inform techniques for future morphodynamic modeling that seeks to maximize computational resources while modeling fluvial dynamics at the timescales of change.",

The framework adopts a “bottom-up” approach to risk assessment that aims at a thorough understanding of a project’s vulnerabilities to climate change in the context of other nonclimate uncertainties (e.g., economic, environmental, demographic, political). It helps identify projects that perform well across a wide range of potential future climate conditions, as opposed to seeking solutions that are optimal in expected conditions but fragile to conditions deviating from the expected. Lessons learned through application of the Decision Tree to case studies in Kenya and Nepal will be presented, and aspects of the framework requiring further refinement will be described.",

            "abstract": "The goal of this study is to directly calibrate a freshwater microbial carbonate deposit currently forming in the Florida Everglades, to ancient deposits formed during Pleistocene marine transgressions of the South Florida platform. Through textural and geochemical analyses, this project tracks the deposition and early diagenesis of microbial carbonates and their associated organic content as an analogue study applicable to ancient microbialites.\nIn the modern, fine-grained low-Mg calcite crystals are precipitated and buried on a low-lying coastal plain (Paurotis Pond). Geochemical parameters were measured to provide baseline characterization of the deposition and early diagenesis of the freshwater muds. Stable isotopic values of the precipitated muds range from d18O of -1.5 to -2.5‰ and d13C 0.5 to -0.5‰, showing slight increases with depth. This change is likely due to waters from the underlying Pleistocene bedrock, diffusing up and mixing with the surface water. Total organic carbon (TOC) is depleted with depth from 10.4 to 4.2% as a result of the degradation of highly labile organic matter (heavier in d13Corg), leaving the resulting pool of organics increasingly negative (-23‰ to -26‰ in the modern).\nPleistocene freshwater limestones were observed in core borings ~20 km north of Paurotis Pond. These units closely resemble the modern muds, and allow us to assess the preservation potential of original microbial, geochemical, and textural signatures. Diagenesis has resulted in lighter d13C values relative to the adjacent altered marine units, as well as their modern equivalent. Organics in the Pleistocene are also characterized by more negative C and O isotopic compositions from interpreted original values, and TOC was reduced to <0.1%.\nResults suggest that both carbonate and organic fractions are pervasively altered during the burial process, and may not be effective paleoclimate indicators as some research suggests. However, these components may still provide some evidence of a microbial origin, in both textural components as well as the remaining d13Corg values are typically more negative than non-microbial organics.",

However, this is a task that is easier said than done. This presentation will discuss some of the successes and hurdles experiences through the past year, from a climate scientist’s perspective, working with engineers in infrastructure research and applied engineering through the Infrastructure & Climate Network (ICNet).\nEngineers rely on strict building codes and ordinances, and can be the subject of lawsuits if those codes are not followed. Matters are further complicated by the uncertainty inherent to climate projections, which include short-term natural variability, as well as the influence of scientific uncertainty and even human behavior on the rate and magnitude of change. Climate scientists typically address uncertainty by creating projections based on multiple models following different future scenarios. This uncertainty is difficult to incorporate into engineering projects, however, due to the fact that they cannot build two different bridges, one allowing for a lower amount of change, and another for a higher. More often than not there is a considerable difference between the costs of building two such bridges, which means that available funds often are the deciding factor.\nDiscussions of climate science are often well received with engineers who work in the research area of infrastructure; going a step further, however, and implementing it in applied engineering projects can be challenging. This presentation will discuss some of the challenges and opportunities inherent to collaborations between climate scientists and transportation engineers, drawing from a range of studies including truck weight restrictions on roads during the spring thaw, and bridge deck performance due to environmental forcings.",

Although not optimized for solar observations, NuSTAR can observe X-ray emission from the Sun with unprecedented sensitivity in the hard X-ray range; this is crucial for detecting individual events in the quiet corona. While NuSTAR has not yet detected any such events, we use QS data from the 01-November-2014 observations (at a GOES-level ~B4) to determine what types of events we could have detected. In particular, we place lower limits on the detectable flare emission measure for isothermal temperatures between 2 – 10 MK. While our sensitivity to date has been limited by noise due to active regions outside the field of view, these limits are still >2 orders of magnitude below the RHESSI detection limits at corresponding temperatures. We expect to increase our sensitivity by at least an order of magnitude with future observations at lower solar flux levels and with fewer active regions on the disk.",

Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM) lists 845 events for the period Jan. 2010 – Jun. 2015 with local magnitude up to 3.3. Peer review shows that the offshore events can be grouped into a number of small clusters, whereas onshore events are relatively few and unevenly distributed. It appears to have little relationship between the location of offshore event clusters and the direction of main onshore faults running NNE – SSW. In this study, we focus on the small events occurred in the area of N37°45´-38°35´ and E128°30´ – 129°20´. The Korea Integrated Seismic System (KISS) network operated by KIGAM and 5 temporary stations with Guralp CMG-40T short-period seismometers placed along the east coast of South Korea record the seismic energy generated from small events. The 137 events recorded from May to October 2014, ranging in local magnitude from 0.4 to 2.3, are already relocated using 1849 direct P-wave traveltimes identified from 29 stations. Relocation produced two major clusters in offshore Goseong (cluster 1) and Yangyang (cluster 2) province. The waveforms of relocated events in cluster 1 and 2 are similar to those from explosion in waters rather than earthquake, and spectrum analysis shows energy concentration on low frequencies below 10 Hz. We are combining the multidisciplinary data set from land based broadband and short-period seismometers, Guralp OBS system deployed in July this year, accelerometer and hydrophone array mounted on the offshore platforms of the underwater seismic observatory in the north of the study area. The integration of seismic and hydro-acoustic data in offshore supplements uneven azimuthal coverage and gives improved characterization of offshore seismic activity.",

Microbial activity changes the structures and properties that influence further bioavailability of NOM. To date, our understanding of these interactions is insufficient, and indigenous microbial activities that regulate NOM turnover are poorly resolved. It is critical to identify NOM characteristics to the structure and composition of microbial communities and to the metabolic potential of that community.\nTowards that end, sediment samples collected from the background area well FW305 (Oak Ridge Field Research Center, Oak Ridge, TN) were tested for NOM extraction methods that used three mild solvents, e.g., phosphate buffered saline (PBS), pyrophosphate, and MilliQ-water. MilliQ-water was finally chosen for extracting sediment samples via shaking and sonication. Groundwater from well FW301 was used as an inoculum to which the extracted NOM was added as carbon sources to feed native microbes. To identify the specific functional groups of extracted NOM that are bioavailable to indigenous microbes, several techniques, including FTIR, LC-MS, EEM, were applied to characterize the extracted NOM as well as the transformed NOM metabolites. 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing was also performed to identify the specific microbial diversity that was enriched and microbial isolates that preferentially grew with these NOM was also cultivated in the lab for future detailed studies.",

            "abstract": "Most of the current Earthquake Early Warning technologies focus on time analysis of wave amplitudes. There are two major drawbacks of these waveform-based techniques: tradeoffs between magnitude and distance estimation for the onsite algorithms, and time latency in alerts for the network algorithms. We are proposing an alternative EEW algorithm that combines the efficiency of onsite algorithms and accuracy of network algorithms, which provides the fastest alert at the moment of station trigger. It is achieved by using observed seismicity from the network as prior information to predict short-term seismic hazards, and then use trigger information from the onsite station as likelihood information to estimate earthquake probability and hypocenter location. This algorithm has numbers of advantages. First, due to the independent data source of this algorithm, results can be directly multiplied to the results of other algorithms such as GPS and waveform data under Bayesian framework to achieve posterior probability function. Second, it is especially beneficial for regions with sparsely distributed station density where it takes longer time for the seismic signals to arrive at the near stations. Lastly, it can significantly speed up warning process during aftershock sequence, swarm earthquake sequence, and mainshocks that had foreshocks. The concept can be further extended to network-based algorithms to incorporate arrived waveform data at more stations.",

A number of hydropower projects are currently being developed in East Africa in order to meet the energy demands of the fast growing economy in sustainable and climate-resilient manner. However, the performance efficiency of existing hydropower systems in Africa is much lower (about 30% in some cases) than their design capacity. This study proposes a decision support system (DSS) that integrates climate forecasts and remote sensing products into modeling and optimization of the hydropower systems in order to achieve reliable reservoir operations and enhance hydropower production efficiency. The DSS has three main components; climate system, hydrologic and water resources system, and optimization system. The climate system comprises of tools and interfaces for accessing, customizing and integrating climate forecasts and remote sensing data. The North America Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) seasonal retrospective forecasts for the East Africa Power Pool (EAPP) region are compared with the TRMM rainfall estimates and the CPC unified gauged rainfall data. The errors of the NMME seasonal forecasts have portrayed significant spatial and temporal variability in the EAPP region. The root mean square errors of the seasonal forecasts are relatively higher for wetter locations and months. However, the skills of the NMME seasonal forecasts are not significantly depreciating with lead time for the study region. The seasonal forecast errors vary from one model to another. Here, we present the skills of NMME seasonal forecasts, the physical factors and mechanisms that affect the skills. In addition, we discuss our methodology that derives the best seasonal forecasts for the study region from the NMME seasonal forecasts, and show how the climate forecast errors propagate through hydrologic models into hydrological forecasting.",

C. nudata now forms fringes along the edges of the low flow channel and grows as islands within the river. C. nudata appears to be altering channel morphology and planform in ways that may facilitate key restoration goals. I have employed multiple methods to investigate changes in channel morphology and planform in association with C. nudata: aerial imagery analysis, repeated topographic surveys, and erosion pins in cut banks with C. nudata fringes. Preliminary results suggest that C. nudata stabilizes the edges of the low flow channel, but cut banks behind C. nudata fringes continue to erode such that the bankflow width and channel boundaries continue to move. Aerial imagery analysis indicates that current C. nudata islands are often the result of C. nudata fringes becoming “detached” from banks rather than from initial establishment of plants in midchannel positions. Topographic surveys suggest scouring upstream of C. nudata islands and along the edges of C. nudata fringes. We propose a conceptual model in which multiple alternative pathways of river development may be possible after the establishment of C. nudata, depending on the antecedent conditions where it becomes established (e.g. bank composition, river curvature). Alternative pathways include: 1) bank stabilization, channel narrowing and deepening; 2) formation of a compound channel with a side channel that is activated at high flows; 3) the formation of islands within the channel. The potential for multiple pathways of development after C. nudata establishment may lead to complex patterns of river morphology and planform consistent with habitat complexity goals of river restoration.",

            "abstract": "While the current concentration of particulate matter (PM10) in the metropolitan areas of South Korea shows a continuous decreasing tendency, the high concentration episodes have reportedly been increasing. The Ministry of Environment of Korea plans to promote the Korea-US Air Quality Campaign (hereinafter referred to as KORUS-AQ) in cooperation with NASA, to identify the drivers of particulate matter and ozone and improve the accuracy of forecasting models.\nThe purpose of this research is to identify the chemical composition characteristics of particulate matters (PM10 and PM2.5) by analyzing the filters collected at the Seoul intensive monitoring site during the pre-campaign period. From May 18 through June 19 in 2015, we collected the PM10 and PM2.5 samples from 10 am to 9 am the next day every day for 23 hours by using the low-volume air sampler at KIST, located in Hawolgok-dong, Seongbuk-gu, Seoul, Korea, to analyse fine dust concentration and ionic, carbonaceous, and elemental components.\nDuring the research period, the PM10 and PM2.5 mass concentrations were within 21.1 - 78.5 ug/m3 and 12.0 - 56.0 ug/m3, respectively and the average PM10 and PM2.5 mass concentrations were 42.5 ug/m3 and 24.6 ug/m3, respectively. In 24.6 ug/m3 of the average PM2.5 mass concentration, anions were 37.1 %( 9.7 ug/m3) and cations were 13.9%( 3.6 ug/m3), indicating that 51% of the PM2.5 components were ions. In the ionic components of PM2.5, sulfate showed the highest concentration (7.03 ug/m3), followed by nitrate (2.61 ug/m3), chloride (0.08 ug/m3), ammonium (3.14 mu/m3), sodium (0.17 ug/m3), kalium (0.15 ug/m3), calcium (0.11 ug/m3), and magnesium (0.01 ug/m3).\nThe average concentrations of carbonaceous components of PM2.5 were 4.2 ug/m3 (18.7 %) for organic carbon (OC) and 2.2 ug /m3 (9.8 %) for inorganic carbon (EC), indicating that PM2.5 had total 6.4 ug/m3 (28.5 %) of carbon. As a result of the analysis on elemental components, it was shown that PM2.5 had 1.61 ug/m3(6.9 %) of crustal materials and 0.08 ug/m3 (0.4 %) of trace metals that accounted for 7.3%. PM10 was high in crustal materials, as it had 7.40 ug/m3(18.0 %) of crustal materials and 0.15 ug/m3 (0.4 %) of trace metals that accounted for 18.4%. Compared to PM2.5, PM10 showed high concentrations of K, Ca, Ti, Fe, and Zn that are the main components of fugitive dusts and crust materials.",

Japan has been sending a field team to Greenland each year since 2011, to construct and maintain the GLISN stations especially on ice. However, the thick and heterogeneous Greenland ice sheet is considered to cause various kinds of distortion on seismic waveforms observed at these ice stations.\nWe have been working for construction of a numerical technique, which can calculate accurate regional seismic wavefields with small computational requirements. In this presentation, we calculate elastic wave propagation up to 2 Hz for several structural models of the Greenland ice sheet radiated from a seismic source with various depths and mechanisms. Our computations for a realistic ice sheet model, the near-surface seismic source produced a very characteristic wave train with the group velocity smaller than the S-wavespeed in the ice, which is considered as an ice-sheet guided S wave, developed by a superposition of post-critical reflections between the free surface and the ice bed. We named this wave \"Le\" on the analogy of the Lg wave, a crustally guided S wave (\"e\" comes from the German word \"Eisdecke\", meaning the ice sheet). Furthermore, computation for a deeper seismic source resulted in reinforcement of the crustal Sg-coda wave with a group velocity range of ~3.1-2.6 km/s, which well explains the characteristic waveform observed on the Greenland ice sheet.\nIn the presentation, we will show several results for the Antarctic ice sheet.",

            "abstract": "Sinuous wrinkle ridges are common tectonic landforms on Mars and in lunar mare basins. They have up to hundreds of meters of relief on the Moon and up to over a kilometer of relief on Mars, and are interpreted as folded basalt layers overlying thrust faults. They consist of a narrow, asymmetric ridge atop a broad arch and sometimes occur radial to or concentric with the centers of some mass concentrations (mascons). Wrinkle ridges with these patterns have previously been associated with mascons – dense concentrations of mass identified by positive gravity anomalies. Loading of the crust by mascons causes flexure and subsidence to form wrinkle ridges. However, some basins on the Moon including western Mare Frigoris are not associated with mascons, yet wrinkle ridges deform the mare. On Mars, gravity data is coarser, but wrinkle ridges are sometimes observed in terrains that are not expected to have a significant mascon. The origin of compressional stresses in non-mascon environments remains an outstanding question.\nA key step to better understanding the occurrence of wrinkle ridges in non-mascon environments is characterizing the behavior of the underlying faults. We expand upon methods used in Williams N. R. et al. [2013] and apply fault dislocation modeling to estimate geometries and displacements for selected wrinkle ridge faults. On the Moon, we use a digital terrain model (DTM) derived from Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC) Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) stereo images to constrain fault models. On Mars, we use a DTM derived from High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) stereo images. Different from our previous work, we apply inverse methods on a triangular mesh [Shirzaei & Bürgmann, 2013] to model ridge relief for curved fault geometries. Preliminary results suggest maximum depths of faulting within the upper few km and shallow (<40°) dip angles. These preliminary modeled values are comparable to previous estimates for other lunar and martian wrinkle ridges, and suggest this faulting is likely confined to within the upper crust.",

The eastern passive continental margin has been modified by multiple episodes of orogenesis and rifting through several cycles of supercontinent assembly and breakup over the past 1.3 billion years of Earth history. The MAGIC Flexible Array broadband seismic deployment began in October 2013, with the main phase of the deployment taking place in October 2014. As of summer 2015 the experiment had 27 stations running; the deployment will demobilize in October 2016. We have investigated splitting of SKS phases measured at MAGIC stations during the early stages of the deployment. As illustrated by this presentation, stations located in the Appalachian Mountains, present fast splitting directions parallel to the strike of the Appalachian range, with delay times of approximately 1 sec. At stations to the east and west of the high topography, we find more complicated splitting patterns, with fast directions that vary over short length scales and a large number of null SKS arrivals over a range of backazimuths. These observations suggest a significant contribution to SKS splitting from anisotropy in the lithospheric upper mantle in our study region.",

            "abstract": "Coastal areas are often characterized by high population densities in an ever changing, dynamic environment. The world’s coasts are often dominated by steeply sloping sea cliffs, the morphology of which reflects rock type, wave erosion, and surface erosion, as well as human activities such changing vegetation, urban runoff, and construction of coastal defenses. The Santa Barbara and Goleta area, with over 17 km of sea cliffs and beaches, extends from Santa Barbara Point west to the hamlet of Isla Vista. A deeper understanding of the local geology and the physical processes generating slope failure and, thus, landward cliff retreat is important for general public safety, as well as future development and planning. Our research objective includes assessment of landslide hazard potential through investigation of previous landslides and how these events relate to various physical variables and characteristics within the surrounding bedrock. How does landslide frequency, volume, and type relate to varying local bedrock and structure?\nTwo geologic formations dominate the sea cliffs of the Santa Barbara area: Monterey shale (upper, middle, and lower) and Monterey Sisquoc shale. Geology varies from hard cemented shale and diatomaceous, low specific gravity shale to compaction shale. Variations in landslide characteristics are linked closely to the geology of a specific site that affects how easily rock units are weathered and eroded by wave erosion, naturally occurring oil and water seeps, burnt shale events, and landslide type and frequency on steeply dipped bedding planes/daylighting beds. Naturally occurring features linked to human processes often weaken bedrock and, thus, increase the likelihood of landslides. We categorize landslide frequency, type, and triggers; location of beach access, drainage pipes, and water; and oil and tar seeps in order to develop suggestions to minimize landslide potential. Lastly, using previously published erosion cliff retreat rates and sea level rise estimates, a map displaying likely position of the coastline by 2100 will be created. This information will be useful to the county of Santa Barbara, California when considering future development and hazard mitigation plans.",

            "abstract": "We calculated topographic gradients over the surface of the Moon at a 25 m baseline using data obtained by the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) instrument onboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) spacecraft. The derived slope-frequency distribution revealed a steep roll-over for slopes close to the angle of repose. Slopes significantly steeper than the angle of repose are almost absent on the Moon due to (1) the general absence of cohesion/strength of the fractured and fragmented megaregolith of the lunar highlands, and (2) the absence of steep-slope producing geological processes in the recent geological past. The majority of slopes steeper than 32 - 35 degrees are associated with relatively young large impact craters. Very rare extremely steep (> 45 degrees) slopes are exclusively associated with large Copernican-age craters. Craters of Early Imbrian age and older are devoid of slopes steeper than ~35 degrees. We interpret these observations in the following way. Every basin-forming impact removes steep slopes by global seismic shaking causing slope collapse. The latest such impact formed Orientale basin and instantly removed all preexisting slopes steeper than ~35 degrees. This makes steep slopes a good global stratigraphic marker at Early/Late Imbrian boundary. After the Orientale impact, craters lose their steepest slopes progressively with time. This makes crater wall steepness an independent proxy for crater age. The global spatial distribution of the proportion of the steepest slopes correlates moderately well with the predicted spatial distribution of impact rate: low latitudes and the leading hemisphere have a higher steep slope proportion than high latitudes and the trailing hemisphere. However, the southern farside has a significant paucity of steep slopes, which remains unexplained.

Diatomaceous sediments were recovered Site 1150 and Site 1151, and the depth of each site is 1181.60 mbsf and 1113.60 mbsf, respectively. This area is under the influence of the Oyashio current and is one of the highly bio-productive regions of the North Pacific Ocean (Motoyama et al., 2004). The combination of high productivity and active tectonic deformation that often caused high rate accumulating of fossil and organic rich sediments. Likewise, IODP Exp. 341 was implemented on off South Alaska. Pelagic and MTD ‘s layer were recognized with IRD(Ice Rafted Debris).\nIn Tohoku, The onboard results of porosity measurements show high value (50-70 %) down to 1000 mbsf, and obviously higher than nearby subduction trench, Nankai Trough (Taylor and Fisher, 1993). There is a possibility that diatomaceous shell keep a frame structure from effective stress and load pressure. On another drilling site result, DSDP Leg. 19 located 60 km to the north of ODP sites, was reported high value of porosity, but recognized only shallow range (>500 mbsf) (Shephard and Bryant, 1980). Also, South Alaska sediments show high sedimentation rate and cyclic MTD's Layer. Permeability was lower than Tohoku sediments in spite of upper depth.\nWe focused on the relationships between physical property, microstructure, and logging data at deep range(-1000 mbsf). Logging data were collected using wireline logging (Sacks and Suyehiro, 2003; IODP Prel. Rept., 341., 2014). Based on these results, it is expected that microstructure and logging can be integrated into a general model of core-log correlation.\nIn this presentation, We show results of microstructure using SEM, measured physical properties, and wireline logging data, respectively.",

Yet most leaf-level studies demonstrating the link between chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthesis have studied leaves in their prime: leaves that recently finished expansion and have yet to senesce. By contrast, remote sensing of landscapes involves observing leaves of different ages. For example, broadleaf deciduous forests and annual plant communities in temperate regions have leaves that develop and then senesce over the course of a growing season. In this experiment, we explored how leaf age and moisture availability affect steady-state fluoresence (Fs) at the leaf level. We simultaneously measured net photosynthesis (Anet) and Fs for leaves of known ages on greenhouse-grown dwarf Helianthus Annuus (sunflowers) from two watering treatments. To monitor plant water status, we measured pre-dawn water potential, and, for a subset of leaves, osmotic potential. Fully expanded or near-fully expanded leaves (~8 to ~23 days old) had higher Anet at saturating light than young, expanding leaves (less than 8 days old) or old leaves nearing senescence (>23 days old). We found a positive relationship between Fs and Anet, suggesting that the link between fluorescence emission and photosynthesis is robust across leaves of different ages. However, leaf age had marked effects on the light response curve of photosynthesis and fluorescence metrics. These results suggest that leaf age distribution, and changes in leaf age distribution due to phenology, should be considered when interpreting SIF at the landscape level.",

However, so far very little is known about the potential influence of fractionation of the stable Li isotope composition of biogenic carbonates. Here, we investigate the δ7Li of various organisms (particularly mollusks, echinoderms and brachiopods) abundant in the Phanerozoic record, in order to understand which geologic archives might provide the best targets for reconstructing past seawater composition. The range of measured samples includes (i) modern calcite and aragonite shells from variable natural environments, (ii) shells from organisms grown under controlled conditions (temperature, salinity, pCO2), and (iii) fossil shells from a range of species collected from Miocene deposits. When possible, both the inner and outer layers of bivalves were micro-sampled to assess the intra-shell heterogeneity.\nFor calcitic shells, the measured δ7Li of bivalve species range from +32 to +41‰ and is systematically enriched in the heavy isotope relative to seawater (31 ‰) and to inorganic calcite, which is characterized by Δ7Licalcite–seawater = −2 to −5‰ [1]. The Li isotope composition of aragonitic bivalves, ranging from +16 to +22‰, is slightly fractionated to both high and low δ7Li relative to inorganic aragonite. The largest intra-shell Li isotope variability is observed for mixed calcite-aragonite shells (more than 20‰) whereas in single mineralogy shells, intra-shell δ7Li variability is generally less than 3‰. Overall, these results suggest a strong influence of vital effects on Li isotopes during bio-calcification of bivalve shells. On the contrary, measured brachiopods systematically exhibit fractionation that is very similar to inorganic calcite, with a mean δ7Li of 27.0±1.5‰, suggesting that brachiopods may provide good targets for future work aiming to reconstruct the Li isotope composition seawater.",

Data types, volumes, packaging, and use cases evolve. Scientific requirements emerge and mature. Standards shift while systems scale and adapt. In this complex and dynamic environment, interoperability remains a critical component of successful cyberinfrastructure. Through the resource- and priority-driven iterations on systems, interfaces, and content, questions fundamental to stable and useful Earth Science cyberinfrastructure arise. For instance, how are sociotechnical changes planned, tracked, and communicated? How should operational stability balance against ‘new and shiny’? How can ongoing maintenance and mitigation of technical debt be managed in an often short-term resource environment? \nThe Arctic Data Explorer is a metadata brokering application developed to enable discovery of international, interdisciplinary Arctic data across distributed repositories. Completely dependent on interoperable third party systems, the Arctic Data Explorer publicly launched in 2013 with an original 3000+ data records from four Arctic repositories. Since then the search has scaled to 25,000+ data records from thirteen repositories at the time of writing. In the final months of original project funding, priorities shift to lean operations with a strategic eye on the future. Here we present lessons learned from four years of Arctic Data Explorer design, development, communication, and maintenance work along with remaining questions and potential directions.",

            "abstract": "Agricultural land cover dynamics in the U.S. are dominated by two trends: 1) total agricultural land is decreasing and 2) average farm size is increasing. These trends have important implications for the future of water resources because 1) growing more food on less land is due in large part to increased groundwater withdrawal and 2) larger farms can better afford both more efficient irrigation and more groundwater access. However, these large-scale trends are due to individual farm operators responding to many factors including climate, economics, and policy. It is therefore difficult to incorporate the trends into watershed-scale hydrologic models. Traditional scenario-based approaches are valuable for many applications, but there is typically no feedback between the hydrologic model and the agricultural dynamics and so limited insight is gained into the how agriculture co-evolves with water resources.\nWe present a socio-hydrologic model that couples simplified hydrologic and agricultural economic dynamics, accounting for many factors that depend on farm size such as irrigation efficiency and returns to scale. We introduce an “economic memory” (EM) state variable that is driven by agricultural revenue and affects whether farms are sold when land market values exceed expected returns from agriculture. The model uses a Generalized Mixture Model of Gaussians to approximate the distribution of farm sizes in a study area, effectively lumping farms into “small,” “medium,” and “large” groups that have independent parameterizations. We apply the model in a semi-arid watershed in the upper Columbia River Basin, calibrating to data on streamflow, total agricultural land cover, and farm size distribution. The model is used to investigate the sensitivity of the coupled system to various hydrologic and economic scenarios such as increasing market value of land, reduced surface water availability, and increased irrigation efficiency in small farms.",

Because the eolian fluxes in the Southern Hemisphere are so low, subtle changes in the absolute flux of dust and volcanic ash may have a disproportionally large impact on climate. Our multi-site record of eolian dust and volcanic ash accumulation in pelagic clay of the South Pacific Gyre (SPG), gathered during IODP Expedition 329, shows that eolian fluxes varied by an order of magnitude over the Cenozoic and correlate with changes of tectonic processes and global climate.\nWe analyzed the concentrations of 37 elements in 138 bulk pelagic clay samples from 6 sites drilled throughout the SPG. Using multivariate statistical modeling of the geochemical dataset (e.g. Q-mode factor analysis and multiple linear regression) and a cobalt-based age model, we quantified the mass accumulation rate (MAR) of 6 end-members that comprise the SPG pelagic clay: dust, rhyolite, altered basalt, Fe-Mn oxyhydroxides, excess Si, and apatite.\nOur record shows that Australian dust MAR begins at the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum ~50 Ma as global temperatures began to cool and Australia began to tectonically separate from Antarctica. The mid-Miocene has noticeably higher MAR of dust and ash at multiple sites. While a simultaneous increase in production is possible (i.e., more aridity and volcanic activity), the synchronicity may be more indicative of stronger winds in the Southern Hemisphere and increased material in the atmosphere during this time.\nHeavier Mg isotopes occur at Site U1366 in samples that are composed primarily of hydrothermal deposition, excess Si, and volcanic ash. The Mg isotopic enrichment suggests that these components have undergone alterations to form authigenic aluminosilicates.",

            "abstract": "1. Introduction\nThe recent launch of NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission [Entekhabi, et al] has opened the door to improved brightness temperature (TB) calibration of satellite L-band microwave radiometers, through the use of SMAP’s lower noise performance and better immunity to man-made interference (vs. ESA’s Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission [Kerr, et al]), better spatial resolution (vs. NASA’s Aquarius sea surface salinity mission [Le Vine, et al]), and cleaner antenna pattern (vs. SMOS).\nAll three radiometers use/used large homogeneous places on Earth’s surface as calibration targets—parts of the ocean, Antarctica, and tropical forests. Despite the recent loss of Aquarius data, there is still hope for creating a longer-term L-band data set that spans the timeframe of all 3 missions.\n 2. Description of Analyses and Expected Results\n In this paper, we analyze SMAP brightness temperature data to quantify the spatial and temporal characteristics of external target areas in the oceans, Antarctica, forests, and other areas. Existing analyses have examined these targets in terms of averages, standard deviations, and other basic statistics (for Aquarius & SMOS as well). This paper will approach the problem from a signal processing perspective. Coupled with the use of SMAP’s novel RFI-mitigated TBs, and the aforementioned lower noise and cleaner antenna pattern, it is expected that of the 3 L-band missions, SMAP should do the best job of characterizing such external targets. The resulting conclusions should be useful to extract the best possible TB calibration from all 3 missions, helping to inter-compare the TB from the 3 missions, and to eventually inter-calibrate the TBs into a single long-term dataset.",

The transect defines three major crustal and structural provinces: 1) Precambrian-Paleozoic, Chortis continental block whose northern edge is defined by the North America-Caribbean plate boundary. Events in this ~20-25-km-thick province include two major unconformities at the top of the Cretaceous and Eocene, associated southeast-dipping thrust faults related to collision of the Great Arc of the Caribbean (GAC) and Caribbean Large Igneous Province (CLIP) with the Chortis continental block. A third event is Eocene to recent subsidence and transtensional basins formed during the opening of the Cayman trough; 2) Late Cretaceous GAC and CLIP of oceanic arc and plateau origin, whose northern, deformed edge corresponds to the mapped Siuna belt of northern Nicaragua. This crustal province has a ~15-20-km-thick crust and is largely undeformed and extends across the Lower Nicaraguan Rise, Hess fault, to the southern limit of the Colombian basin where about 300 km of this province has been subducted beneath the accretionary wedge of the South Caribbean deformed belt of northwestern South America; and 3) Eocene to recent accretionary prism and intramontane basins on continental crust of northern South America, where Miocene accelerated exhumation and erosion of Paleogene and Cretaceous rocks reflect either shallow subduction of the CLIP or the Panama collisional event to the southwest.",

Yet the reasons behind their rise to such a globally significant component of the terrestrial biosphere within the last 10 million years are not well understood. In eastern Africa, the expansion of C4 grasslands led to long-term changes in faunal distributions and resulted in major dietary shifts in mammalian lineages. Potential mechanisms leading to the rise of C4 plants include a decrease in atmospheric CO2, ecosystem perturbations by fire or large herbivores, and increased aridity or seasonality of precipitation. Improvement of the temporal and spatial coverage of vegetation records in the Late Neogene of East Africa may help elucidate the mechanisms responsible for regional and global C4 grassland expansion. It will also improve our ability to assess the relationship between vegetation change and mammalian evolution.\nTo evaluate the evolution of C4 grasslands in East Africa, we measured carbon isotope ratios of n-alkanes from four DSDP cores stretching from the Red Sea (19.1° N) to the Somali Basin (2.4° S) that range in age from ~24 Ma to 0.5 Ma. Carbon isotope data from Somali Basin sites 235 and 241 indicate the appearance of C4 vegetation by ca. 10 Ma, followed by a relatively steady increase through the late Pleistocene. Odd numbered n-alkane homologues (C29 ­to C35) exhibit up to a 10‰ increase in δ13C. We also established end member molecular distributions of n‑alkanes and tracked changes in their proportional contributions through time. Changes in molecular distribution are broadly synchronous with increases in carbon isotope ratios, suggesting that n-alkane distributions reflect changes in C3 and C4 vegetation types.",

We used HAZUS-MH analysis to assess losses from earthquake, flood and other potential hazards such as landslide and tsunami in the project areas; on shorelines of the Pacific Ocean and Puget Sound of Washington Grays Harbor, Pacific, Skagit, Whatcom, Island, Mason, Clallam, Jefferson and San Juan counties. The FEMA’s Hazus-MH tool was applied to estimate losses and damages for each building due to floods and earthquakes. User-defined facilities (UDF) inventory data were prepared and used for individual building damage estimations and updating general building stocks. Flood depth grids were used to determine which properties are most impacted by flooding. For example, the HAZUS-MH (flood model) run based on the 1% annual chance event (or 100 year flood) for Grays Harbor County, resulted in a total of $161 million in losses to buildings including residential, commercial properties, and other building and occupancy types. A likely M9 megathrust Cascadia earthquake scenario USGS-ShakeMap was used for the HAZUS-MH earthquake model.

We produced GIS-based overlay maps of properties exposed to tsunami, landslide, and liquefaction hazards within the communities. This multi-hazard approach is an essential component to produce non-regulatory maps for FEMA’s RiskMAP project, and they help further improve local and regional mitigation efforts and emergency response plans, and overall resiliency plan of the communities in and around the coastal communities in western Washington.",

            "abstract": "The Quaternary topaz rhyolite lava domes of the bimodal, basalt-dominated Blackfoot volcanic field (BVF), SE Idaho occur in three clusters. We refer to these as the China Hat lava dome field (southernmost; ~ 57 ka), and the 1.4 to 1.5 Ma Sheep Island and White Mountain (northernmost) lava dome fields. The rhyolites and surrounding, more voluminous basalt lavas closely resemble coeval Quaternary rocks erupted to the north along the Eastern Snake River Plain segment of the Yellowstone-Snake River Plain volcanic track. However rhyolites in BVF are distinguished by having more evolved Sr- and Nd-isotopic ratios, as well as having phenocryst assemblages that includes hydrous phases (biotite and hornblende), thorite, and vapor-phase topaz. This study seeks to improve our understanding of the unique conditions of magma evolution that led to these differences. We focus on textural features of major and accessory phenocrysts as a basis for inferring paragenesis for rhyolites from the China Hat lava dome field. Preliminary work indicates that there are three sequentially formed populations of textures among magmatic phases: 1. population of anhedral quartz and plagioclase; 2. population of euhedral grains that includes quartz, sandine, plagioclase, biotite, hornblende, Fe-Ti oxides, zircon and apatite; 3. boxy cellular (skeletal?) sanidine and quartz. We speculate that the first population are resorbed antecrysts, the second formed prior to eruption as autocrysts (at or near equilibrium?), and the third formed soon before or during eruption.",

This area was a research foci in the 1990's when the soils, u-series soil carbonate dating, and subsurface structure of deformed strata identified from oil wells were used to create a kinematic model of deformation, and estimates of fault slip, uplift, and lateral propagation rates. A recent collection of light detection and ranging (lidar) topographic data and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) data allow us to complete meter scale topographic analyses of the fluvial networks and hillslopes and correlate geomorphic response to tectonics. We interpret these results using a detailed morphological map and observe drainage network and hillslope process transitions both along and across the fold axis. With lidar topography, we extract common morphometrics (e.g., channel steepness-- ksn, eroded volume, hillslope relief) to illustrate how the landscape is responding to variations in uplift rate along the fold axis and show asymmetry of surface response on the forelimb and backlimb. The forelimb is dominated by large drainages with landslides initiating in the marine units at the core of the fold. Our topographic analysis shows that the stream channel indices values on the forelimb increase along the fold axis, away from the propagation tip. The backlimb drainages are dominantly long and linear with broad ridgelines. Using lidar and fieldwork, we see that uplifted backlimb surfaces preserve the deformed fan surface. The preliminary OSL results from alluvial fan units improve age control of previously defined surfaces, refining our understanding of the deposition and uplift of alluvial fan units on preserved on backlimb.",

            "abstract": "The Iron Wash fault (IWF) is an approximately 30 mile-long, NW-SE trending structure, oriented perpendicular to the San Rafael Monocline near Green River in Utah. IWF exhibits well-expressed geomorphic features such as a linear escarpment with consistently north side down displacement. The fault coincides with an abrupt change in San Rafael Monocline dip angle along its eastern margin. The IWF is exposed in incised drainages where Jurassic Navajo sandstone (oldest) and Lower Carmel Formation (old), are juxtaposed against Jurassic Entrada sandstone (younger) and Quaternary alluvium (youngest). To assess the recency of activity of the IWF we performed detailed geomorphic mapping and a paleoseismic trenching investigation. A benched trench was excavated across a Quaternary fluvial terrace remnant across the mapped trace of the IWF. The uppermost gravel units and overlying colluvium are exposed in the trench across the projection of the fault. In addition, we mapped the basal contact of the Quaternary gravel deposit in relation to the adjacent fault exposures in detail to show the geometry of the basal contact near and across the fault. We find no evidence of vertical displacement of these Quaternary gravels. A preliminary U-series date of calcite cementing unfaulted fluvial gravels and OSL dating of a sand lens within the unfaulted fluvial gravels yielded approximately 304,000 years and 78,000 years, respectively. These preliminary results of independent dating methods constrains the timing of last activity of the IWF to greater than 78,000 years before present suggesting that IWF not an active structure. Its distinct geomorphic expression is most likely the result of differential erosion, forming a fault-line scarp.",

We sought to unify these two lines of research to provide regional scale landslide hazard information for risk assessments and resource management decision-making. Our approach couples an empirical inherent landslide probability, based on a frequency ratio analysis, with a numerical dynamic probability, generated by combining subsurface water recharge and surface runoff from the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) macro-scale land surface hydrologic model with a finer resolution probabilistic slope stability model. Landslide hazard mapping is advanced by combining static and dynamic models of stability into a probabilistic measure of geohazard prediction in both space and time. This work will aid resource management decision-making in current and future landscape and climatic conditions.

            "abstract": "We have obtained improved 87Rb-87Sr isochrons for the Duluth Gabbro, an analog for lunar KREEP rocks, using a prototype spaceflight laser ablation resonance ionization mass spectrometer (LARIMS). The near-side of the Moon comprises previously un-sampled, KREEP rich, young-lunar basalts critical for calibrating the <3.5 Ga history of the Moon, and hence the solar system, since 3.5 Ga. Measurement of the Duluth Gabbro is a proof of concept of lunar in-situ dating to constrain lunar history. Using a novel normalization approach, and by correcting for matrix-dependent isotope effects, we have been able to obtain a date of 1100 ± 200 Ma (Figure 1), compared to the previously established thermal ionization mass spectrometry measurement of 1096 ± 14 Ma. The precision of LARIMS is sufficient to constrain the current 1 Ga uncertainty of the lunar flux curve, allowing us to reassess the timing of peak lunar volcanism, and constrain lunar thermal evolution. Furthermore, an updated lunar flux curve has implications throughout the solar system. For example, Mars could have undergone a longer epoch of voluminous, shield-forming volcanism and associated mantle evolution, as well as a longer era of abundant volatiles and hence potential habitability. These alternative chronologies could even affect our understanding of the evolution of life on Earth: under the classic chronology, life is thought to have originated after the dwindling of bombardment, but under the alternative chronology, it might have appeared during heavy bombardment. In order to resolve the science questions regarding the history of the Moon, and in light of the Duluth Gabbro results, we recently proposed a Discovery mission called MARE: The Moon Age and Regolith Explorer. MARE would accomplish these goals by landing on a young, nearside lunar basalt flow southwest of Aristarchus that has a crater density corresponding to a highly uncertain absolute age, collecting >10 rock samples, and assessing their radioisotopic age, geochemistry, and mineralogy.",

In order to observe volcanic phenomena near craters according to the circumstance, monitoring system with unmanned robots are useful. We have been trying to develop a practical UGV-type robot, and have completed a prototype, which we named \"Homura\". Homura is a small-sized, vehicle-type robot with six wheels (750 x 430 x 310 mm in dimensions and a weight of about 12 kg). Homura is remotely controlled with mobile phone radio waves; it can move in volcanic fields and send real time data of sensors equipped in the vehicle to the base station.\nWe carried out a test campaign of Homura from Feb. 19th to Apr. 8th, 2015 at Iwo-yama to examine if Homura can work for a few month in natural volcanic fields. Iwo-yama is one of craters in the Kirishima volcanic field, SW Japan; the area within 1 km from the crater was an off-limit area from Oct. 24th, 2014 to May 5th, 2015 because volcanic seismicity there was active and eruption might occur. On Feb. 19th, we carried and put Homura at the rim of the crater. Unfortunately, mobile phone connectivity was not entirely stable around Iwo-yama. Then, we decided not to move Homura and only to obtain real time data of the sensors (a camera, CO2 gas sensor, and thermometer). After we returned to our office, we operated Homura for one to two hours every day until Apr. 8th. Although the weather was often bad (rain, fog, or cold temperature) during the test campaign, we could completely operate Homura without any trouble. On Apr. 8th, the battery in Homura ran down. After we collected Homura from Iwo-yama and recharged the battery, Homura perfectly worked again. The results of this campaign indicate that Homura stably operates for a long time in volcanic field. Homura is useful as simple monitoring station in volcanic fields where mobile phone connection is available.",

The delivery of the 2014 NCA marked a new way of providing transparency, documenting metadata, and improving user access via the Global Change Information System. Ultimately, these efforts to provide actionable information, data, and tools about climate change impacts and vulnerability will lead to increased resilience of our communities. Of course, implementing new approaches brings new challenges as well as opportunities. Complete transparency is in many ways a change from the established way of publishing science, and requires authors and data providers to document details with a depth and precision that many are unused to. The depth of metadata needed to provide a user with full traceability of the conclusions – i.e., from a published paper to all of its underlying datasets, their observational instruments, resulting model output, related figures – will need to be built over time. The Program’s efforts to build GCIS and connections to other climate data, information, and tools will also assist coordination among Federal agencies, which manage their data resources individually and maintain their own data policies. Continued collaboration will identify paths forward that meet the collective need without constraining agencies' abilities to meet their own needs and those of their stakeholders.",

Some of the MIRACLE network stations include digital all-sky cameras (ASC) with overlapping field-of-views located at the latitude aurora occurs. The ASCs in this network operate at three different wavelengths: 427.8 nm (blue line), 557.7 nm (green line) and 630.0 nm (red line). These wavelengths are selected using narrow band filters. The new ASC systems are based on electron multiplying CCDs (emCCD), which allow higher time and spatial resolutions. The peak auroral emission altitude is determined using two ASC images from a station pair. Different auroral events are used to evaluate the altitude variations of the peak auroral emissions within auroral structures and its evolution in time.",

            "abstract": "Climate change mitigation strategies are greatly directed towards the reduction of CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gases from fossil fuel combustion to limit warming to 2º C in this century. For example, the Clean Power Plan aims to reduce CO2 emissions from the power sector by 32% of 2005 levels by 2030 by increasing power plant efficiency but also by switching from coal-fired power plants to natural gas-fired power plants. It is important to understand the impact of such fuel switching on climate change. While all fossil fuels emit CO2, they also emit other pollutants with varying effects on climate, health and agriculture. First, The emission of CO2 per joule of energy produced varies significantly between coal, oil and natural gas. Second, the complexity that the co-emitted pollutants add to the perturbations in the climate system necessitates the detangling of radiative forcing for each type of fossil fuel. The historical (1850-2011) net radiative forcing of climate as a function of fuel type (coal, oil, natural gas and biofuel) is reconstructed. The results reveal the significant dependence of the CO2 and the non-CO2 forcing on fuel type. The CO2 forcing per joule of energy is largest for coal. Radiative forcing from the co-emitted pollutants (black carbon, methane, nitrogen oxides, organic carbon, sulfate aerosols) changes the global mean CO2 forcing attributed to coal and oil significantly. For natural gas, the CO2-only radiative forcing from gas is increased by about 60% when the co-emitted pollutants are included.",

            "abstract": "The most conspicuous cumulative deformation in subduction zones is the formation of island arc-trench system. A pair of anomalies in topography and free-air gravity, high in the arc and low around the trench, is observed without exceptions all over the world. Since the 1960s, elastic dislocation theory has been widely used to interpret coseismic crustal deformation. For the modeling of longer-term crustal deformation, it is necessary to consider viscoelastic properties of the asthenosphere. By simply applying elastic-viscoelastic dislocation theory to plate subduction, Matsu'ura and Sato (1989, GJI) have shown that some crustal deformation remains after the completion of one earthquake cycle, which means that crustal deformation accumulates with time in a long term due to plate subduction. In fact, by constructing a plate interface model in and around Japan, Hashimoto, Fukui and Matsu'ura (2004, PAGEOPH) have demonstrated that the computed vertical displacements due to steady plate subduction well explain the observed free-air gravity anomaly pattern.\nRecently, we got a lucid explanation of crustal deformation due to plate subduction. In subduction zones, oceanic plates bend and descend into the mantle. Because the bending of oceanic plates is usually not spontaneous, there exists kinematic interaction between the oceanic and overriding plates, which causes cumulative deformation of the overriding plate. This may be understood based on the law of action and reaction: one is bending of an oceanic plate and the other is deformation of the overriding plate.\nAs a special case, it is useful to consider plate subduction along a part of true circle. In this case, crustal deformation due to steady subduction is solely caused by the effect of gravity, because dislocation along a circle does not cause any intrinsic internal deformation. When an oceanic plate is descending along an arcuate plate interface from the right-hand side, according to dislocation theory, the oceanic plate rotates anti-clockwise and the overriding plate rotates clockwise. The gravity, however, requires both plates at a distance from the trench to remain in the original gravitational equilibrium, which results in upward bending of both plates. As subduction proceeds, the deformation of the upward bending accumulates with time.",

Dow Foundation to reform K-12 science education to present science as an integrated body of knowledge that is applied to address societal issues. To achieve this goal, Mi-STAR is developing an integrated science curriculum for the middle grades that will be aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). Similar to the geosciences, the curriculum requires the integration of science, engineering and math content to explore 21st-century issues and demonstrates how these concepts can be used in service of society. The curriculum is based on the Mi-STAR Unit Specification Chart which pairs interdisciplinary themes with bundled NGSS Performance Expectations. Each unit is developed by a collaborative team of K-12 teachers, university STEM content experts and science education experts. Prior to developing a unit, each member on the team attends the on-line Mi-STAR Academy, completing 18+ hours of professional development (PD). This on-line PD program familiarizes teachers and experts with necessary pedagogical and content background knowledge, including NGSS and three-dimensional learning. With this background, teams use a staged, backwards design process to craft a multi-week unit based on a series of performance based tasks, or ‘challenges’ that engage students in actively doing science and engineering. Each unit includes Disciplinary Core Ideas from multiple disciplines, which focus on local and familiar examples that demonstrate the relevance of science in student's lives. Performance-based assessments are interwoven throughout the unit. Mi-STAR units will go through extensive pilot testing in several school districts across the state of Michigan. Additionally, the Mi-STAR program will develop teacher professional development programs to support implementation of the curriculum and design a pre-service teacher program in integrated science. We will share preliminary results on the collaborative Mi-STAR process of designing integrated science curriculum to address NGSS.",

Launch of an international initiative, Climate and Clean Air Coalition (CCAC), is an example of efforts to ease the difficulties by reducing Short-Lived Climate Pollutants (SLCPs), i.e., black carbon aerosol, methane and other short-lived atmospheric materials that heat the earth's system, along with long-lived greenhouse gas mitigation. Impact evaluation of the air pollutants, however, has large uncertainties.\nWe like to introduce a recent effort of projects MEXT/SALSA and MOEJ/S-12 to develop a seamless transport model for atmospheric constituents, NICAM-Chem, that is flexible enough to cover global scale to regional scale by the NICAM nonhydrostatic dynamic core (NICAM), coupled with SPRINTARS aerosol model, CHASER atmospheric chemistry model and with their three computational grid systems, i.e. quasi homogeneous grids, stretched grids and diamond grids. A local ensemble transform Kalman filter/smoother with this modeling system was successfully applied to data from MODIS, AERONET, and CALIPSO for global assimilation/inversion and surface SPM and SO2 air pollution monitoring networks for Japanese area assimilation.\nMy talk will be extended to discuss an effective utility of satellite remote sensing of aerosols using Cloud and Aerosol Imager (CAI) on board the GOSAT satellite and Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) on board the new third generation geostationary satellite, Himawari-8. The CAI has a near-ultraviolet channel of 380nm with 500m spatial resolution and the AHI has high frequency measurement capability of every 10 minutes. These functions are very effective for accurate land aerosol remote sensing, so that a combination with the developed aerosol assimilation system is promising.",

It is primarily a function of hydrology and climate, but influenced by landcover and the underlying soils. These additional factors make it much more difficult to accurately model than water flow alone. It is not intuitive what impact different hydrologic modeling schemes may have on the prediction of sediment yield. Here, two implementations of the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (MUSLE) are compared to examine the effects of hydrologic model choice. Both the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and the Landscape Hydrology Model (LHM) utilize the MUSLE for calculating sediment yield. SWAT is a lumped parameter hydrologic model developed by the USDA, which is commonly used for predicting sediment yield. LHM is a fully distributed hydrologic model developed primarily for integrated surface and groundwater studies at the watershed to regional scale.\nSWAT and LHM models were developed and tested for two large, adjacent watersheds in the Great Lakes region; the Maumee River and the St. Joseph River. The models were run using a variety of single model and ensemble downscaled climate change scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5).

To better characterize N2O dynamics in the Chesapeake Bay, we measured ammonia oxidation and N2O production rates in August and September 2013 in the mesohaline region of the Chesapeake Bay during low oxygen conditions. Surface N2O saturation values ranged from 95 to 231%, with the northernmost transect being a sink for atmospheric N2O. Ammonium oxidation rates were greatest at the interface between ammonium-rich bottom water and oxygenated surface water, ranging between 15 and 133 nM h-1. N2O profiles suggest a source of N2O at the pycnocline and N2O consumption below the pycnocline. An engineering ‘control volume’ budget was used to estimate N2O production and consumption along a 21 km region in the Chesapeake Bay. Advective and diffusive processes were separated from internal N2O production and consumption processes, yielding estimates of atmospheric N2O flux between -0.05 to 0.06 nM h-1; these values agree with estimates of N2O production from nitrification rate measurements and reasonably explain N2O concentration profiles. Despite the high rates of ammonia oxidation measured during the study period, abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea as determined by quantification of the amoA gene was very low. Our study shows that N2O emissions from the Chesapeake Bay are variable over multiple time and spatial scales and that the Bay can act as both a source and a sink for N2O during stratified summer conditions.",

Forecasted Cumulative Distribution Functions (CDFs) of monthly precipitation are plotted by combining the range of monthly precipitation based on proper Probability Density Function (PDF) in past data with probabilistic forecasts in each category. Ensembles of inflow are estimated by entering generated ensembles of precipitation based on the CDFs into the ‘abcd’ water budget model. The bias and RMSE between averages in past data and observed inflow are compared to them in forecasted ensembles. In our results, the bias and RMSE of average precipitation in the forecasted ensemble are bigger than in past data, whereas the average inflow in the forecasted ensemble is smaller than in past data. This result could be used for reference data to apply long-term forecasts to water management, because of the limit in the number of forecasted data for verification and differences between the Andong-dam basin and the forecasted regions.\nThis research has significance by suggesting a method of applying probabilistic information in climate variables from long-term forecasts to water management in Korea. Original data of a climate model, which produces long-term probabilistic forecasts should be verified directly as input data of a water budget model in the future, so that a more scientific response in water management against uncertainty of climate change could be reached.",

The fate of nutrients in streams is typically described by the dynamic coupling of physical processes and biochemical processes. However, isolating each of these processes and determining its contribution to the whole system is challenging due to the complexity of the physical, chemical and biological domains. We conducted column experiments seeking to understand nutrient processing in shallow sediment-water interactions along representative sites of the Jemez River-Rio Grande continuum (eight stream orders), in New Mexico (USA). For each stream order, we used a set of 6 columns packed with 3 different sediments, i.e., Silica Cone Density Sand ASTM D 1556 (0.075-2.00 mm), gravel (> 2mm) and native sediments from each site. We incubated the sediments for three months and performed tracer experiments in the laboratory under identical flow conditions, seeking to normalize the physical processes along the river continuum. We added a short-term pulse injection of NO3, resazurin and NaCl to each column and determined metabolism and NO3 processing using the Tracer Additions for Spiraling Curve Characterization method (TASCC). Our methods allowed us to study how changes in bacterial communities and sediment composition along the river continuum define nutrient processing.",

            "abstract": "Drylands are very sensitive to climatic or anthropogenic pressures and prone to critical degradation thresholds which make rehabilitation efforts considerably difficult. In these systems, the spatial structure of vegetation and the spatial redistribution of overland flow are tightly linked through feedbacks mechanisms. Disturbances, induced by human activities or climate change, can disrupt the spatial distribution of vegetation triggering erosion and substantial water losses by increasing landscape hydrological connectivity and damaging ecosystem function. Characterizing the integrity of these coevolving patterns is especially relevant for the detection of landscape degradation processes and possible threshold behaviour. Here we investigate the impact of degradation processes, induced by grazing pressure, across the Mulga Lands Bioregion in Australia. We combine remote sensing observations and a modelling approach to analyse changes in ecosystem connectivity and the existence of threshold behaviour along a precipitation gradient (250mm to 450mm annual average rainfall). Vegetation patterns are derived from high resolution remote sensing images, and Rainfall Use Efficiency (RUE) estimated from precipitation data and MODIS vegetation indices for a total of 40 plots along this gradient. A critical degradation threshold, associated to loss of vegetation cover appears for sites with lower mean annual precipitation. In these sites, hillslopes with high vegetation cover display low hydrologic connectivity and high RUE, and can be therefore classified as “functional”. However, below a threshold vegetation cover we found highly “dysfunctional hillslopes” characterized by high connectivity and very low RUE. We found that this threshold behaviour tends to disappear for the north-western sites with higher mean annual rainfall. We further analytically investigate the dynamic response of these hillslopes using a coupled landform evolution-vegetation model to simulate coevolving vegetation patterns and geomorphology. We use the model to analyse changes in hydrologic and sediment connectivity responsible for triggering this threshold behaviour for selected plots along this precipitation gradient. The implications for ecosystem resilience and land management strategies are discussed.",

            "abstract": "Surface temperature and emissivity provide important insight into the ecosystem being remotely sensed. Dozier (1981) proposed a an algorithm to solve for percent coverage and temperatures of two different surface types (e.g. sea surface, cloud cover, etc.) within a given pixel, with a constant value for emissivity assumed. Here we build on Dozier (1981) by proposing an algorithm that solves for both temperature and emissivity of a water body within a satellite pixel by assuming known percent coverage of surface types within the pixel. Our algorithm generates thermal infrared (TIR) and emissivity end-member spectra for the two surface types. Our algorithm then superposes these end-member spectra on emissivity and TIR spectra emitted from four pixels with varying percent coverage of different surface types. The algorithm was tested preliminarily (48 iterations) using simulated pixels containing more than one surface type, with temperature and emissivity percent errors of ranging from 0 to 1.071% and 2.516 to 15.311% respectively\n[1]\n. We then tested the algorithm using a MASTER image from MASTER collected as part of the NASA Student Airborne Research Program (NASA SARP). Here the temperature of water was calculated to be within 0.22 K of in situ data. The algorithm calculated emissivity of water with an accuracy of 0.13 to 1.53% error for Salton Sea pixels collected with MASTER, also collected as part of NASA SARP. This method could improve retrievals for the HyspIRI sensor.\n\n[1] Percent error for emissivity was generated by averaging percent error across all selected bands widths.",

            "abstract": "The increased frequency and severity of drought conditions in the Amazon Basin region have emphasized the question of rainforest vulnerability and resilience to heat and drought-induced stresses. However, what emerges from much research is that the impacts of droughts, essential controlling factors of the rainforest function, and variability of tree-scale strategies are yet to be fully understood. We present here a preliminary analysis of hydraulic relations of a seasonal Amazon rainforest using a set of ecohydrologic data collected through the GoAmazon project over dry and wet seasons. Expressions of different hydraulic strategies are identified that convey different implications for tree resilience during short- (diurnal) and longer-term (seasonal) stress periods. These hydraulic strategies appear to be inter-related with the tree growth and non-structural carbohydrate dynamics, contributing to the understanding of trait coordination at the whole-plant scale. Integration of individual responses is conducted over a range of wood density and exposure conditions. The results of this research thus shed light on the implication of variations in the rainforest function for future stresses, vital for predictive models of ecosystem dynamics of next generation.",

            "abstract": "The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover is currently investigating the lower stratigraphy of northwestern Mt. Sharp, the 5 km thick stack of layered rock that makes up the central mound of Gale Crater. Previous near-infrared spectral investigations from orbit using CRISM have shown that this portion of the mound exhibits a diverse mineralogy that may indicate changing aqueous environments on early Mars. The relationship of these mineralogic units to stratigraphic units across the full extent of Mt. Sharp is not well understood, although such relationships are key to interpreting the depositional and digenetic history. Here we present new mineral maps derived from CRISM data, as well as detailed stratigraphic columns from around the mound, and we use these new results to constrain hypotheses for the modes of aqueous alteration.\nOur new CRISM mineral maps are projected and co-registered to HiRISE imagery and DEMs, and include Fe/Mg-smectites, poly- and mono-hydrated sulfates, iron oxides, high-Ca pyroxene, and a ferrous phase with a strong red spectral slope between 1.1-1.8 μm, which is consistent with ferrous alteration phases like ferrous clays. This latter unit consistently overlies Fe/Mg-smectites in NW and SW Mt. Sharp, and is located in topographic benches that are either immediately stratigaphically above hematite-bearing ridges. The presence of ferrous alteration phases supports previous interpretations that hematite formed when an Fe2+-bearing fluid encountered an oxidizing environment. In this scenario, the reducing fluids were created by long-term oxygen limited alteration of Fe-bearing minerals in the near-surface. Downward movement of these fluids may have been limited by the underlying clay layer, forcing lateral flow. On emergence at the surface, the iron was oxidized by photochemical or other redox reactions. On Earth, similar pedogenic processes form hematite ironpans on slopes surrounding poorly-drained hilltops, as well as ancient banded iron formations in shallow coastal waters. The reducing environment inferred from the ferrous phases could be a site of high organic preservation potential, and the redox gradient inferred from the ferric/ferrous mineral relationship could have served as an energy source for chemolithotrophic microbes.",

NOAA Air Resources Laboratory has participated in all these campaigns in the role of air quality forecasting support. For some of these campaigns post analyses were performed with the possible help of after-the-fact observed data from satellite retrieved radiances to constrain emissions through the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) developed at the Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation. It is our experience that despite the vastly different chemical regime, season, terrain, and meteorological conditions of the domain for the campaigns, we found that the emissions input and the U.S. EPA Community Air Quality model (CMAQ), the forecasting chemical transport model used to generate the forecast had severely under-estimated formaldehyde (HCHO), and carbon monoxide (CO) aloft between surface and the middle of the free troposphere – 500 hPa. Post analyses point to two strong suspects of these deficiencies: (a) emission projection fed into CMAQ, and/or (b) erroneously fast removal of the species. We investigate both of these potential deficiencies and for the former possible reason we looked into data assimilation and possible inverse modeling to adjust emission projection for CMAQ. We will elaborate more on the CRTM which plays a critical role in this aspect of remedying erroneous inputs to CMAQ.\nIn addition, we will utilize some satellite products to improve initial fields of aerosols and CO for air quality forecasting. Suomi NPP VIIRS aerosol optical depth (AOD) environmental data record (EDR) delivers global aerosol information daily. The Unique CrIS/ATMS Processing System (NUCAPS) operationally generates vertical profiles of atmospheric carbonate EDRs (CO, CO2, and CH4) and ozone during day and night. The AOD can be assimilated by using the CRTM. The carbonate EDRs and ozone EDR can be directly assimilated.",

According to the anomalous amplitudes of the surface air temperature (SAT), there are two typical types of ETEs, e.g. cold waves (CWs) and warm waves (WWs). This study used cluster analysis to categorize both CWs and WWs into four distinct regimes respectively and investigated their associated large-scale circulations on intra-seasonal time scale.\nMost of the CW regimes have large areal impact over the continental US. However, the distribution of cold SAT anomalies varies apparently in four regimes. In the sea level, the four CW regimes are characterized by anomalous high pressure over North America (near and to west of cold anomaly) with different extension and orientation. As a result, anomalous northerlies along east flank of anomalous high pressure convey cold air into the continental US. To the middle troposphere, the leading two groups feature large-scale and zonally-elongated circulation anomaly pattern, while the other two regimes exhibit synoptic wavetrain pattern with meridionally elongated features. As for the WW regimes, there are some patterns symmetry and anti-symmetry with respect to CW regimes. The WW regimes are characterized by anomalous low pressure and southerlies wind over North America. The first and fourth groups are affected by remote forcing emanating from North Pacific, while the others appear mainly locally forced.",

Interestingly, these “new” alloys are now receiving huge attention, primarily because of their catalytic capacity to accelerate bond rupture and formation processes in small organic molecules relevant to the origin of life, but also because they are viewed as nature’s stockpile of alloy surfaces that would assist in the hydrogenation of greenhouse gases (reductive sequestration).\nTwo forms of ‘Ni-Fe’ metal alloys have been examined in detail here, namely awaruite (Ni81Fe19) and tetrataenite (Ni50Fe50); however, intermediate, i.e. solid solutions do exist along the Fe-Ni binary, so that a large group of Ni-Fe alloy phases would probably form during serpentinization-type processes. In this study, the atomic structure of Ni-Fe alloy will be investigated containing 75 nickel atoms and 25 iron atoms (Ni75Fe25), a composition closely related to awaruite. We will also present results in which we have examined the occurrence of so-called magic number awaruite clusters at the positions n=13,55,147, all of which exhibit a high stability relative to their atom number precursors and successors. Awaruite clusters with n=13,55,147 stand out in terms of the total atom binding energy and maintain highly organized structures; in the case of n=13 the cluster is comprised of central metal atoms sandwiched between two pentameric ring moieties. These clusters may react with molecular hydrogen in preparation for various hydrogenation reactions that ultimately give rise to small but important molecules such as ammonia, methane, ethane etc. Here we will present results of a series of molecular simulations that we examine specific sites on the “awaruite” cluster surface and the affinity of H2 to attach and dissociate on various surface sites of awaruite clusters. These simulations build on a basin-hopping algorithm and density functional calculations, in which stable structures of, i.e. Fen·H, Nin·H, Fe13-n-Nin·H and related clusters are predicted. A detailed discussion of these results, particularly their relevance for hydrogenation processes on early Earth and its impact on Earth’s inventory of prebiotic molecules will be presented.",

This approach presents a new and challenging aspect to the calibration and operation of these instruments on ground and in flight. The response uniformity, the reliability of their calibration and the approach to handling any temporal evolution of these calibrated characteristics all assume enhanced importance in this application, where we attempt to understand the meaning of particle distributions within the ion and electron diffusion regions of magnetically reconnecting plasmas.\nWe have developed a detailed model of the spectrometer detection system, its behavior and its signal, crosstalk and noise sources. Based on this, we have devised a new calibration method that enables accurate and repeatable measurement of micro-channel plate (MCP) gain, signal loss due to variation in MCP gain and crosstalk effects in one single measurement. The foundational concepts of this new calibration method, named threshold scan, are presented. It is shown how this method has been successfully applied both on ground and in-flight to achieve highly accurate and precise calibration of all 64 spectrometers. Calibration parameters that will evolve in flight are determined daily providing a robust characterization of sensor suite performance, as a basis for both in-situ hardware adjustment and data processing to scientific units, throughout mission lifetime. This is shown to be very desirable as the instruments will produce higher quality raw science data that will require smaller post-acquisition data‑corrections using results from in-flight derived pitch angle distribution measurements and ground calibration measurements. The practical application of the method is presented together with the achieved calibration results from both ground and in-flight calibration. Finally, we will present the residual post-processing correction performed from in-flight derived pitch angle distribution measurements of the science data acquired with the calibrated spectrometers.",

Since O3 production ceases at nighttime, a plausible reasoning for observed bimodal pattern of O3 with enhanced NSO concentration during nighttime (2300-0500 local time) is hypothesized to be related with different atmospheric transport processes. Simultaneous measurements of O3 at 32 spatially distributed sites in Portugal suggest that horizontal advection alone cannot explain the enhancement of NSO. Thus, detailed analysis of the atmospheric conditions with the regional Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model were performed. Results revealed that each of the five NSO enhancement events occurred over the same geographical location under entirely different atmospheric conditions. The first event happened due to the presence of a synoptic scale circulation and downward vertical motion from the free troposphere over Portugal. The second event was a result of a combination of vertical and horizontal transport over a large area. The third event showed that under favorable conditions the high NSO events can last for several days. The fourth event showed that the NSO enhancement can drastically exceed the daytime O3 concentrations over a large area. Finally, the fifth event showed that the enhancement of NSO occurred due to low level jet formation from southwest corner to northeast corner, passing through the mainland of Portugal at around 1.5 km height, associated with the vertical mixing below the jet stream. This study revealed that any single physical phenomenon is not sufficient to explain the NSO enhancement at a given location and large-scale flow patterns with downward vertical motion plays a key role in the enhancement of NSO.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGUPOSTER2015.pdf\nThe equilibrium Fe and Cu isotope fractionation factor between chalcopyrite and dissolved metal species was determined under hydrothermal conditions at 350°C and 500 bars. The experiments took advantage of gold-cell reaction technology, allowing time-series sampling of solution during the hydrothermal recrystallization of chalcopyrite over 3000 hours. One of the recrystallization experiments utilized an anomalous 57Fe spike in solution to quantify the degree and rate of isotopic exchange towards equilibrium between mineral and fluid reservoirs. The time-series 57Fe spike data suggests that chalcopyrite exchanges rapidly with dissolved Fe and Cu in solution and the isotopic fractionation between each metal-bearing reservoir throughout reaction progress, upon dissolution and recrystallization, represents close to equilibrium conditions. The isotope data indicate that the equilibrium fractionation between chalcopyrite and dissolved Fe and Cu at 350°C, Δ56FeCpy-Fe(aq), is 0.129±0.171‰ and Δ65CuCpy-Fe(aq), is -0.201±0.341‰ (2σ), and are in good agreement with recent theoretical equilibrium predictions. Comparison of the experimental data from this study with conjugate chalcopyrite and dissolved Fe and Cu pairs from a variety of hydrothermal systems along the mid-ocean ridge system indicates that chalcopyrite precipitates and recrystallizes at isotopic equilibrium with the fluid during cooling upon ascent to the seafloor. The rapid exchange between the mineral and fluid metal-reservoirs suggests that chalcopyrite effectively records the isotopic composition of the coexisting hydrothermal fluid during the evolution of hydrothermal systems. In addition, the pyrite-chalcopyrite equilibrium Fe isotope fractionation, Δ56FePyr-Cpy, at 350°C is quantified by combination of pyrite-Fe2+(aq) equilibrium fractionation data from Syverson et al., [2013] with chalcopyrite-Fe2+(aq) from this study, resulting in a fractionation of 0.861±0.337‰ (2σ). The empirical sulfide mineral-mineral fractionation determined empirically is consistent with mineral-mineral theoretical predictions and can be coupled with mineral-fluid isotope fractionation systematics to differentiate between different ore depositional processes, of which, chalcopyrite is intimately is involved.",

            "abstract": "The Indianapolis Flux Experiment (INFLUX) aims to utilize a variety of measurements and a high resolution inversion system to estimate the spatial distribution and the temporal variation of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the city of Indianapolis. We separated biogenic and fossil fuel CO2 fluxes and tested the sensitivity of inverse flux estimates to inverse system configurations by performing Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs). The a priori CO2 emissions from Hestia were aggregated to 1 km resolution to represent emissions from the Indianapolis metropolitan area and its surroundings. With the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled to a Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Model (LPDM), the physical relations between concentrations at the tower locations and emissions at the surface were simulated at 1 km spatial resolution, hourly. Within a Bayesian synthesis inversion framework, we tested the effect of multiple parameters on our ability to infer fossil fuel CO2 fluxes: the presence of biogenic CO2 fluxes in the optimization procedure, the use of fossil fuel CO2 concentration measurements, the impact of reduced transport errors, the sensitivity to observation density, and the spatio-temporal properties of prior errors. The results indicate that the presence of biogenic CO2 fluxes obviously weakens the ability to invert for the fossil fuel CO2 emissions in an urban environment, but having relatively accurate fossil fuel CO2 concentration measurements can effectively compensate the interference from the biogenic flux component. Reduced transport error and more intensive measurement networks are two possible approaches to retrieve the spatial pattern of the fluxes and decrease the bias in inferred whole-city fossil fuel CO2 emissions. The accuracy of posterior fluxes is very sensitive to the spatial correlation length in the prior flux errors which, if they exist, can enhance significantly our ability to recover the known fluxes and reduce the posterior uncertainties.",

This is hard(!), and students often have difficulty when learning and visualizing the three dimensional and temporal concepts. Visible Geology is an online geologic block modelling tool that is targeted at students in introductory and structural geology. With Visible Geology, students are able to combine geologic events in any order to create their own geologic models and ask ‘what-if’ questions, as well as interrogate their models using cross sections, boreholes and depth slices. Instructors use it as a simulation and communication tool in demonstrations, and students use it to explore concepts of relative geologic time, structural relationships, as well as visualize abstract geologic representations such as stereonets. The level of interactivity and creativity inherent in Visible Geology often results in a sense of ownership and encourages engagement, leading learners to practice visualization and interpretation skills and discover geologic relationships.\nThrough its development over the last five years, Visible Geology has been used by over 300K students worldwide as well as in multiple targeted studies at the University of Calgary and at the University of British Columbia. The ease of use of the software has made this tool practical for deployment in classrooms of any size as well as for individual use. In this presentation, I will discuss the thoughts behind the implementation and layout of the tool, including a framework used for the development and design of new educational simulations. I will also share some of the surprising and unexpected observations on student interaction with the 3D visualizations, and other insights that are enabled by web-based development and deployment.",

To take this medium a step further, we use illustrations in the form of comics as a way to teach Earth science concepts. The comic book format lends itself to engaging reading for young and old alike and has been used recently by the American Physical Society (APS) and by NASA as an outreach teaching tool. Due to their sequential nature, comic books make it easy for readers to follow a story and grasp concepts that are covered. The limited text in each panel can also help those where reading is a challenge or for those who become nervous and/or discouraged with long text passages. The illustrations also add visual clues that can aid in understanding the concepts being laid out.\nIn the second installment of “Adventures of Geo,” we use the comic book format to introduce the Moon, its formation, evolution, orbit and its interplay with Earth.

As part of the NASA Airborne Science Research Program (SARP), this study examines the impact of ocean chemistry and climatological variables on KCA in the Santa Barbara Channel through time series analysis. El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO), North Pacific Oscillation (NPO), and upwelling indices as well as sea surface temperature (SST), salinity, nitrate, and chlorophyll-a concentrations taken within the Santa Barbara channel (1990-2014) were acquired from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC), California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation (CalCOFI), and Di Lorenzo's NPGO websites. These data were then averaged for winter (November-January) and summer (May-August) seasons and compared to KCA measurements derived from Landsat images via unsupervised classification. Regression, cumulative sum tests, and cross-correlation coefficients revealed a two year lag between KCA and the NPGO, indicating the presence of an additional factor driving both variables. Further analyses suggests that the NPO may be this driving factor, as indicated by the correlation (lag 0) with KCA. Comparing relationships between kelp and other variables over various time periods supports the acceleration of the NPGO and other variables in more recent years. Exploring relationships between KCA, NPGO, and NPO may provide insight into potential impacts of climate change on coastal marine ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Measurements over extents from submeter to 10s of meters are critical science requirements for the design and integration of remote sensing instruments for coastal zone research. Various coastal ocean phenomena operate at different scales (e.g. meters to kilometers). For example, river plumes and algal blooms have typical extents of 10s of meters and therefore can be resolved with satellite data, however, shallow benthic ecosystem (e.g., coral, seagrass, and kelp) biodiversity and change are best studied at resolutions of submeter to meter, below the pixel size of typical satellite products. The delineation of natural phenomena do not fit nicely into gridded pixels and the coastal zone is complicated by mixed pixels at the land-sea interface with a range of bio-optical signals from terrestrial and water components. In many standard satellite products, these coastal mixed pixels are masked out because they confound algorithms for the ocean color parameter suite. In order to obtain data at the land/sea interface, finer spatial resolution satellite data can be achieved yet spectral resolution is sacrificed. This remote sensing resolution challenge thwarts the advancement of research in the coastal zone. Further, remote sensing of benthic ecosystems and shallow sub-surface phenomena are challenged by the requirements to sense through the sea surface and through a water column with varying light conditions from the open ocean to the water’s edge. For coastal waters, >80% of the remote sensing signal is scattered/absorbed due to the atmospheric constituents, sun glint from the sea surface, and water column components. In addition to in-water measurements from various platforms (e.g., ship, glider, mooring, and divers), low altitude aircraft outfitted with high quality bio-optical radiometer sensors and targeted channels matched with in-water sensors and higher altitude platform sensors for ocean color products, bridge the sea-truth measurements to the pixels acquired from satellite and high altitude platforms. We highlight a novel NASA airborne calibration, validation, and research capability for addressing the coastal remote sensing resolution challenge.",

WADNR sells timber and other agricultural products to help fund local services and the construction of institutions such as public schools and universities. Quality of rocks used as a surface on the roads built to access the timber is the essential and selecting appropriate rock quarry locations is challenging. Traditional borehole drilling methods only provide information from discrete locations. The study was conducted in the Capitol Forest area of western Washington. In our previous study, we suggested that a combination of P-wave seismic and ground penetrating radar (GPR) can be a rapid, comprehensive and cost effective alternative for identifying desired rock sources. In this study, we further improved upon that method and accomplished the following: 1) rock quality at a relatively fine resolution was distinguished and 2) the spatial variability of the rock was identified. Both 450 MHz and 80 MHz GPR antennas were used to obtain high resolution radargrams in the near-surface zone with 5m maximum penetration depth and lower resolution radargrams in the deeper subsurface zone with about 20m maximum penetration depth. We then correlated the GPR radargrams with P-wave velocities using the refraction survey data as well as S-wave velocities, estimated using Multi-Channel Analysis of Surface Waves (MASW) survey data. Additionally, nearby test pits and boreholes (maximum depth = 15 meters) were used to confirm the geophysical measurements. Our study results demonstrate that the combination of GPR, using the two antennas, and seismic surveys provides very useful subsurface information regarding quality and spatial distribution of the rocks beneath the overburden. Subsurface images gathered from these combined geophysical methods do assist quarry operators to rapidly locate the desired rock sources.",

Assessing the impacts of OA and deoxygenation on harvested species is crucial for guiding resource management with the aim of maintaining healthy and sustainable populations. The Dungeness crab, Cancer magister, is an important species ecologically and economically for the US West Coast. Crabs transition through four main stages: zoea, megalopa, juvenile, and adult. Each stage results in a different morphology and behavior, and as a result, is exposed to various environmental parameters, such as pH and dissolved oxygen (DO). The first two stages exhibit diel vertical migration while the final stages are benthic. Our study focused on the megalopae stage and their metabolic response to OA and hypoxia. We exposed wild-caught megalopae to a pH x DO cross, producing treatment waters with combinations of low or high pH and O2, all maintained at 12˚C. Closed-chamber respirometry was used to compare standard metabolic rates in a common garden setting with high pH/high DO conditions. We predict that the megalopae exposed to the low pH/high DO treatment will have a higher metabolic rate than those exposed to the high pH/high DO treatment. This may be a result of homeostatic processes increasing to return the megalopae’s internal pH back to equilibrium. We predict that the high pH/low DO treatment will cause a decrease in metabolism when compared to the high pH/high DO treatment due to the megalopae conserving oxygen in a limiting environment. If results support our hypothesis, they would suggest that OA and hypoxia affects Dungeness crabs in sublethal ways.",

An important step in developing control strategies for the mitigation of ozone is determining the contribution of various emission sources of ozone precursors, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in Bakersfield. During the SARP 2015 campaign, whole air samples were collected over Bakersfield and other Central Valley emission sources - including oil and natural gas sites and agricultural areas - and analyzed by gas chromatography. To estimate the influence of oil and natural gas sources on air in Bakersfield, the ratio of i-pentane to n-pentane was used. Use of this ratio demonstrated mixed urban and oil and natural gas influences in the Bakersfield samples. To better identify and quantify the contributions of oil and natural gas fields as well as other regional emission sources on Bakersfield air quality, positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied to whole air samples taken within the planetary boundary layer in the Central Valley. PMF generated three interpretable factors: an urban source, an oil and natural gas source, and an agricultural/biogenically-influenced source. The contribution of each of the three sources on the mixing ratios of C1-C7 alkanes and isoprene was calculated. Of the non-methane VOCs in Bakersfield, it was determined that 45% originated from the oil and natural gas sites, 34% from the agriculture/biogenically-influenced sources, and 21% from urban areas. Furthermore, it was observed that there was a better agreement between PMF results and propane to ethyne ratios than with i-pentane to n-pentane ratios.",

            "abstract": "Alluvial megafans are ‘large’ fan-shaped bodies of sediment that form from lateral migrations of a river as it exits a topographic front. They differ from large alluvial fans (radial length between 30-100km) with sizes greater than 100-km in radial length. This study characterizes and describes megafans and large alluvial fan through morphometrics. We cataloged the fans into a geodatabase delineating size and extent of basins both upstream and downstream from the apex. Through remote sensing, elevation modeling and geomorphic mapping, we populated the database with fan morphometric measurements, qualitative descriptions and basin parameters. Metrics include planform area, catchment area, gradient, relief index, drainage density, and others. These were compared to longitudinal/transverse profiles, satellite imagery, and geomorphic maps. The database is global, however since the largest megafans of the world are located in South America, this preliminary analysis will focus on the continent. We found morphometric and characteristic differences between large alluvial fans and megafans in the region. These include difference in relationship between morphometrics, for example the ratio between catchment and fan size area. These properties of fans could be a better approach in differentiating megafans from large alluvial fans. The current criteria is an artificial scale divide, which varies in the literature, with the most common being a 100-km apex-to-toe length. Alternative values as little of 30-km apex-to-toe length have been proposed, as well as alternative metrics like coverage areas of greater than 10,000 square-km. We propose that geomorphic characteristics and morphometrics provide an intrinsic approach to differentiating megafans from larger alluvial fans.",

The Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel-2 (HLS) project is a NASA initiative aiming to produce surface reflectance data from Landsat and Sentinel-2 missions and to deliver them to the community in a combined, seamless form. The HLS will be beneficial for global agricultural monitoring applications that require medium spatial resolution and weekly or more frequent observations. In particular, the provided opportunity to track crop phenology at the scale of individual fields will support detailed mapping of crop type and type-specific vegetation conditions.\nTo create a compatible set of radiometric measurements, the HLS product relies on rigorous pre- and post-launch cross-calibration (Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2 MSI) activities. The processing chain includes the following components: atmospheric correction, cloud/shadow masking, nadir BRDF-adjustment, spectral-adjustment, regridding, and temporal composite. The atmospheric correction and cloud masking is based on the OLI atmospheric correction developed at NASA-GSFC and has been adapted to the MSI data. The BRDF-adjustment is based on a disaggregation technique using MODIS-based BRDF coefficients. The technique has been evaluated using the multi-angular acquisition from the SPOT 4 and 5 (Take5) experiments. The spectral-adjustment relies on a linear regression that has been calibrated and evaluated using synthetic data and surface reflectance processed from a large number of hyperspectral EO-1 Hyperion scenes. Finally, significant effort is placed on product validation and evaluation.\nThe delivered data set will include surface reflectance products at different levels:\nUsing the native gridding, i.e. UTM, 30m for Landsat-8, and UTM, 10-20m for Sentinel-2\nUsing a common global gridding (Sinusoidal, 30m)\nTemporal composite (Sinusoidal, 30m, 5-day)\nDuring the first year of operation of Sentinel-2A, the HLS will be prototyped over a selection of 30 sites that includes some of the JECAM sites, Aeronet sites and Cal/Val sites. Then, the HLS spatial coverage will be increased as more Sentinel-2A data become available.",

            "abstract": "Dominated by cold and often acidic water logged environments, mineralization of organic matter is slow in the majority of northern ecosystems. Measures of extractable ammonium and nitrate are generally low and can be undetectable in peat pore waters. Despite this apparent nitrogen limitation, many of these environments produce deep deposits of soil organic matter. Biological nitrogen fixation carried out by autotrophic and heterotrophic diazotrophs associated with cryptograms provides the majority of known nitrogen inputs in these northern ecosystems. Nitrogen fixation was assessed in a variety of northern soils within rhizospheres of dominant plant communities. We investigated the availability of this newly fixed nitrogen to the vascular plant community in nitrogen limited northern plant communities. We tracked nitrogen flow from 15N2 gas fixed in Sphagnum mosses into tissues of two native vascular plant species, boreal cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccus) and black spruce (Picea mariana). 15N-labeled Sphagnum microcosms were grown within variable mesh size exclusion/inclusion fabrics in a nitrogen addition experiment in situ in order to investigate the role of mycorrhizal fungi in the uptake of newly fixed nitrogen.  Up to 24% of daily fixed 15N label was transferred to vascular plant tissues during 2 months. Nitrogen addition resulted in decreased N2 fixation rates; however, with higher nitrogen availability there was a higher rate of 15N label uptake into the vascular plants, likely the result of increased production of dissolved organic nitrogen. Reliance on mycorrhizal networks for nitrogen acquisition was indicated by nitrogen isotope fractionation patterns. Moreover, N2 fixation activities in mosses were stimulated when vascular plants were grown in moss microcosms versus “moss only” treatments. Results indicate that bog vascular plants may derive considerable nitrogen from atmospheric N2 biologically fixed within Sphagnum mosses. This work demonstrates that diazotroph-mediated 15N labeling is a viable technique for tracking nitrogen flow without altering form and concentration of native nitrogen pools in a nitrogen limited ecosystem.",

Vegetation shifts with respect to climate are induced by biased land use patterns in the upper Midwestern United States, but because pollen can be transported long distances, and because the granularity of the pollen signal, obtained from lake sediments and interpolated across the landscape, is often much lower than for forest and land cover data, the apparent influence of climate in structuring vegetation is much stronger for pollen than for vegetation.\nWe examine the impacts of widespread human land use on taxon boundaries in the northeastern United States, both prior to widespread EuroAmerican Settlement and under modern conditions, for both pollen and forest cover and compare these distributions and the forest community ecotones to climate and physiographic features. We show that following EuroAmerican settlement vegetation ecotone sensitivity to both climate and physiography is much weaker than prior to settlement, while for pollen climate remains the dominant driver, but the presence of cosmopolitan “weedy” taxa produces a landscape that is more homogeneous, and again shows weaker sensitivity to climate and physiographic thresholds.\nThe drivers for decreased sentitivity are largely the result of broad-scale homogenization, the overall loss of strong vegetation ecotones in the region. Pollen is less sensitive to this decline because the influence of heavy producers has already resulted in an apparent homogenization of the landscape. This has implications for past land-cover reconstruction and our understanding of the strengths of climate and physiography in structuring vegetation cover over long time scales.",

The probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment that we applied is as follows;\n(1) Characterized earthquake fault models (CEFMs) are constructed on each of the 15 hypothetical source areas (HSA) that ERC(2013) showed. The characterization rule follows Toyama et al.(2015, JpGU). As results, we obtained total of 1441 CEFMs.\n(2) We calculate tsunamis due to CEFMs by solving nonlinear, finite-amplitude, long-wave equations with advection and bottom friction terms by finite-difference method. Run-up computation on land is included.\n(3) A time predictable model predicts the recurrent interval of the present seismic cycle is T=88.2 years (ERC,2013). We fix P30 = 67% by applying the renewal process based on BPT distribution with T and alpha=0.24 as its aperiodicity.\n(4) We divide the probability P30 into P30(i) for i-th subgroup consisting of the earthquakes occurring in each of 15 HSA by following a probability re-distribution concept (ERC,2014). Then each earthquake (CEFM) in i-th subgroup is assigned a probability P30(i)/N where N is the number of CEFMs in each sub-group. Note that such re-distribution concept of the probability is nothing but tentative because the present seismology cannot give deep knowledge enough to do it. Epistemic logic-tree approach may be required in future.\n(5) We synthesize a number of tsunami hazard curves at every evaluation points on coasts by integrating the information about 30 years occurrence probabilities P30(i) for all earthquakes (CEFMs) and calculated maximum coastal tsunami heights. In the synthesis, aleatory uncertainties relating to incompleteness of governing equations, CEFM modeling, bathymetry and topography data, etc, are modeled assuming a log-normal probabilistic distribution.\nExamples of tsunami hazard curves will be presented.",

This study investigates the role of submarine groundwater discharge in delivering increased salt contents to the river and how the subsurface hydrology is affected by the presence of a salt barrier (i.e. saltwater dam) which separates the tidal and non-tidal parts of the Nueces river basin. Thus, a combination of resistivity profiling and elemental and stable isotope geochemistry methods has been applied to portions of the river located downstream (tidal) and upstream (non-tidal) of the dam. Preliminary data show that salinity levels gradually increases at the river bank indicating that groundwater is likely a source of solutes to the river in the upper, non-tidal portion. The presence of vertical upwelling of conductive groundwater plumes is also revealed by marine resistivity profiles collected along the river. Different sampling during the spring and summer of 2014 show higher concentration values of major ions (i.e., calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride, etc.) and salinity of pore water for the upstream river at several locations while it remains relatively constant for bottom- and surface water. In addition, because the groundwater and porewater have slightly lower pH values, a shift to more acidic surface water accompanied by some increases in dissolved major ion concentrations and salinity suggest that groundwater might represent a source of increased salt content in the upper portion of the river. On the other hand, downstream dissolved major ion concentrations generally decrease in pore- and bottom water from spring to summer and are correlated with decreases in salinity while surface water becomes more saline with an increase in major ions. Therefore, these preliminary data indicate different hydrology systems of the two portions of the river, the likely different sources of groundwater discharge and that terrestrial groundwater discharge rather than recirculated water is a source of increased salinity in the upper portion of the river while it may supply freshwater to the lower part.",

Such nonlocal effects are a manifestation of the inherent asymmetry in vertical transport, which is in turn associated with third-order moments (skewness and fluxes of fluxes). In this work, we examine the role of the turbulent transport term in the sensible heat flux budget within the convective boundary layer, with the principal aim of reconciling the aforementioned models to various closure assumptions of this term. In particular, by connecting turbulent heat transport and the ejection-sweep events in the flow field, we establish a generic framework upon which such closure models can be derived. These ejections and sweeps are tied to third-order moments (asymmetry) in the Gram-Charlier cumulant expansion of the joint probability distribution of vertical velocity and potential temperature. The heat flux budget is solved under several assumptions on closure timescales, skewness profiles, and relations between the mixed third-order moments to recover the necessary conditions for adequate vertical profile of the heat flux. The surface layer scaling laws and their contribution to turbulence fluxes is also included and discussed.",

At pressures below the bulk modulus of the sample, the correction for the thermal pressure is relatively small and therefore the uncertainties in the thermal model are not significant. However, as stresses in diamond anvil cells are achieving pressures of 4-10 Mbar, reducing Hugoniot data to an isotherm requires a tremendous thermal pressure correction and uncertainties in the reduced isotherm are unconstrained. Here we present ramp-wave compression experiments at the Sandia Z-Machine that we use to constrain the equation of state of copper to a stress state of nearly 5 Mbar. We use the iterative Lagrangian analysis technique, developed by Rothman and Maw, to determine the stress-strain path. We correct for the plastic work heating and the deviatoric stress contribution to the stress-density measurement to obtain an isentrope. Our measured isentrope compares well with our shock-wave reduced isentrope at low pressures and provides an accurate pressure standard for diamond anvil cells at extreme conditions.\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.",

We provide the first spatially continuous map of forest tree density at a global-scale.

Of these trees, approximately 1.39 trillion exist in tropical and subtropical regions, with 0.74, and 0.61 trillion in boreal and temperate regions, respectively. Biome-level trends in tree density demonstrate the importance of climate and topography in controlling local tree densities at finer scales, as well as the overwhelming impact of humans across most of the world. Based on our projected tree densities, we estimate that deforestation is currently responsible for removing over 15 billion trees each year, and the global number of trees has fallen by approximately 46% since the start of human civilization.",

            "abstract": "Hazard scenarios provide emergency managers and others with information to help them prepare for future disasters. The SAFRR Tsunami Scenario, published in 2013, modeled a hypothetical but plausible tsunami, created by an Mw9.1 earthquake occurring offshore from the Alaskan peninsula, and its impacts on the California coast. It presented the modeled inundation areas, current velocities in key ports and harbors, physical damage and repair costs, economic consequences, environmental impacts, social vulnerability, emergency management, and policy implications for California associated with the scenario tsunami. The intended users were those responsible for making mitigation decisions before and those who need to make rapid decisions during future tsunamis. It provided the basis for many exercises involving, among others, NOAA, the State of Washington, several counties in California, and the National Institutes of Health. The scenario led to improvements in the warning protocol for southern California and highlighted issues that led to ongoing work on harbor and marina safety.\nBuilding on the lessons learned in the SAFRR Tsunami Scenario, another tsunami scenario is being developed with impacts to Hawaii and to the source region in Alaska, focusing on the evacuation issues of remote communities with primarily shore parallel roads, and also on the effects of port closures. Community exposure studies in Hawaii (Ratliff et al., USGS-SIR, 2015) provided background for selecting these foci.\nOne complicated and important aspect of any hazard scenario is defining the source event. The USGS is building collaborations with the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program (NTHMP) to consider issues involved in developing a standardized set of tsunami sources to support hazard mitigation work. Other key USGS-NTHMP collaborations involve population vulnerability and evacuation modeling.",

            "abstract": "A large part of the high productivity of CA current ecosystems can be attributed to Ekman upwelling of cold, nutrient-rich water, driven by north winds running parallel to shore. As meteorological (e.g. wind direction and velocity, atmospheric pressure fields, etc.) and oceanographic (e.g. sea surface temperature) parameters change in the context of climate change, it is unclear how ecosystems and the coastal upwelling on which they depend, will be impacted. To better understand the effects of meteorological and oceanographic forcing on coastal upwelling, eleven years (2005-2015) of data were taken from satellites, weather stations and data-collecting buoys located in and around the Santa Barbara Channel as part of the NASA Student Airborne Research Program (SARP). These data were then analyzed using regression and time-series cross-correlation statistics in order to identify trends in meteorological and oceanographic cycles, their relationship to localized upwelling (e.g. upwelling indices), and how climate change may impact upwelling. Results indicate that as temperature has increased over the last four years (as a result of the 'warm blob'), upwelling has decreased. They also indicate differences in the annual cycles of cross-shore pressure gradients during years of poor versus years when upwelling conditions are favorable. This documented dependence of the coastal wind on sea surface temperature could have important implications as our oceans change; elevated sea surface temperatures, such as those associated with the 'warm blob', may result in less coastal upwelling and lower ecosystem productivity.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing of the nighttime OI 135.6-nm emission represents the primary means of quantifying the F-region ionospheric state from optical measurements. Despite its pervasive use for studying aeronomical processes, the interpretation of these emissions as a proxy for ionospheric state remains ambiguous in that the relative contributions of radiative recombination and mutual neutralization to the production and, especially, the effects of scattering and absorption on the transport of the 135.6-nm emissions have not been fully quantified. Moreover, an inversion algorithm, which is robust to varying ionospheric structures under different geophysical conditions, is yet to be developed for statistically optimal characterization of the ionospheric state. In this work, as part of the NASA ICON mission, we develop a comprehensive radiative transfer model from first principle to investigate the production and transport of the nighttime 135.6-nm emissions. The forward modeling investigation indicates that under certain conditions mutual neutralization can contribute up to ~38% to the 135.6-nm emissions. Moreover, resonant scattering and pure absorption can reduce the brightness observed in the limb direction by ~40% while enhancing the brightness in the nadir direction by ~25%. Further analysis shows that without properly addressing these effects in the inversion process, the peak electron density in the F-region ionosphere (NmF2) can be overestimated by up to ~24%. To address these issues, an inversion algorithm that properly accounts for the above-mentioned effects is proposed for accurate quantification of the ionospheric state using satellite measurements. The ill-posedness due to the intrinsic presence of noise in real data is coped with by incorporating proper regularizations that enforce either global smoothness or piecewise smoothness of the solution. Application to model-generated data with different signal-to-noise ratios show that the algorithm has achieved unprecedented accuracy in estimating the electron density, with only a few percentage errors in Nmf2 and a few kilometer differences in hmf2. The inversion is also demonstrated to be robust to different geophysical conditions, in which the electron density profile can be distinctly different from a smooth Chapman profile.",

Potential drivers of change in the biological sediment proxy can be environmental contributors like weather and temperature changes as well as man-made such as developments in agriculture and forestry. However we don’t know how these different factors contribute to the biological sediment signal. Here we are monitoring a boreal lake with a varved sediment to understand how the biological signal of diatom remains is formed in the annually layered sediment. We compare the diatom stratigraphy with a sequential sediment trap. For a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms we look at three full years of bi-weekly monitoring of physical, chemical and biological parameters and 15 years of water stratification data. We seek to link the monitored in-lake processes with the yearly environmental characteristics. The diatom sediment stratigraphy of the two most abundant species Asterionella formosa and Fragilaria delicatissima indicates three periods with a contrasting trend for both species from 1975 until 2014. In the first period Asterionella formosa is almost not abundant spanning one decade (1975-1985), reaching elevated abundance with a decreasing trend in period 2 over the following 17 years to be followed by a tripling of Asterionella fromosa remains in the sediment during the third period. The opposite trend is found for Fragilaria delicatissima. Linking the recorded data with the corresponding sediment stratigraphy allows us to distinguish between weather changes and catchment disturbances as potential drivers for changes in a sedimentary diatom signal.",

The WFIP 1 field deployment/modeling campaign in the Southern Study Area (SSA--encompassing most of central and western Texas) ran from August 2011 through Septembe 2012. This ensured observational data and model output for all representative weather regimes affecting the SSA. Cold and warm season regimes featured synoptic-scale, convective, and low-level jet (LLJ) phenomena that are responsible for the favorable wind resource in the SSA, and also posed a challenge for assigning specific explanations for the observed forecast improvements (e.g. additional observations, model improvements, or a combination of both). LLJs produced hourly capacity factors exceeding 80% in aggregated wind farm power production, while synoptic-scale systems were responsible for the largest ramp events observed during WFIP 1. Accurately forecasting convective phenomena (such as outflow boundaries) during WFIP 1 was at times problematic. Here, we present regime-based and phenomenological-related forecast performance results for WFIP 1. These performance metrics suggest future research pathways that will facilitate improvements in operational wind power forecasts.",

            "abstract": "We have evaluated iodine-to-calcium (I/Ca) ratios from a series of carbonate samples with well-constrained histories of diagenetic alteration to assess the likelihood of overprints on primary water column-derived signals. Because only the oxidized iodine species, iodate, is incorporated during carbonate precipitation, I/Ca ratios have strong potential as proxies for both marine redox and carbon cycling. This utility lies with the combination of iodate’s redox sensitivity as well as the close association between iodine and marine organic matter. However, despite the possibility of large pore water iodine enrichments relative to overlying seawater, carbonate alteration under reducing diagenetic conditions, and iodate-to-iodide reduction, no study has assessed the prospect of diagenetic alteration of primary I/Ca ratios. Here, we evaluated aragonite-to-calcite transformations and dolomitization within the Key Largo Limestone of South Florida and the Clino and Unda drill cores of the Bahamas Bank. Also, early burial diagenesis was studied through analysis of I/Ca ratios in short cores from a variety of shallow settings within the Exuma Bay, Bahamas. Further, we evaluated authigenic carbonates through analysis of iodine in concretions constrained to have formed during varying stages of evolving pore fluid chemistry. In all cases, I/Ca ratios show the potential for diagenetic iodine loss relative to water-column derived values, consistent with observations of quantitative reduction of dissolved iodate to iodide in pore waters before or synchronous with carbonate alteration. In no case, however, did we observe an increase in I/Ca during diagenetic transformation. Our results suggest both that primary I/Ca values and trends can be preserved but that maximum I/Ca ratios should be considered a minimum estimate of seawater iodate. We recommend that ancient carbonates with distinct I/Ca trends not indicative of diagenetic iodine loss reflect preservation of or very early diagenetic alteration of primary mineralogies.",

High levels of ozone were observed near the surface over the Sierra Nevada mountains, and VOC data was used to investigate factors that contributed to ozone production. This was done by calculating the hydroxyl radical reactivity, which can, in proper conditions, be used to predict ozone formation potential. The region was divided into three boxes from east to west, based on wind direction, and the reactivity was analyzed over each region with respect to methane, non-methane alkanes, alkenes, aromatics, and biogenic compounds. In the westernmost box the reactivity was 1.7 ± 0.5 s-1 (1σ), in the middle section it was 1.4 ± 1 s-1, and in the easternmost region it was 0.8 ± 0.3 s-1. The data were compared with a region known to be heavily polluted, the Los Angeles (LA) basin, and it was observed that the reactivity was 1.1 ± 0.6 s-1, lower than in two of the mountainous regions. In the Sierra Nevada mountains a major percentage of the hydroxyl radical reactivity was the result of biogenic influence, at 24% for the western box, 39% for the middle box, and 31% for the easternmost box, in contrast to only 2% biogenic contribution in LA. This indicates that biogenic factors greatly contributed to overall ozone formation in the Sierra Nevada mountains. These mountains are strategically protected, and high pollution levels could lead to health impacts for visitors, vegetation, and wildlife.",

            "abstract": "There have been many modeling studies of the runaway greenhouse effect and the conditions required to produce one on an Earth-like planet, however these models have not been verified with empirical evidence. It has been suggested that the Earth’s tropics may be near a state of localized runaway greenhouse, meaning the surface temperature and atmospheric composition in those areas could cause runaway greenhouse, were it not for the tempering effects of meridional heat transport and circulation (Pierrehumbert, 1995). Using the assumption that some areas of the Earth’s tropics may be under these conditions, this study uses measurements of the atmospheric properties, surface properties, and radiation budgets of these areas to quantify a radiation limit for runaway greenhouse on Earth, by analyzing the dependence of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) at the top of the atmosphere on surface temperature and total column water vapour. An upper limit on OLR for clear-sky conditions was found between 289.8 W/m2 and 292.2 W/m2, which occurred at surface temperatures near 300K. For surface temperatures above this threshold, total column water vapour increased, but OLR initially decreased and then remained relatively constant, between 273.6 W/m2 and 279.7 W/m2. These limits are in good agreement with recent modeling results (Goldblatt et al., 2013), supporting the idea that some of the Earth’s tropics may be in localized runaway greenhouse, and that radiation limits for runaway greenhouse on Earth can be empirically derived.

            "abstract": "Estuaries are responsible for the transport and transformation of nutrients and organic matters from the continent to the adjacent coastal zone, and therefore play critical roles in global biogeochemical cycles. They are under increasing stress from human activities, especially in China, yet we still know little about the responses of microbial communities that mediate biogeochemical processes. Here, we investigated planktonic and benthic microbial communities in the human-perturbed Jiulong River estuary (JRE), southern China by using Illumina 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing. The results of taxonomic assignments indicated that Beta- (23.32%), Alpha- (22.21%), Gammaproteobacteria (14.83%), Actinobacteria (8.67%), and Flavobacteria (7.56%) were the five most abundant classes in estuarine surface waters, while benthic microbial communities were dominated by Gamma- (20.09%), Delta- (14.68%), Beta- (9.82%), Alphaproteobacteria (7.63%), and Anaerolineae (7.25%). The results of Adnois and ANOSIM tests confirmed that the compositions of microbial communities from waters and sediments of the JRE were significantly different from each other, and then salinity may be the primary factor controlling spatial distributions of planktonic and benthic microbial communities in this estuary. At the temporal scale, planktonic communities showed a more clear variation pattern. Remarkably, the ratios of Thaumarchaeota (putative ammonia-oxidizing archaea) to Nitrosomonadales (ammonia-oxidizing bacteria) either in water or sediments of the JRE increased from freshwater to marine end, suggesting that bacterial and archaeal nitrifiers occupy low-salinity and high-salinity niches, respectively. The nutrient concentrations and salinity might be the most important factors which are responsible for this niche diversification. Overall, this study shed light on our understanding of the biogeographic patterns and its ecological drivers of estuarine microbial communities.",

            "abstract": "Remote sensing has emerged as a viable and efficient tool for studying river systems and facilitating their rehabilitation. While many remote sensing applications utilize spectral information from the substrate and water column, light reflected from the water surface is often a significant component of the total at-sensor radiance. As water surface roughness (WSR) increases, a greater proportion of surface facets become oriented so as to reflect, rather than transmit, light. As a result, WSR exerts a primary control on the amount of surface reflected light measured by a remote sensor. WSR in rivers is a function of flow hydraulics, channel form, slope, bed roughness, and wind. While the relative influence of each of these components on WSR changes with scale, understanding these relationships could lead to methods for obtaining hydraulic information from image-derived metrics of WSR (i.e., surface reflectance). We collected field data on flow depth and velocity using an acoustic Doppler current profiler and simultaneously measured WSR using a custom built ultrasonic distance sensor on a diverse set of rivers ranging from a 15 m wide supraglacial river on the Greenland Ice Sheet to 100 m wide gravel-bed rivers in Wyoming and Oregon. Simultaneous multi- and hyperspectral image data sets indicate that image-derived surface reflectance is strongly correlated with WSR. Temporally distributed point measurements of flow depth, velocity, and WSR on the supraglacial river capture a threefold range in discharge (6 m3/s to 17 m3/s) and indicate that flow velocity is a primary control on WSR in smaller channels, even in the absence of sediment-induced bed roughness. Spatially distributed field measurements from large gravel-bed rivers suggests that spatial variability of WSR in the thalweg corresponds with geomorphic facies while WSR along the channel margins is more significantly influenced by grain size, relative submergence, and bank geometry. These findings suggest that controls of water surface roughness are scale dependent. Image-derived metrics of WSR provide information on channel hydraulics that could be used to define geomorphic units (i.e. pool/riffles), refine flow model inputs, and delineate aquatic habitats.",

            "abstract": "By 2050, the world will need to feed 9 billion people. This will require a 60% increase in agricultural production and subsequently a 6% increase in water use by the agricultural sector alone. By 2030, global water demand is expected to increase by 40%, mostly in developing countries like Nigeria (Addams, Boccaletti, Kerlin, & Stuchtey, 2009) and global energy demand is expected to increase by 33% in 2035, also, mostly in emerging economies (IEA, 2013). These resources have to be managed efficiently in preparation for these future demands. Population growth leads to increased demand for water, energy and food. More food production will lead to more water-for-food and energy-for-food usage; and more demand for energy will lead to more water-for-energy needs. This nexus between water, energy and food is poorly understood and furthermore, complicated by external drivers such as climate change.\nNiger State Nigeria, which is blessed with abundant water and arable land resources, houses the three hydropower dams in Nigeria and one of the governments’ proposed Staple Crops Processing Zones (SCPZ) for rice production. Both of these capital intensive investments depend heavily on water resources and are all highly vulnerable to changes in climate. Thus, it is essential to know how the local climate in this state will likely change and its impacts on water, energy and food security, so that policy makers can make informed mitigation/adaptation plans; operational and investment decisions.\nThe objective of this project is to provide information, using an integrated resources management approach, on the effects of future climate changes on water, energy (hydropower) and food resources in Niger State, Nigeria and improve knowledge on the interlinkages between water, energy and food at a local scale.",

Atmospheric composition is inferred using the Atmospheric Ultraviolet Radiance Integrated Code [Strickland et al., 1999] adapted to the Martian atmosphere [Evans et al., 2015]. For our retrievals we use emission features observed by IUVS on MAVEN under daytime conditions over both northern and southern hemispheres from October 2014 to September 2015. We use retrieved CO2 densities to derive temperature variability between 150 – 220 km. We also investigate the sensitivity of neutral and ion density retrievals to variability in solar irradiance, solar longitude, and local time. We compare our retrievals to predictions from the Mars Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model [MGITM, Bougher et al., 2015], as well as in situ measurements by the Neutral Gas Ionizing Mass Spectrometer [NGIMS, Mahaffy et al., 2014], and quantify the differences throughout the altitude region of interest. The N2/CO2 ratio is used to show that N2 is in the diffusively separated region of the Martian atmosphere with a mean mixing ratio that is consistent with model predictions from MGITM, as well as in situ measurements by Viking 1 & 2 [Nier and McElroy, 1977] and NGIMS.",

Episode 1: 1992–1995, deflation rate of about 2.7 cm/yr, episode 2: 1996–2000, minimal deflation of 0.5 cm/yr with considerable inflation of 1.7 cm/yr at Norris, episode 3: 2000–2004, slight deflation of 0.7 cm/yr with local inflation of 0.6 cm/yr at Norris, episode 4: 2004–2009, extraordinary inflation of 3–8 cm/yr with substantial deflation of 1–4 cm/yr at Norris, episode 5: 2010–2014, notable deflation of about 1–2.4 cm/yr across the entire caldera floor, and ultimately episode 6: 2014–2015, remarkable caldera-wide inflation of about 2-6 cm/yr. During the period of observation (1992–2015), extensive deformation has occurred primarily at three locations; namely, the Mallard Lake resurgent dome, the Sour Creek resurgent dome, and the Norris Geyser Basin that is located nearby the northwestern rim of the caldera. InSAR data acquired during 1992–2015 by ERS-1, ERS-2, ENVISAT, TerraSAR-X, TanDEM-X, and Sentinel-1 are analyzed using the two-pass and the small baseline subset interferometric methods. The created interferograms do not show any alignment of crustal deformation with fault zones across the intermittently active caldera, which indicate that the magma charge and discharge, as well as the widespread hydrothermal activity are responsible for the induced deformation. Fault zones most likely have acted as pathways for the movements of magma and hydrothermal fluids, but they do not have any influence on the measured rates of surface motion. Source modeling of recent GPS and InSAR measurements indicates the existence of two distinct planar sources beneath the caldera (8–12 km) and the Norris Geyser Basin (10–16 km).",

            "abstract": "The impact of multidecadal variations of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) on the Southern Ocean (SO) is investigated using a coupled ocean-atmosphere model. We find that the AMOC can influence the SO via fast atmosphere teleconnections and subsequent ocean adjustments. A stronger than normal AMOC induces an anomalous warm SST over the North Atlantic, which favors an increased equator-to-pole temperature gradient in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) upper troposphere and lower stratosphere due to an amplified tropical upper tropospheric warming as a result of increased latent heat release. This eventually strengthens and pushes the Southern Hemisphere westerly jet poleward. The wind change over the SO then cools the SST by anomalous northward Ekman transports. The wind change also weakens the Antarctic bottom water (AABW) cell through changes in surface heat flux heating forcing. The poleward shifted westerly wind decreases the long term mean easterly winds over the Weddell Sea, thereby reducing the turbulent heat flux loss, decreasing surface density and therefore leading to a weakening of the AABW cell. The weakened AABW cell produces a temperature dipole in the SO, with a warm anomaly in the subsurface and a cold anomaly in the surface that corresponds to an increase of Antarctic sea ice. Opposite conditions occur for a weaker than normal AMOC. Our study here suggests that efforts to attribute the recent observed SO variability to various factors should take into consideration not only local process but also remote AMOC forcing.",

            "abstract": "Coarse-resolution satellite albedo products are increasingly applied in geographical researches because of their capability to characterize the spatio-temporal patterns of land surface parameters. In the long-term validation of coarse-resolution satellite products with ground measurements, the scale effect, i.e., the mismatch between point measurement and pixel observation becomes the main challenge, particularly over heterogeneous land surfaces. Recent advances in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) technologies offer an opportunity for validation using multi-point observations instead of single-point observation. The difficulty is to ensure the representativeness of the WSN in heterogeneous areas with limited nodes.\nIn this study, the objective is to develop a ground-based spatial sampling strategy through consideration of the historical prior knowledge and avoidance of the information redundancy between different sensor nodes. Taking albedo as an example. First, we derive monthly local maps of albedo from 30-m HJ CCD images a 3-year period. Second, we pick out candidate points from the areas with higher temporal stability which helps to avoid the transition or boundary areas. Then, the representativeness (r) of each candidate point is evaluated through the correlational analysis between the point-specific and area-average time sequence albedo vector. The point with the highest r was noted as the new sensor point. Before electing a new point, the vector component of the selected points should be taken out from the vectors in the following correlational analysis. The selection procedure would be ceased once if the integral representativeness (R) meets the accuracy requirement. Here, the sampling method is adapted to both single-parameter and multi-parameter situations.\nFinally, it is shown that this sampling method has been effectively worked in the optimized layout of Huailai remote sensing station in China. The coarse resolution pixel covering this station could be well-represented by six nodes with an integral representativeness high to 99.1%. The measurements have been applied to the validation of MODIS albedo products for crop. Comparison results demonstrate that the RMSE of MODIS albedo products in growing season is 0.011, in harvest time was nearly 0.05, and for bare soil in winter is 0.009.",

            "abstract": "Throughout the Colorado River Basin (CRB), uranium (U) persists as a relic contaminant of former ore processing activities. Elevated solid-phase U levels exist in fine-grained, naturally-reduced zone (NRZ) sediments intermittently found within the subsurface floodplain alluvium of the following Department of Energy-Legacy Management sites: Rifle, CO; Naturita, CO; and Grand Junction, CO. Coupled with groundwater fluctuations that alter the subsurface redox conditions, previous evidence from Rifle, CO suggests this resupply of U may be controlled by microbially-produced nitrite and nitrate. Nitrification, the two-step process of archaeal and bacterial ammonia-oxidation followed by bacterial nitrite oxidation, generates nitrate under oxic conditions. Our hypothesis is that when elevated groundwater levels recede and the subsurface system becomes anoxic, the nitrate diffuses into the reduced interiors of the NRZ and stimulates denitrification, the stepwise anaerobic reduction of nitrate/nitrite to dinitrogen gas. Denitrification may then be coupled to the oxidation of sediment-bound U(IV) forming mobile U(VI), allowing it to resupply U into local groundwater supplies. A key step in substantiating this hypothesis is to demonstrate the presence of nitrogen-cycling organisms in U-contaminated, NRZ sediments from the upper CRB.\nHere we investigate how the diversity and abundances of nitrifying and denitrifying microbial populations change throughout the NRZs of the subsurface by using functional gene markers for ammonia-oxidation (amoA, encoding the α-subunit of ammonia monooxygenase) and denitrification (nirK, nirS, encoding nitrite reductase). Microbial diversity has been assessed via clone libraries, while abundances have been determined through quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), elucidating how relative numbers of nitrifiers (amoA) and denitrifiers (nirK, nirS) vary with depth, vary with location, and relate to uranium release within NRZs in sediment cores spanning the upper CRB. Early findings from Rifle, CO indicate elevated abundances of ammonia-oxidizers seem to correlate with elevated uranium concentrations emphasizing the critical need to understand how nitrogen-cycling organisms influence subsurface U redox chemistry and mobility.",

We provide access to over 85 terabytes of continuous and event-based time series data from broadband, short-period, strong motion, and strain sensors as well as continuous and campaign GPS data at both standard and high sample rates. The Northen California Seismic System (NCSS), operated by UC Berkeley and USGS Menlo Park, has recorded over 900,000 events from 1984 to the present, and the NCEDC serves catalog, parametric information, moment tensors and first motion mechanisms, and time series data for these events. We also serve event catalogs, parametric information, and event waveforms for DOE enhanced geothermal system monitoring in northern California and Nevada.\nThe NCEDC provides a several ways for users to access these data. The most recent development are web services, which provide interactive, command-line, or program-based workflow access to data. Web services use well-established server and client protocols and RESTful software architecture that allow users to easily submit queries and receive the requested data in real-time rather than through batch or email-based requests. Data are returned to the user in the appropriate format such as XML, RESP, simple text, or MiniSEED depending on the service and selected output format. The NCEDC supports all FDSN-defined web services as well as a number of IRIS-defined and NCEDC-defined services. We also continue to support older email-based and browser-based access to data.

However, there has been little exploration about the spatial variations in streamflow in steep headwater catchments and its relationship with stream-groundwater exchange. We investigated streamflow and stream-groundwater exchange in a 45 m reach in a small steep headwater catchment in western Japan to explore the effects of stream-groundwater exchange on the spatial variation in streamflow. The study reach had an incised channel with the substrate of cobbles and boulders, and the channel gradient was 0.5 m/m. The streamflow was gauged at both ends of the reach, and series of tracer injection experiments were conducted to quantify the water exchange between stream and groundwater. The differences between the two gauges (∆Q) was approximately 0.2 L/s (34% of downstream discharge) in low flow period in January-May and increased to 1.4 L/s (56% of downstream discharge) during high flow period in June-July. The relative flux of stream-groundwater exchange increased with streamflow, in contrast to previous findings. Thus, in the steep headwater stream studied, the spatial variation in streamflow was large, and the influence of stream-groundwater exchange on streamflow variation became larger in high flow period, suggesting the presence of additional flow paths during high flow period. The combination of spatial variations in streamflow and stream-groundwater exchange can help to clarify the unique streamflow generation process in steep headwater catchment.",

            "abstract": "The youngest sub-population of a detrital zircon geochronological dataset is routinely used to approximate the age of deposition for a sample. The ages represent a maximum depositional age (MDA) because the detrital zircons analyzed crystallized at depth, in a magma chamber prior to being exposed at the surface through erosion or volcanic eruption. Dickinson and Gehrels (2009) demonstrate four methods of calculating the MDA of a zircon population using U-Pb ages, which are assessed in this study. Previous MDA studies used relatively small datasets (n<100), reducing the likelihood of finding the youngest population in a sample. We consider large-n datasets (n>500), which have a greater likelihood of capturing a significant proportion of the youngest population and therefore have the potential to improve the accuracy of a calculated MDA.\nWe assess the effects of sample size and MDA calculation methods using a numerical model consisting of a simulated population of detrital zircon grains with known ages. Using our population of 25048 simulated grains, we ran repeated trials of varying sample sizes (n=50, 100, 300, 500, 700, 1000, 1500) to compare the output of MDA calculation techniques. As sample size increases the youngest sub-population of zircons is better defined, and the MDA decreases and becomes more precise.\nAs a further test, model results are compared to U-Pb data (n=695) from a sample of the Maasrichtian-Paleocene Gabriola Formation (Nanaimo Group, B.C., Canada). Similar trials of varying sample sizes show the same decrease in MDA. Biostratigraphic analysis assigned the formation to the Maastrichtian (72.1 – 66.0 Ma), however, our results indicate that deposition took place in the Danian (66.0 – 61.6 Ma). This result has implications for the timing of forearc basin fill, and more broadly, the evolution of the Western North American Cordillera. MDA methods on large-n datasets can be used to hone stratigraphic correlations and calculate sediment accumulation rates.",

As part of the draft assessment, we reviewed, analyzed, and synthesized information from over 950 sources and concluded that there are above and below ground mechanisms by which hydraulic fracturing activities have the potential to impact drinking water resources. These mechanisms include:\nWater withdrawals in times of, or in areas with, low water availability;\nSpills of hydraulic fracturing fluids and produced water; \nFracturing directly into underground drinking water resources; \nBelow ground migration of liquids and gases; and \nInadequate treatment and discharge of wastewater.\nOf the potential mechanisms identified in this report, we found specific instances where one or more mechanisms led to impacts on drinking water resources, including contamination of drinking water wells. The number of identified cases, however, was small compared to the number of hydraulically fractured wells. This finding could reflect a rarity of effects on drinking water resources, but may also be due to other limiting factors. These factors include: insufficient pre- and post-fracturing data on the quality of drinking water resources; the paucity of long-term systematic studies; the presence of other sources of contamination precluding a definitive link between hydraulic fracturing activities and an impact; and the inaccessibility of some information on hydraulic fracturing activities and potential impacts.\nDisclaimer: The views expressed are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views or polices of the EPA.",

            "abstract": "Cyclone activities are governed by many boundary conditions, such as the underlying SST or sea ice, the relative heating between the continent and the ocean, and their relative location against the jet stream to name a few. All these factors and their seasonal march is prone to change under the future global warming condition. Especially in the Arctic, the timing of sea ice melting and freezing, seasonal change in snow cover, and the location of upper level jets all contribute towards a change in cyclone seasonal distribution and extreme events. Here, we use a Langrangean method of detecting cyclones and their activity under the historical and rcp 4.5 scenario of 8 CMIP5 climate models to assess the change in Arctic cyclone activities. We find that while the models show weaker cyclone activities than observation and inter-model difference is large in some cases, they simulate the seasonal cycle and extreme events reasonably well. In the winter season under the global warming scenario, many models exhibits a northeastward shift in mid-latitude storm track resulting in mode cyclones entering the Arctic from the mid-latitudes. There is also a marked increase in the number of cyclones in the Barents/Kara Sea where correlation with sea ice is suspected. During the summer season, a large change in the Arctic cyclone activity located near the North Pole is evident in many models. This change in Arctic cyclone is due to contribution of more cyclogenesis within the Arctic circle. In this presentation, we also look at other seasons and the seasonal march of the cyclone activity within the Arctic and its interaction with the mid-latitudes. We also document the change in extreme events under the climate models.",

            "abstract": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (CCS) is recently expected as the promising method to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is important to investigate CO2 behavior in the reservoir, to evaluate the safety and to account the stored CO2 volume. In this study, experimental investigation is conducted to discuss the relationships between injected fluid speed (Flow rate: FR) or capillary number (Ca) and non-wetting fluid flow by compressional wave velocity (Vp) and electrical impedance (Z). In the experiment, N2 and supercritical CO2 were injected into the two sandstones with different porosity (φ), Berea sandstone (φ: 18 %), and Ainoura sandstone (φ: 11.9 %). The dimension of the rock specimens is cored cylinder with a 35 mm diameter and 70 mm height. Experimental conditions are nearly same as the reservoir of deep underground (Confining pressure:15MPa, 40℃). Initial conditions of the specimen are brine (0.1wt%-KCl) saturated. Four piezo-electrical transducers (PZTs) are set on the each surface of the top, middle, lower of the specimen to monitor the CO2 bahavior by Vp. To measuring Z, we use for electrodes method with Ag-AgCl electrodes. Four electrodes are wounded around specimen on the both sides of PZTs. We measured the changes of these parameters with injecting N2, injected fluid speed (FR), the differential pore pressure (DP), N2 saturation (SN2), P-wave velocity (Vp) and electrical impedance (Z), respectively. We also estimated the Ca from measured FR. From these experimental results, there are no obvious Vp changes with increasing Ca, while Z measurement indicates clear and continuous increment. In regards to Vp, Vp reduced at the small FR (0.1 to 0.2 ml/min). As the Ca increases, Vp doesn’t indicate large reduction. On the other hand, Z is more sensitive to change the fluid saturation than Vp. It is well-known that both of Vp and Z are the function of fluid saturation. Though, these experimental results are not consistent with previous studies. In this study, we will discuss this mismatch by using fluid mechanical theory and numerical simulation of two-phase fluid flow in porous geological medium based on experimental results of two different types of sandstone.",

Ecological stoichiometry of plant N and P provides the dominant means for investigating plant nutrient, and it may provide insights for fields as diverse as global carbon modeling, global climate change, and macroecology. Here we measured N and P contents and their ratios for 132 leaf samples and 120 root samples collected at 132 sites along the 5000km long China Grassland Transect (CGT) that traverses the Inner Mongolian and Qinghai-Tibet Plateaus. The aim was to explore the patterns of leaf N, P and root N, P and their ratio (N/P) respectively in relation to variability in geography, temperature and precipitation, and also the patterns of the relative N and P contents in leaf and root (leaf N(P)/ root N(P)). Results show that: 1) with decreasing longitude and latitude, increasing altitude and mean annual precipitation, leaf N and P increased, N/P decreased. 2) root N increased with increasing longitude, latitude, mean annual temperature, root P only increased with longitude. The patterns of root N,P were not in accord with the patterns of leaf N, P. 3) leaf and root relative N and P increased with increasing latitude and decreasing altitude, and relative N content also increased with decreasing mean annual temperature and increasing mean annual precipitation. Leaf and root relative N and P content reflected the distribution characteristics of the elements in relation to variability in geographical and climate factors. When there was more precipitation, or lower temperature, more N would be distributed to root. Lastly, we speculated that the ratio of leaf and root relative N and relative P content should be a fixed value, and our study was 0.81±0.51.",

            "abstract": "Many restoration projects in the Pacific Northwest are implemented to improve habitat quality, quantity, and complexity for fish. Although numerous engineered log structures have been constructed in the hopes of achieving these goals, relatively few projects have been rigorously monitored to determine their success. This research seeks to compare the utility and application between photogrammetric and spectral depth approaches in detecting fish habitat in order to determine which method is more accurate and affordable for monitoring channel bathymetry. While each of these techniques has been individually studied, previous research has not directly compared and quantified their differences. Channel bathymetry data were collected by combining pre- and post-restoration digital photographs of the Salmon River in Northeast Clackamas County, Oregon, using structure-from-motion (SfM). The resulting 3D point cloud will be used to estimate water depths using photogrammetry and spectral depth. The photogrammetric method applies a refraction correction to the extracted water depth from the SfM topography to derive water depth. A regression between the surveyed water depth values and digital number values of surface pixels will derive depth. The resulting water depths from these two methods will be compared to the surveyed water depths for their accuracy and precision, particularly in critical salmonid habitats. The quantification of these differences will be an important contribution to river restoration science as it will allow for more accurate measurement and monitoring of changes in fish habitat. In the future, these data will be used in an eco-hydraulic River2D model to simulate changes in salmonid habitat availability after restoration.",

Using a suite of geodynamo simulations, we have tested several parameterizations of the Lorentz to Coriolis force ratio against direct calculations and developed a scaling estimate to predict this ratio for planetary cores. Our results suggest that the Earth's core is likely to be in magnetostrophic balance where the Lorentz and Coriolis forces are comparable. The Lorentz force may also be significant in Jupiter's core, where it is predicted to be approximately a factor of ten less than the Coriolis force. Magnetic fields become increasingly sub-dominant for the other planets: the Coriolis force is predicted to exceed the Lorentz force by at least two orders of magnitude within the cores of Saturn, Uranus/Neptune, Ganymede, and Mercury.",

            "abstract": "The Actively Heated Fiber Optics (AHFO) method has the potential to measure soil water content at high temporal (<1hr) and spatial (every 0.25 m) resolutions along buried fiber optics (FO) cables multiple kilometers in length. This game-changing method can capture soil water dynamics over four orders of magnitude in spatial scale (0.1-1000 m). However, many challenges remain to resolve for the practical applicability of the AHFO at the field scale. In particular, cost effective distributed calibration method that accounts for the spatial variability of the soil thermal properties is still lacking. In fact, AHFO infers soil water content from observing the thermal response of the soil to a heat pulse injected along the fiber optic cable. For a particular location, the temporal variation of the soil thermal response depends mainly on the soil moisture content. Across the field the variability of thermal response will also be a function of the soil thermal properties which change with the soil mineralogy and bulk density. Here we present various strategies for distributed calibration of the AHFO method based on numerical simulation, direct field observation, and/or laboratory experimentation. In particular we will present a novel approach for mapping the soil thermal behavior by conducting AHFO measurements at strategic soil water conditions such as near saturation and dry conditions. We will show results from a large scale deployment at the MOISST site in Stillwater, Oklahoma where 4900 m of fiber optic soil moisture sensing cables are providing daily soil moisture measurements at >39,000 locations in the field.\nThe material is based upon work supported by NASA under award NNX12AP58G, with equipment and assistance also provided by CTEMPs.org with support from the National Science Foundation under Grant Number 1129003.

            "abstract": "Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are increasingly being applied by the geophysical community for large-scale surveys of environments that are challenging to reach (e.g. volcanoes, glaciers). Some of these natural systems include large bodies of water such as oceans, lakes and rivers. These environments are highly dynamic and, even in normal conditions, their characterization requires long surveys involving the deployment of expensive equipment and large crews. Technical challenges, and thus costs, become prohibitive especially during extreme natural events that may pose a threat not only to the monitoring facilities but, more importantly, to the surrounding residential areas (e.g. river flooding, extreme waves). Traditional measurement techniques have difficulty or are unable to monitor some flow quantities (i.e. flow discharge and wave energy content) associated with these natural systems, especially during emergencies. Extreme hydrodynamic loads due to high flow discharges and/or highly energetic waves may tamper with traditional monitoring systems that are typically submerged or fixed in the vicinity of the water body.\nHere, we propose to employ specially developed UAV systems to remotely and safely gain high-resolution images of the water surface. Such images are processed using robust large-scale particle image velocimetry (LSPIV) algorithms that are able to accurately resolve the complex two-dimensional flow field of the water surface over extensive areas. These systems can theoretically be deployed in a cost-effective way for long periods of time for continuous monitoring. Such monitoring is key to inform and calibrate predictive tools that can reconstruct potential emergency scenarios. In addition, during extreme natural events, data can be collected with no risk to human operators. Here, we discuss the concept and technology employed to render these measurement systems effective, and provide examples of applications that show the depth of the data that can be extracted from aerial images and thus the potential of this technology.",

However, by applying the non-hydrostatic deep momentum system, we can omit the angular momentum principle for regional modeling, while leaving the cosine terms, to calculate the full-component Coriolis force.\nFrom the governing equations, we can see that the cosine terms of the Coriolis force affect zonal wind (u) and vertical wind (w). The magnitude of the Coriolis force is determined by two factors: wind speed and latitude. The maximum of the cosine function happens when the latitude is zero degrees, which is at the equator. In this study, we conduct research into the effects of full-component Coriolis force in the nonhydrostatic regional spectral model (RSM) over tropical areas. Numerical experiments will be done to show the impact of the cosine terms of Coriolis force on wind field and precipitation structure. The differences in the two approaches will be compared in order to prove their relative effectiveness in climate prediction.",

Estimation of the effectiveness of protected areas is thus important for evaluating the efficacy of forest conservation policies and priorities. However, comprehensive evaluation of the long-term effects of Protected Areas and international aid is lacking. However, with the recent availability of long-term, large-scale forest cover change data at 30-m resolution, it has become possible to address some of the issues surrounding the effectiveness of protected areas. To evaluate the effectiveness of Protected Areas in the pan-tropics and international aid for conservation, we use the 30m resolution data along with econometrics 1) to estimate avoided deforestation by PAs in the tropics during the 2000s, 2) estimate effects of international aid on avoided deforestation by PAs and 3) analyze the relationships between the socio-economic variables and increases in deforestation, avoided deforestation by PAs and effects of international aid. Our results show that protected areas avoided 83,500 ± 21,200 km2 of deforestation during the 2000s. Brazil showed the highest estimates of effects of international aid on the avoided deforestation of 22 m2/USD, which is about 50 times higher compared to Indonesia (0.5 m2/USD). The regression analysis between avoided deforestation, effects of international aid and socio-economic factors demonstrates that PAs have been relatively more effective in the countries where the deforestation pressures were increasing and that governance and forest change monitoring capacity may be important factors enhancing the efficacy of international aid. Our study presents the first pan-tropical analysis of the long-term evaluation of the effectiveness of protected areas, international aid and their regulating factors using spatially explicit fine resolution data. Our findings allow us to pinpoint where conservation initiatives and resource management are effectively practiced and to discover the link with socio-economic factors and their significance and underlying implications for the effectiveness of PAs.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_2015.pdf\nThe discovery of Europa maintaining a probably sporadic water vapor plume constitutes a huge scientific opportunity for NASA’s upcoming mission to this Galilean moon. Measuring the properties of material emerging from interior sources offers a unique chance to understand conditions at Europa’s subsurface ocean. Exploiting results obtained for the Enceladus plume, we adjust the ejection model by Schmidt et al. [2008] to the conditions at Europa. In this way, we estimate properties of a possible, yet unobserved dust component of the Europa plume. For a size-dependent speed distribution of emerging ice particles we use the model from Kempf et al. [2010] for grain dynamics, modified to run simulations of plumes on Europa. Specifically, we model emission from the two plume locations determined from observations by Roth et al. [2014] and also from other locations chosen at the closest approach of low-altitude flybys investigated in the Europa Clipper study. This allows us to estimate expected fluxes of ice grains on the spacecraft. We then explore the parameter space of Europa dust plumes with regard to particle speed distribution parameters, plume location, and spacecraft flyby elevation. Each parameter set results in a 3-dimensional particle density structure through which we simulate flybys, and a map of particle fallback (‘snowfall’) on the surface of Europa. Due to the moon’s high escape speed, a Europa plume will eject few to no particles that can escape its gravity, which has several further consequences: (i) For given ejection velocity a Europa plume will have a smaller scale height, with a higher particle number densities than the plume on Enceladus, (ii) plume particles will not feed the diffuse Galilean dust ring, (iii) the snowfall pattern on the surface will be more localized about the plume location, and will not induce a global m = 2 pattern as seen on Enceladus, and (iv) safely observing an active plume will require low altitude flybys, preferably at 50-100 km. Our simulations provide an extensive library documenting the possible structure of Europa dust plumes, which can be quickly refined as more data on Europa dust plumes are collected. The attached image shows example number density profiles for two particle size distributions of slope α ejected from a Roth et al. plume, with the Clipper E35 flyby overlaid.",

For this investigation, we run our model using plasma and turbulence parameters from OMNI data as time-dependent boundary conditions at 1 AU for the Reynolds-averaged MHD equations and investigate the evolution of plasma and turbulent fluctuations along the trajectory of the New Horizons spacecraft, which recently passed by Pluto nearly ten years after launch. We also present solar wind simulations starting at 0.1 AU outwards using interplanetary scintillation data as boundary conditions. Simulations are compared with OMNI and STEREO data. The purpose of this study is to create a time-dependent solar wind model capable of reproducing the plasma flow, magnetic field, and turbulence along the trajectories of Solar Probe Plus and Solar Orbiter.",

            "abstract": "The moisture balance of the continental boundary layer plays an important role in regulating the exchange of water and energy between the land surface and atmosphere. The surface layer moisture balance is controlled by a number of factors including precipitation, infiltration, evaporation and transpiration. Measurements of stable isotope ratios in water can be exploited to better understand the mechanisms controlling atmosphere-land surface water fluxes. We present three years of in situ tower-based measurements of stable isotope ratios of water (δD and δ18O) in vapor, precipitation, vegetation and soil from the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory, a semi-arid 300 meter tall-tower site in Erie, Colorado. Co-located meteorological and disdrometer measurements at the surface and 300m allow us to explore key aspects of continental moisture cycling in a semi-arid environment such as the important contribution of sub-surface vapor diffusion to the surface water vapor budget and its implications for partitioning in dry ecosystems, and the role of rain evaporation during precipitation events on inter-event and seasonal time scales. We use our observations to constrain a Craig-Gordon evaporation model at the land surface to weight the contributions of rainfall, surface water vapor exchange and sub-surface vapor diffusion to soil water isotope values. A multi-season in situ time series of surface vapor isotope profiles in conjunction with soil and precipitation allows us to field-validate choices for parameters such as the kinetic fractionation factor for each process. This has implications both for modeling short-term gas exchange at the land surface in modern-day climate models as well as for refining paleoclimate interpretations of stable oxygen and hydrogen isotope-based proxies. Tall-tower precipitation and vapor isotope profile data can also be analyzed in conjunction with disdrometer data on inter-event and seasonal time scales to quantify the role of rain evaporation in the surface layer water balance. These studies can help refine fractionation factor choices in land surface and boundary layer parameterizations in isotope-enable climate models.",

            "abstract": "In recent times, fluorine has been receiving increasing attention due to the possibility for chemical (HF) leakage accidents and its high toxicity to human and environment. In this respect, a novel approach for the determination of fluorine concentrations in water samples using wavelength dispersive X-ray fluorescence (WDXRF) spectrometry was investigated in this study. The main disadvantage of WDXRF technique for fluorine analysis is low analytical sensitivity for light elements with atomic number (Z) less than 15. To overcome this problem, we employed the precipitation reaction which fluoride is reacted with cation such as Al3+ and/or Ca2+ prior to WDXRF analysis because of their high analytical sensitivity. The cation was added in fluoride solutions to form precipitate (AlF3 and/or CaF2) and then the solution was filtered through Whatman filter. After drying at 60 °C for 5 min, the filter was coated with X-ray film and directly analyzed using WDXRF spectrometry. Consequently, we analyzed the cation on filter and subsequently fluorine concentration was calculated inversely based on chemical form of precipitate. This method can improve the analytical sensitivity of WDXRF technique for fluorine analysis and be applicable to various elements that can make precipitate.",

            "abstract": "Two genes necessary for microbial production of the neurotoxin methylmercury have been identified; hgcA encoding a corrinoid methyltransferase and hgcB, a ferredoxin-like protein. To date, all microbes possessing orthologs of these genes that have been tested are capable of methylating mercury; whereas, organisms lacking hgcA and hgcB are not. Also of interest is the observation that confirmed mercury-methylating microbes are all considered anaerobes although not members of a specific phylogenetic group. They are found scattered in the genomes of methanogens, Firmicutes, and Deltaproteobacteria. Methylation has not been demonstrated to provide protection of the microbes to mercury exposure. To determine the source of evolutionary pressure for acquisition and maintenance of these genes, we are seeking to understand whether there is a second function of the proteins. We are seeking evidence for the metabolic source(s) of the methyl group and for competing reactions. We have found that deletion of the metH gene encoding a tetrahydrofolate methyltransferase in Desulfovibrio sp. ND132 decreases the mercury methylation capacity by ca. 95%, consistent with an interpretation that this enzyme is involved in the pathway for the methyl group for HgcA. In addition, the corrinoid present in HgcA and the MetH of ND132 is strictly dependent on nicotinate nucleotide:5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole phosphoribosyltransferase encoded by the cobT gene, linking methionine biosynthesis with mercury methylation at a second level. Additional methyl transferases have not been found to be necessary for this function. While earlier evidence was provided for an involvement of the CO dehydrogenase/acetylCoA synthase, this enzyme is not universally present in methylating strains unlike the pathway for methionine synthesis.",

            "abstract": "In alpine ecosystems where temperature increases associated with anthropogenic climate change are likely to be amplified, the flowering phenology of plants may be particularly sensitive to changes in environmental signals. For example, earlier snowmelt and higher temperature have been found to be important factors driving plant emergence and onset of flowering. However, few studies have examined the interactive role of soil moisture in response to warming. Using infrared heating to actively warm plots crossed with manual watering over the growing season in a moist alpine meadow at Niwot Ridge, Colorado, our preliminary results indicate that community-level phenology (length of flowering time across all species) was contracted with heating but was unaffected by watering. At the species level, additional water extended the length of the flowering season by one week for almost half (43%) of species. Heating, which raised plant and surface soil temperatures (+1.5 C) advanced snowmelt by ~7.6 days days and reduced soil moisture by ~2%, advanced flowering phenology for 86% of species. The response of flowering phenology to combined heating and watering was predominantly a heating effect. However, watering did appear to mitigate advances in end of flowering for 22% of species. The length of flowering season, for some species, appears to be tied, in part, to moisture availability as alleviating ambient soil moisture stress delayed phenology in unheated plots. Therefore, we conclude that both temperature and moisture appear to be important factors driving flowering phenology in this alpine ecosystem. The relationship between flowering phenology and species- or community-level productivity is not well established, but heating advanced community peak productivity by 5.4 days, and also reduced peak productivity unless additional water was provided, indicating some consistency between drivers of productivity and drivers of flowering phenology.",

However, only few studies have specifically examined the effects of spatial patterns of land covers and urban structure.\nTo examine how much the local climate is affected by the spatial pattern in highly urbanized city, we investigated the correlation between land surface temperature and spatial patterns of land covers. In the analysis of correlation, we categorized urban structure to four different land uses: Apartment residential area, low rise residential area, industrial area and central business district. Through this study, we aims to examine the types of residential structure and land cover pattern for reducing urban heat island and sustainable development. Based on land surface temperature, we investigated the phenomenon of urban heat island through using the data of remote sensing. This study focused on Daegu in Korea. This city, one of the hottest city in Korea has basin form. We used high-resolution land cover data and land surface temperature by using Landsat8 satellite image to examine 100 randomly selected sample sites of 884.15km2\n (1)In each land use, we quantified several landscape-levels and class-level landscape metrics for the sample study sites. (2)In addition, we measured the land surface temperature in 3 year hot summer seasons (July to September). Then, we investigated the pattern of land surface temperature for each land use through Ecognition package. (3)We deducted the Pearson correlation coefficients between land surface temperature and each landscape metrics. (4)We analyzed the variance among the four land uses. (5)Using linear regression, we determined land surface temperature model for each land use. (6)Through this analysis, we aims to examine the best pattern of land cover and artificial structure for reducing urban heat island effect in highly urbanized city.\nThe results of linear regression showed that proportional land cover of grass, tree, water and impervious surfaces well explained the temperature in apartment residential areas. In contrast, the changes in the pattern of water, grass, tree and impervious surfaces were the best to determine the temperature in low rise residential area, central business district and industrial area.",

            "abstract": "Quantification of spatial coverage of snow and its temporal decline throughout the snowmelt season is an important input for snowmelt runoff models in the prediction of runoff and simulation of streamflow. Several remote sensing methods of snow cover mapping exist today with differing spatial and temporal resolutions that can be used in determining the progressive reduction of snow cover during snowmelt. The Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensor has provided global coverage with daily temporal resolution and a spatial resolution on the order of 1 km2 since the year 2000. Several challenges hinder the development and routine use of MODIS snow covered area products, which include cloud and forest obscuration of snow-covered surfaces. Furthermore, the relatively recent launch of the MODIS sensor prevents its direct use in historical or future (e.g., climate change scenario) studies. Based on numerous observations in the literature that snowmelt occurs in a repeating spatial pattern, albeit shifted and/or accelerated or decelerated in time, from one year to the next, a method is presented that makes use of remotely sensed MODIS snow, land and cloud data and concurrent ground-based Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) data to construct a single, inter-annually applicable and temporally dimensionless snow depletion curve and a corresponding snow depletion map. MODIS Cloud data and ground-based SNOTEL snowfall data during the snowmelt season are used together with the inter-annual snowmelt curve/map to generate within-year snowmelt curves that account for the impact of additional melt-season snowfall. The method is successfully applied to the 9000 km2 Upper Snake River Basin in Wyoming, USA as a test case. The method may be used with historical SNOTEL data to reconstruct snow depletion curves or maps for base periods preceding the availability of current satellite remote sensing, and with synthesized weather datasets for future periods associated with altered climate scenarios; the method may also be used in any current snowmelt season as model input to forecast snowmelt and improve streamflow forecasts.",

The science goal of this mission is to “explore Europa to investigate its habitability”. One of the primary instruments in the selected scientific payload is a multi-frequency, multi-channel ice penetrating radar system. The “Radar for Europa Assessment and Sounding: Ocean to Near-surface (REASON)” will play a critical role in achieving the mission’s habitability driven science objectives, which include characterizing the distribution of any shallow subsurface water, searching for an ice-ocean interface and evaluating a spectrum of ice-ocean-atmosphere exchange hypotheses. The development of successful measurement and data interpretation techniques for exploring Europa will need to leverage knowledge of analogous terrestrial environments and processes. Towards this end, we will discuss a range of terrestrial radioglaciological analogs for hypothesized physical, chemical, and biological processes on Europa and present airborne data collected with the University of Texas dual-frequency radar system over a variety of terrestrial targets. These targets include water filled fractures, brine rich ice, water lenses, accreted marine ice, and ice surfaces with roughness ranging from firn to crevasse fields and will provide context for understanding and optimizing the observable signature of these processes in future radar data collected at Europa.",

In order to develop the model, hydrostatic mapping function, vertical scale height, and vertical TEC(Total Electron Contents) are used for calculations. The electron density and GPS data with hydrostatic mapping function give the vertical TEC and after some algebra using exponential model of density profile give the vertical scale height of ionosphere. The scale height have about 10^2~10^3 km order of magnitude so it can be used exponential model again since the altitude of CHAMP. Therefore, apply the scale height to exponoential model we can get the topside electron density profile. The result of the density profile model can be compared with other satellite data as STSAT-1, ROCSAT, DMSP which is measured the electron density in similar Local Time, Latitude, Longitude but above the CHAMP.

            "abstract": "The production of sulfide in a petroleum reservoir by anaerobic sulfate reducing microorganisms (SRM) is environmentally, industrially, and epidemiologically hazardous. More knowledge is needed about the anaerobic respiration pathway of SRM in petroleum, and whether the activity of SRM could be effectively inhibited using nitrate or perchlorate treatments. In order to understand the molecular transformations and metabolic fingerprints of SRM in petroleum reservoirs, and how they are altered by nitrate or perchlorate treatments, the Coates and Goldstein Laboratories at UC-Berkeley have run controlled column incubation studies of petroleum from an oil reservoir. By using two dimensional gas chromatography (GCxGC) with high resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometry coupled to vacuum ultraviolet radiation at the Advanced Light Source (ALS) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), detailed chemical characterizations of hydrocarbons from approximately C9-C30 have been completed, separating the complete oil sample by number of carbon atoms and chemical classes (including normal alkanes, branched alkanes, number of alkyl rings, and number of aromatic rings) corresponding to petroleum transformations in sulfate, nitrate, and perchlorate reducing environments. Results demonstrate that the anaerobic pathway of SRM preferentially involves the transformation of heavier polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and that a large number of products are created that contain either two or four oxygen atoms, suggesting fumarate additions initialize the anaerobic process.",

            "abstract": "The Late Cretaceous Mt. Givens pluton (central Sierra Nevada batholith, CA) is noteworthy for its large size (≈1400 km2) and relative compositional and textural homogeneity. It has been proposed as a plutonic analog for \"monotonous intermediate\" ignimbrites. The pluton is characterized by a 30 km wide ellipse shaped northern lobe that connects with a long mass about 15 km wide and extending 50 km SE. The northern lobe was constructed over 7 m.y. (from 98 to 91 Ma) with progressively younger ages toward the interior. This inward younging is accompanied by transitions to more felsic compositions and from equigranular to K-spar porphyritic textures. The large elongated mass extending to the SE (ca. 95-91 Ma) is more homogeneous, mostly equigranular granodiorite with subordinate K-spar-phyric granodiorite. Small diorite intrusions (10's to 100's m2) are also present and locally mingle and hybridize with the host granodiorite. Unlike other Late Cretaceous zoned intrusions (the Sierra Crest intrusions), the equigranular, and K-spar porphyritic phases of the Givens have similar trace element characteristics. All zircons have high Ti-in-zircon model temperatures (850-1000 °C), pronounced negative Eu anomalies, and curved MREE and HREE patterns. These characteristics indicate that zircon grew early and that initial magmas were likely undersaturated in zircon. Significant within sample variations in δ18O (up to 1.5‰) and eHf (up to 8 units) require mixing of isotopically distinct magmas in the Givens magma system after they had begun crystallizing zircon, but well before solidification. O and Hf isotopic variation within the granodiorites shows distinct geographic variation, with higher δ18O and more negative eHf values along the western margin of the pluton. This trend is consistent with earlier work suggesting that the Givens intruded across the Panthalassan-North American lithospheric boundary.",

The long-term wind velocity data at Poker Flat has been analyzed for 10 years of 1999 – 2008 to understand the coupling processes between mesospheric gravity waves and tidal waves in more detail. Climatological 1-day composite plots of semidiurnal components of zonal wind and GW-KE showed that the maximum of GW-KE occurs at Poker Flat when zonal wind is westward in winter. It was confirmed that the phases between semidiurnal components of zonal wind and GW-KE are locked for more than 10 days in several years. The present study focuses on the phase loch events and examines the modulation of background wind including tides due to gravity wave drags under an assumption that gravity waves dissipate and/or break when the GW-KE is large.\nAs with previous studies (AGU2014, IUGG2015), observed wind velocities having the 1~4 hour period components are analyzed as short-period gravity waves and those having harmonic components with periods of 24, 12, and 8 hours are calculated every 30 minutes. The amplitude modulations of 12 hour components of zonal wind and GW-KE show that the time derivative of zonal wind is negative after the GW-KE has large amplitude during the phase lock events in winter of 1999, 2000, and 2004. We plan to discuss more detail of underlying the physical processes, focusing on the local modulation of tidal waves associated with gravity wave drags using not only observation data but also reanalysis and modeling data.",

            "abstract": "The existence of multiple magma reservoirs beneath Kı̄lauea’s summit area is well known, but in May 2015, we had the unique opportunity to observe an instance of rapid magma exchange between reservoirs.\nThe series of events began on April 22, with rapid inflation of the shallow (~1.5 km below the surface) reservoir near Halema‘uma‘u (HMM) Crater in Kı̄lauea Caldera. Inflation continued, at an exponentially decaying rate, for more than a week, while the lava lake within the vent in HMM rose about 40 m, overtopping its rim and spilling onto the crater floor. Inflation was accompanied by elevated seismicity in the caldera and especially in the upper East Rift Zone (UERZ). For a little more than a week after deformation rates slowed, the lava lake put on a spectacular show for hordes of appreciative onlookers, while intense seismicity kept Hawaiian Volcano Observatory staff on alert. On May 11, borehole tiltmeters began recording rapid deflation of the HMM reservoir, as lake level began to drop and earthquakes in the south caldera increased in rate and magnitude. Within a day, inflation in the south caldera was clear from tilt, GPS and InSAR data. The visual pattern of deformation and simple inverse modeling are consistent with the south caldera magma reservoir—a complex feature often imaged in the past, especially by leveling and InSAR—as the main source of this deformation. Inflation in the south caldera proceeded at an exponentially increasing rate for about 5 days. During this time, the lava lake level continued to drop to about 20 m below pre-April 22 levels, and seismicity in the UERZ waned. Our preliminary modeling suggests that the volume lost from the HMM reservoir and lava lake is comparable to that gained in the south caldera.\nThis event provides a rare glimpse of rapid magma transfer between two subcaldera magma storage bodies, raising new questions about how these reservoirs are connected and offering the potential to further elucidate the geometry of Kilauea’s summit magma storage system.",

Despite fine-grain sizes and low K contents, most samples yield high quality ages (either simple plateaus or spectra indicative of modest recoil ± low T argon loss) with estimated uncertainties of ±0.1 to 0.2 Ma. Ages decrease monotonically westward in the eastern half of transect from 12.1 to 10.0 Ma over an 18 km distance, in excellent agreement with the estimated half spreading rate of 0.9 cm/yr. In contrast, the western 15 km of the transect (and ~ 1 km of “apparent” vertical succession), including lavas below, above and within the Breiddalur volcano shows no systematic westward younging - all lavas in this region range from 9.1 to 9.8 Ma. Ages from diabase dikes similarly range from 9.1 to 9.8 Ma, except one distinctly younger at 7.8 Ma.\nThe simplest interpretation of the new age determinations is that up until ~9 Ma, a ≥15 km-wide rift zone/plate boundary was situated in the eastern half of the transect. The entire rift zone (including Breiddalur volcano) was then accreted to the Eurasian plate during a westward rift jump of ≥ 15 km. These types of minor jumps in the plate boundary and accretion of entire rift zones to one plate or the other may help explain the “excess width” of Iceland. Also, the data raise questions about the strict applicability of the Palmeson (1973) model, as in this case, a paleo rift zone is not reflected by a dip reversal, and “proximal” or within rift volcanic and plutonic rocks are well exposed at the present surface and are not buried by younger flows as the spreading center moves away.",

            "abstract": "The existence and importance of peroxyformic acid (PFA) in the atmosphere has been under controversy. We present here, for the first time, the observation data for PFA from four field measurements carried out in China. These data provided powerful evidence that PFA can stay in the atmosphere, typically in dozens of pptv level. The relationship between PFA and other detected peroxides was examined. The results showed that PFA had a strong positive correlation with its homolog, peroxyacetic acid, due to their similar sources and sinks. Through an evaluation of PFA production and removal rates, we proposed that the reactions between peroxyformyl radical (HC(O)O2) and formaldehyde or the hydroperoxyl radical (HO2) were likely to be the major source and degradation into formic acid (FA) was likely to be the major sink for PFA. Based on a box model evaluation, we proposed that the HC(O)O2 and PFA chemistry was a major source for FA under low NOx conditions. Furthermore, it is found that the impact of the HC(O)O2 and PFA chemistry on radical cycling was dependent on the yield of HC(O)O2 radical from HC(O) + O2 reaction. When this yield exceeded 50%, the HC(O)O2 and PFA chemistry should not be neglected for calculating the radical budget. To make clear the exact importance of HC(O)O2 and PFA chemistry in the atmosphere, further kinetic, field and modeling studies are required.",

            "abstract": "The Totten Glacier is the largest ice sheet outlet in East Antarctica, draining 3.5 meters of eustatic sea level potential from the Aurora Subglacial Basin (ASB) into the Sabrina Coast. Recent work has shown that the ASB has drained and filled many times since largescale glaciation began including evidence that it collapsed during the Pliocene. Steady thinning rates observed near Totten Glacier’s grounding line since the beginning of the satellite altimetry record are the largest in East Antarctica\nand the nature of the thinning suggests that it is driven by enhanced basal melting due to ocean processes\n. Warm Modified Circumpolar Deep Water (MCDW), which has been linked to glacier retreat in West Antarctica, has been observed in summer and winter on the Sabrina Coast continental shelf in the 400-500 m depth range. Using airborne geophysical data acquired over multiple years we delineate seafloor valleys connecting the inner continental shelf to the cavity beneath Totten Glacier that cut through a large sill centered along the ice shelf calving front. The sill shallows to depths of about 300 mbsl and was likely a grounding line pinning point during Holocene retreat, however, the two largest seafloor valleys are deeper than the observed range of thermocline depths. The deeper of the two valleys, a 4 km-wide trough, connects to the ice shelf cavity through an area of the coastline that was previously believed to be grounded but that our analysis demonstrates is floating, revealing a second, deeper entryway to ice shelf cavity. The previous coastline was charted using satellite-based mapping techniques that infer subglacial properties based on surface expression and behavior; the new geophysical analysis techniques we use enable inferences of subglacial characteristics using direct observations of the ice-water interface. The results indicate that Totten Glacier and, by extension, the Aurora Subglacial Basin are vulnerable to MCDW that has been observed on the nearby Sabrina Coast continental shelf by multiple shipborne expeditions beginning in 1996.",

            "abstract": "Three years of continuous and discrete sediment and water quality data, from four forested, mountain, headwater catchments in the Sierra Nevada, is used to identify water sources, determine the importance of sub-surface flow pathways, detect any changes in source waters due to seasonal variation or drought, and link flow pathways with observed patterns of in-channel sediment movement within the study watersheds. Patterns in stream chemistry and turbidity point to infiltration as the dominant flow pathway within these catchments. Data support a flow pathway conceptual model in which precipitation water infiltrates into the shallow or deeper subsurface, increasing the hydraulic head of the water table and pushing pre-event water into the stream ahead of event water. Study catchments contain perennial streams and are characterized by a Mediterranean climate with a distinct wet and dry season. Sites are located in the rain-snow transition zone with snow making up 40 to 60 percent of average annual precipitation. Barring human disturbances such as logging/grazing (compaction) or fire (hydrophobicity), catchment soils have high infiltration capacities. Springs and seeps maintain baseflow during the summer low-flow season, and shifting chemical signals within the streams indicate the increased importance of sub-surface water sources during drought years. End-member mixing analysis was conducted to identify possible water end members. Turbidity hysteresis patterns described by previous studies show in-channel sources are dominant for discharge events year round, and there is no difference in fine sediment delivery to streams with or without a soil protecting layer of snow on the land surface. The dominance of sub-surface water sources and evidence for infiltration flow fits with turbidity data, as little material is reaching the stream due to erosive overland flow. An understanding of flow pathways provides a foundation for sustainable land use management in forested, mountain systems.",

The aim of this study is to better understand the net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in annual and perennial cropping systems used in dairy production to benefit greenhouse gas emission model developments and the life cycle analysis of dairy production. The study was conducted on two 4-ha plots where one plot was a 5-year old hayfield and the other plot was planted in a continuous cycle corn. All plots were continuously monitored using the flux-gradient method deployed with a tunable diode laser trace gas analyzer and sonic anemometers. All plots received dairy manure as fertilizer applied according to common practice. The cumulative NEE for the three years of the study was -873.15 g C m-2 for corn and -409.36 g C m-2 for hay. Differences in respiration between the two cropping systems was found to be the larger factor compared to differences in gross ecosystem production (GEP) that resulted in the contrasting cumulative NEE where cumulative respiration for the three years for hay was 3094.23 g C m-2 as opposed to 2078.11 g C m-2 for corn.

            "abstract": "For nanoparticle transport through soil, the pore-scale (i.e., tens to hundreds of grains and pores) is a crucial intermediate scale which links nanoparticle-surface interactions with field-scale transport behaviour. However, very little information exists on how nanoparticles behave within real three-dimensional pore spaces. As a result, pore-scale processes are poorly characterized for nanoparticle systems and, subsequently, continuum-scale transport models struggle to describe commonly observed ‘anomalous’ behaviour such as extended tailing.\nThis knowledge gap is due to two primary factors: an inability to experimentally observe nanoparticles within real pore spaces, and the computationally expensive models required to simulate nanoparticle movement. However, due to recent advances in Synchrotron X-Ray Computed Microtomography (SXCMT), it is now possible to quantify in-situ pore-scale nanoparticle concentrations during transport through real 3-dimensional porous media [1]. Employing this SXCMT quantification method to examine real nanoparticle/soil transport experiments has yielded new insights into the pore-scale processes governing nanoparticle transport. By coupling SXCMT nanoparticle quantification method with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations we are able to construct a better picture of how nanoparticles flow through real pore spaces.\nThis talk presents SXCMT/CFD analyses of three silver nanoparticle transport experiments. Silver nanoparticles were flushed through three different sands to characterize the influence of grain distribution and retention rates on pore-scale flow and transport processes. These CFD/SXCMT analyses illuminate how processes such as temporary hydraulic retention govern nanoparticle transport. In addition, the observed distributions of pore water velocities and nanoparticle mass flow rates challenge the standard conceptual model of nanoparticle transport, suggesting that pore-scale processes require explicit consideration in order to fully describe nanoparticle ransport.

            "abstract": "The daily quest of a geoscientist is to seek reliable information about Earth: its history, nature, materials, processes, resources and hazards. In science, reliable information is based on reproducible observations (scientific facts), and includes an estimate of uncertainty. All geoscientists share that basic quest, regardless of whether they wear a lab coat, business suit or field boots at work. All geoscientists also share a responsibility to serve society – the same society that invested in science and education, and thereby enabled the development of geoscience as well as the commercial ventures that utilize geoscience. What does society expect in return for that investment? It just wants the truth, along with a clear indication of the uncertainty. Society needs reliable geoscience information and expertise so that it can make good, informed decisions about resources, risk and our shared environment. Unreliable geoscience information, if represented as valid, might do irreparable harm.\nThe authors represent the International Association for Promoting Geoethics (IAPG, www.geoethics.org), which seeks to develop and advance geoethics worldwide. Geoethics is based on the moral imperative for geoscientists to use our knowledge and expertise about Earth for the benefit of humankind. Informed by the geologic record of the intertwined history of life and our planet, that moral imperative extends beyond our time, our culture, and even our species. Ultimately, Earth is a small lifeboat in space. Geoscientists form the essential interface between our human society and Earth, and we must act for the health and benefit of both. Einstein wrote, “Truth is what stands the test of experience.” If geoscientists are unwilling to engage the public and to speak the truth about Earth, who else will assume that role? The challenges we face together – resources, energy, potable water, soil conservation, sea-level rise – are too serious for geoscientists to be mute. Voices motivated by narrow self-interest might fill the void left by our indifference. Our children’s children’s children will expect us to have done our job in our time: to be honest, to be good scientists, to provide reliable expertise about Earth, to help reorient society toward sustainability, and to pass on a healthy ecosystem to those who follow.",

            "abstract": "\"Is the mantle transition zone (MTZ) a major water reservoir of the Earth?\" To answer this question, we have inferred the amount of water reserved in a “normal” oceanic MTZ beneath the northwestern Pacific from electrical and seismic structures. The field experiment was conducted with arrays of ocean bottom electromagnetometers and broadband ocean bottom seismometers in 2010-2014. Our innovative ocean bottom instruments, Earth’s electric field observation system was used to measure time-variations of electric field with high S/N ratio at periods of >105s where the electromagnetic field is sensitive to the MTZ, and broadband ocean bottom seismometer of the next generation was used to record the earth motion with as low noise level as land stations.\nElectromagnetic data were first analyzed to derive MT and GDS response functions at periods of >105s. Then, model responses were numerically obtained from electrical conductivity models overlain by earth-surface land-ocean heterogeneity. Comparison between the observation and the prediction suggested that a MTZ electrical conductivity structure beneath the northwestern Pacific is similar to an averaged 1-D structure of the north Pacific [Shimizu et al., 2010].\nSeismic data were analyzed through a P-wave receiver function method. Depths of 410 and 660 km discontinuities and thickness of the MTZ were variable by areas. The MTZ thickness beneath the southern part of Area A (northwest to the Shatsky Rise), 270 km, is larger a global average of 243 km [e.g., Flanagan & Shearer, 1989], while those beneath Area B (southeast to the Shatsky Rise), 241 and 248 km, are comparable to the average.\nThe water content and a thermal structure in the MTZ beneath Area A were inferred from the data. First, a temperature perturbation was determined to -70~-150 K from the thickness perturbation of the MTZ. Then, a thermal structure for Area A is assumed to a structure [Katsura et al., 2010] with the temperature perturbation. Electrical conductivity models with variable water contents for the MTZ were constructed based on the thermal structure and conductivity measurements of hydrous wadsleyite and rigwoodite in laboratory [e.g., Yoshino & Katsura, 2010]. Comparisons of predictions from these models with the observation suggest that the maximum amount of water in the MTZ beneath Area A is 0.5 wt%.",

Consequently, there is growing interest in developing drought tolerant rice varieties with high yield. We parameterized two photosynthesis models based on light and CO2 response curves for seven different rice genotypes with different drought survival mechanisms: sensitive (Nipponbar, TEJ), resistance (Bengal, TRJ), avoidance by osmotic adjustment (Kaybonnet, TRJ; IRAT177, TRJ; N22, Aus; Vandana, Aus; and O Glabberrima, 316603). All rice genotypes were grown in greenhouse conditions (24 °C ± 3°C air temperature and ~ 600 μmol m-2 s-1 light intensity) with light/dark cycles of 10/14 h in water filled trays simulating flooded conditions. Measurements were conducted on fully grown plants (35 - 60 days old) under simulated flooded and drought conditions. Preliminary results have shown that the drought sensitive genotype, Nipponbare has the lowest photosynthetic carboxylation capacity (Vcmax) and a similar electron transport rate (Jmax) compared to the drought resistant genotype IRAT 177. Mitochondrial respiration (Rd) of all the genotypes were similar while quantum yield of the drought sensitive genotype was greater than that of the drought resistant genotypes. While both drought tolerant and drought sensitive rice genotypes have the same photosynthetic yield, from an irrigation perspective the former would require less ‘drop per grain’. This has enormous economic and management implications on account of dwindling water resources across the world due to drought.",

Pore-plugging by the solid oxidation product MnO2 and limited lateral dispersion of the oxidant are two common problems with existing in-situ chemical oxidation (ISCO) schemes that could be alleviated through the development of a delayed gelation method for oxidant delivery. The objective of the current study was to further develop and optimize slow-release permanganate gel (SRP-G), a solution comprising colloidal silica and KMnO4, as a novel low-cost treatment option for large and dilute TCE plumes in groundwater. Batch tests showed that gelation could be delayed through manipulation of KMnO4 concentration, pH, and silica particle size of the SRP-G solution. In flow-through columns and flow-tanks filled with saturated sands, silica concentration had little effect on the gelation lag stage and release rate, but increasing silica concentration was associated with increasing release duration. When compared to a pure KMnO4 solution, visual observations and [MnO4−] measurements from flow tank tests demonstrated that the SRP-G prolonged the release duration and enhanced lateral spreading of the oxidant.",

            "abstract": "Relativistic electron precipitation events lasting from minutes to hours have been observed by balloon-borne instrumentation since 1996. This collection of observations, including the recent BARREL observations, all occur in the noon to midnight sector. EMIC waves have been suggested as the precipitation mechanism for this type of event [Lorentzen et al., 2000 and Millan et al., 2002]. A recent study by Li et al., [2014] performed a case study which modeled the radiation belt relativistic electron pitch angle diffusion from EMIC waves which showed convincing agreement between the modeled results and the BARREL x-ray observations. A survey of the BARREL REP events suggests this type of precipitation is a very localized phenomena with most events only being observed by a single balloon at a time despite the extensive L-value and local time coverage of observations during the campaign. This result is consistent with the findings of Blum et al., [2013]. Furthermore, the balloon observations show local time energy dependence consistent with the SAMPEX observations reported by Comess et al, [2013]. In this work we address the following questions: based on the REP events observed by balloon-borne instrumentation, are these characteristics true for all identified REP events and does this support EMIC waves as the precipitation mechanism? Due to the localized region of precipitation, do these events represent a significant radiation belt loss process?",

            "abstract": "Biogenically-precipitated magnetite has been found in organisms ranging from Bacteria, single-celled protists, and many of the animal phyla, where its major function is navigation and magnetoreception. To date there is but a single report of biogenic magnetite in plants (essentially, magnetoferritin), and that is in common grass (Festuca species, from Gajdardziska-Josifovska et. al. doi:10.1127/0935-1221/2001/0013/0863). Recent developments in cryopreservation suggest that ~ 1 mT, ~ 10 Hz oscillating magnetic fields can drastically reduce ice nucleation during freezing, promote supercooling, and minimize cellular damage in living tissues (e.g., Kaku et al., doi: 10.1016/j.cryobiol.2012.02.001). Kobayashi & Kirschvink (2014, doi:10.1016/j.cryobiol.2013.12.002) suggest that biogenic magnetite crystals could be the nucleating site for damaging ice crystals, and that they would be driven magneto-mechanically to rotate in those oscillating fields which could inhibit the ice crystal nucleation process. This prompted our investigation into the magnetite content of ordinary fruit and vegetable food products, as knowledge of the natural levels of biogenic magnetite in the human food supply could guide the selection of which foods might work for this type of cryopreservation.\nOur study involved a range of common foods including avocados, bananas, garlic, and apples. Samples were prepared in a clean lab environment kept free of contaminant particles, and subjected to a variety of standard rock-magnetic tests including IRM and ARM acquisition, and the corresponding Af demagnetization, on a standard 2G™ SRM. Results are consistent with moderately interacting single-domain magnetite (see figure), with moderate inter-particle interaction effects. Typical magnetite concentrations in these samples are in the range of .1 to 1 ng/g for room temperature samples, increasing to the range of 1-10 ng/g when measured frozen (to inhibit thermal rotation of small particles and clumps). If these are distributed as fine, single-domain particles they would constitute the largest mineral surface area in the tissues, (aside from amorphous silica phytoliths), and are therefore likely the site of ice crystal nucleation.",

            "abstract": "Why megacrystic textures develop in silicic igneous rocks is still unknown. One hypothesis is that these crystals nucleate early in a magma chamber with a high liquid content. A supportive observation of this hypothesis is areas in plutons with high concentrations of megacrysts suggesting flow sorting. Another group of hypotheses suggest megacrystic textures form during protracted late-stage coarsening in a low-melt, interlocked matrix due to either thermal oscillations from incremental pluton emplacement, or Ostwald ripening. Isotopic analyses of large, euhedral K-feldspar megacrysts from the Cretaceous intrusive suites of the Sierra Nevada batholith (SNB) provide new insight into their origin. Megacrysts from the SNB reach the decimeter scale, are Or rich (85-90%), are perthitic, and host mineral inclusions of nearly all phases in the host rock. In-situ micro-drilling of transects, from core to rim, of the alkali feldspars provides material for Sr and Pb isotopic analyses by thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS). Preliminary 87Sr/86Sr(i)  isotopic data from samples from the Cathedral Peak Granodiorite, of the Tuolumne Intrusive Suite range from 0.706337 to 0.706452 (~1.6εSr) near the cores, whereas a sawtooth pattern with larger variability, 0.706179 to 0.706533 (~5εSr), occurs nears the rims. We interpret these preliminary data to indicate that the late portion of growth (i.e. crystal rim) was dominated by either cannibalism of small K-feldspar crystals with isotopic variability, or by addition of isotopically diverse late components to the magma. By comparing the Sr and Pb isotopic stratigraphy of megacrysts from a variety of rock matrices and different granitoids in the SNB isotopic trends can be evaluated to determine if crystals sizes are dependent on disequilibrium processes or grow at a steady state.",

Carbon flux sensitivity analysis is a method that uses in situ networks to understand how ecosystems respond to changes in climatic variables. Flux towers concurrently observe key ecosystem metabolic processes (e..g. gross primary productivity) and micrometeorological variation, but only over small footprints. Remotely sensed vegetation indices from MODIS offer continuous observations of the vegetated land surface, but are less direct, as they are based on light use efficiency algorithms, and not on the ground observations.\nThe marriage of these two data products offers an opportunity to validate remotely sensed indices with in situ observations and translate information derived from tower sites to globally gridded products. Here we provide correlations between Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI) and MODIS gross primary production with FLUXNET derived estimates of gross primary production, respiration and net ecosystem exchange. We demonstrate remotely sensed vegetation products which have been transformed to gridded estimates of terrestrial biosphere metabolism on a regional-to-global scale.\nWe demonstrate anomalies in gross primary production, respiration, and net ecosystem exchange as predicted by both MODIS-carbon flux sensitivities and meteorological driver-carbon flux sensitivities. We apply these sensitivities to recent extreme climatic events and demonstrate both our ability to capture changes in biosphere metabolism, and differences in the calculation of carbon flux anomalies based on method. The quantification of co-variation in these two methods of observation is important as it informs both how remotely sensed vegetation indices are correlated with on the ground tower observations, and with what certainty we can expand these observations and relationships.",

            "abstract": "Daily time series of evapotranspiration and surface conductance to water vapor were estimated using the ETRHEQ method (Evapotranspiration from Relative Humidity at Equilibrium). ETRHEQ has been previously compared with ameriflux site-level measurements of ET at daily and seasonal time scales, with watershed water balance estimates, and with various benchmark ET data sets. The ETRHEQ method uses meteorological data collected at common weather stations and estimates the surface conductance by minimizing the vertical variance of the calculated relative humidity profile averaged over the day. The key advantage of the ETRHEQ method is that it does not require knowledge of the surface state (soil moisture, stomatal conductance, leaf are index, etc.) or site-specific calibration. The daily estimates of conductance from 229 weather stations for 53 years were analyzed for dependence on environmental variables known to impact stomatal conductance and soil diffusivity: surface temperature, surface vapor pressure deficit, solar radiation, antecedent precipitation (as a surrogate for soil moisture), and a seasonal vegetation greenness index. At each site the summertime (JJAS) conductance values estimated from ETRHEQ were fitted to a multiplicate Jarvis-type stress model. Functional dependence was not proscribed, but instead fitted using flexible piecewise-linear splines. The resulting stress functions reproduce the time series of conductance across a wide range of ecosystems and climates. The VPD stress term resembles that proposed by Oren (i.e., 1-m*log(VPD) ), with VPD measured in kilopascals. The equivalent value of m derived from our spline-fits at each station varied over a remarkably small range of 0.58 to 0.62, in agreement with Oren’s original analysis based on leaf and tree-level measurements.",

            "abstract": "Urban land use occupies a small but critical proportion of global land area for the carbon cycle, and in the coming decades, urban land area is expected to nearly double. Conversion of natural land cover to urban land cover imposes myriad ecological effects, including increased land surface and air temperatures via the urban heat island effect. In this study, we characterize the seasonal and spatial characteristics of the urban heat island over Boston, MA and estimate its consequences on biogenic carbon fluxes with a remote sensing-based model.\nUsing a 12-year time series of emissivity- and atmospherically-corrected land surface temperatures from Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery, we find a high degree of spatial heterogeneity and consistent seasonal patterns in the thermal properties of Boston, controlled mainly by variations in vegetative cover. Field measurements of surface air temperature across an urbanization gradient show season- and vegetation-dependent patterns consistent with those observed in the Landsat data. With a fused data set that combines surface air temperature, MODIS, and Landsat observations, we modify and run the Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (VPRM) to explore 1) how elevated temperatures affect diurnal and seasonal patterns of hourly urban biogenic carbon fluxes in Massachusetts in 2013 and 2014 and 2) to what extent these fluxes follow spatial patterns found in the urban heat island. Model modifications simulate the ecological effects of urbanization, including empirical adjustments to reanalysis-driven air temperatures (up to 5 K) and ecosystem respiration reduced by impervious surface area. Model results reveal spatio-temporal patterns consistent with strong land use and vegetation cover controls on biogenic carbon fluxes, with non-trivial biogenic annual net ecosystem exchange occurring in urban and suburban areas (up to -2.5 MgC/ha/yr). We specifically consider the feedbacks between Boston’s urban heat island and landscape phenology and explore the role of phenology in biogenic carbon uptake and release in urban areas. While most remote sensing-based models assume zero biogenic fluxes over urban, suburban, and exurban areas, our results suggest that live biomass in urban areas plays an important role in regional carbon budgets and should not be ignored.",

            "abstract": "It is now widely recognized that climate change is affecting various sectors of the world. Climate change impact on one sector may spread out to other sectors including those seemingly remote, which we call “interconnections of climate risks”. While a number of climate risks have been identified in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), there has been no attempt to explore their interconnections comprehensively. Here we present a first and most exhaustive visualization of climate risks drawn based on a systematic literature survey. Our risk network diagrams depict that changes in the climate system impact natural capitals (terrestrial water, crop, and agricultural land) as well as social infrastructures, influencing the socio-economic system and ultimately our access to food, water, and energy. Our findings suggest the importance of incorporating climate risk interconnections into impact and vulnerability assessments and call into question the widely used damage function approaches, which address a limited number of climate change impacts in isolation. Furthermore, the diagram is useful to educate decision makers, stakeholders, and general public about cascading risks that can be triggered by the climate change.\nSocio-economic activities today are becoming increasingly more inter-dependent because of the rapid technological progress, urbanization, and the globalization among others. Equally complex is the ecosystem that is susceptible to climate change, which comprises interwoven processes affecting one another. In the context of climate change, a number of climate risks have been identified and classified according to regions and sectors. These reports, however, did not fully address the inter-relations among risks because of the complexity inherent in this issue. Climate risks may ripple through sectors in the present inter-dependent world, posing a challenge ahead of us to maintain the resilience of the system. It is therefore imperative to improve our understanding on how climate change may induce a chain of impacts. Our study is a first step toward this goal by mapping out climate risks and their cause-effect relationships based on current literature.",

In an attempt to better understand its evolution, we designed simplified thermomechanical models to simulate extension of a double-wedge-shaped orogen with highlands on both sides and lowland in the center to mimic the geological condition of the proto-SCS. We imposed constant extension rates on both sides and Gaussian-shaped thermal impulse in the center. We also varied the strength of lower crust but did not explicitly incorporate mid-ocean ridges and searfloor spreading mechanisms. We currently used symmetric double-wedge, but further tests are planed for asymmetric double-wedges. Our preliminary results show that the models produced many structures that resemble those of SCS, such as 1) a series of domino or conjugate faults sitting above a subsurface detachment (or décollement), 2) exhumed domes of middle-lower crust, 3) extreme thinning of both upper crust and lower crust, and 4) propagation of extension towards NW and SE margins. Our models suggest that superimposition of these modeled characteristics produced during several phases of extension of the SCS that may be due to thermal impulsion, magmatic events, and subduction related relaxation potentially produces high resemblance of the SCS.",

To that end, the U.S. Global Change Research Program’s sustained National Climate Assessment process includes a focus on engaging users through an inclusive, broad-based, and ongoing process. Such a process provides opportunities for scientific experts and decision makers to share knowledge about the climate-related issues, impacts, and potential response actions that are most important in a particular region or sector. Such a process is also highly transparent in order to produce results that are credible, salient, and legitimate for both scientists and decision makers, ultimately making the results extremely useful.\nTo implement these principles, USGCRP implements a broad-based engagement strategy that invites participation from users and stakeholder communities and considers methods for communicating with potential users at every step. The strategy elicits contributions to help shape the framing of the assessment process and products, improve the transparency of the process, and increase the utility of the final information. Specific user inputs are gathered through workshops, public comment opportunities, town hall meetings, presentations, requests for information, submitted documents, and open meetings. Further, a network of contributors self-organizes around topics of interest to extend assessment activities to a wider range of user groups. Here, we describe the outcomes of these innovations in assessment engagement and identify clear successes, notable surprises, future evaluation needs, and areas for new ideas.",

            "abstract": "The MagnetoTelluric (MT) method is widely used in geophysical exploration, especially in geothermal exploration. The extensive frequency range allows mapping the resistivity structure to greater depths than typically achieved using controlled sources (on the order of 10 km’s). This is advantageous in identifying structures of interest, such as those related to hydrothermal alterations in a geothermal system and the heat source of the system. To obtain information about subsurface resistivity structures from MT data, an inversion modelling is commonly performed. The goal of an inversion is to recover a resistivity model that explains the data (within a degree of accuracy), given sets of constraints on the model. An attention to detail, often through an iterative process, is required during the inversion. A workflow that is transparent and repeatable is important for addressing the complexities encountered in an inversion and make the iterative process more effective.\nIn this presentation, we will show examples of a workflow for an inversion of MT data from the Krysuvik geothermal area in Iceland. The workflow is implemented as a Python script, where the SimPEG framework (http://simpeg.xyz) is used to implement an open-source code base to work with MT data . The SimPEG framework uses finite-volume discretizations for structured and semi-structured meshes and has built-in routines for optimization and regularization. By structuring and writing the simpegMT code in compliance with the modular, object-oriented framework of SimPEG, full compatibility is achieved and its functions can be leveraged directly. Further, the structure facilitates interoperability with other problem-types, streamlines testing and fosters cooperations between developers and users of the code.\nWe will step through the workflow, where varying complexity leads to a recovery of 3D models of different detail. We show how we guide steps in the workflow based on the preceding results, iteratively building our knowledge and incorporating it to converge to an improved resulting resistivity model. We will discuss the issues that arise and choices made in the workflow, interpret our resistivity model in terms of relevant structures and visualize along with other data sources from the area.",

For the best use of the microwave-sensed low-level dynamics, this study develops new objective detection techniques of TC genesis with machine learning approaches from WindSat data. Dynamical and hydrological factors related to TC genesis have been defined from 325 developing and 974 non-developing Windsat wind/precipitation images for 2005-2009. In particular, degrees of symmetry in the ocean-surface circulation are quantified from circular variances (CVs), to measure a spread of wind angles, and the degree of organization of strong wind (rainfall) is newly defined using a Spatial Pattern Analysis Program for Categrical Maps called as FRGSTATS. Also, system strength and convective vigor are represented by the averages of wind speeds and rainfall, respectively.\nApplying the invented WindSat-derived predictors (2005-2007) to two machine learning approaches, decision tree (DT) and random forecast (RF), constructs objective detection techniques of TC genesis. Both results commonly show the symmetry and the intensity of ocean surface circulation are the most important than other predictors. Despite of inherent sampling issues of the polar orbiting satellite, hindcast validation with DT (RF) for 2008-2009 years show that a positive rate of detection is approximately 95.3% (83.7%) with false alarm rate 28.4% (11.1%). Accordingly, this study emphasizes new capability of the microwave-sensed dynamical information for objective detection of TC genesis.",

            "abstract": "Foreland basin deposits in the South Central Pyrenees provide a natural laboratory for investigating the interplay between tectonic and sedimentary processes. Early Cenozoic foreland basin deposits preserve the record of hinterland erosion throughout Pyrenean collision. This study uses high-resolution detrital zircon (DZ) geo- and thermochronometry to investigate the progressive evolution of sediment provenance and paleodrainages through the stratigraphic record and across different depozones of the foreland basin. The Ainsa Basin in the South Central Pyrenees contains a secession of Eocene turbidite packages sampled in detail to examine the transition from fluvial to shelf-slope to deep marine environments. New data are congruent with previous DZ studies showing the turbidites are mixed from two main sources, Hercynian plutons from the Pyrenean axial zone and Cadomian/Caledonian plutonic and metamorphic rocks exposed in the Eastern Pyrenees. Although many of the turbidite packages yield similar DZ U-Pb signatures, detailed DZ U-Pb-He double dating resolves subtle differences between stratigraphic packages. These differences likely reflect varying degrees of mixing of multiple sources, or autogenic sorting during transport. Some units yield anomalous DZ U-Pb distributions, which potentially indicate an additional source region. Studying these anomalies will better our understanding of processes such as sediment bypass in marine canyons and fluvio-deltaic depozones as well as axial vs transverse paleodrainages. Also these anomalous signals can be traced throughout depozones in the basin and used to refine stratigraphic correlations between different parts of the basin. The data, Interpreted in the context of the structural and stratigraphic framework of the Pyrenean foreland basin, provide insights into processes during sediment delivery, paleodrainage networks, and the interplay between tectonic deformation and basin sedimentation.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture data measured by various techniques has been widely used in unsaturated flow data assimilation, while the effect of vertical measurement depth (or scale) of soil moisture on model prediction and parameter estimation has not been quantitatively investigated. This study adopts the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to assimilate surface soil moisture data of different observation depths into a one-dimensional variably-saturated water flow model, to estimate soil hydraulic parameters and soil moisture profiles. Through a few synthetic experiments, two factors are considered: soil heterogeneity and upper boundary conditions. Results show that as the heterogeneity of soil increases, the affecting depth of surface soil moisture decreases, and the observation with a larger depth is advantageous. For homogenous soil, soil moisture data with a smaller scale leads to better estimation of soil hydraulic parameters and soil moisture profiles. For heterogeneous soil, surface soil moisture exerts less or no influence on deeper layers. It is thus not able to estimate multiple parameters simultaneously by only assimilating surface soil moisture data in heterogeneous soil. It is found that regardless of the measurement scale, the estimated average soil moisture within the measurement scale matches well with the measurements at the corresponding scale. The accuracy of soil moisture profiles retrieval and soil hydraulic parameter estimation also depends on the upper boundary conditions. Flow regimes controlled by upward fluxes are found less successful, as the observed surface data may be no longer useful to infer the hydrologic processes in the deep soil, and, the observation with a larger scale tends to be more useful to reveal the relationship between surface soil moisture and deeper layer soil moisture. Our results show that the soil moisture with smaller depths is more effective to estimate soil moisture and soil hydraulic parameters of surface layer, while the soil moisture with larger depths is more helpful to interpret the correlation between surface soil moisture and deeper layer soil moisture.",

Unfortunately, this increasing popularity has not been matched by the availability of automated codes to estimate underground deformation, since many of them still rely on trial-error subsurface model building strategies. We posit that an efficient algorithm for the volumetric modeling of differential surface displacements should match the availability of current leveling and InSAR data and have developed an algorithm for the joint inversion of ground leveling and dInSAR data in 3D. We assume the ground displacements are originated by a stress free-volume strain distribution in a homogeneous elastic media and determined the displacement field associated to an ensemble of rectangular prisms. This formulation is then used to develop a 3D conjugate gradient inversion code that searches for the three-dimensional distribution of the volumetric strains that predict InSAR and leveling surface displacements simultaneously. The algorithm is regularized applying discontinuos first and zero order Thikonov constraints. For efficiency, the resulting computational code takes advantage of the resulting convolution integral associated to the deformation field and some basic tools for multithreading parallelization. We extensively test our algorithm on leveling and InSAR test and field data of the Northwest of Mexico and compare to some feasible geological scenarios of underground deformation.",

            "abstract": "The mechanism of first order Fermi acceleration of particles interacting with the converging magnetized flows at a reconnection site was introduced recently in an attempt to predict the energy distribution of particles resulting from violent reconnection in galactic microquasars. More careful consideration of this mechanism showed that the spectral index of accelerated particles is related to the total plasma compression within a reconnection region, similar to that in the formulation for diffusive shock acceleration. In the solar context, reconnection regions producing strong compression could be the source of suprathermal “seed particles”. A hard spectrum of such suprathermal particles is believed to be necessary to initiate the particle acceleration process at low Mach number coronal mass ejection shocks close to the Sun where the gradual solar energetic particle events originate. As a first step to investigate the efficiency of Fermi acceleration, we explore the degree of plasma compression that can be achieved at reconnection sites in the solar corona. This work presents a set of 2D two-temperature resistive MHD simulations of the dynamics of several magnetic configurations within a range of lower corona plasma parameters. Energy transport processes in the MHD model include anisotropic thermal conduction for electrons and ions and radiative cooling. Magnetic configurations considered are a Harris current sheet, a force-free current sheet, a flux rope sitting above an arcade of magnetic loops, and two merging flux ropes. We demonstrate that only for some magnetic topologies, corresponding in particular to 3D magnetic nulls, the compression ratio, sufficient for first order Fermi acceleration in the reconnection region, can be achieved. These represent the potential sites in the solar corona where a hard seed particle energetic spectrum could be produced.",

            "abstract": "A wide variety of chemical additives are used as part of the hydraulic fracturing (HyF) process. There is concern that HyF chemicals will be released into the environment and contaminate drinking water, agricultural water, or other water used for beneficial purposes. There is also interest in using produced water (water extracted from the subsurface during oil and gas production) for irrigation and other beneficial purposes, especially in the arid Southwest US. Reuse of produced water is not speculative: produced water can be low in salts and is being used in California for irrigation after minimal treatment. In this study, we identified chemicals that are used for hydraulic fracturing in California and conducted an analysis to determine if those chemicals would be removed by a variety of technically available treatment processes, including oil/water separation, air stripping, a variety of sorption media, advanced oxidation, biological treatment, and a variety of membrane treatment systems. The approach taken was to establish major physiochemical properties for individual chemicals (log Koc, Henry’s constant, biodegradability, etc.), group chemicals by function (e.g corrosion inhibition, biocides), and use those properties to predict the fate of chemical additives in a treatment process. Results from this analysis is interpreted in the context of what is known about existing systems for the treatment of produced water before beneficial reuse, which includes a range of treatment systems from oil/water separators (the most common treatment) to sophisticated treatment trains used for purifying produced water for groundwater recharge. The results show that most HyF chemical additives will not be removed in existing treatment systems, but that more sophisticated treatment trains can be designed to remove additives before beneficial reuse.",

            "abstract": "Landslides and mud flows were occurred in the west part of the Izuoshima Island, Japan on 16 October 2013. The Izuoshima Island is a volcanic island and the land surface is covered by the volcanic ash sediment in 1m depth. Hence, the mud flow with high sediment concentration was formed. The laminar layer is formed in the debris flow from the bed to the fluid surface. On the other hand, the laminar flow is restricted near the bed in the mud flow and the turbulence flow is formed on the laminar flow layer. As a result, the equilibrium slope of the mud flow becomes smaller comparing to the debris flow. In this study, the numerical analysis mud flow model considering the effect of turbulence flow on the equilibrium slope of the mud flow is developed. Subsequently, the model is applied to the mud flow occurred in the Izuoshima Island and discussed the applicability of the model and the flow characteristics of the mud flow. The differences of the horizontal flow areas between the simulated results and the field data are compared and it was found that the outline of the horizontal shape of the flow areas is reproduced well. Furthermore, the horizontal distribution of the erosion and deposition area is reproduced by the numerical analysis well except for the residential area (Kandachi area). Kandachi area is judged as the erosion area by the field observation, but the sediment was deposited in the numerical analysis. It is considered that the 1.5hour heavy rain over 100mm/h after the mud flow makes the discrepancy. The difference of the horizontal distribution of the maximum flow surface elevation between the simulated results and the field data are compared and it was found that the simulated flow depth is overestimated slightly, because of the wider erosion area due to the coarse resolution elevation data. The averaged velocity and the depth of the mud flow was enough large to collapse the houses.",

            "abstract": "The depositional age of moraines can be determined through cosmogenic nuclide exposure dating. These ages are useful in establishing a glacial history of an area and ascribing age constraints to transport processes. Be-10 is the most common nuclide used for exposure dating today, but this method is both expensive and time consuming because it requires analysis by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). He-3 and Ne-21 can be analyzed using noble gas mass spectrometry, which is more cost efficient than AMS and requires less chemical preparation. We collected samples from areas in Moraine Canyon, Antarctica (86.10° S, 157.75° W), which is a dry valley in the Transantarctic Mountains. Dolerite boulders along a transect of recessional moraines were sampled in the typical fashion of using a large piece of the boulder for analysis. Pyroxene minerals have been separated from these samples following the method of Bromley et al. (2014) using hydrofluoric acid. Exposure ages will be calculated from the He-3 concentrations in them. In the Mono Lake area of California, moraines were sampled from Bloody Canyon and McGee Creek sites. Instead of collecting a sample from an individual boulder, we collected approximately 25 granitic pebbles (1-3 cm) from 4-6 sites along the crest of the moraines following the method of Briner (2009). Each suite of pebbles was crushed together, and quartz minerals were separated from the agglomeration of pebbles. Cosmogenic Ne-21 will be measured from these samples to determine their exposure age. From these two field sites, we will use He-3 and Ne-21 to better understand the timing and extent of glaciation in these areas.",

            "abstract": "Coastal infrastructure can be highly vulnerable to changing climate, including increasing sea levels and altered frequency and intensity of coastal storms. Existing coastal infrastructure may be of a sufficient age that it is already experiencing noticeable impacts from global sea level rise, and require a variety of potential preparedness and resilience measures to adapt to changing climate. Methods to determine vulnerability to changing sea level and support planning of potential future adaptation measures are needed for application to projects having multiple purposes (e.g., navigation, coastal risk reduction). Here we describe a potential framework for assessing projects with several components typical of existing coastal infrastructure spanning a range of engineering disciplines (e.g., hydrology, geotechnical, structural, electrical, and mechanical). The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Climate Preparedness and Resilience Register (CPRR) framework is currently under development. It takes a tiered approach as described in earlier USACE guidance (Engineer Technical Letter 1100-2-1) using the three scenarios prescribed by Engineer Regulation\nER 1100-2-8162\n. Level 1 is a qualitative assessment defining the major sea level change-related impacts and ranks them in order of soonest occurrence. Level 2 is a quantitative evaluation that analyzes current and future performance of individual project components, including electrical, mechanical and structural components and functions using the sea level change scenarios prescribed by\nER 1100-2-8162\n. Level 3 proposes adaptation measures per ETL 1100-2-1 and evaluates changes in sea level change-related impacts.",

            "abstract": "Understanding how marine ecosystems respond to climate change is very important as we continue to warm the climate. Fish represent a critical protein source for a significant portion of the global population, and as such, an understanding of fish production and its interactions with climate change may help better prepare for the future. Ichthyoliths, fossil fish teeth and shark scales, are a novel fossil group which can be used as an indicator for fish productivity. Several important climate events occurred during the Miocene (7 to 23 Ma), including the Middle Miocene Climatic Optimum. Here we reconstruct fish production from across the Miocene from Pacific and Atlantic Ocean gyres. South Atlantic samples, from Deep Sea Drilling Program (DSDP) Site 522 spanning from 30 to 20 Ma, show fairly variable numbers in the Oligocene (ranging from 100 to 800 ich/cm2/yr), but stabilization in the Early Miocene (around 400 ich/cm2/yr), suggesting that the beginning of the Miocene brought consistent conditions for fish production. In the North Pacific, our record from Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 886 shows a distinct crash in fish productivity at 11 Ma, from 3500 ich/cm2/yr to a steady decline around 100 ich/cm2/yr for the next million years. This crash is followed by a marked increase in the presence of diatoms and biogenous opal. This is somewhat surprising, since in modern oceanic systems, an increase in diatoms and other large-celled phytoplankton is associated with shorter, more efficient food chains and higher levels of fish. It is also interesting to note that denticles remain consistently low at both sites, indicating consistently low shark populations through this time period. Together, these results suggest that the Late Oligocene and Miocene was a time of variable fish production and provide a window into understanding of dynamic ecosystem changes through the Miocene in open-ocean gyre ecosystems.",

Increased infiltration and groundwater recharge during the wet season may result in increased groundwater flow during the dry season, the “sponge effect hypothesis”. We irrigate a 6m by 2m test plot with slightly saline water at varying applied rainfall intensities using an ARS-type rainfall simulator, which has an oscillating boom mounted 2m above the forest floor, and four spray nozzles. We install 10cm tall lawn edging at the bottom of the test plot to direct surface water runoff to a small flume where runoff rates are recorded over time. In addition, we use time lapse ERI (electrical resistivity imaging) to map the vertical and downslope flow paths. We add NaCl to the applied water at a concentration of 200 mg/l, tagged with 10 mg/l LiBr as a salinity/conductivity contrast. Because ERI is highly sensitivity to changes in the electrical conductivity of soils and solute, we obtain a clear time-lapse image of flow path and bulk flow velocities. In this presentation we compare and contrast results of observations collected in an actively grazed cattle pasture adjacent ~10-12 year and >25 year old secondary forest plots using data collected during the 2015 wet season.",

The inversion code has been developed by researchers at the Berkeley Seismological Laboratory, whose main attractive is to decrease the time it takes to have an estimate calculation of a moment tensor for any major earthquake using regional data, approximately less than 7 minutes of an earthquake’s origin time. Four seismic events in the region have been used as testbed to the inversion code configured for this area. In order to compare our results, previously computed and published moment tensor inversions from the Global CMT and USGS for the same events were used to assess the deviations from results obtained in this study. Our results indicate the inversion method is capable of reproducing the regional and teleseismic solutions, and thus can be incorporated into daily earthquake location operations at the Puerto Rico Seismic Network (PRSN) for quick estimation of faulting mechanisms and tsunami warning purposes.",

In the northeastern U.S., the distribution of large wood is documented; however, there is little understanding of the movement, longevity and geomorphic function. This research examines the hypothesis that tree species control the persistence and geomorphic function of instream wood in the Appalachian region of the northeastern U.S. To do this, we assessed size, location, and species of logs in New Hampshire rivers, including locations in the White Mountain National Forest (WMNF) where these data were collected ten years ago. We expanded the previous dataset to include assessment of geomorphic function, including creation of diversion channels, pool formation, and sediment storage, among others. We also added new sites in the WMNF and sites on a large rural river in southwestern NH to increase the range of geomorphic variables to now include: confined and unconfined channels; 1st to 4th order streams; low to high gradient; meandering, multithreaded, and straight channels; and land use such as historic logging, modern agriculture, and post-agricultural abandonment. At each study site, we located all large logs (>10cm diameter, > 1m length) and log jams (>3 accumulated logs that provide a geomorphic function) along 100m-700m reaches. We marked each identified log with a numbered tag and recorded species, diameter, length, orientation, GPS location, tag number, and photographs. We assessed function and accumulation, decay, stability, and source classes for each log. Along each reach we measured riparian forest composition and structure and channel width. Preliminary analysis suggests that tree species significantly affects the function of logs: yellow birch and American sycamore are highly represented. Additionally, geomorphic setting also plays a primary role, where unconfined reaches have large logs that provide important functions; those functions are rarely contributed by logs in confined channels. Land use limit the ability of logs to provide habitat for vegetation recruitment, notable in rivers adjacent to agricultural areas that maintain a straight channel; invasive vegetation dominate the banks and there is little to no recruitment of native vegetation.",

            "abstract": "The creation of the electron density irregularities in the middle latitude F region is often interpreted in association with traveling ionospheric disturbances (TIDs). However, the occurrence climatology of the irregularities is somewhat different from that of TIDs, and therefore, a different source of the irregularities may exist. In this study, we investigate the variability of the middle-latitude irregularities with local time, season, and solar cycle by analyzing the measurements of the ion density by the CHAMP (2001–2009) and Swarm (2014–2015) satellite observations. The occurrence climatology of the field-aligned irregularities (FAIs) in middle latitude is also investigated with the VHF radar observations acquired since January 2010 at Daejeon in South Korea. The role of TIDs in the creation of the middle latitude irregularities and FAIs is investigated by comparing the their occurrence climatology with the climatology of TIDs. The conventional wisdom is that the activity of TID decreases with an increase of the solar activity. However, our preliminary results show that the occurrence rate of the FAI increases with an increase of the solar activity. The distribution of the irregularities derived from the analysis of the satellite observations may provide insight into the relationship between TIDs, FAIs, and irregularities.",

Currently, estimates of soil organic C for countries or continents are either unavailable or largely uncertain because they are derived from sparse data, with large gaps over many areas of the Earth. Here, we derive spatially explicit estimates, and their uncertainty, of the distribution and stock of organic C content and composition in the soil of Australia. The composition of soil organic C may be characterized by chemical separation or physical fractionation based on either particle size or particle density (Skjemstad et al., 2004; Gregorich et al., 2006; Kelleher&Simpson, 2006; Zimmermann et al., 2007). In Australia, for example, Skjemstad et al. (2004) used physical separation of soil samples into 50–2000 and <50-μm particle-size fractions followed by the measurement of char-carbon using solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, giving the three OC pools, particulate organic carbon (POC), humic organic carbon (HOC) and resistant organic carbon (ROC; charcoal or char-carbon).\nWe assembled and harmonized data from several sources to produce the most comprehensive set of data on the current stock of organic C in soil of the continent. Using them, we have produced a fine spatial resolution baseline map of organic C, POC, HOC and ROC at the continental scale. In this presentation I will describe how we made the maps and how we use them to assess the vulnerability of soil organic C to for instance climate change.",

Such comparisons are essential in quantifying changes in ice sheets across the last decade, but are complicated by the disparate data that is produced by the two instruments. These comparisons are especially important over complex surfaces such as crevasses, which are among the most dynamic ice sheet features and are often indicative of underlying changes in the ice stress fields. We use a density based algorithm (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure, or OPTICS) to filter photon counting data from two separate Photon-counting LiDAR instruments; the filtered point data is then weighted and convolved to simulate ICESat waveforms. Linking ICESat waveforms with ICESat-2 photon counts is needed in order to understand changes in ice sheet dynamics, and will help quantify the temporal scale of changes occurring in Greenland’s outlet glaciers.",

            "abstract": "Alluvial fans, important depositional systems that record how sediment is stored and moved on planetary surfaces, are found on the surface of Titan, a body of significantly different materials and process rates than Earth. As seen by Cassini’s Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images at 350 m resolution, fans on Titan are found globally and are variable in size, shape and relationship to adjacent landforms. Their morphologies and SAR characteristics, which reveal roughness, textural patterns and other material properties, show similarities with fans in Death Valley seen by SAR and indicate there are regions of high relative relief locally, in the Ganesa, Xanadu and equatorial mountain belt regions. The Leilah Fluctus fans near Ganesa are ~30 km x 15 km, similar to the largest Death Valley fans, and revealing mountainous topography adjacent to plains. Others have gentle slopes over hundreds of kilometers, as in the high southern latitude lakes regions or the Mezzoramia southern midlatitudes, where a fan system is 200 km x 150 km, similar to the Qarn Alam fan emerging into the Rub al Khali in Oman. Additionally, there is evidence for a range of particle sizes, from relatively coarse (~2 cm or more) to fine, revealing long-term duration and variability in erosion by methane rainfall and transport. Some features have morphologies consistent with proximality to high-relief source areas and highly ephemeral runoff, while others appear to draw larger catchment areas and are perhaps characterized by more prolonged episodes of flow. The presence of many fans indicates the longevity of rainfall and erosion in Titan’s surface processes and reveals that sediment transport and the precipitation that drives it are strongly episodic. Alluvial fans join rivers, lakes, eroded mountains, sand dunes and dissolution features in the list of surface morphologies derived from atmospheric and fluvial processes similar to those on Earth, strengthening comparisons between the two planetary bodies.",

The systems hardware, software, and processing methods and tools have grown in numbers and improved over the years, yet many issues linger: there are no standard procedures for acquisition, poor or absent calibration, limited understanding and documentation of processing methods, etc.\nA workshop organized at the GeoHab (a community of geoscientists and biologists around the topic of marine habitat mapping) annual meeting in 2013 was dedicated to seafloor backscatter data from multibeam sonars and concluded that there was an overwhelming need for better coherence and agreement on the topics of acquisition, processing and interpretation of data. The GeoHab Backscatter Working Group (BSWG) was subsequently created with the purpose of documenting and synthetizing the state-of-the-art in sensors and techniques available today and proposing methods for best practice in the acquisition and processing of backscatter data.\nTwo years later, the resulting document \"Backscatter measurements by seafloor-mapping sonars: Guidelines and Recommendations\" was completed1. The document provides:\nAn introduction to backscatter measurements by seafloor-mapping sonars;\nA background on the physical principles of sonar backscatter;\nA discussion on users’ needs from a wide spectrum of community end-users;\nA review on backscatter measurement;\nAn analysis of best practices in data acquisition;\nA review of data processing principles with details on present software implementation; and finally\nA synthesis and key recommendations.\nThis presentation reviews the BSWG mandate, structure, and development of this document. It details the various chapter contents, its recommendations to sonar manufacturers, operators, data processing software developers and end-users and its implication for the marine geology community.\n1: Downloadable at https://www.niwa.co.nz/coasts-and-oceans/research-projects/backscatter-measurement-guidelines",

Currently, there are four stations with baseline varying from 100 to 400 km between them. Our optical observation systems recorded 48 various types of TLEs on the night of 20 August 2014, with eight of them being gigantic jets that were recorded by at least two stations. Due to the length of baselines and the TLE occurring locations, the earth curvature needed to be taken into account by means of spherical trigonometry method. The preliminary results shows the gigantic jets occurred over the northern Taiwan and the accuracy of geolocation is less than 1 km and the accuracy of the retrieval height on the key structures is less than 0.5 km. The triangulation results of the eight events indicate most of these gigantic jets terminated at 80-90km, but one of the gigantic jets is likely extend to 100 km. Three of the eight gigantic jets occurred consequently after previous one with time interval of 500ms to more than 100s. The previous gigantic jet is likely to influence the consequent gigantic jet for usually the consequent gigantic jet has more beads structures in high altitude and one of the streamer column of a consequent gigantic jets at 55 -60 km is identified to re-bright, which is more than 100s after the previous gigantic jet.",

In this study we present the results of coupling a landform evolution model with our SSSPAM5D soil pedogenesis model. In previous work the SSSPAM5D soil evolution model was used to identify trends of the soil profile evolution on a static landform. Two pedogenetic processes, namely (1) armouring due to erosion, and (2) physical and chemical weathering were used in those simulations to evolve the soil profile. By incorporating elevation changes (due to erosion and deposition) we have advanced the SSSPAM5D modelling framework into the realm of landscape evolution. Simulations have been run using elevation and soil grading data of the engineered landform (spoil heap) at the Ranger Uranium Mine, Northern Territory, Australia. The results obtained for the coupled landform-soil evolution simulations predict the erosion of high slope areas, development of rudimentary channel networks in the landform and deposition of sediments in lowland areas, and qualitatively consistent with landform evolution models on their own. Examination of the soil profile characteristics revealed that hill crests are weathering dominated and tend to develop a thick soil layer. The steeper hillslopes at the edge of the landform are erosion dominated with shallow soils while the foot slopes are deposition dominated with thick soil layers. The simulation results of our coupled landform and soil evolution model provide qualitatively correct and timely characterization of the soil evolution on a dynamic landscape. Finally we will compare the characteristics of erosion and deposition predicted by the coupled landform-soil SSSPAM landscape simulator, with landform evolution simulations using a static soil.",

            "abstract": "Mangrove forests are located along Earth’s coastlines and estuaries within tropical and subtropical latitudes. They provide numerous services functioning as an extraordinary carbon sequestration system and serving as habitat and nursery for fish, crustaceans and amphibians. To coastal populations, they provide livelihood, food, lumber and act as an effective protection against tsunamis, storm surges and hurricanes. Their vulnerability to sea level rise is strongly related to their extraordinary ability to accumulate soils, which is in part related to their productivity and therefore canopy structure. As a first step to understand their vulnerability, we seek to understand mangrove dependencies on environmental and geophysical setting. To achieve this, we mapped mangrove canopy height and above ground biomass (AGB) at the Global scale. To identify mangrove forests, existing maps derived from a collection of Landsat data around the 2000 era were used. Using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission elevation data collected in February of 2000, we produced a Global map of mangrove canopy height. The estimated heights were validated with the ICESat/Geoscience Altimeter System (GLAS) and in situ field data. Most importantly, field data were also used to derive relationships between canopy height and AGB. While the geographical coverage of in situ data is limited, ICESat/GLAS data provided extensive geographical coverage with independent estimates of maximum canopy height. These estimates were used to calibrate SRTM-estimates of height at the Global scale. We found the difference between GLAS RH100 and SRTM resulted from several sources of uncertainty that are difficult to isolate. These include natural variations of canopy structure with time, system errors from GLAS and SRTM, geo-location errors and discrepancies in spatial resolution. The Global canopy height map was trnasormed into AGB using the field-derived allometry. Depending on the scale of analysis and geographical location, accuracies in the order 2 to 4m in height was obtained with AGB accuracies below 20%.",

            "abstract": "Natural fractures in shale reservoirs are frequently filled with mineral cement that lacks any residual fracture porosity that is visible under the petrographic microscope. These fully cemented fractures are generally interpreted to be impermeable for fluid flow. Scanning electron microscopy of calcite, dolomite, and barite fracture cements from a variety of shale reservoirs, prepared using broad ion beam milling, provides evidence of open to partially healed elongate pores that are on the order of hundreds of nanometers in aperture. In calcite fracture cement, these pores have consistent apertures of about 100 nm. In dolomite and barite, apertures are up to 500 nm. These pores have been previously overlooked because traditional thin sectioning and polishing destroys sub-micron details of the fracture cement pore structure. Ion milling preserves these details with a minimum of sample damage during sample preparation. Electron backscatter diffraction shows that these pores occur along grain boundaries within the blocky or columnar fracture cement. While partially healed, these pores, arranged along grain boundaries, are frequently sufficiently well connected acting as channels for fluid flow along and across fully cemented natural fractures. In shale reservoirs of ultra-low matrix permeability, these grain boundary channels may thus provide fracture permeability significantly contributing to reservoir production where intersected or indirectly reactivated by hydraulic fractures.",

Quantitative information on the spatial distribution of snow depth and snow water equivalence (SWE) is central to numerous applications in cryospheric research. However, in complex terrain, strong orographic gradients and wind redistribution produce complicated accumulation patterns that are difficult to capture using traditional in situ and satellite-based approaches, and are challenging to model with acceptable levels of uncertainty. Here we apply a repeat airborne photogrammetric approach and employ a Structure from Motion (SfM) processing method to generate digital surface models (DSMs) of snow-free and end-of-winter snow covered surfaces. Surface elevation differencing of these datasets produces a continuous and accurate snow depth map into which we assimilate in situ SWE measurements to produce detailed estimates of SWE over complex terrain in the maritime-continental transition zone of the eastern Chugach Mountains.",

            "abstract": "A global hydrological hazard evaluation system based on the BTOP models (Global BTOP) is introduced and quantifies flood and drought hazards with simulated river discharges globally for historical, near real-time monitoring and climate change impact studies. The BTOP model utilizes a modified topographic index concept and simulates rainfall-runoff processes including snowmelt, overland flow, soil moisture in the root and unsaturated zones, sub-surface flow, and river flow routing. The current global BTOP is constructed from global data on 10-min grid and is available to conduct river basin analysis on local, regional, and global scale. To reduce the impact of a coarse resolution, topographical features of global BTOP were obtained using river network upscaling algorithm that preserves fine resolution characteristics of 3-arcsec HydroSHEDS and 30-arcsec Hydro1K datasets. In addition, GLCC-IGBP land cover (USGS) and the DSMW(FAO) were used for the root zone depth and soil properties, respectively. The long-term seasonal potential evapotranspiration within BTOP model was estimated by the Shuttleworth-Wallace model using climate forcing data CRU TS3.1 and a GIMMS-NDVI(UMD/GLCF). The global BTOP was run with globally available precipitation such APHRODITE dataset and showed a good statistical performance compared to the global and local river discharge data in the major river basins. From these simulated daily river discharges at each grid, the flood peak discharges of selected return periods were obtained using the Gumbel distribution with L-moments and the hydrological drought hazard was quantified using standardized runoff index (SRI). For the dynamic (near real-time) applications, the global BTOP model is run with GSMaP-NRT global precipitation and simulated daily river discharges are utilized in a prototype near-real time discharge simulation system (GFAS-Streamflow), which is used to issue flood peak discharge alerts globally. The global BTOP system and GFAS-Streamflow sites may be used to introduce a combined flood and drought hazard monitor to close the gap between local and global scale hazard assessments and support the International Flood Initiative (IFI) Flagship Project, which aims to support benchmarking flood risk reduction at global, national and local levels.",

The 2013 30°N observations indicate surface 134Cs concentrations of 3–5 Bq/m3 between 160°E and 160°W, slightly lower concentrations west of 160°E and no detectable signal east of 160.6°W. Profile samples show 134Cs penetration to 500 m west of 180° with shoaling penetration depth toward to the east. The near-uniform vertical distribution of 137Cs between 152°W and 121.3°W in the top 500 m is indicative of trace amounts of radionuclides remaining from weapons testing. The physical processes responsible for the deep 134Cs penetration in the western Pacific appear to be related to distinct water mass subduction pathways, however the timing and rapidity of deep penetration over the broad scales observed has yet to be clarified.",

There are four major dust explosion areas in the world, such as North America, Australia, Central Asia and Middle East. Located in the Central Asia, North China has a severe desertification because of deforestation and excessive population growth. Beijing is at the fork of three dust transmission paths in Chin, which makes it a dust-prone region for a long history especially in spring. Thanks to the improvement of the ecological environment in Mongolia, the number of dust weather in recent years reduced significantly than before. However, as the spring coming earlier for the relatively high temperature, a severe dust weather process happened suddenly on March 28, 2015 following with the long-term hazy weather, which up to the highest intensity in the nearly two years.\nA set of ground-based observations for this serious dust event were adopted in this paper. The ground-based remote sensing station is equipped with an automatic CIMEL lidar and an AERONET sun-photometer. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol size distribution were measured by sun-photometer. AOD of dust reached 2.0 at 532nm, which was much larger than clear days. And there was an obvious trend that coarse mode increases more significantly and quickly than fine mode when a dust storm occurs. At the same time, data provided by the air quality monitoring and analysis platform of China shown that the PM10 concentration was larger than 1000μg/m3 and PM10 made important contribution to the high AQI. Lidar observation clearly shown the dust spread very tall (higher than 1km) when the dust storm occurrence. After the dust dissipating, the planetary boundary layer roughly from 0 to 3km, aerosol has a very widely vertical distribution. The AOD based on sun-photometer were taken as a constraint, 65 sr were retrieved and analyzed. And the extinction coefficients indicated that the dust had been dissipation near the ground, while some dissolved into the upper air (2-3km) after the dust passed over.\nBackward trajectory analysis showed those dust was originating from Mongolia (northwest of Beijing). According to the air quality index data, the dust transmission path could be Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei-Shandong-Jiangsu. And then it deposited at Taizhou in Jiangsu province.",

It is considered the most active volcano in Mexico, with activity characterized mainly by intermittent effusive and explosive episodes. On July 10th-12th 2015, Volcán de Colima underwent its most intense eruptive phase since its Plinian eruption in 1913. A partial collapse of the dome and of the crater wall generated several pyroclastic flows, the largest of which reached almost 10 km to the south of the volcano. Lava flows along with incandescent rockfalls descended through various flanks of the volcanic edifice. Ashfall affected people up to 40 km from the volcano’s summit. Inhabitants from the small villages closest to the volcano were evacuated and authorities sealed off a 12 km area.\nWe present an overview of the seismic activity that preceded and accompanied this eruptive phase, with data from the closest broadband and short period seismic stations of the Volcán de Colima monitoring network. We focus on the search of temporal information within the spectral content of the seismic signals. We first employ common time-frequency representations such as Fourier and wavelet transforms, but we also apply more recent techniques proposed for the analysis of non-stationary signals, such as empirical mode decomposition and the synchrosqueezing transform. We present and discuss the performances of these various methods characterizing and quantifying spectral changes which could be used to forecast future eruptive events and to evaluate the course of volcanic processes during ongoing eruptions.",

            "abstract": "Large microseismic events (M>0) have been shown to be generated during hydraulic fracture treatments relatively frequently. These events are a concern both from public safety and engineering viewpoints. Recent microseismic monitoring projects in the Horn River Basin have utilized both downhole and surface sensors to record events associated with hydraulic fracturing. The resulting hybrid monitoring system has produced a large dataset with two distinct groups of events: large events recorded by the surface network (0<M<3), and small events recorded only by the downhole sensors (-4<M<0). Large events tend to occur well below the reservoir on pre-existing structures; small events are concentrated at reservoir depth. Differences in behavior have been observed between these two datasets, leading to conclusions of different underlying processes responsible for the recorded activity. Both datasets show very low seismic efficiency, implying slip weakening and possibly the presence of fluids in the source region. Reservoir events have shear-tensile source mechanisms ranging between tensile opening and tensile closing, and fracture orientations dominated by the rock fabric which are not always optimally oriented to the regional stress field. The observed source characteristics are expected for events driven by increased pore pressure and reduced friction due to lubrication. On average, deep events show higher stress drop, apparent stress, and rupture velocity than reservoir events. This reflects higher confining stresses with depth, and possibly the release of stored energy in the existing zone of weakness. Deep events are dominated by shear failures, but source characteristics are smaller than for naturally occurring tectonic earthquakes of similar magnitude. Most importantly from a seismic hazard perspective, large earthquakes associated with hydrofracing have lower stress drops than tectonic earthquakes, and thus produce smaller peak ground acceleration and less damage on surface. The largest event recorded in this dataset has a moment magnitude of +2.9 and was felt by field crews in the area. The response spectrum for this event has maximum ground acceleration less than 20% of the UBC-97 Type I design response spectrum, and thus does not pose a significant threat to infrastructure.",

            "abstract": "Systematic high-resolution thermo-mechanical numerical models are conducted in order to better understand the behavior of deep mantle lithosphere and surface topography response during continental collision. In the models with similar rheological properties for the pro- (subducting) and retro- (overriding) continental plates, subduction mode is preferred, with localized topography uplift and mountain building. However, if the effective viscosities of the retro-plate are decreased, then delamination of the lithospheric mantle may occur there, which results in large-scale topography buildup and plateau formation. Several other factors that may also influence the delamination dynamics are further investigated, e.g., plastic weakening of the lithospheric mantle, density contrast between the lithospheric and asthenospheric mantle, convergence velocity, as well as the possible lower crust eclogitization effects. Based on the series of numerical simulations, the delamination processes in collisional orogens are summarized into three modes: (1) pro-plate delamination, (2) retro-plate delamination, and (3) a transitional double-plates (both the pro- and retro-plate) delamination. The controlling factors, as well as the geological applications in nature, of the variable delamination modes are also discussed.",

            "abstract": "Experiments were conducted to evaluate mechanisms operating along grain boundaries that control compositional and textural properties during recrystallization of rocks. Grain boundaries act as important geochemical reservoirs because elements that are incompatible in the dominant matrix minerals of a rock are partitioned into grain boundaries. Compositional variations in recrystallized minerals adjacent to grain boundaries in recrystallized rocks result from processes that are similar to those that modify compositions in mineral/melt and mineral/fluid systems. In fluid-free systems the transport of elements in polycrystalline materials must occur by diffusion along pathways composed of grain boundaries. From a purely geometrical standpoint, the only available pathway for coexisting minerals to ‘communicate’ with one another in response to changes in P–T is by grain-boundary diffusion. Because grain-boundary diffusion is commonly 104 to 106 times higher than diffusion through the lattices of most rock forming minerals, rapid transport of components through low volume grain boundaries may govern the kinetics of textural and geochemical equilibration. Minerals adjacent to grain boundaries may incorporate elements from the grain boundary region. The extent to which minerals adjacent to grain boundaries equilibrate is largely dependent upon the mechanism by which those minerals incorporate impurities from the grain-boundary region; lattice diffusion from a grain-boundary source may produce limited equilibration whereas chemically induced grain-boundary migration may produce extensive equilibration. The presence of a free fluid phase significantly affects the transport along grain boundaries, and in many cases will promote equilibration through dissolution and precipitation of minerals adjacent to grain boundaries.",

            "abstract": "Negative emission technologies such as Bioenergy with Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (BioCCS) play an ever more crucial role in meeting the 2°C stabilization target. However, such technologies are currently at their infancy and their future penetrations may fall short of the scale required to stabilize the warming. Furthermore, the overshoot in the mid-century prior to a full realization of negative emissions would give rise to a risk because such a temporal but excessive warming above 2°C might amplify itself by strengthening climate-carbon cycle feedbacks. It has not been extensively assessed yet how carbon cycle feedbacks might play out during the overshoot in the context of negative emissions. \n\nThis study explores how 2°C stabilization pathways, in particular those which undergo overshoot, can be influenced by carbon cycle feedbacks and asks their climatic and economic consequences. We compute 2°C stabilization emissions scenarios under a cost-effectiveness principle, in which the total abatement costs are minimized such that the global warming is capped at 2°C. We employ a reduced-complexity model, the Aggregated Carbon Cycle, Atmospheric Chemistry, and Climate model (ACC2), which comprises a box model of the global carbon cycle, simple parameterizations of the atmospheric chemistry, and a land-ocean energy balance model. The total abatement costs are estimated from the marginal abatement cost functions for CO2, CH4, N2O, and BC.\n\nOur preliminary results show that, if carbon cycle feedbacks turn out to be stronger than what is known today, it would incur substantial abatement costs to keep up with the 2°C stabilization goal. Our results also suggest that it would be less expensive in the long run to plan for a 2°C stabilization pathway by considering strong carbon cycle feedbacks because it would cost more if we correct the emission pathway in the mid-century to adjust for unexpectedly large carbon cycle feedbacks during overshoot. Furthermore, our tentative results point to a key policy message: do not rely on negative emissions to achieve the 2°C target. It would make more sense to gear climate mitigation actions toward the stabilization target without betting on negative emissions because negative emissions might create large overshoot in case of strong feedbacks.",

The quantity and seasonality of river flow in the 13,289 km^2 basin depends on glacier runoff to an extent that belies the small percentage of the basin's area that is covered by glaciers (4%). We run a physically-based hydrological model (WaSiM) to project 21st century river discharge for the basin, explicitly including the glacier component of runoff. Climate inputs come from a CCSM CMIP5 RCP6.0 scenario downscaled to a 20km-5km nested grid using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model and are adjusted with a local bias correction. From 2010-2029 to 2080-2099 the basin-wide mean-annual temperature will rise 2.5 degrees and total precipitation will rise 2%, with a 13% decrease in snowfall and a 20% increase in rainfall. WaSiM runs indicate that glaciers will lose about 40% of their area, evapotranspiration will increase, and permafrost will thaw. Annual runoff will remain relatively steady, but the timing of the peak spring runoff will shift to an earlier date (by about 1 month) and late summer runoff will be reduced (by about 50%) compared to present.

This apparatus can control temperatures and pressures equivalent to an MH reservoir in deep seabed. Additionally, observation windows are installed in front of and behind the specimen in order to allow the local deformation of the specimen during shear tests to be measured. The specimen is a cuboid with 80mm width, 60mm thickness and 160mm height. A 5mmｘ5mm mesh was drawn on the membrane in front of the observation window. Using this testing apparatus, plane strain compression and methane hydrate dissociation by depressurization tests were performed with the measurement of localized deformation. Local deformation analysis was performed by observing the cross-points of the mesh during shear tests and using this data in PIV analysis. Thermocouples were installed at 60mm and 30mm from the bottom of the specimen in order to measure the variation of the temperature during the dissociation of MH. Tc and Toyoura sand were the materials used for comparison. In plane strain shear tests, Tc and Toyoura sand as host sands with and without MH were compared. Due to the existence of MH, initial stiffness and strength increased in both materials, however the tendency was more apparent in Toyoura sand compared with Tc. The local deformations occurred more clearly in Toyoura sand, compared with fine material. It also appeared more clearly when the specimen contained MH. During depressurization, marked deformation was not observed, because of an increase of effective stress. However, after depressurization, repressurization caused the specimen to fail in the case of high initial shear stress conditions. ",

Here, the influence of different plant functional traits on the coexistence of different species in arid and semi-arid regions with patchy vegetation is investigated using an ecohydrology model. The model simulates coevolving changes in biomass patterns for two species, as well as overland flow and soil moisture dynamics. Vegetation patterns emerge as a result of facilitation (shading and infiltration) and competition mechanisms as well as varying seed dispersal strategies. The results show that the survival of only one species or the coexistence of both species not only strongly depends on environmental stresses, but also on differences in hillslope micro and macro topography. These vegetation patterns have very different hydrologic signatures and the potential to trigger remarkably different geomorphic responses. Based on these results we establish new hypothesis that will be used to further investigate the role of plant interspecific and intraspecific feedbacks on landscape coevolution processes.",

Whenever CPA could be used to calculate K, advective transport scaling relationships from percolation theory should describe solute transport. Two solute transport relationships are applied to predict soil development and edaphic constraints on natural vegetation growth. These results use known exponents from percolation theory and known subsurface flow velocities. The typical flow velocity itself constrains optimal growth rates of cultivars. The percolation scaling relationship constraining vegetation growth is shown to be in accord with data over time scales from hours to 100,000 years, including over a dozen studies (and two models) of tree growth. The scaling function for soil development explains time scales for formation of soils from years to hundreds of millions of years. Data on soil development comes from 23 different studies. The key unification is the common origin of the time and space coordinates for all three relationships in the time of transport through a single pore of roughly micron size at a typical subsurface pore-scale flow velocity. The distinction in evolving time scales is primarily a result of the hierarchical nature of vascular plant root systems, which speed up nutrient access relative to physical transport rates in the soil. The results help explain reduction in forest productivity with age, diminishing soil production with time, and the temporal distinction between the relevance of chemical and biological processes in soils to the global carbon cycle.",

This region contains three east-trending, laterally-continuous tectonostratigraphic units separated by two major fault zones. To the south, low-grade metasediments of the Lesser Himalayan Sequence (LHS) are separated from high-grade crystalline rocks of the Greater Himalayan Sequence (GHS) by the north dipping Main Central Thrust (MCT). The northern extent of the GHS is separated from overlying low-grade sedimentary rocks of the Tethyan Himalayan Sequence (THS) along the north dipping South Tibetan Detachment System (STDS). There is controversy over the location and type of shear motion for the STDS in the ~50 km strip running through Lahul Valley where the STD is interpreted as a discrete fault, a dextral shear zone, and is unidentified in some areas along the trend of the STDS. This study focuses on understanding the pressure-temperature-time-deformation (P-T-t-d) evolution of THS and GHS rocks in Lahul Valley to better understand regional Cenozoic deformation and the location and role of the STDS in the extrusion of the GHS. Deformed granitics, migmatites, and leucogranites from the GHS contain a dominant mineralogy of Qz + Kfs + Pl + Bt + Ms ± Grt ± Ky ± St. Schists and phyllites from the THS contain a dominant mineralogy of Qz + Kfs + Pl + Bt + Ms ± Grt. Isochemical phase equilibria diagrams (pseudosections) are calculated in Perple_X using whole-rock chemistry data with solution models based on these mineral assemblages. Ti-in-quartz thermometry and the Fe-Mg exchange thermometry from garnet-biotite pairs used with mineral growth relationships constrain conditions during deformation and to establish P-T paths. U-Pb SHRIMP dating of zircon constrains peak metamorphic conditions and 40Ar/39Ar thermochronology of micas provide the cooling history along the valley and across the STDS. This multi-component approach to understand the metamorphic and deformational evolution of Lahul provides a holistic understanding of the GHS, THS, and STDS in a controversial area that can be used to draw comparisons, and build on tectonic models in the NW Himalaya.",

A major question is how effective this storage of overbank flow is at treating streamwater based on the cumulative time stream discharge at a downstream location has spent in shallower, slower overbank flow.\nThe North Carolina Floodplain Mapping Program maintains a detailed statewide Flood Risk Information System (FRIS) using HEC-RAS modeling, lidar, and detailed surveyed river cross-sections. FRIS provides extensive information regarding channel geometry on approximately 39,000 stream reaches (a slightly coarser spatial resolution than the NHD+v2 dataset) with tens of cross-sections for each reach. We use this FRIS data to calculate volume and discharge from floodplain riparian areas separately from in-channel flow during overbank events. Preliminary results suggest that a small percentage of total annual discharge interacts with the full floodplain extent along a stream reach due to the infrequency of overbank flow events. However, with the significantly different physical characteristics of the riparian area when compared to the channel itself, this overbank flow can provide unique services to water quality. Our project aims to use this information in conjunction with data from the USGS SPARROW program to target non-point source hotspots of Nitrogen and Phosphorus addition and removal. By better understanding the flow dynamics within riparian areas during high flow events, riparian restoration projects can be carried out with improved efficacy.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - PosterChaney.pdf\nExisting land surface models (LSM) struggle to accurately represent the observed field-scale (~100 meters) spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture due to the over-simplistic parameterizations of sub-grid heterogeneity and the coarseness of the model input data. This is especially relevant in the context of satellite remote sensing of soil moisture since land surface models are seen as important tools with which to validate high-resolution soil moisture retrievals. To address this challenge, we have developed HydroBloks, a semi-distributed land surface model that uses hydrologic response units (HRUs) to represent the observed field-scale spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture while maintaining the computational efficiency of existing LSMs. To accomplish this goal, HydroBloks couples the Noah-MP land surface model to the Dynamic TOPMODEL hydrologic model. The HRUs are defined by clustering proxies of the drivers of spatial heterogeneity using field-scale land data (e.g., NLCD). This allows for each HRU's results to be readily mapped out in space, enabling model application and validation at sub-100 meter scales. In this study, HydroBloks is implemented at three USDA watersheds over the contiguous United States (Little Washita, Little River, and Walnut Gulch). HydroBloks is run at each watershed between 2004 and 2014 using a 100 Latin Hypercube Sample to account for model parameter uncertainty. Each catchment's model ensemble is constrained and validated using available in-situ top-layer soil moisture observations. The results from this study provide insight into the strengths and weaknesses of existing soil moisture networks and the model’s potential applications for improved design of in-situ soil moisture networks.",

However, airborne measurements have shown that these particles may also contain a significant amount of organic material. Experiments combining organics (propanal, glyoxal and/or methylglyoxal) with sulfuric acid at concentrations typical of UT/LS aerosols produced highly colored surface films (and solutions) that have the potential to impact chemical, optical and/or cloud-forming properties of aerosols. In order to assess the potential for such films to impact aerosol chemistry or climate properties, experiments were performed to identify the chemical processes responsible for film formation. Surface films were analyzed via Attenuated Total Reflectance-FTIR and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopies and are shown to consist primarily of aldol condensation products and cyclic and linear polyacetals, the latter of which are likely responsible for separation from the aqueous phase.",

To contribute to the understanding of source process of earthquakes the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention NIED maintains the international seismic Network (ISN) since 2007. Continuous seismic waveforms from 294 broadband seismic stations in Indonesia, Philippines, and Central-South America regions are received in real time at NIED, and used for automatic location of seismic events. Using these data we perform automatic and manual estimation of moment tensor of seismic events (Mw>4.5) by using the SWIFT program developed at NIED. We simulate the propagation of local tsunamis in these regions using a tsunami simulation code and visualization system developed at NIED, combined with CMT parameters estimated by SWIFT. The goals of the system are to provide a rapid and reliable earthquake and tsunami information in particular for large seismic, and produce an appropriate database of earthquake source parameters and tsunami simulations for research.\nThe system uses the hypocenter location and magnitude of earthquakes automatically determined at NIED by the SeisComP3 system (GFZ) from the continuous seismic waveforms in the region, to perform the automated calculation of moment tensors by SWIFT, and then carry out the automatic simulation and visualization of tsunami. The system generates maps of maximum tsunami heights within the target regions and along the coasts and display them with the fault model parameters used for tsunami simulations. Tsunami calculations are performed for all events with available automatic SWIFT/CMT solutions. Tsunami calculations are re-computed using SWIFT manual solutions for events with Mw>5.5 and centroid depths shallower than 100 km. Revised maximum tsunami heights as well as animation of tsunami propagation are also calculated and displayed for the two double couple solutions by SWIFT.\nAcknowledgments\nReal-time seismic data from Indonesia and Philippines is received at NIED in the framework of cooperative research projects with BMKG (Indonesia), PHIVOLCS (Philippines), and GFZ (Germany).

Diamond samples were shock compressed using a high energy laser drive. We obtained images and velocity maps of deformation and fracture that provide an unprecedented view into material response at the breakout surface. Our data show velocity roughening at the breakout surface as a result of spall fracture in free surface samples and as a result of the compressional inelastic wave and reflected release wave in tamped samples. The larger increase in velocity roughness associated with the microdiamond samples agrees with previously obtained data indicating a loss of reflectivity on breakout for microdiamond shock compression. Using the observed fragment size for spall fracture in the microcrystalline and nanocrystalline diamond, and Grady’s model for spall fracture fragment size as a function of strain rate, we have found values for the micro- and nanocrystalline fracture toughness of 103±14 MPa m1/2 and 44±8 MPa m1/2, respectively. Using these values for the fracture toughness, the strain rate dependent spall stresses were calculated and found to agree with previous research.",

            "abstract": "The Rio Grande rift (RGR) has Quaternary and active volcanism and faulting that provide a field laboratory for examining links between mantle degassing and faults as fluid conduits. Diffuse and spring CO2 flux measurements were taken at 6 sites in the northwestern Albuquerque Basin (NWAB) and Valles caldera geothermal system. All sites progress to the southwest from the 1.25 Ma Valles caldera, down the rift-related Jemez fault network, to intersect with the Nacimiento fault system. Mantle CO2 and He degassing are well documented at 5 of 6 sites, with decreasing 3He/4He ratios away from the caldera. The instrument used to measure CO2 flux was an EGM-4 CO2 gas analyzer (PP systems) with an accumulation chamber. Carbonic springs at Penasco Springs (PS) and San Ysidro (SY), and the carbonate-cemented Sand Hill Fault (SHF) were targeted, all near the western border of the RGR. The SHF has no spring activity, had the smallest maximum flux of all the sites (8 g/m2d), but carbonate along the fault zone (<2 m wide) attest to past CO2 flux. The other two sites are equal distance (30-40 km) between the SHF site and Valles caldera sites. These sites have active carbonic springs that precipitate travertine mounds. Our work suggests these sites reflect intersections of the Nacimiento fault with NE trending faults that connect to the Jemez fault network. The maximum diffuse flux recorded at SY (297 g/m2d) and PS (25 g/m2d) are high, especially along the fault and near springs. At SY and PS the instruments capacity was exceeded (2,400 g/m2d) at 6 of 9 springs. Interpretations indicate a direct CO2 flux through a fault-related artesian aquifer system that is connected to magmatic gases from the caldera. Maximum diffuse flux measurements of Alamo Canyon (20,906 g/m2d), Sulphur Springs (2,400 g/m2d) and Soda Dam (1,882 g/m2d) at Valles caldera geothermal sites are comparable to Yellowstone geothermal systems. We use geospatial analysis and local geologic mapping to examine relationships of CO2 flux to structure. Travertine mounds can create impermeable barriers that modify near-surface degassing patterns, making it difficult to decipher where CO2 and fluids preferentially migrate up the damage zones in the hanging-wall or footwall. Future work will utilize grids to more accurately assess the localized affect fault zones have on CO2 flux rates.",

Diatoms and other microfossils provide biostratigraphic and paleoenvironmental constraints, inferences regarding ice stream erosion, particulate provenance and glacial mixing.\nMost subglacial samples contain a mixture of eroded diatoms which reflect initial deposition throughout the Cenozoic. Pleistocene diatoms reflect erosion of marine sediments deposited in the West Antarctic during ice sheet retreat events. Miocene diatoms reflect extensive Miocene deposition before entering a dominantly glacial phase. Additionally, Paleogene fossils, both marine and non-marine occur widely, reflecting deeper erosion and provide insights into basin history.\nSLW contains Upper Miocene fossils with a mix of younger and older marine taxa and Paleogene pollen and spores. These ages and taxa are consistent with samples from 200 km upstream at the Whillans Ice Stream (UpB), suggesting a connection between the sites with little evidence of new erosion of material between these sites. Diatom fragment abundance is on average lower than UpB suggesting sediments have experienced additional cumulative shearing and transport. Biomarker data is used to understand changes in inputs from terrestrial and marine components. UpB has a stronger terrestrial signal, compared with SLW further illustrating mixing and transport of sediments.\nWGZ cores exhibit stratigraphic variation in microfossil abundance as well as a transition in age dominance of taxa. The upper 25cm of the sediment core is characterized by an assemblage of Upper Miocene dominating taxa which largely represent rain-out from melting debris-laden ice, but also includes consistent occurrences of Late Pleistocene diatoms. A radiolarian encasing a modern pelagic diatom assemblage was noted at 26cm. An interval, from 45 cm down core contains significantly more abundant diatoms than the upper layers, and below that is a Paleogene-dominated assemblage. The stratigraphic variability at the grounding zone indicates changes in sediment provenance, indicating a variable glaciological regime including a dynamic grounding line and potential input from the Mercer Ice Stream.",

The likelihood of such shortages in the future is further exacerbated by the fact that increased greenhouse forcing and rapid growth in human population will continue for at least the next several decades. These socio-environmental changes will likely put some regions under enormous economic and environmental stress by forcing them to adapt to new conditions. India with its rapidly growing population and high rates of urbanization and industrialization is one such region whose agricultural resources will be particularly vulnerable to the impact of these changes. This study collectively reviews and analyses the possible impacts of climate change, population growth and resulting land use change on the availability of food and water in the coming decades for India. By analyzing and fusing a wide variety of existing data and research on the impact of land use change, population, and climate change, on water and food resources this study develops an understanding of the broader implications of each of the changes on food security in the region. In addition, the study focuses on the need to assess and quantify the combination of such impacts at a regional level and identify food security hotspots spatially across India that will help to narrow down regions in the country which will be severely affected and need priority adaptation and mitigation measures.",

            "abstract": "Tropical dry forests have been reduced to a fraction of their original extent in the Neotropics due to conversion to agriculture and cattle pasture. While TDF can recover via natural regeneration, resulting forests are dominated by wind-dispersed pioneer species of limited value for frugivorous wildlife. Additionally, passive restoration can be perceived as “abandonment” resulting in neighbors casually invading property to rear livestock and extract timber. In 2007, the NGO Paso Pacífico initiated restoration in a highly degraded tropical dry forest landscape of southwestern Nicaragua; funded by an ex-ante carbon purchase, the project was designed to integrate multiple native tree species known to provide resources used by local wildlife. We restored roughly 400 hectares spanning a rainfall gradient from dry to transitional moist forest, using reforestation (planting 70 species of tree seedlings in degraded pastures on a 4x4 m grid, leaving occurring saplings) and assisted regeneration (clearing vines and competing vegetation from saplings in natural regeneration and strategically managing canopy cover). In just over seven years, mean carbon increased nearly threefold, from to 21.5±5.0 to 57.9±9.6 SE tonnes/ha. Current carbon stocks match those of 20-year-old forests in the area, accumulated in less than a decade. Stem density per 15-m radius plot decreased from 16.3±2.3 to 12.5±0.9 SE, while species richness increased from 3.9±0.4 to 18.4±1.4 SE. Alpha richness of woody stems across plots increased from 36 to 94 species, and over 20 tree species established as a result of natural dispersal and recruitment. We have observed sensitive species such as spider monkeys and parrots foraging in restoration areas. Managed reforestation is a highly effective method for rapidly restoring the functionality of multiple ecosystem services in degraded TDF, particularly when social and political realities force restoration to coexist with human productive activities. Project techniques were developed in collaboration with local community members and incorporated indigenous practices regarding lunar cycles, intercropping, and other management aspects. We suggest that this integration was a critical aspect to project success, and that these approaches could be widely adapted throughout Central America.",

            "abstract": "This paper compared grain size, thickness, and lithological character of ten fluvial gravel layers formed during the glacial sea-level lowstands intervening inner bay mud layers deposited during the interglacial marine transgressional periods since the last 900 ka by integrated analyses of sediment cores including 600 m deep onein the Nobi plain, central Japan. Linkages between river long profile changes and sea-level and climate changes will be discussed. The Nobi basin is one of the representative delta type alluvial lowlands in Japan dominated by longitudinal drainage system named Kiso river system flowing southward from central Japan Alps with abundant water and sediment discharges. The basin bounded by the Yoro fault on the west has been tilted westward by the repetitive faulting activity. The basin stratigraphy and its stacking patterns suggest uniform and rapid subsidence and tilting rates of the basin with the maximum value of 1 mm yr-1 and 10-4 kyr-1 respectively produced by the Yoro fault activity under the W-E compressional regional stress field during the middle and late Quaternary periods. Tephrochronological, paleomagnetic, geochemical, and diatom analyses enabled to identify ten times repeated marine transgression–regression sequences correlated with full glacial-interglacial sea-level changes during the last 900 ka. All of the ten sequence boundaries were characterized by fluvial gravel layers were formed by the Kiso river system. The mean maximum gravel size is proportional to the magnitude of sea level lowering inferred from MIS curve, i.e. gravels deposited in MIS 12 and 16 are the largest, and those in MIS 14 and 8 are the smallest since MIS 16. This suggests that the longitudinal profile of the Kiso river system has been adjusting to the sea level changes and that the steeper longitudinal profile formed in the lower sea level periods can transport larger gravels to the drilling sites. In fact the present river bed gravel size is in proportion with the tractive force and mainly controlled by slope of the rive long-profile.",

            "abstract": "Earth’s mantle connects the surface with the deep interior through convection, and the evolution of its redox state will affect the distribution of siderophile elements1, recycling of refractory isotopes2 and the oxidation state of the atmosphere through volcanic outgassing3. The rise of oxygen in atmosphere, i.e., the Great Oxidation Event (G.O.E.) occurred ~2.4 billion years ago (Ga)4. However, multiple lines of evidence point to biological oxygen production well before 2.4 Ga5; while chromium isotopes in iron formations indicates a decline of atmospheric oxygen about 1.88 Ga6. In contrast to the fluctuation of atmospheric oxygen, vanadium in Archean mantle lithosphere suggests that the mantle redox state has been constant for ~3.5 Ga7. Indeed, the redox state of the deep Earth’s interior is not well constrained8 and its effect on mantle dynamics is unknown. Here we show a redox-induced density difference affects mantle convection and may potentially cause the oxidation of the upper mantle. From two synthetic enstatite chondritic samples with identical bulk compositions but formed under different oxygen fugacities (fO2) compressed to lower mantle pressures and temperatures, we find Al2O3 forms its own phase separate from the dominant Mg-silicate perovskite phase (i.e., bridgmanite9) in the more reduced composition, in contrast to a more Al-rich, bridgmanite-dominated assemblage for a more oxidized starting composition. As a result, the reduced material is ~1-1.5% denser than the oxidized material. Geodynamical numerical simulations show that the redox-induced density difference could lead to an increased oxidation of Earth’s upper mantle but is buffered by slow mixing with more reduced material through hot upwellings, which will potentially affect mantle redox and rise of oxygen in atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "The cratered Noachian highlands region of Mars is host to hundreds to thousands of exposures of hydrated minerals. Areas of the highlands that are relatively free of dust, such as Tyrrhena Terra, have been previously examined using Mars Express/OMEGA and MRO/CRISM visible/near-IR reflectance data. The inferred alteration mineralogy is consistent with formation under low water to rock ratio, relatively low T/P and shallow crustal conditions. The vast majority of occurrences are associated with impact craters with a wide range of diameters, and within not only central peaks, but also rims and ejecta. This implies that most outcrops are a result of the excavation of pre-existing mineralology, not formation in-situ by post-impact hydrothermalism. Types of minerals reported include, most commonly, Fe/Mg phyllosilicates (smectite, chlorite, mixed-layer clays, prehnite, serpentine, illite), and less commonly, Al-phyllosilicates (e.g., kaolinite), carbonates, zeolites (e.g., analcime), and hydrated silica.\nHere we document and characterize the occurrence of an additional class of mineralogy in Noachian terrain: hydrated sulfates. Hydrated sulfates are observed in the central peaks and (in one case) the proximal ejecta of 3 craters dispersed across the region. In each crater, a diverse assemblage of other hydrated alteration minerals is also apparent and includes prehnite, carbonate, zeolite, Fe/Mg smectite, and chlorite. Two of the three craters are approximately 10 km in diameter, with resulting sulfate exhumation depths in the central peaks approaching 1 km. The third crater has a diameter of 25 km; however, uplift and ejecta from several pre-existing impacts reduce the possible sulfate excavation depth to 1.3 km. CRISM spectra are consistent with a poly-hydrated sulfate, with major absorptions centered at 1.45, 1.95, and 2.4 micrometers – similar to, but distinct from, many zeolites. While mono-hydrated and poly-hydrated sulfates are not uncommon to other areas of Mars, they are generally relegated to younger, layered sedimentary settings (e.g., Valles Marineris, Meridiani Planum). If confirmed, the formation of hydrated sulfates in Noachian-aged terrain substantially adds to our understanding of the complexity of the early Mars environment.",

The natural and anthropogenic influx of toxic metals into drinking water sources pose a sustainability challenge for cities that need to provide safe water with the smallest footprint. This work presents our study of the transformations of copper in the Yerba Loca-Mapocho system. Our sampling campaign started from the headwaters at La Paloma Glacier and continues to the inlet of the San Enrique drinking water treatment plant, a system feeding municipalities in the Eastern area of Santiago, Chile. Depending on the season, total copper concentrations go as high as 22 mg/L for the upper sections, which become diluted to <5 mg/L downstream. pH ranged from 3 to 5.6 while suspended solids ranged from <10 to 100 mg/L. We used Geochemist Workbench to assess copper speciation and to evaluate the thermodynamic controls for the formation and dissolution of solid phases. A sediment trap was used to concentrate suspended particulate matter, which was analyzed with ICP-MS, TXRF (total reflection X ray fluorescence) and XRD (X-ray diffraction). Major elements detected in the precipitates were Al (200 g/kg), S (60 g/kg), and Cu (6 g/kg). Likely solid phases include hydrous amorphous phases of aluminum hydroxides and sulfates, and copper hydroxides/carbonates. Efforts are undergoing to find the optimal mixing ratios between the acidic stream and more alkaline streams to maximize attenuation of dissolved copper. The results of this research could be used for enhancing in-stream natural attenuation of copper and reducing treatment needs at the drinking water facility.\nAcknowledgements to Fondecyt 1130936 and Conicyt Fondap 15110020",

The goal of this effort is to enable recording and sharing data within the geoscience community, to encourage interdisciplinary research, and to facilitate the investigation of scientific questions that cannot currently be addressed. The development of the Data System emphasizes community input in order to build a system that encompasses the needs of researchers, in terms of data and usability. SG&T data is complex for a variety of reasons, including the wide range of temporal and spatial scales (many orders of magnitude each), the complex three-dimensional geometry of some geological structures, inherent spatial nature of the data, and the difficulty of making temporal inferences from spatial observations. To successful implement the step of developing a SG&T data system, we must simultaneously solve three problems: 1) How to digitize SG&T data; 2) How to design a software system that is applicable; and 3) How to construct a very flexible user interface.\nTo address the first problem, we introduce the “Spot” concept, which allows tracking of hierarchical and spatial relations between structures at all scales, and will link map scale, mesoscale, and laboratory scale data. A Spot, in this sense, is analogous to the beam size of analytical equipment used for in situ analysis of rocks; it is the size over which a measurement or quantity is applicable. A Spot can be a single measurement, an aggregation of individual measurements, or even establish relationships between numerous other Spots. We address the second problem through the use of a Graph database to better preserve the myriad of potentially complex relationships.\nIn order to construct a flexible user interface that follows a natural workflow, and that serves the needs of the community, we have begun the process of engaging the SG&T community in order to utilize the expertise of a large group of scientists to ensure the quality and usability of this data system. These activities have included Town Halls, subdiscipline-specific workshops to develop community standards, and pilot projects to test the data system in the field during the study of a variety of geologic structures.",

            "abstract": "Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) is a principal conduit for huge volumes of fresh groundwater loss and is a key transport mechanism for nutrient and contaminant pollution to coastal zones worldwide. However, the volumes and spatially and temporally variable nature of SGD is poorly known and requires rapid and high-resolution data acquisition at the scales in which it is commonly observed. Airborne thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing, using high-altitude manned aircraft and low-altitude remote-controlled unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs or \"Drones\") are uniquely qualified for this task, and applicable wherever 0.1°C temperature contrasts exist between discharging and receiving waters. We report on the use of these technologies in combination with in situ radon model studies of SGD volume and nutrient flux from three of the largest Hawaiian Islands. High altitude manned aircraft results produce regional (~300m wide x 100s km coastline) 0.5 to 3.2 m-resolution sea-surface temperature maps accurate to 0.7°C that show point-source and diffuse flow in exquisite detail. Using UAVs offers cost-effective advantages of higher spatial and temporal resolution and instantaneous deployments that can be coordinated simultaneously with any ground-based effort. We demonstrate how TIR-mapped groundwater discharge plume areas may be linearly and highly correlated to in situ groundwater fluxes. We also illustrate how in situ nutrient data may be incorporated into infrared imagery to produce nutrient distribution maps of regional worth. These results illustrate the potential for volumetric quantification and up-scaling of small- to regional-scale SGD. These methodologies provide a tremendous advantage for identifying and differentiating spring-fed, point-sourced, and/or diffuse groundwater discharge into oceans, estuaries, and streams. The integrative techniques are also important precursors for developing best-use and cost-effective strategies for otherwise time-consuming in situ studies, and represent a substantial new asset for land use and coastal zone research and management.",

            "abstract": "Oceanic transform faults (OTFs) are considered to have relatively simple structure [thermal, geometric, compositional], with the brittle-ductile transition defined by the 600-800ºC isotherm. Earthquakes on these faults account for less than half of the expected slip (Boettcher & Jordan, 2004), leaving the majority of motion to be accommodated aseismically.\nThe 2015 MW7.1 Charlie-Gibbs transform earthquake is the latest of seven large [M≥6.25] earthquakes that form two quasi-repeating sequences dating back to 1920. These two sequences are separated by a region of persistent aseismicity in the center of the transform, interpreted to be a rupture barrier that prevents the full extent of the transform from rupturing in a single earthquake. However, aseismic rupture barriers alone cannot account for the inferred deficit in the seismic budget of OTFs.\nA growing catalogue of slip distributions has revealed distinctive behavior for large OTF earthquakes. We present evidence from teleseismic body wave modeling for directivity and slip distribution of four MW ≥ 7.0 oceanic strike-slip earthquakes: the 2015 MW7.1 Charlie-Gibbs transform earthquake in the North Atlantic, the 2015 MW7.0 Fourier transform earthquake in the South Atlantic, and the 2013 MW7.3 and 2006 MW7.4 South Sandwich transform earthquakes in the Southern Ocean. Each earthquake initiates near the ridge with nominal slip then propagates unilaterally to rupture larger asperities nearer the middle of the transform, similar to behavior observed for the 1994 MW7.0 Romanche transform earthquake. Significant continental strike-slip earthquakes, such as the 2002 MW7.9 Denali earthquake and the 2001 MW7.8 Kunlun earthquake, also exhibit unilateral ruptures with a small initial slip.\nThe slip distributions of large oceanic transform earthquakes suggest that seismic coupling of OTFs varies considerably along strike, with large slip asperities separated by areas of little or no slip. Substantial earthquakes are not observed in these areas of unresolvable co-seismic slip. This suggests that motion is accommodated both aseismically during the interseismic period and seismically during large earthquakes. Such multimode fault behavior has implications for quantifying seismic hazard along other faults with aseismic and creeping sections.",

A better understanding of where it is and how it is changing will enable better management of this valuable resource and guide protection of sensitive ecological areas. Global water maps have typically been representations of surface water at one given time. However, there is both seasonal and interannual variability: rivers meander, lakes disappear, floods arise. To address this ephemeral nature of water, in this study University of Maryland has developed a method that analyzes every Landsat 5, 7, and 8 scene from 1999-2015 to produce global seasonal maps (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall) of surface water dynamics from 2000-2014. Each Landsat scene is automatically classified into land, water, cloud, haze, shadow, and snow via a decision tree algorithm. The land and water observations are aggregated per pixel into percent occurrence of water in a 3 year moving window for each meteorological season. These annual water percentages form a curve for each season that is discretized into a continuous 3 band RGB map. Frequency of water observation and type of surface water change (loss, gain, peak, or dip) is clearly seen through brightness and hue respectively. Additional data layers include: the year the change began, peak year, minimum year, and the year the change process ended. Currently these maps have been created for 18 1°x1° test tiles scattered around the world, and a portion of the September-November map over Bangladesh is shown below. The entire Landsat archive from 1999-2015 will be processed through a partnership with Google Earth Engine to complete the global product in the coming months. In areas where there is sufficient satellite data density (e.g. the United States), this project could be expanded to 1984-2015. This study provides both scientific researchers and the public an understandable, temporally rich, and globally consistent map showing surface water changes over time.",

            "abstract": "Measurements of upper-tropospheric water vapor and cloud ice at a variety of local times are critically needed to provide information not currently available from microwave sensors in sun-synchronous orbits. Such global measurements would enable increasingly accurate cloud and moisture simulations in global circulation models, improving both climate predictions and knowledge of their uncertainty. In addition, this capability would address the need for measurements of cloud ice particle size distribution and water content in both clean and polluted environments. Complementary measurements of aerosol pollution would allow investigation of its effects on cloud properties and climate. This is particularly important since the uncertainty in the aerosol effect on climate is at least four times as great as the uncertainty in greenhouse gas effects.\nTo address this unmet need, a collaborative team among Colorado State University, Caltech Jet Propulsion Laboratory and Northrop Grumman Corporation is developing and fabricating the Tropospheric Water and Cloud ICE (TWICE) radiometer instrument. TWICE is designed with size, mass, power consumption and downlink data rate compatible with deployment aboard a 6U-Class nanosatellite. TWICE is advancing the state of the art of spaceborne millimeter- and submillimeter-wave radiometers by transitioning from Schottky mixer-based front ends to InP HEMT MMIC low-noise amplifier front ends, substantially reducing the radiometer’s mass, volume and power consumption. New low-noise amplifiers and related front-end components are being designed and fabricated by JPL and Northrop Grumman based on InP HEMT MMIC technology up to 670 GHz. The TWICE instrument will provide 16 radiometer channels, including window frequencies near 240, 310 and 670 GHz to perform ice particle sizing and determine total ice water content, as well as four sounding channels each near 118 GHz for temperature sounding and near 183 GHz and 380 GHz for water vapor sounding during nearly all weather conditions, particularly useful in the upper troposphere in the presence of ice clouds.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Poster.pdf\nPrevious work has shown that the presence of biological soil crusts (BSCs) may affect the concentrations of uranium and other transition metals by influencing metal dissolution, solubility, and transport.(1) These effects may provide a proxy for the presence of microbial mat communities in paleosols, possibly constraining the timing of the rise of early terrestrial ecosystems. Thus, in an effort to uncover possible biosignatures, this study examines metal abundances in modern desert BSCs as a possible analogue for early terrestrial life.\nWe present results from a preliminary study comparing crusted and uncrusted soils from a low-desert site near Casa Grande, Arizona. Seventeen 5-cm soil cores were collected and the bulk elemental composition of the top 1 cm of crusted (9 samples) and non-crusted (8 samples) soils were analyzed by quadrupole ICP-MS with a typical measurement precision between 2-5%. Metal concentrations were normalized to aluminum (Al) to minimize dilution effects due to variations in carbonate and quartz content.\nAlthough the mean concentrations of nearly all elements were similar in crusted and uncrusted sites, the variability in the normalized concentrations of some of the elements, such as uranium, were different between crusted and uncrusted sites. The average U/Al ratio at the crusted site was 25 ± 1 µg U/ g Al and the average U/Al ratio at the uncrusted site was 27 ± 4 µg U/ g Al. Bartlett’s and Levene’s tests were used to confirm that the U/Al ratio was significantly more variable in the uncrusted sites as compared to the crusted sites. Iron (Fe), vanadium (V) and cesium (Cs) showed a similar pattern which was significant under Bartlett’s but not Levene’s test.\nAs U, Fe, and V solubility and transport are redox-sensitive, we hypothesize that their aqueous mobility could have been impacted by diurnal redox swings in the photosynthetic crusts, possibly resulting in the homogenization of local cm-scale variations in background soil concentrations. Future work will test this hypothesis by 1) analyzing samples from a wider range of sites to determine if this pattern is robust and 2) measuring 238U/235U ratios throughout the crust profile to determine if there is evidence for redox-dependent cycling and fractionation of U within modern BSCs.\n(1) Beraldi-Campesi, H. et al.

Some of the stations are co-located on previous monitoring sites that allow for an extended period of record. Stage-discharge relationships have been built with high degrees of confidence at each station, and stream isotope data have been taken to better determine sources of water and fractionation of precipitation into runoff components. In addition to runoff observations we have multiple weather stations and use geophysical methods to investigate the subsurface and better characterize potential flow pathways and remote sensing and field methods to characterize the watersheds. From these data we have observed a high degree in variability in runoff characteristics among these sites, including significant differences in annual runoff, proportion of baseflow, rainfall/runoff efficiency, and hydrologic regime. Analyses of nested runoff data reveal longitudinal and seasonal changes in surface and subsurface flow, which allow us to identify the timing and location of groundwater contributions and channel transmission to regional aquifers. Differences among the watershed responses are augmented by precipitation, and we identify stream reaches that change from effluent to influent depending on timing and magnitude of runoff. We explored physical interpretations for the observed variability, including management, beetle impacts, and subsurface characteristics as inferred from geophysical data.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Final Indicators Poster ESA August 2015.pdf\nIndicators are observations or calculations that are used to systematically report or forecast social and biophysical conditions over time. When the purpose of indicators is to, in part, provide complex scientific information that is understood by non-scientists and included in decision processes, the choice of indicators requires a structured process that includes co-production among a range of actors, including scientists, decision-makers, and a range of stakeholders. Here we describe recommendations on a vision and a prototype created for an indicators system, we term the National Climate Indicators System (NCIS). The goal of the NCIS is to create a system of physical, natural, and societal indicators to communicate and inform decisions about climate changes, impacts, vulnerabilities, and responses. The process of generating the indicator system involved input from over 200 subject-matter experts. Organized into 13 teams, experts created conceptual models of their respective sectors to generate an initial recommended set of indicators. A subset of indicators, which could be immediately implemented, were prototyped for the U.S. Global Change Research Program (USGCRP) a Federal program that coordinates and supports integration of global change research across the government. USGCRP reviewed the recommendations (Kenney et al., 2014) and prototypes provided by the scientific experts, and recently launched 14 indicators as proof-of-concept in support of a sustained National Climate Assessment and to solicit feedback from the users. Social science research is currently being undertaken in order to evaluate how well the prototype indicators communicate science to non-scientists, the usability of indicator system portal by scientists and decision-makers, and the development of information visualization guidelines to improve visual communication effectiveness. The goal of such efforts would be to provide input into the development of a more comprehensive USGCRP indicator set, building on recommendations from Kenney et al. (2014), and improve our understanding of the comprehension and use of indicators by non-scientists.",

Pioneering geologic mapping of MVF by Rytuba and McKee (1984) and subsequent work established four main ignimbrites within the field. Our new 40Ar/39Ar ages (FCT=28.02 Ma) are 16.41±0.02 (±2σ) Ma for Tuff of Oregon Canyon, 16.35±0.04 Ma for Tuff of Trout Creek Mountains, 16.30±0.04 Ma for Tuff of Long Ridge, and 15.56±0.08 Ma for Tuff of Whitehorse Creek. We have mapped two previously unrecognized overlapping calderas that we interpret as sources for Tuff of Oregon Canyon and Tuff of Trout Creek. These ~20-km diameter calderas lie north of the well-known McDermitt Caldera; a smaller 7-km caldera that formed on eruption of the Tuff of Whitehorse Creek is nested within them. Argon ages and geochemistry of alkali rhyolite lava domes in the northern MVF define two populations: ~16.6-16.3 Ma associated with the newly recognized calderas, and ~15.5-15.3 Ma outlining the margins of the younger Whitehorse Caldera.\nConsistent with both ignimbrites erupting from the same evolving magma system, the high-silica alkali rhyolite Tuff of Oregon Canyon lies on compositional trends defined by the Tuff of Trout Creek, which is zoned from a moderately crystal-rich high-silica alkali rhyolite to a strongly porphyritic low-silica alkali rhyolite. They both are distinguished from the Tuff of Long Ridge from McDermitt Caldera by their higher Zr/Rb, and relatively high FeO* concentrations distinguish all MVF ignimbrites from ignimbrites from the nearby High Rock Caldera Complex, where the oldest caldera formed on eruption of the Idaho Canyon Tuff at 16.38±0.02 Ma (Coble and Mahood, in review).\nThe Tuff of Trout Creek rests conformably on the Tuff of Oregon Canyon west and southwest of the calderas, where they overlie a thick stack of Steens Basalt lavas. To the east and southeast the two ignimbrites are separated by as much as ~100m of Steens Basalt and ~150m of overlying trachyte lavas. Intrusion beneath the caldera of magma that continued to erupt elsewhere as mafic to intermediate lavas may have rejuvenated the Oregon Canyon magma chamber, which ultimately led to eruption of the Tuff of Trout Creek ~100 ky later.",

This large displacement was largely unexpected for this region and was mainly responsible for the very large and damaging tsunami along the northeast coast of Honshu. We investigate the possibility of large slip to the trench in great earthquakes for other subduction zones around the world. Since the trench region is generally far offshore, it is often difficult to resolve the amount of slip from onshore geodetic and strong-motion data. We use a variety of observations, including slip distribution models, aftershock locations, local coastal deformation, and tsunami heights to determine which events likely had large amounts of slip close to the trench. Tsunami earthquakes, such as 1992 Nicaragua and 2006 Java likely had large shallow slip. Some typical subduction earthquakes, such as 1968 Tokachi-oki and 2003 Tokachi-oki (located in regions north of the source area of the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake) likely did not.\nWe will discuss possible factors that influence the slip distribution on the shallow area of subduction megathrusts. Using results from the Japan Trench Fast Drilling Project (JFAST) which sampled the fault in the region of large slip, we can begin to understand the conditions of very large fault slip, such as the characteristic fault zone material and level of friction on the fault.",

The NAC3 project encompasses many facets, including joint international courses, student internships, economic development, service learning, and applied research. In its first phase, the project has generated myriad outcomes and opportunities for bridging STEM disciplines with other fields to holistically and collaboratively address specific human-environmental issues falling under the broad umbrella of climate change. WKU and UNAK students desire interaction and exposure to other cultures and regions that are threatened by climate change and Iceland presents a unique opportunity to study influences such as oceanic processes, island economies, sustainable harvest of fisheries, and Arctic influences on climate change.

            "abstract": "China is currently experiencing some of the worst pollution problems on Earth. The increase in nitrogen deposition from industrial pollution sources over the past 30 years, has been substantial enough to increase foliar N uptake in plants growing in unfertilized fields and forests throughout China. The δ15N signature of foliage and soil have been used to infer changes in the biogeochemical cycling of N in the surrounding ecosystem. The current understanding of global trends in foliar δ15N however, is limited for the East Asia and Pacific region. Most of the research to date has been conducted in temperate and boreal forests of North America and Europe. In this study, two forested sites were sampled on the Loess Plateau, approximately 80km east of the city of Xi’an, Shaanxi Province, China. The study sites are 1 and 4km down wind of an industrial center including a large nitrogen fertilizer plant. Ecosystem components sampled include soil, forest floor, bole wood, and foliage. We use a combination of δ15N and δ13C of the tree rings, foliage, and soil as indicators of a changing nitrogen cycle and the physiological response of Chinese parasol trees (Firmiana simplex) over time. CN ratios at the study sites suggest that both forested stands are saturated with respect to N. A positive correlation between soil N and foliar δ15N is attributed to the leaching of N depleted in 15N with increasing N availability. Despite this positive correlation within the study area, overall foliar δ15N with a mean of -8.2‰ is low relative to foliage sampled in regions with lower atmospheric N inputs. Foliage and bole wood samples closest to the industrial center have higher δ13C, which is consistent with greater exposure to NOx emissions. While difference in δ15N of ecosystem components between sites is consistent with global trends, the absolute values for the whole study area are relatively low and attributed to N inputs from industrial sources depleted in 15N.",

            "abstract": "Research activities are iterative, collaborative, and now data- and compute-intensive. Such research activities mean that even the many researchers who work in small laboratories must often create, acquire, manage, and manipulate much diverse data and keep track of complex software. They face difficult data and software management challenges, and data sharing and reproducibility are neglected. There is signficant federal investment in powerful cyberinfrastructure, in part to lesson the burden associated with modern data- and compute-intensive research. Similarly, geoscience communities are establishing research repositories to facilitate data preservation. Yet we observe a large fraction of the geoscience community continues to struggle with data and software management. The reason, studies suggest, is not lack of awareness but rather that tools do not adequately support time-consuming data life cycle activities.\nThrough NSF/EarthCube-funded GeoDataspace project, we are building personalized, shareable dataspaces that help scientists connect their individual or research group efforts with the community at large. The dataspaces provide a light-weight multiplatform research data management system with tools for recording research activities in what we call geounits, so that a geoscientist can at any time snapshot and preserve, both for their own use and to share with the community, all data and code required to understand and reproduce a study. A software-as-a-service (SaaS) deployment model enhances usability of core components, and integration with widely used software systems. In this talk we will present the open-source GeoDataspace project and demonstrate how it is enabling reproducibility across geoscience domains of hydrology, space science, and modeling toolkits.",

            "abstract": "Despite substantial efforts to improve the modeling and prediction of low streamflows at ungauged river sites, most models of low streamflow statistics create estimators with large errors. Often this is because the hydrogeologic characteristics of a watershed, which can strongly impact low streamflows, are difficult to characterize. One solution is to take a nominal number of streamflow measurements at an ungauged site to either estimate improved hydrogeologic indices or correlate with concurrent streamflow measurements at a nearby gauged river site. Past results have indicated that baseflow correlation performs better than regional regression when 4 or more streamflow measurements are available, even when the regional regression models are augmented by improved hydrogeologic indices. Here we revisit this issue within the 19,800 square mile Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint watershed, a USGS WaterSMART region spanning Geogia, southeastern Alabama, and northwestern Florida. This study area is of particular interest because numerous watershed modeling analyses have previously been performed using gauged river sites within this basin. Initial results indicate that baseflow correlation can produce improved estimators when spot-measurements are available, but selection of an appropriate donor site is problematic, especially in regions with a small number of gauged river sites. Estimation of hydrogeologic indices do improve regional regression models, but these models are generally outperformed by baseflow correlation.",

However, the effects of temperature increase on the quality of underground water has yet to be fully investigated. In order to reduce the risks of ground-water pollution by the installed GSHPs, it is important to evaluate the effect of temperature change on the ground-water quality. In this study, we installed a closed loop GSHP system on a heat exchange well along with a monitoring well drilled to measure ground-water quality and temperature. The monitoring well was drilled at 0.1cm away from the heat exchange well. We observed that changes of temperature in the heat exchange well affected the water quality, especially turbidity, in gravelly layer.",

The enhanced dynamic pressure lasted for about 24 hours, but magnetic storm was not occurred. The impact of the interplanetary shock on 13 April 2013 produced dipolarization of the magnetic field for a few minutes, which was simultaneously observed by VAP A and B moving in the nightside region. The enhancement of the electron fluxes with E < ~600 keV coincidentally occurred during the dipolarization. Later, drift echoes with energy dispersion and ULF-like modulations were observed. By comparing the measurements from VAP A and B we will discuss spatial and temporal characteristics of the enhancement of the energetic electron fluxes.",

            "abstract": "Deltas are important depositional systems because many large hydrocarbon reservoirs in the world today are found in delta deposits. Deltas form when water and sediments carried by fluvial channels are emptied to an open body of water, and form delta shaped deposits. Depending on the relative importance of the physical processes that controls the forming and the growth of deltas, deltas can often be classified into three different types, namely fluvial, tidal and wave dominated delta. Many previous works, using examples from modern systems, tank experiments, outcrops, and 2 and 3D seismic data sets, have studied the shape, morphology and stratigraphic architectures corresponding to each of the deltas’ types. However, few studies have focused on the change of these properties as a function of the relative change of the key controls, and most of the studies are qualitative.\nHere, using computer simulations, the dynamics of delta evolutions under an increasing amount of tidal influences are studied. The computer model used is fully based on the physics of fluid flow and sediment transport. In the model, tidal influences are taken into account by setting proper boundary conditions that varies both temporally and spatially. The model is capable of capturing many important natural geomorphic and sedimentary processes in fluvial and tidal systems, such as channel initiation, formation of channel levees, growth of mouth bars, bifurcation of channels around channel mouth bars, and channel avulsion. By systematically varying tidal range and fluvial input, the following properties are investigated quantitatively: (1) the presence and the form of tidal beds as a function of tidal range, (2) change of stratigraphic architecture of distributary channel mouth bars or tidal bars as tidal range changes, (3) the transport and sorting of different grainsizes and the overall facie distributions in the delta with different tidal ranges, and (4) the conditions and locations of mud drapes with different magnitude of tidal forcing.",

Superposed epoch analysis of Alfvénic activity of storm periods demonstrates a sharp increase in the number of observed Alfvén waves, peaking near sudden commencement and then monotonically decreasing (in a statistical sense) through the main and recovery phases, returning within two or three days of storm commencement to background levels of Alfvénic activity. Stormtime Alfvén events are statistically more likely to be observed at lower latitudes relative to geomagnetically quiet periods, and are also more likely to occur at pre-midnight longitudes.\nFor the same 37 storms, superposed epoch analysis of ion upflow measurements associated with each Alfvénic FAC not only shows an increase overall number of upflowing ions increases due to the increase in Alfvén activity, but also an increase in the average intensity of ion upflow; this suggests a nonlinear relationship between occurrence rates of Alfvén waves and upflow intensity. We explore one such possibility in terms of the magnitude of the current density and the intensity of upflowing ions related to Alfvénic FACs.",

            "abstract": "Due to global climate change, bioaerosols are more globally mixed with a more random manner. During a long-distance traveling dust event, the number of microbes significantly increases in bioaerosol, and the chance for bioaerosol to contain human pathogenic microorganisms may also increase. Recently, we have found that bioaerosol microbial community characteristics (copy number of total bacterial 16S rRNA genes, and population diversity and composition) are correlated with the quantitative detection of potential human pathogens. However, bioaerosol microbial community characteristics cannot be directly used in real-time monitoring because the DNA-based detection method requires at least couple days or a week to get reliable data. To circumvent this problem, a correlation of microbial community characteristics with real-time measurable environmental items (PM10, PM2.5, temperature, humidity, NOx, O3 etc.), if any, will be useful in frequent assessment of microbial risk from available real-time measured environmental data. In this work, we monitored bioaerosol microbial communities using a high-throughput DNA sequencing method (Mi-seq) during the KORUS-AQ (KoreaUS-Air Quality) pre-campaign (May to June, 2015) in Seoul, and investigated whether any correlation exists between the bioaerosol microbial community characteristics and the real-time measureable environmental items simultaneously attained during the pre-campaign period. At the pre-campaign site (Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Seoul), bioaerosol samples were collected using high volume air sampler, and their 16S rRNA gene based bacterial communities were analyzed by Miseq sequencing and bioinformatics. Simultaneously, atmosphere environmental items were monitored at the same site. Using Decision Tree, a non-linear multi-variant correlation was observed between the bioaerosol microbial community characteristics and the real-time measured atmosphere chemistry data, and a rule induction was developed to assess bacterial community characteristics from the real-time measurable chemistry data. The findings suggest that it is promising to develop a new method in real-time assessing bioaerosol microbial risk from diverse real-time measured data including satellite and flight monitoring.",

            "abstract": "An ongoing problem in understanding the evolution of the Himalayan-Tibetan Orogen is determining how much shortening and thickening of the crust occurred before the Cenozoic collision between India and Eurasia. Whereas previously-determined values for the timing and magnitude of internal shortening in the Pamir as a whole suggest >340 km of Cenozoic internal shortening and 150 km within the Southern Pamir alone (Burtman and Molnar, 1993), recent work indicates the magnitude of shortening may be much less. In the Southern Pamir, for example, shortening formerly-interpreted as a Cenozoic nappe structure, which accounted for approximately 100 km of the 150 km, has recently been shown to be a detachment fault bounding a Cenozoic gneiss dome (Stubner et al. 2013). Our study aims to address the timing and magnitude of shortening in the Southern Pamir. The Pamir has had a protracted history of deformation due to the accretion of Gondwana terranes and subsequent tectonism. A post accretion Jurassic carbonate platform within the Central and Southern Pamir provides an ideal strain marker for evaluating the magnitude of post-suturing deformation. Further, syn-tectonic terrigenous deposits associated with deformation of the Jurassic carbonates provide means of addressing the timing of their deformation through detrital zircon maximum depositional ages. Preliminary detrital zircon results from our work and other studies indicate shortening occurred during the Early to Middle Cretaceous, prior to the collision of India and Eurasia, rather than during the Cenozoic as previously interpreted. Further, our geologic field mapping and cross section analysis suggest post-Jurassic internal shortening in the Southern Pamir is ~7 km, much less than the 50 km previously suggested. Our results of this study indicate that internal upper crustal shortening in the Pamir is significantly less than previously proposed and is largely Cretaceous in age rather than Cenozoic.",

            "abstract": "Bed load transport in steep headwater channels is complex because of the particle size distribution, topography, channel roughness, and sediment supply from adjacent hillslope. We monitored movement bed load sediment using PIT tags in a steep headwater channel segments. Study area is located in 7.0ha Oobora-sawa observatory from 50km west of Tokyo metropolitan. Annual precipitation is 3000mm and mean temperature is 10°. Annual bed load sediment yields in the study catchment was from 6.5 to 7.6 t/ha/yr. Mean channel gradient is 24° with 0.5m low flow width. The channel is consisted by 0.2 to 1.6m interval of step-pool sequences. Based on pebble count method, D10, D50 and D90 of channel substrate were 8, 28 and 206mm respectively. We deployed 134 bed load tracers with five classes of diameter ranges (Class1:17.7, Class2:24.8, Class3:35.8, Class4:54.1 and Class5:83.8mm). Selected tracers represented from D20 to D77 of channel bed substrates. PIT tags (diameter 2mm, length 9mm and weight 0.1g) were placed into the particles by drilling and refilled with non-corrosive epoxy. We investigated the movement of bed load tracers every major storm event since February 2015. Channel morphology was measured using photographic survey and topographic model was developed using software of Surface from motion (PhotoScan). Mean bed load movement in the 5 storm event with 438 mm total and 33 mm maximum intensity was 168 mm. Then 51 mm of bed load movement occurred in 43 mm total and 16 mm intensity of rainfall. Recurrence interval of the two storm event was 1 and 4 year respectively. Receivable rates of bed load tracers was 70 and 74 % in the two events. Mobilized bed load (7 to 18%) deposited at cascade, pool and riffle, and among step clusters. Mobilized bed load tracers is rather random and we do not find any patterns for particle size for the movement and distance. Our field monitoring showed that bed load tracers were not mobilized for storm events with 10.5mm/h intensity of rainfall. The intermittency of movement of bed load was also observed in the sediment ponds at catchment outlets.",

            "abstract": "Given that soil organic matter (SOM) is the largest global terrestrial carbon (C) pool, some fractions of which have turnover times of centuries to millennia, it is critical to understand the mechanisms by which higher net primary productivity (NPP) and higher litter inputs, in the future, as predicted by some models, might alter the potentials of forest soils to serve as long-term C sinks. Here, we use a 10-year-old site in the DIRT (Detritus Input and Removal Treatments) network of litter manipulations to compare plots in a forested, northern-temperate sandy soil that were subjected to double-leaf-litter additions (DL) and both root- and leaf-litter removals (no inputs, NI) to non-manipulated controls. Previous data show that rather than increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, plots receiving doubled litter inputs lose SOC at rates similar to losses in Control soils. To trace the source of extra mineralized SOC, we analyzed field CO2 effluxes for δ13C and characterized SOC of varying degrees of organo-mineral association with sequential density fractionations.\nSoils in DL plots respired significantly faster (p=0.095) and proportionally more (p=0.015) than control soils over the course of July, August, and October 2014. This suggests a greater fresh litter contribution to soil efflux in DL than in Control plots after 10 years of treatment. Preliminary data show that intermediate (1.85 - 2.4 g/mL) and dense (>2.4 g/mL) fractions are relatively larger in DL than in Control soils. This suggests that the addition C from doubled litter could be more rapidly transferred into those more dense fractions, or that higher litter inputs prime the decomposition of lighter particulate SOC forms, leading to a relative increase of the dense organo-mineral associations. Using δ13C values to parameterize a multi-source mixing model, we partition the fate of both fresh litter and partially-decomposed SOC and will present on the modeled relative contributions of various sources to field CO2 effluxes from diverse treatments.\nOur preliminary data and expected results may suggest important contributions from mineral-associated SOC, rather than simply from free SOC, to seasonal field soil respiration. Thus, with higher litterfall rates, C that similar forest soils sequester may exhibit shorter ecosystem-level residence times.",

Although they only represent 3 % of the total forest area (or 0.01 % of land area), C emissions from mangrove destruction alone at current rates could be equivalent to 10 % of carbon emissions from deforestation.\nOne of the main challenges to implementing carbon mitigation projects is measuring carbon, efficiently, effectively, and safely. In mangroves especially, the extreme difficulty of the terrain has hindered the establishment of sufficient field plots needed to accurately measure carbon on the scale necessary to relate remotely sensed measurements with field measurements at accuracies required for REDD and other C trading mechanisms. In this presentation we will showcase the methodologies for, and the remote sensing products necessary to implement MRV (monitoring, reporting and verification) systems in Coastal Blue Carbon ecosystems. Specifically, we will present new methods to estimate aboveground biomass stocks and change in mangrove ecosystems using remotely sensed data from Interferometric SAR from the TanDEM-X mission, commercial airborne Lidar, High Resolution Stereo-imagery, and timeseries analysis of Landsat imagery in combination with intensive field measurements of above and belowground carbon stocks. Our research is based on the hypothesis that by combining field measurements, commercial airborne Lidar, optical and Pol-InSAR data, we are able to estimate Mangrove blue carbon storage with an error under 20% at the project level and permit the evaluation of UNFCCC mechanisms for the mitigation of carbon emissions from coastal ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "In west-central Florida, wetland and lake distribution is strongly controlled by karst landforms. Sandhill wetlands and lakes are sand-filled upland basins whose water levels are groundwater driven. Lake dimensions only reach wetland edges during extreme precipitation events. Current wetland classification schemes are inappropriate for identifying sandhill wetlands due to their unique hydrologic regime and ecologic expression. As a result, it is difficult to determine whether or not a wetland is impacted by groundwater pumping, development, and climate change. A better understanding of subsurface structures and how they control the hydrologic regime is necessary for development of an identification and monitoring protocol.\nLong-term studies record vegetation diversity and distribution, shallow ground water levels and surface water levels. The overall goals are to determine the hydrologic controls (groundwater, seepage, surface water inputs). Most recently a series of geophysical surveys was conducted at select sites in Hernando and Pasco County, Florida. Electrical resistivity and ground penetrating radar were employed to image sand-filled basins and the top of the limestone bedrock and stratigraphy of wetland slopes, respectively.\nThe deepest extent of these sand-filled basins is generally reflected in topography as shallow depressions. Resistivity along inundated wetlands suggests the pools are surface expressions of the surficial aquifer. However, possible breaches in confining clay layers beneath topographic highs between depressions are seen in resistivity profiles as conductive anomalies and in GPR as interruptions in otherwise continuous horizons. These data occur at sites where unconfined and confined water levels are in agreement, suggesting communication between shallow and deep groundwater.\nWetland plants are observed outside the historic wetland boundary at many sites, GPR profiles show near-surface layers dipping towards the wetlands at a shallower angle than the slope. Wetlands plants are often found where these layers are truncated by the slope suggesting seepage of unconfined aquifer and a new wetland boundary.",

            "abstract": "A key potential uncertainty in estimating carbon stocks across multiple scales stems from the use of empirically calibrated allometric equations, which estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) from plant characteristics such as diameter at breast height (DBH) and/or height (H). The equations themselves contain significant and, at times, poorly characterized errors. Species-specific equations may be missing. Plant responses to their local biophysical environment may lead to spatially varying allometric relationships. The structural predictor may be difficult or impossible to measure accurately, particularly when derived from remote sensing data. All of these issues may lead to significant and spatially varying uncertainties in the estimation of AGB that are unexplored in the literature. We sought to quantify the errors in predicting AGB at the tree and plot level for vegetation plots in California. To accomplish this, we derived a generalized allometric equation (GAE) which we used to model the AGB on a full set of tree information such as DBH, H, taxonomy, and biophysical environment. The GAE was derived using published allometric equations in the GlobAllomeTree database. The equations were sparse in details about the error since authors provide the coefficient of determination (R2) and the sample size. A more realistic simulation of tree AGB should also contain the noise that was not captured by the allometric equation. We derived an empirically corrected variance estimate for the amount of noise to represent the errors in the real biomass. Also, we accounted for the hierarchical relationship between different species by treating each taxonomic level as a covariate nested within a higher taxonomic level (e.g. species < genus). This approach provides estimation under incomplete tree information (e.g. missing species) or blurred information (e.g. conjecture of species), plus the biophysical environment. The GAE allowed us to quantify contribution of each different covariate in estimating the AGB of trees. Lastly, we applied the GAE to an existing vegetation plot database - Forest Inventory and Analysis database - to derive per-tree and per-plot AGB estimations, their errors, and how much the error could be contributed to the original equations, the plant’s taxonomy, and their biophysical environment.",

In particular, other distributions have been proposed to better fit observations, for example, kappa-distributions. If present, these distributions will generate radio emissions with different observable properties compared with the classical gyroresonance (GR) or free–free emission, which implies a way of remotely detecting these kappa distributions in the radio observations. Here we present analytically derived GR and free–free emissivities and absorption coefficients for the kappa-distribution, and discuss their properties, which are in fact remarkably different from the classical Maxwellian plasma. In particular, the radio brightness temperature from a gyrolayer increases with the optical depth τ for kappa-distribution. This property has a remarkable consequence allowing a straightforward observational test: the GR radio emission from the non-Maxwellian distributions is supposed to be noticeably polarized even in the optically thick case, where the emission would have strictly zero polarization in the case of Maxwellian plasma. This offers a way of remote probing the plasma distribution in astrophysical sources, including solar active regions as a vivid example. In this report, we present analytical formulae and computer codes to calculate the emission parameters. We simulate the gyroresonance emission under the conditions typical of the solar active regions and compare the results for different electron distributions. We discuss the implications of our findings for interpretation of radio observations.\nThis work was supported in part by NSF grants AGS-1250374 and AGS-1262772, NASA grant NNX14AC87G to New Jersey Institute of Technology and RFBR grants 15-02-01089, 15-02-03717, 15-02-03835, and 15-02-08028.",

The unique geological setting of Ruapehu, New Zealand, allows investigation on the effect of enhanced regional extensional crustal tension on the eruptive behaviour of subduction-zone volcanoes. The composite cone is located at the southwestern terminus of the Taupo Volcanic Zone, one of the most active silicic magma systems on Earth, which extends through the central part of New Zealand’s North Island. Rhyolitic caldera eruptions are limited to its central part where crustal extension is highest, whereas lower extension and additional dextral shear dominate in the southwestern and northeastern segments characterized by andesitic volcanism. South of Ruapehu, the intra-arc rift zone traverses into a compressional geological setting with updoming marine sequences dissected by reverse and normal faults. The current eruptive behaviour of Ruapehu is dominated by small-scaled vulcanian eruptions, but our studies indicate that subplinian to plinian eruptions have frequently occurred since ≥340 ka and were usually preceded by major rhyolitic caldera unrest in the Taupo Volcanic Zone. Pre-existing structures related to the NNW-SSE trending subduction-zone setting are thought to extend at depth and create preferred pathways for the silicic magma bodies, which may facilitate the development of large (>100 km3) dyke-like upper-crustal storage systems prior to major caldera activity. This may cause enhanced extensional stress throughout the entire intra-arc setting, including the Ruapehu area. During periods of caldera dormancy, the thick crust underlying the volcano and the enhanced dextral share rate likely impede ascent of larger andesitic magma bodies, and storage of andesitic melts dominantly occurs within small-scaled magma bodies at middle- to lower-crustal levels. During episodes of major caldera unrest, ascent and storage of voluminous rhyolitic magma bodies at upper crustal levels may cause the extensional stress to supercede the dextral shear rate in the Ruapehu area, facilitating ascent of larger andesitic magma bodies at depth, and changing the volcano’s eruptive behaviour from dominantly vulcanian to violently subplinian/plinian.",

            "abstract": "The poorly understood atmospheric budget and distribution of molecular hydrogen (H2) have invited further research since the discovery that emissions from a hydrogen-based economy could have negative impacts on the global climate system and stratospheric ozone. The burgeoning fuel cell electric vehicle industry in the South Coast Air Basin of California (SoCAB) presents an opportunity to observe and constrain urban anthropogenic H2 emissions. This work presents the first H2 emissions estimate for the SoCAB and calculates an upper limit for the current rate of leakage from production and distribution infrastructure within the region. A top-down method utilized whole air samples collected during the Student Airborne Research Program (SARP) onboard the NASA DC-8 research aircraft from 23-25 June 2015 to estimate H2 emissions from combustion and non-combustion sources. H2:carbon monoxide (CO) and H2:carbon dioxide ratios from airborne observations were compared with experimentally established ratios from pure combustion source ratios and scaled with the well-constrained CO emissions inventory to yield H2 emissions of 24.9 ± 3.6 Gg a-1 (1σ) from combustion engines and 8.2 ± 4.7 Gg a-1 from non-combustion sources. Total daily production of H2 in the SoCAB was compared with the top-down results to estimate an upper limit leakage rate (5%) where all emissions not accounted for by incomplete combustion in engines were assumed to be emitted from H2 infrastructure. For bottom-up validation, the NOAA Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory dispersion model was run iteratively with all known stationary sources in attempt to constrain emissions. While this investigation determined that H2 emissions from non-combustion sources in the SoCAB are likely significant, more in-depth analysis is required to better predict the atmospheric implications of a hydrogen economy.",

We focus on two processes that dramatically and instantaneously change tributary long profiles: 1) Capture of tributaries by growing meander bends, and 2) Meander bend neck cutoffs on the main-stem that leave tributaries disconnected from base-level lowering. We focus on these two types of events because they provide clear examples of autogenic drivers of landscape disequilibrium at the sub-watershed scale in a landscape that is commonly argued to reflect steady tectonic forcing of base-level.\nWe show that tributary streams are significantly more likely to flow into the leading edge of meander bends, testifying to the repeated capture of tributaries by growing bends. Examples of eminent captures by migrating bends, and examples with large knick points along recently captured tributaries suggest that the autogenic capture of tributaries by growing bends is a fundamental cause of transience in tributary channels in this landscape. To demonstrate the influence of the process of meander bend neck cutoff on tributary long profile evolution, we compare the long profiles of 34 tributaries that were hung above the main-stem of the Smith River following neck cutoff events. These stagnated tributary channels typically exhibit large convexities that record ongoing lowering of the trunk stream. Measured heights of these hanging tributaries implies that the timescale of adjustment for tributaries following cutoff events is ~ 105-106 years. The timescale of adjustment of tributary channels following meander cutoff events is therefore comparable to or in excess of the time-scale of Pleistocene climate and sea-level variability. Our results therefore demonstrate that tributaries in the OCR are strongly overprinted by the effects of autogenic base-level changes triggered by meandering trunk streams.",

The rover navigated using GPS waypoint following and had 3 – 4 hr endurance at 5 km/hr while towing 60 – 70 kg of GPR equipment. Yeti’s low ground pressure allowed it to cross thinly bridged crevasses without interrupting a survey.\nIn Feb – Mar 2014, Yeti executed 23 autonomous GPR surveys covering 94 km of terrain on the ice transition to the main ice sheet in northwest Greenland. This was the first robotic effort directly to support manual crevasse surveys to map a safe route for vehicle travel, in this case a resupply traverse to Summit Station. Yeti towed a radar controller, 400 MHz antenna, GPS receiver and battery pack. Radar scan rate was 16 scans/m and pulse timing allowed good spatial resolution to about 20-m depth. The resulting data allowed us to map hundreds of subsurface crevasses and provide the results nightly to the manual survey team to compliment its efforts. We met our objectives: (a) to enhance operational efficiency of the concurrent manual surveys, and (b) to create a geo-referenced database of crevasse signatures to validate aerial- and satellite-based crevasse-mapping platforms.\nIn Oct – Nov 2014, we deployed Yeti in Antarctica to conduct systematic GPR surveys across a crevasse-ridden section of the shear margin between the Ross and McMurdo ice shelves and thereby gain insight into its state of fracture and long-term stability. Yeti flawlessly executed a total of 613 km of autonomous GPR surveys at temperatures as low as – 33ºC. The rover towed a a radar controlling a 400 MHz and a 200 MHz antenna, the latter added to profile 160 m through the ice sheet. The main survey grid covered 5.7 km x 5.0 km, with survey lines at 50-m spacing oriented west-east across the Shear Zone (575 km total length). Yeti’s tracks normally deviated only 1 – 2 m from a straight line between the two end waypoints. Interpreted features include crevasses up to 16 m wide with snowbridges up to 10 m thick and at least the upper 16 m of stratified marine basal ice.\nThese autonomous GPR surveys could not have been conducted safely using manual methods owing to the numerous, thinly bridged crevasses. Such systematic, repetitious measurements can enhance other Polar research projects.",

In an effort to develop the next generation of future leaders prepared for these challenges and opportunities, faculty from Western Kentucky University (WKU) and the University of Akureyri (UNAK), Iceland partnered to co-teach a course in climate change science and communication in Iceland. Students from both Institutions participated in the course to further enhance the cross-learning opportunity presented to the students. The 11-day course stationed out of three cities in Iceland, including Reykjavík, Vik, and Akureyri, the Icelandic gateway to the Arctic. In addition to undertaking field experiences such as hiking on glaciers, exploring ice caves, and touring geothermal plants, the group also hosted forums to discuss climate change with members of the Icelandic community, and completed The $100 Solution™ service-learning projects. A culminating point of the study abroad experience was a presentation by the students to persons from the University of Akureyri and representatives from the neighboring Icelandic communities about what they had learned about climate change science and communication during their travels. Through this experience, students were able to share their knowledge, which in turn gave them a deeper understanding of the issues they were learning throughout the study abroad program. In short, the program combined interdisciplinary learning, service-learning, and international understanding toward the goal of preparing the leaders of tomorrow with the skills to address climate change challenges.",

            "abstract": "A long-standing puzzle in the global carbon cycle is the increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2 and its relation to long-term carbon sink. This increase likely reflects enhanced biological activity in the Northern Hemisphere. It has been hypothesized that vegetation growth may have been stimulated by higher concentrations of CO2 as well as warming in recent decades, and more recently, the intensification of agriculture due to the use of high-productivity cultivars, fertilizer use and irrigation has been identified as a missing driver. However, the state-of-the-art carbon cycle models do not agree on the relative roles of such mechanisms. Furthermore, even the simulation of the mean seasonal cycle may be problematic. Yet most models predict large changes in the CO2 seasonal amplitude in the future, up to 75% increase in the CMIP5 ensemble. We analzye and review the evidence and mechanisms of such changes, based on CO2 and satellite vegetation observations and the TRENDY and CMIP5 models. We argue that detail spatial patterns and temporal variability, aspects often ignored and less well constrained, may be a key in delineating the mechanisms and therefore enhancing our confidence in future projection of both seasonal cycle and mean sink.",

Mean monthly precipitation values in the period 1971-2000 of Chenar Rahdar River basin were used for the estimation of drought severity. These precipitation time series have been used for estimation of Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for multiple time scales (1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12- months) for Chenar Rahdar River basin. The outputs of two Global Circulation Models HadCM3 and CGCM3 were applied for three socioeconomic scenarios, namely, SRES A1B, SRES A2 and SRES B2 for the assessment of climate change impact on droughts. The GCM outputs were downscaled to the Chenar Rahdar River basin of using a statistical methodology to estimate precipitation time series for three future periods 2011–2040 and 2041–2069 and 2070-100. A method has been proposed for the estimation of annual cumulative drought severity-time scale-frequency curves. These curves integrate the drought severity and frequency for various types of drought. The SPI time series and annual weighted cumulative drought severity were estimated and compared with the respective time series and values of the historical period 1970-2000. The results showed that the annual drought severity is increased for all hydrological areas and SPI time scales, with the socioeconomic scenario SRES A1B being the most extreme.",

            "abstract": "Mantle convection generates stress in the mantle and lithosphere. The lithosphere stress is responsible for localized deformation including seismic deformation at plate boundaries, and localized stress highs in lithosphere are also suggested to cause dynamically self-consistent generation of plate tectonics and continental lithosphere instability, as the stress exceeds a threshold or yield stress. Modeling load-induced deformation at oceanic islands (e.g., Hawaii) constrains lithospheric stress at 100-200 MPa in the plate interiors, leading to a lower limit on lithospheric yield stress (Zhong and Watts, 2013). However, convection-induced lithospheric stress is poorly understood, ranging from 500 MPa to tens of MPa as reported in mantle convection studies. The magnitude and distribution of lithospheric and mantle stress depend critically on buoyancy and viscosity, particularly the latter. Unfortunately, lithospheric and mantle viscosity is also poorly constrained. For example, the inferred lower mantle viscosity from post-glacial rebound and geoid modeling studies ranges from 1023 Pas to 1022 Pas (e.g., Mitrovica and Forte, 2004; Simons and Hager, 1996; Paulson et al., 2007). In addition to the stress, the lower mantle viscosity may also affect the time evolution of mantle structure including sinking rate of slabs and formation of the degree-2 mantle seismic structure. Therefore, it is important to develop independent constraints on mantle viscosity and convection-induced stress. In this study, I demonstrate that dynamic topography can be used to place first-order constraints on both lithospheric stress and mantle viscosity. For a given superadiabatic temperature difference across the mantle (e.g., 2500 K), a larger mantle viscosity (or a smaller Rayleigh number) leads to a larger lithospheric stress and a larger dynamic topography. To be consistent with the inferred dynamic topography, the lower mantle viscosity is constrained to be significantly smaller than 1023 Pas, and convection-induced lithospheric stress is unlikely to exceed 200 MPa (i.e., the yield stress for plate interiors). I will discuss the general implications of the results for mantle dynamics including dynamic generation of plate tectonics and the nature of mantle structures (i.e., slabs and plumes) as imaged seismically.",

            "abstract": "The combination of gravity and topography has been the method of choice to obtain quantitative information on the interior of Enceladus, but its application was challenging because of the small mass of the moon and the short gravitational interaction time with the Cassini spacecraft. The main observable quantity used in the estimation of the gravity field was the spacecraft range rate, measured by the antennas of NASA’s Deep Space Network to an accuracy of about 0.03 mm/s (at 60 s integration time). In spite of these challenges and thanks to the careful design of three gravity flybys, Cassini was able to catch the essential features of Enceladus’s gravity field, in particular to estimate its quadrupole and detect the sought-for hemispherical asymmetry [1]. Crucial for the correct fit of the Doppler data was the inclusion in the dynamical model of the drag acceleration from the plume’s neutral particles.\nAlthough the largest quadrupole coefficients indicate only a mild deviation from hydrostatic equilibrium (J2/C22=3.55±0.05), a reliable determination of the MOIF uses J3 to separate the hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic components of the quadrupole field. The application of this method results in a MOIF (0.336) compatible with a differentiated structure. (An admittance analysis leads to a similar value.) The magnitude and the sign of J3 indicate that the gravity anomaly associated to the striking topographic depression (-1 km) in the southern polar regions is largely compensated by denser material at depth. The obvious (but not the only) interpretation points to a liquid water mass, denser than the surrounding ice and sandwiched between the ice shell and the rocky core. The gravity field and the topography provide also rough estimate of the size of the water mass and the depth at which it is located. Starting from the consideration that the hydrostatic J2/C22 ratio for a fast rotator like Enceladus is about 3.25 and not 10/3, a recent work [2] offers some adjustments to this picture.\n[1] L.

High flow events driven by storms and/or snow or glacial melt often dominate the annual load of such constituents, yet remain poorly understood from a biogeochemical perspective. Our research examines the biogeochemical nature of riverine metal and P loads during targeted high flow events to determine to what extent, and under what environmental conditions, are the concentration and biogeochemical composition of riverine loads of P, Fe, and Mn disproportionately high and relatively reactive v. inert. We present a suite of biogeochemical data derived from water and suspended sediment samples that were collected during these events in multiple catchments and over different seasons within the hydrologic year. We examine the size partitioning (particulate, colloidal, ‘truly dissolved’) of riverine Fe, Mn, and P during events in glaciated, boreal-forested, and agriculturalized catchments of Vermont and Alaska. Suspended sediment loads are also characterized by relative redox sensitivity to examine the potential reactivity of Fe, Mn, and P in sediment transported during particular events. We demonstrate that metal and P concentration, size partitioning, and redox sensitivity differs both seasonally and by land cover, which is due to different source environments and flow paths that are preferentially activated during high discharge. The conceptual model herein developed is critical to understanding the biogeochemical nature of event-based riverine loads, and how this could evolve with changing frequency and severity of high flow events or land cover associated with climate change and landscape management.",

            "abstract": "A large suite of problems in applied geophysics can be tackled by simulating and inverting electromagnetic (EM) data. Problems can be treated in the time- or frequency-domain, sources can be magnetic or electric and either natural or controlled, techniques such as primary-secondary may be employed and different problem dimensionalities, including 1D, 2D and 3D, may be considered. To address the inverse problem, derivatives of each of these element must be readily accessible so they may be composed to form the sensitivity for the approach taken. For many applications, efficient algorithms have been designed and implemented. However, inconsistencies between implementations of different problem-types and modeling techniques often limits extensibility and interoperability, particularly when addressing the inverse problem. Building on top of the open-source simulation and gradient based parameter estimation framework, SimPEG (\nhttp://simpeg.xyz\n), we have developed simpegEM to be a modular framework for geophysical problems in electromagnetics.\nThe SimPEG implementation in Python provides finite-volume discretizations for both structured and semi-structured meshes, along with machinery for the inversion, including optimization and regularization routines. The elements of the EM simulation, including the formulation of Maxwell’s equations and definitions of the sources and receivers as well as their derivatives are implemented in a modular, object-oriented manner. This structure and organization of the code allow elements to be readily interchanged and extensions made.\n\nIn this presentation, we discuss an example with steel-cased wells. Steel is highly conductive, has a significant magnetic permeability and is very thin compared to its length, making it a challenging structure to model. Using the open-source frameworks of SimPEG and simpegEM, we solve this using a primary-secondary approach that employs multiple formulations of Maxwell’s equations and both a 2D cylindrically symmetric mesh and a 3D tensor mesh. We explore results from these numerical experiments and discuss our goals for the ongoing construction of a platform to supports a community of researchers using EM geophysical simulations and inversions.",

            "abstract": "The incorporation of rare earth elements (REE) in garnet, Sm and Lu in particular, links garnet chemical zoning to absolute age determinations. The application of REE-based geochronology depends critically on the diffusion behaviors of the parent and daughter isotopes. Previous experimental studies on REE diffusion in garnet, however, exhibit significant discrepancies that impact interpretations of garnet Sm/Nd and Lu/Hf ages.\nWe present a new statistical framework to analyze diffusion data for REE using an Arrhenius relationship that accounts for oxygen fugacity, cation radius and garnet unit-cell dimensions [1]. Our approach is based on Bayesian statistics and is implemented by the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. A similar approach has been recently applied to model diffusion of divalent cations in garnet [2].\nThe analysis incorporates recent data [3] in addition to the data compilation in ref. [1]. We also include the inter-run bias that helps reconcile the discrepancies among data sets. This additional term estimates the reproducibility and other experimental variabilities not explicitly incorporated in the Arrhenius relationship [2] (e.g., compositional dependence [3] and water content).\nThe fitted Arrhenius relationships are consistent with the models in ref. [3], as well as refs. [1]&[4] at high temperatures. Down-temperature extrapolation leads to >0.5 order of magnitude faster diffusion coefficients than in refs. [1]&[4] at <750 °C. The predicted diffusion coefficients are significantly slower than ref. [5]. The fast diffusion [5] was supported by a field test of the Pikwitonei Granulite—the garnet Sm/Nd age postdates the metamorphic peak (750 °C) by ~30 Myr [6], suggesting considerable resetting of the Sm/Nd system during cooling. However, the Pikwitonei Granulite is a recently recognized UHT terrane with peak temperature exceeding 900 °C [7]. The revised closure temperature (~730 °C) is consistent with our new diffusion model.\n[1] Carlson (2012) Am Mineral 97 1598–1618. [2] Chu & Ague (2015) Contrib Mineral Petrol, in press.

The satellite estimates were supplemented and checked by ground measurements whenever possible.

            "abstract": "The response of the terrestrial carbon (C) cycle to climate change is a key uncertainty in land models. An important component of this uncertainty concerns plant functional diversity, which is typically represented in land models by ~10 functional types (PFTs) with fixed traits. However, few land models include the individual-level competitive mechanisms that largely determine how plant functional traits are distributed in time and space in real ecosystems. We have developed a new land model that represents height-structured competition for light with a simple canopy space-filling algorithm, the perfect plasticity approximation (PPA). The new land model, LM3-PPA, allows for an arbitrary number of PFTs (or ‘species’) whose spatial-temporal distributions are determined by the outcome of competition for light and water. We performed experiments with a modified version of LM3-PPA in 10 eastern U.S. grid cells and across simulated precipitation gradients to determine how competition for light and water affects tree C allocation to leaves, fine roots, and wood across climate gradients and in response to episodic drought. We studied the performance of 16 allocational types (‘species’) in monoculture and in competition with each other to determine the competitively-optimal, NPP-maximizing, and biomass-maximizing C allocation strategy under different environmental conditions.   Under chronically moist conditions, competitively-optimal, NPP-maximizing, and biomass-maximizing trees all had similar C allocation. However, under chronically dry conditions, competitively-optimal trees allocated more C to both fine roots and leaves, and less C to wood, compared to NPP- or biomass-maximizing strategies. When subject to episodic drought, the most drought-tolerant allocational strategies had relatively low allocation to leaves (and thus low leaf area and low water demand). Thus, the “over-investment” in leaves that results from resource competition increases the vulnerability of forests to drought in the current version of LM3-PPA, which allows for individual-level plasticity in tree crown shapes but not in plant C-allocation strategy. Our results imply that land model predictions may depend strongly not only on trait variation across species or PFTs, but also on individual plasticity in traits.",

            "abstract": "Around AD 800, Polynesians arrived on the Hawaiian Islands where they expanded and intensified distinct agricultural practices in the islands’ wet and dry regions. Dryland farming productivity in particular would have been sensitive to atmospheric rearrangements of the ENSO and PDO systems that affect rainfall in Hawaii. The few detailed terrestrial paleoclimate records in Hawaii are mainly derived from vegetation proxies (e.g. pollen, seeds, fruits, and plant biomarkers) which are heavily influenced by widespread landscape modification following human arrival. Here we present initial results of an independent paleomoisture proxy: fossil remains of moisture-sensitive testate amoebae (Protozoa: Rhizopoda) and cladocera (water fleas) preserved in continuous bog sediments on Kohala Volcano uplsope of the ancient Kohala agricultural field system, one of the largest dryland field systems in Hawaii. Hydrologic conditions inferred from testate amoebae and cladoceran fossil assemblages correlate with observed decadal moisture regimes in Hawaii and state changes of the PDO system during the last century. Testate ameoabe and cladoceran fossils in older sediments reveal an alternating history of very wet, lake-forming conditions on the bog surface to periods when bog soils were much drier than today's, demonstrating that this method can be paired with vegetation proxies to provide a better understanding of hydroclimate variability in prehistoric Hawaii.",

This paper comparatively analyzed on-road passenger traffic fleets (cars, buses, taxis, motorcycles), using local data collected in cities of Bangkok (BKK), Kathmandu, Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC), and Yangon. Surveys were done in 2010-2014 to obtain information on vehicle technology, driving activities (speed, distance, number, and types of starts), traffic density, and fuel characteristics.\nLarge shares of pre-Euro vehicles were still observed, especially for public buses. The most advanced technology was Euro4, which was observed in small shares (<5%) of the personal car fleets in BKK, HCMC, and Yangon. Euro3 was generally the most advanced technology found in other fleets in these cities. Motorcycles (MC) was the most dominant fleet in all cities, except in Yangon, where they were not allowed. Low vehicle speeds, mainly below 25 km/h, were observed for all vehicle types, indicating traffic jams. Natural gas and LPG had considerable shares in BKK and Yangon while for other cities diesel and gasoline were still the two major fuels used in transportation. Running emission factors (EF) of buses and taxis in Kathmandu were considerably higher than other cities due to its hilly topography, low speeds, high mileage, and less advanced vehicle technologies. The number of passenger vehicles per 1000 people were 400-500 in HCMC and Hanoi (mainly by MC) and in BKK (also by cars), moderate in Kathmandu (200) and the lowest in Yangon (40) because of the MC ban.\nAnnual emissions of the passenger fleets were calculated for each city using the International Vehicle Emission (IVE) for 14 species. BC and OC emissions were estimated using their fractions of PM10 emission. Annual emission per capita of toxic air pollutants and GHGs was analyzed. For example, the emission in kg/year/person for CO, VOC, NOx and PM10 in these cities was 24-150 for CO, 0.9-23 for VOC, 2.1-8.2 for NOx and 0.2-1.1 for PM10. The highest per capita emissions of CO and VOC were found for HCMC and the lowest for Yangon, which showed the influence of MC fleet. The per capita emission of Kathmandu was ranked second among the cities. Our results were also analyzed in comparison with the per capita emission estimated for other Asian cities.",

            "abstract": "The 2015/04/25 Mw7.8 Gorkha, Nepal earthquake occurred beneath the central portion of the Himalayan Frontal Thrust Fault. The mainshock was followed by numerous aftershocks near its epicentral region, as well as many earthquakes at various distances in China. Small to moderate-size earthquakes in Chongqing (~2500 km) and around Fangshan Pluton near Beijing (~3500 km) coincided with the arrivals of surface wave train, suggesting that they were likely triggered by dynamic stresses from the passing surface waves. 3 hours later, a M5.8 normal-faulting earthquake in Southern Tibet. Because of their close distances (within two fault-rupture lengths), it is not clear whether the M5.8 Tibetan event is triggered by static or dynamic stresses. Here we conduct a systematic detection of microseismicity in Nepal and Southern Tibet around the Nepal mainshock. We use earthquakes listed in the Advance National Seismic Network (ANSS) and China Earthquake Network Center (CENC) catalogs as templates, and scan through continuous waveform data within 700 km of the Nepal mainshock to detect additional smaller events that were not listed in these catalogs. As was done before, we apply a 0.5 to 8 Hz band-pass filter to both the template and continuous waveform data, and detect events with mean cross-correlation (CC) values that are at least 12 times larger than the daily median absolute deviation (MAD) values. Overall we have detected 5 times more aftershocks, as well as more than 80 uncatalogued events in Southern Tibet near the epicentral region of the M5.8 event. We also compute the dynamic and static stress changes on the two nodal planes of the M5.8 event. While we cannot completely rule out the influence of static stress change (because the M5.8 event is in the positive Coulomb stress change region), the amplitude of the dynamic stress change is several times larger than the static stress change, suggesting that this event is possibly triggered by dynamic stress changes (albeit with some time delays). The early aftershocks show systematic along-strike migrations, similar to other recently studied aftershock sequences. Our next step is to extend the same analysis to longer time period before and after the mainshock to detect potential foreshocks and investigate longer-time evolutions of seismicity in Nepal.",

Existing monitoring and data infrastructures are inadequate for producing the variety of environmental and socioeconomic information needed to ensure efficient and effective outcomes across the range of interlinked SDGs and targets. The scientific community needs to take a lead in developing new tools and approaches that, at reasonable cost, provide monitoring data of sufficient quality and spatial and temporal coverage to support informed decision making by diverse stakeholders.\nThe expanded SDGs related to water offer the opportunity to explore potential new monitoring approaches and data system architectures in a key sector, building on existing water monitoring capabilities and incorporating new technologies and methods. Since additional investments in monitoring will undoubtedly be limited, it is important to assess carefully the value of information produced by different options and their associated risks and tradeoffs. We review here the existing set of water monitoring systems, known gaps and limitations, stakeholder inputs on data needs, and the potential value of information in light of alternative water sector interventions. Of particular interest are opportunities to share investments in monitoring across sectors and stakeholders (e.g., public and private entities) and to identify where incremental improvements in water monitoring could have significant benefits for other SDGs (e.g., related to health, energy, agriculture, and climate change). Value of information is also driven by the numbers of people affected by decisions or able to take advantage of improved data, which implies the need not only to collect and archive data, but also to invest in making data accessible and usable to diverse and geographically dispersed users.",

The background work that preceded the encyclical was several years in the making. The Church has its own Science Academy, known as the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, consisting of 80 members from around the world with more than a third Nobel Laureates. The members are chosen for their scientific excellence (like most science academies of the world) and not for their religious affiliations. This academy organized a series of scientific meetings for the last 5 years, culminating in a 2014 workshop entitled: Sustainable Humanity, Sustainable Nature , Our Responsibility, jointly organized with the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences. This meeting of the world's thought leaders in natural and Social sciences, came to a remarkable set of conclusions: Climate Change has become a moral issue. A fundamental change in our attitude towards natue and towards each other is required to solve the problem. Religious leaders can have a transformational effect by mobilizing public opinion for actions to stabilize climate change and protect the people.\nBeing a council member of the Pontifical Academy and watching from within the powerful moral voice of Pope Francis, I conclude that this partnership with religion is a powerful new venue for those researchers, reticent about publicly voicing their grave concerns to pursue. We are going to bring massive public support for urgent actions only when the impacts of climate change and its origins are taught in every church, every temple, every mosque, every synagogue, and other places of worship.",

The national targets are disaggregated into provinces, where region-specific action plan is designed and implemented by local government. It is particularly important to timely assess the effectiveness of local emission control measures and guarantee local efforts are in line with the national goal. We develop an integrated model framework for air quality management and policy evaluation, by integrating a dynamic high-resolution emission model, an emission scenarios analysis tool, and a 3-D air quality model. We then put the model system into pilot use in Hebei province for policy making to achieve the air quality target of 2017. We first integrate over 3000 point source facilities into this system to develop a high-resolution emission inventory. Upon the base emission dataset, the efforts to mitigate emissions with current and enacted measures are tracked and quantified to dynamic account of emission changes monthly. Strict policies are designed within the model framework through analyzing the potential to cut emissions for each point source. The finalized policy package can reduce emissions of major air pollutants by 20%-40%, respectively, leading to large decrease of ambient PM2.5 concentration.",

            "abstract": "A significant range in microbial lipid 2H/1H ratios is observed in modern marine sediments [Li et al. 2009. GCA]. The magnitude of hydrogen isotope fractionation between microbial lipids and growth water (2εlipid-H2O) is hypothesized to relate to the central carbon and energy metabolism [Zhang et al. 2009. PNAS]. These observations have raised the intriguing possibility for culture independent identification of the dominant metabolic pathways operating in environments critical to the geological record. One such metabolism we would like to track for its global significance in sedimentary carbon cycling is bacterial sulfate reduction [Jørgensen. 1982. Nature]. To-date, heterotrophic sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) have been observed to produce lipids that are depleted in fatty acid H-isotope composition, relative to growth water (2εlipid-H2O ~ -125 to -175 ‰), with experiments on different substrates yielding little variability [Campbell et al. 2009. GCA; Osburn. 2013; Dawson et al. 2015. Geobiology]. In stark contrast, aerobic heterotrophs show a wide range in fractionations (2εlipid-H2O ~ +300 to -125‰) which seems to scale with the route cellular carbon metabolism [Zhang et al. 2009. PNAS; Heinzelmann et al. 2015. Front Microbio].\nRecent work in aerobic methylotrophs [Bradley et al. 2014. AGU] implicates transhydrogenase (TH) activity as a critical control on 2εlipid-H2O. This work suggests a specific driving mechanism for this range in fractionation is the ratio of intracellular NADPH/NADH, and more fundamentally, the intracellular redox state. In SRB a key component of energy metabolism is the activity of electron-bifurcating TH [Price et al. 2014. Front Microbio], for which a recent transposon mutant library has generated a number of knockouts in the target gene [Kuehl et al. 2014. mBio] in the model organism Desulfovibrio alaskensis strain G20. In this study we compare growth rates, fatty acid concentrations and 2εlipid-H2O from wild type and TH mutants in strain G20. We observed significant growth rate and isotopic phenotypes as a function of substrate when the TH is involved in carbon and energy metabolism. We discuss implications for understanding H-isotope fractionation during microbial fatty acid biosynthesis in sulfate reducers and anaerobes in general in anoxic environments.",

The Mattole River does not follow the classic river “concave-up” profile. Instead, the river headwaters have wide valleys of low gradient fill, cut and strath terraces with deeply incised active channels. In fact, the river has a “convex-up” profile with a low gradient headwater leading to a higher gradient midcourse. Terrace formation in the upper headwater region of the Mattole River records times of disequilibrium of channel profile and incision as the river responds to changes that are, in large part, due to the passage of the northwardly migrating, thermally buoyant MTJ. In order to investigate the distribution and relative ages of terraces, detailed surveys of terrace surfaces and bedrock strath positions were conducted along four headwater tributaries: Thompson Creek, Baker Creek, Lost River and Ancestor Creek. Additionally, across the terraces, hand borings were excavated to bedrock to provide a three dimensional image of terrace thickness. Terrace morphology and stratigraphy provide information on terrace forming mechanisms and timing. This study includes high-resolution geomorphic data regarding the relation of Mattole headwater terraces to the MTJ, as well as provides more temporal information about the fluvial system’s response to the ongoing northward migration of the MTJ.",

            "abstract": "A recent magnetotelluric (MT) survey in central Colorado, USA, when interpreted alongside existing seismic tomography, reveals potential mechanisms of support for high topography both regionally and locally. Broadband and long period magnetotelluric data were collected at twenty-three sites along a 330 km E-W profile across the Southern Rocky Mountains and High Plains of central North America as part of the Deep RIFT Electrical Resistivity (DRIFTER) experiment. Remote-reference data processing yielded high quality MT data over a period range of 100 Hz to 10,000 seconds. A prominent feature of the regional geo-electric structure is the Denver Basin, which contains a thick package of highly conductive shales and porous sandstone aquifers. One-dimensional forward modeling was performed on stations within the Denver Basin to estimate depth to the base of this shallow conductor. Those estimates were then used to place a horizontal penalty cut in the model mesh of a regularized two-dimensional inversion. Two-dimensional modeling of the resistivity structure reveals two major anomalous regions in the lithosphere: 1) a high conductivity region in the crust under the tallest peaks of the Rocky Mountains and 2) a lateral step increase in lithospheric resistivity beneath the plains. The Rocky Mountain crustal anomaly coincides with low seismic wave speeds and enhanced heat flow and is thus interpreted as evidence of partial melt and/or high temperature fluids emplaced in the crust by tectonic activity along the Rio Grande Rift. The lateral variation in the mantle lithosphere, while co-located with a pronounced step increase in seismic velocity, appears to be a gradational boundary in resistivity across eastern Colorado and could indicate a small degree of compositional modification at the edge of the North American craton. These inferred conductivity mechanisms, namely crustal melt and modification of mantle lithosphere, likely contribute to high topography locally in the Rocky Mountains and regionally in the High Plains.",

            "abstract": "Previous simulation studies on seismic waves for a suboceanic earthquake showed that the long-period component can be significantly amplified and prolonged during their propagation to land areas: e.g., Furumura et al. (2008) indicated that low-velocity sediment layers such as accretionary prisms around the trough area considerably affected the propagation of surface waves and were the cause of the long-period motions. Such investigations on the motions and their relations with subsurface structures are very important in discussing disaster mitigation for future subduction-zone earthquakes. In this study, we simulated seismic wavefields for small- to moderate-sized suboceanic earthquakes and investigated the propagation of surface waves at each period of long-period ranges in land and seafloor areas.\nOur simulation results presented interesting features on the propagation pattern in the areas. The Rayleigh wave at a central period of 10 s propagates with a slower speed in seafloor area than that in land area because of their strong dependence on shallow structures with low seismic velocities such as sediment layers, an oceanic layer, and oceanic crusts. For a period of 15 s, however, the Rayleigh wave propagates with a faster speed in seafloor area than that in land area because of the dependence to oceanic mantle with high velocities. For a period of 20 s, the differences of the propagation between land and seafloor areas are not clearly found. These complex propagation patterns are also demonstrated in the spatial variations of phase and group velocities for the fundamental mode of Rayleigh waves and are explained by velocity differences in the structures between land and ocean areas. Our results indicate that either the point-source or the finite-source waveform analyses in the long-period range using a combined land and seafloor data would potentially produce incorrect evaluations and results if the velocity differences are not correctly incorporated into the analyses.",

To gain insight into which elements tend to associate with each other to form minerals, we have used the IMA mineralogical database (rruff.info/ima) to conduct a statistical analysis of the number of known mineral species containing each of the 72 mineral-forming elements, as well as how many species contain both X and Y for every possible X-Y pair of elements. The frequency with which elements X and Y occur together in the nominal chemical formulae of minerals was compared with the expected rate of co-occurrence (assuming that elements are distributed among mineral species randomly).\n The results reveal that among the most strongly correlated element pairs are H-O, Na-Si, Al-Si, S-Ag, O-Si, Si-Ca, and O-Ca. Examples of strongly anti-correlated pairs are O-S, O-Ag, Si-S, O-Sb, O-Se, H-Ag, and Si-As. The strength of these correlations and anti-correlations varied by many orders of magnitude (as measured by their p-value in a chi-squared test for variable dependence), ranging from near 1 to an astounding 10-304. Out of 2520 unique element pairs, 1688 were statistically significant (p-value <0.05). These pair correlations can be attributed to an array of geochemical factors, including but not limited to 1) the mutual exclusivity of sulfide vs. silicate anionic groups, 2) crystal chemical considerations of size and charge similarities among cations, especially within silicate structures, 3) group relationships on the periodic table, and 4) soft vs. hard ion relationships. These principles, along with the specific correlations they produce, can serve as a valuable guide in explaining the mineral evolution of Earth’s crust, and predicting the mineralogy of terrestrial planets even when the bulk composition is significantly different than that of Earth.",

In this talk I will provide my prospective -- from working in academia, the Federal government, and as an independent consultant -- about the training that we need for graduate students to navigate the jungle gym of career opportunities available (or not available) after they graduate. In particular, I will speak to the need for science policy training, in which scientific and coordination skills are put to use to help support societal decisions. I will assert that, to effectively train graduate students, it is necessary to provide experiences in multidisciplinary, policy-relevant scholarship to build marketable skills critical for a student’s professional development.",

            "abstract": "There are two possible approaches for parameterizing sub-grid cloud dynamics in a coarser grid model. The most common is to use a fine scale model to explicitly resolve the mechanistic details of clouds to the best extent possible, and then to parameterize these behaviors cloud state for the coarser grid. A second is to invoke physical intuition and some very general theoretical principles from equilibrium statistical mechanics. This approach avoids any requirement to resolve time-dependent processes in order to arrive at a suitable solution. The second approach is widely used elsewhere in the atmospheric sciences: for example the Planck function for blackbody radiation is derived this way, where no mention is made of the complexities of modeling a large ensemble of time-dependent radiation-dipole interactions in order to obtain the “grid-scale” spectrum of thermal emission by the blackbody as a whole. We find that this statistical approach may be equally suitable for modeling convective clouds. Specifically, we make the physical argument that the dissipation of buoyant energy in convective clouds is done through mixing across a cloud perimeter. From thermodynamic reasoning, one might then anticipate that vertically stacked isentropic surfaces are characterized by a power law dlnN/dlnP = -1, where N(P) is the number clouds of perimeter P. In a Giga-LES simulation of convective clouds within a 100 km square domain we find that such a power law does appear to characterize simulated cloud perimeters along isentropes, provided a sufficient cloudy sample. The suggestion is that it may be possible to parameterize certain important aspects of cloud state without appealing to computationally expensive dynamic simulations. ",

            "abstract": "Warming temperatures and increasing CO2 are likely to have large effects on the amount of carbon stored in soil, but predictions of these effects are poorly constrained. Higher plant productivity from increased CO2 has been expected to raise soil carbon stocks by increasing root and litter inputs, but may instead prime microbial activity and cause further carbon losses. Previous work at SoyFACE has shown soil carbon to be declining, and this trend has continued despite more than ten years of higher carbon inputs from increased plant productivity under elevated CO2, supporting the hypothesis that new carbon is priming decomposition rather than organic matter accumulation. We elevated temperature (+3.5 °C) and CO2 (+200 ppm) for three years in a factorial experiment on a corn-soybean agroecosystem. We used mobile gas analyzers to monitor respiration by roots and soil microbes, then used a process-based ecosystem model (DayCent) to simulate the decadal effects of warming and CO2 enrichment on soil C. We predicted that heat would accelerate the previously observed priming of organic matter decomposition, leading to higher respiration from heated elevated-CO2 plots and accelerated carbon losses over time.\nBoth heating and elevated CO2 increased respiration from soil microbes, but reduced repiration from roots and rhizosphere. The effects were additive, with no heat x CO2 interactions. Particulate organic matter and total soil C declined over time and were lower under elevated CO2 plots than in ambient plots, but did not differ between heat treatments. DayCent simulations of heated plots agreed with our observations and predicted loss of ~15% of SOC under heating, but simulations of elevated CO2 failed to capture the observed priming of SOC losses and instead predicted a ~4% gain in SOC. These results suggest that soil C models may need to explicitly consider priming effects and that Midwestern agricultural soils may lose C on a massive scale in the coming decades.",

The application of lithium adsorbent in pilot plant, it is important to consider the impact on the marine environment. Especially phytoplankton communities are important marine microorganism to represent marine primary product. At the same time, phytoplankton is possible to induce the decrease of lithium recovery rate due to cause of biofouling to surfaces of lithium adsorbents. Therefore long-term and periodic monitoring of phytoplankton is necessary to understand the environmental impact and biofouling problems near the lithium pilot plant. The abundance and biomass of phytoplankton have been evaluated through monthly interval sampling from February 2013 to May 2015. Abundance and species diversity of phytoplankton went up to summer from winter. When lithium adsorbents were immersing to seawater, eco-toxicities of released substances were determined using Microtox with bioluminescence bacteria Vibrio fischeri. The adsorbents were soaked in sterilized seawater and aeration for 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 14 days intervals under controlled temperature. Maximum EC50 concentration was 61.4% and this toxicity was showed in more than 10 days exposure.",

            "abstract": "Permafrost regions store almost twice the carbon in the atmosphere (Tarnocai et al 2009). As climate warms a proportion of this carbon will be released as carbon dioxide and methane. The Arctic Council may be best suited to harness international scientific collaboration for policy relevant knowledge about the global impacts of permafrost thaw. Scientists in Arctic Council and observer states have historically collaborated on permafrost research (e.g. Permafrost Carbon Network, part of Study of Environmental Arctic Change (SEARCH) project). This work increased knowledge of permafrost carbon pool size and vulnerability. However, data gaps persist across the Arctic. Despite gaps, numerous studies directly inform international policy negotiations aiming to stay below 2° C. Some suggest “permafrost carbon feedback” may comprise 3 to 11% of total allowed emissions through 2100 under a RCP4.5 (Schaefer et al2014).\nUnderstanding and accounting for future permafrost atmospheric carbon release requires science and policy coordination that the Arctic Council could incentivize. For example, Council nations could convene scientists and stakeholders to develop a Permafrost-Climate Indicator providing more direct decision support than current permafrost indicators, and identify research needed for a periodic estimate of Arctic permafrost CO2 and CH4 emissions. This presentation covers current challenges scientists and policymakers may face to develop a practical and robust Permafrost Climate Indicator. For example, which timescales are most appropriate for international emissions commitments? Do policy-relevant timescales align with current scientific knowledge? What are the uncertainties and how can they be decreased? We present likely strengths and challenges of a Permafrost Climate Indicator co-developed by scientists and stakeholders. Potential greenhouse gas atmospheric flux from Arctic permafrost carbon may be greater than some nations’ United Nations emissions reductions commitments. Investing in better understanding greenhouse gas emissions from thawing permafrost is relevant for all nations and essential to setting global emission targets.",

Snow thickness, density, and stratigraphy are among the most important snow variables, affecting snow optical properties, thermal conductivity, and microwave signatures. All these are interconnected and vary on diurnal, seasonal, annual as well as spatial time scales. Our physical understanding and observational capabilities are still inadequate to sufficiently observe, understand, and predict snow and its impact on the ice, climate, and eco systems. Similarly, the collection of in-situ data to support development and validation of snow retrieval algorithms is hampered by challenges related to the inherent small- and large-scale variability of snow properties and to differing footprint sizes of all methods. Here we present results from efforts to collect in-situ data on Antarctic and Arctic sea ice to validate satellite microwave products and airborne snow thickness retrievals. Data were collected during cruises of the German icebreaker RV Polarstern and airborne ESA CryoSat Validation and NASA Icebridge campaigns. Results show that there is still a lack of understanding of satellite microwave products affected by variations in snow properties, and of the penetration and resolution of snow-penetrating snow thickness radars which can lead to wrong interpretations of data and results. However, there also remains uncertainty about “true” snow properties and processes within satellite or airborne footprints because even more extensive in-situ validation campaigns may not be able to sufficiently observe these, lacking advanced methodologies and a combination of spatial resolution and spatial coverage.",

However, in high latitute regions inundation is directly affected by the timing of freeze and thaw conditions at the surface. In other words, these two features (i.e. freeze/thaw and inundation analysis) are interconnected and should be considered simultaneously in understanding hydrological and carbon cycles. One of advantages of L-band microwave satellite observation over optical observation is to penetrate to the clouds and vegetation to detect inundated areas. A recent study usese fine-beam mode of PALSAR observation Fine Beam Data (FBD) with resolution of up to 12m as well as ground based land cover using Random Forest Classification method to classify different types of wetlands over Alaska. However, these observations are not frequent and it makes the seasonal and inter-annual studies challenging. We employ PALSAR ScanSAR mode data with more frequent temporal coverage of up to 40 days along with the static map dervied from FBD data to study the timing of the inundation for these wetland classes for 2007- 2010 years period. This study has the advantage of providing freeze-thaw states to detect the timing of active season and then to provide timing of inundated surfaces. Traditional approaches normalize ScanSAR mode data with varying incidence angle to far angle using either histogram method or linear fit methods. We use a unique method that uses the angle dependency of different land cover types to detect inundated surfaces especially the ones that are mixed with vegetation. The seasonal and temporal inundation and freeze/thaw states maps are generated which agree well with previous studies, ancillary data, and ground observations over different land-cover classes. The results of this study benefits hydrological and carbon cycle studies as an important source of carbon uptake in arctic regions. Moreover, the results can be used for validation of newly launched Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission which has devoted an L-band active to predict seasonal freeze/thaw states in global scale.",

In order to understand the implication of climate departure in Seoul for urban agriculture, we evaluated the daily temperature for the June-September period from 2041 to 2070, which were projected by the RCP8.5 climate scenario. These data were analyzed with respect to climate extremes and their effects on growth of hot pepper (Capsicum annuum), one of the major crops in urban farming. The mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures in 2041-2070 approached to the 90th percentile in the past 30 years (1951- 1980). However, the frequency of extreme events such as heat waves and tropical nights appeared to exceed the past variability. While the departure of mean temperature might begin in or after 2040, the climate departure in the sense of extreme weather events seems already in progress. When the climate scenario data were applied to the growth and development of hot pepper, the departures of both planting date and harvest date are expected to follow those of temperature. However, the maximum duration for hot pepper cultivation, which is the number of days between the first planting and the last harvest, seems to have already deviated from the past variability.",

            "abstract": "Based on our proposed approach (Shen et al 2015) for determining the gravitational potential using high-frequency-stability microwave links between satellite and ground station, here we provide preliminary simulations results. Two precise clocks (oscillators) are equipped onboard a satellite and at a ground station, respectively. The ground oscillator emits a signal with frequency fa towards the satellite and the satellite receiver receives this signal with frequency fb. After receiving this signal, towards the ground station the satellite oscillator emits two signals which have the frequencies fb and fc, respectively. By a combination of these three frequencies based on Doppler cancelation system, the gravitational potential difference between the satellite and the ground station can be determined. Concerning a datum station and a station at Mt. Everest, we may determine the geopotential difference between these two stations via a satellite, and consequrently determine the orthometric height of Mt. Everest. In the simulations, we use 9000 observations (a length of about 2hrs observations), and results show that most offset values are in the order of 0.1 m (in equivalent height). The mean value of the differences is -0.008 m, and standard deviation is around 0.3 m. Since atomic clocks with stability around 10E-18 have been generated, the proposed approach is prospective in the near future.

Evaluating the potential impact of various trade-offs in design is valuable for determining the optimal air reconnaissance flight pattern for a given prospective mission. AOML’s HRD has developed a system for performing regional Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) to assess the potential impact of proposed observing systems on hurricane track and intensity forecasts and analyses. This study focuses on investigating the potential impact of proposed aircraft reconnaissance observing system designs. Aircraft instrument and flight level retrievals were simulated from a regional WRF ARW Nature Run (Nolan et al., 2013) spanning 13 days, covering the life cycle of a rapidly intensifying Atlantic tropical cyclone. The aircraft trajectories are simulated in a variety of ways and are evaluated to investigate the potential impact of aircraft reconnaissance observations on hurricane track and intensity forecasts.",

However, field data for studying SIC dynamics and quantifying SIC accumulation have been lacking. This paper consists of two parts. We first present our recent findings of SIC accumulation in the croplands of north China (Wang et al., 2014; 2015). We then report a meta-analysis of field based SIC data from 745 soil profiles in China.\nOur recent findings were based on two sets of data: >100 soil samples recently collected from the Yanqi Basin of central Xinjiang and ~200 archived soil samples from four long-term experiment (LTE) sites in the north China. Our study showed that intensive cropping in the arid and semi-arid region leaded to a greater increase in SIC than in SOC; organic amendments enhanced SIC accumulation in the cropland of north China.\nOur meta-analysis shows that despite a large variation of SIC stock (5-42 kg C m-2), SIC storage in agricultural soils is generally higher relative to non-agricultural soils. We provide assessment how land use change may affect SIC storage in north China.",

            "abstract": "Cultivated ecosystems constitute a particularly frequent form of human land use. Long-term management of a cultivated ecosystem requires us to know temporal change of land use and land cover (LULC) of the target system. Land use and land cover changes (LUCC) in agricultural ecosystem is often rapid and unexpectedly occurs. Thus, longitudinal LULC is particularly needed to examine trends of ecosystem functions and ecosystem services of the target system. Multi-temporal classification of land use and land cover (LULC) in complex heterogeneous landscape remains a challenge. Agricultural landscapes often made up of a mosaic of numerous LULC classes, thus spatial heterogeneity is large. Moreover, temporal and spatial variation within a LULC class is also large. Under such a circumstance, standard classifiers would fail to identify the LULC classes correctly due to the heterogeneity of the target LULC classes. Because most standard classifiers search for a specific pattern of features for a class, they fail to detect classes with noisy and/or transformed feature data sets. Recently, deep learning algorithms have emerged in the machine learning communities and shown superior performance on a variety of tasks, including image classification and object recognition. In this paper, we propose to use convolutional neural networks (CNN) to learn from multi-spectral data to classify agricultural LULC types. Based on multi-spectral satellite data, we attempted to classify agricultural LULC classes in Soyang watershed, South Korea for the three years’ study period (2009-2011). The classification performance of support vector machine (SVM) and CNN classifiers were compared for different years. Preliminary results demonstrate that the proposed method can improve classification performance compared to the SVM classifier. The SVM classifier failed to identify classes when trained on a year to predict another year, whilst CNN could reconstruct LULC maps of the catchment over the study period. Our results show that the new deep learning algorithms can improve learning from multi-temporal ground truth data sets. The findings of the study can be useful to studies focusing on multi-temporal LULC classification.",

            "abstract": "The Philippine Sea plate subducts northwestward beneath the Japanese islands from the south. The average thickness of the overall Philippine Sea plate has been investigated in the oceanic area using surface wave analyses [e.g. Abe and Kanamori, 1970], suggesting a thin (30–40 km thick) plate. On the other hand, several studies have indicated a thicker Philippine Sea plate based on source mechanisms and seismicity in the eastern rim of the plate [Seno, 1987; Moriyama et al., 1989]. From tomographic images, Kamiya and Kobayashi [2007] pointed out that the subducting Philippine Sea slab has thickness variation with a stepwise offset east of Izu Peninsula. The eastern (the Kanto district) and western (north of Izu Peninsula and the Tokai district) regions have respective thicknesses of 60 and 25 km.\nIn the Kumano basin, the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) developed the Dense Oceanfloor Network System for Earthquakes and Tsunami (DONET) in order to monitor seismic activity [Kaneda et al., 2009; Kawaguchi et al., 2010]. DONET ocean-bottom stations are connected with an optical fiber cable, and data are transferred in real time to our laboratory at JAMSTEC.\nThe present study obtains three-dimensional P-wave and S-wave seismic velocity models beneath the Kumano basin by employing an travel time tomography technique. We pick arrival times of P and S waves from the waveform data recorded by the DONET system during the period from January 2011 to December 2014. In order to improve the resolution in the deeper regions than the seismic area inside of the descending slab, we also pick arrival times from the seismic events occurred outside of this district. We use these picked arrival times adding to the JMA catalogue data in seismic tomography. From the obtained tomographic images, we find high velocity anomalies corresponding to the descending Philippine Sea slab. We also find low velocity anomalies under the high velocity slab clearly. There seems to be a sharp velocity contrast between the anomalies. We can estimate the thickness of the descending slab at about 30 km, which is almost consistent with the thickness beneath the Tokai district estimated by Kamiya and Kobayashi [2007] and comparable to the effective elastic thickness beneath the eastern part of the Shikoku basin estimated by Yoshioka and Ito [2001].",

            "abstract": "Erosion at the base of a debris flow fundamentally controls how large the flow will become and how far it will travel. Experimental observations of this important phenomenon are rather limited, and this lack has led theoretical treatments to making ad hoc assumptions about the basal process. In light of this, we carried out a combination of laboratory experiments and theoretical analysis of granular flow in a rotating drum, a canonical example of steady grain motion in which entrainment rates can be precisely controlled. Our main result is that basal sediment is entrained as the velocity profile adjusts to imbalance in the flow of kinetic energy.\nOur experimental apparatus consisted of a 40cm-diameter drum, 4cm-deep, half-filled with 2.3mm grains. Rotation rates varied from 1-70 rpm. We varied the effective scale by varying effective gravity from 1g to 70g on a geotechnical centrifuge. The field of grain motion was recorded using high-speed video and mapped using particle tracking velocimetry. In tandem we developed a depth-averaged theory using balance equations for mass, momentum and kinetic energy. We assumed a linearized GDR Midi granular rheology [da Cruz, 2005] and a Coulomb friction law along the sidewalls [Jop et al., 2005]. A scaling analysis of our equations yields a dimensionless “entrainment number” En, which neatly parametrizes the flow geometry in the drum for a wide range of variables, e.g., rotation rate and effective gravity. At low En, the flow profile is planar and kinetic energy is balanced locally in the flow layer. At high En, the flow profile is sigmoidal (yin-yang shaped) and the kinetic energy is dominated by longitudinal, streamwise transfer. We observe different scaling behavior under each of these flow regimes, e.g., between En and kinetic energy, surface slope and flow depth. Our theory correctly predicts their scaling exponents and the value of En at which the regime transition takes place. We are also able to make corrections for Coriolis and dilation effects that improve the match between theory and experiment.",

However, the validation of this assumption is not well investigated, especially in heat transport through coarse materials under high pore water velocity. It is important to understand heat transport mechanism in such a condition when the ground-source heat pump systems that exploit the soil as thermal source or sink are applied to permeable sand and gravel aquifers. Therefore, to investigate heat transfer between the solid and liquid phases, we conducted one-dimensional heat transport experiments using different size fractions of glass beads. In the experiments, hot water was injected to the 50-cm column packed with glass beads under different water fluxes. The temperatures of the solid and liquid phases were independently measured. In addition to glass beads, materials with different thermal properties (e.g. stainless balls) were tested. The convection-dispersion equations with the assumption of the thermal equilibrium and non-equilibrium between solid and liquid phases were applied to the measured breakthrough curves.",

The majority of the freshwater entering Hilo Bay is from storm and surface water runoff. The anthropogenic impact on water quality at Hilo Bay is due to sediment entrance, cesspools (Bacteria), and invasive species (Albizia). This poster presentation will focus on the water quality and phytoplankton collected on a weekly basis at a buoy positioned one meter from the shore of Hilo Bay, preserving the phytoplankton intact, concentrating and dehydrating the sample with ethanol, and viewing the phytoplankton with a scanning electron microscope (Hitachi S-3400NII). The GPS (Global Positioning System) points were collected at the sampling stations. Three transects on three separate dates were performed in Hilo Bay with salinity, percent dissolved oxygen, turbidity, secchi depth, temperature, and chlorophyll fluorescence data collected at each sampling station. A consistent trend observed in all transects was as distance from the river increased turbidity decreased and salinity increased. The GPS data on June 30, 2015 showed a major correlation between stations and their distance from shore. There is a decrease in the turbidity but not the temperature for these stations. The GPS points collected on July 7, 2015 at thirteen stations starting with station one being at the shore to the water, showed that the salinity concentration fluctuate noticeably at the first 6 stations. As we proceed further away from the shore, the salinity concentration increases from stations seven through thirteen. The water temperature shows little variation throughout the thirteen stations. The turbidity level was high at the shore and shows a noticeable drop at station thirteen.",

At the individual fault scale: 1) determine the mode of termination of large and active strike -slip faults and application of the STEP model (Septentrional, Polochic, El Pilar, Bocono, Santa Marta-Bucaramanaga); 2) improve the understanding of the earthquake potential on the Enriquillo-Plantain Garden fault zone given “off-fault” events such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake; how widespread is this behavior?; and 3) estimate size of future tsunamis from studies of historic or prehistoric slump scars and mass transport deposits; what potential runups can be predicted from this information?; and 4) devise ways to keep rapidly growing, circum-Caribbean urban populations better informed and safer in the face of inevitable and future, large earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "The Andes Mountains exert critical controls on the climate, hydrology, and biodiversity of South America. The Bagua Basin, a low elevation (400-600 m) intermontane basin in northern Peru, offers a unique opportunity to study the ecological, climatic, and structural evolution of the western topographic boundary of the Amazonian foreland. Situated between the Marañon fold-thrust belt of the Western Cordillera and basement block uplifts of the Eastern Cordillera, the Bagua region contains a protracted, semi-continuous record of Triassic through Pleistocene sedimentation. Whereas Triassic-Cretaceous marine deposits were potentially related to extension and regional thermal subsidence, a Paleocene-Eocene shift to shallow marine and fluvial systems marks the onset of foreland basin conditions. Oligocene-Miocene sedimentation corresponds to a braided-meandering fluvial system with exceptional development of paleosols. In this study, we use new detrital zircon U-Pb geochronologic and oxygen stable isotopic datasets to establish a chronology of pre-Andean and Andean processes within the Bagua Basin. Detrital zircon geochronology provides constraints on when the Western and Eastern cordilleras shed sediments into the basin. Syndepositional zircons within Eocene, Oligocene and Miocene strata provide key age control for a previously poorly constrained depositional chronology. Preliminary results suggest a dramatic provenance shift in which Paleocene deposits contain almost exclusively cratonic populations (500-1600 Ma) whereas Eocene deposits show a mix of syndepositional zircons from the magmatic arc, recycled Mesozoic zircons, and cratonic zircon populations. Oxygen stable isotopes (δ18O) of carbonate nodules from Neogene paleosols will help elucidate when the Eastern Cordillera became an orographic barrier intercepting moisture from the Amazon basin to the east. Together, these records will help uncover the history of tectonics and climate interaction in tropical South America.",

This study was conducted in a 36-m step-pool channel segment in a headwater stream of Ooborazawa watershed located in 20 km south of Tokyo. The channels were covered by Boenninghausenia japonica and Oplismenus undulatifolius var. undulatifolius. Therefore, topographic measurement in high altitude (up to 5 m) using a drone is not applicable. D50 and D90 of channel substrates were 4 cm and 21 cm, respectively. A plastic case that equipped with two digital cameras (RICOH CX5) is mounted at the top of 2.2 m of a glass fiber pole. Photos were taken every 5 seconds from 1.8 m above ground surface. Eleven ground control points (GCP) were installed and measured coordinates. We developed digital 3D topographic model using PhotoScan Pro edition version 1.0.0 and the developed 1 cm contour map using ArcGIS version 10.2. Furthermore, we measured the number, height, and length of steps for examining the accuracy of data. Resolution of obtained topographic model was from 9 to 11 mm per pixel. 1 cm of particle was identified using photo was 1 cm. Estimated step height was agreed to the measured step height in the field. We detected maximum channel scour from October to December, 2014 with (146.5 mm/day for maximum daily rain) occurred at pools with 13cm changes , while 5 to 10 cm of changes in sediment deposition occurred from Mya to June, 2015 with 78.5 mm/day of maximum daily rain. Disposition of sediment was concentration within the sequences of step structures. Our method allows us for understanding detail sediment movement and resultant localized channel changes in steep channels.",

            "abstract": "Impacts of climate and landuse change on the overall water availability can be analytically comprehended in terms of long-term trends in surface and subsurface hydrologic fluxes. The surface and subsurface fluxes can be represented in terms of blue water (BW; surface runoff and deep aquifer recharge) and green water (GW; soil water content and actual evapotranspiration). The objective of this study is to present a comprehensive assessment of the spatial and temporal trend of BW and GW under the historical climate and landuse data over the period of 1935 to 2014 in the Ohio River Basin (490,000 km2), and thereby, quantify the relative effects of climate and landuse changes on their long-term dynamics. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is used to simulate hydrologic fluxes for the Ohio River Basin by first changing both climate and landuse inputs, and then by only changing the climate input keeping landuse constant. The Mann-Kendall and Theil-Sen trend analyses over the whole basin show volumetric increase in both BW and GW. However, the trends reveal a regional pattern, where GW has increased significantly in the upper and lower parts of the basin in response to prominent landuse change. Whereas, BW has increased significantly only in the lower part that can be related to the significant change in precipitation there. The finding that BW is more affected by precipitation while landuse change is more influential in changing GW, is further supported from the BW and GW trend analyses at the individual sub-basin scale. The results from this study help to understand the collective influence of natural and anthropogenic impacts on hydrologic responses in the Ohio River basin, and thereby provide useful information for future water security and planning.",

            "abstract": "As “the kidneys of the landscape” and “ecological supermarkets”, wetland plays an important role in ecological equilibrium and environmental protection．Therefore, it is of great significance to understand the dynamic changes of the wetland. Nowadays, many index and many methods have been used in dynamic Monitoring of Wetland. However, there are no single method and no single index are adapted to detect dynamic change of wetland all over the world. In this paper, three digital change detection algorithms are applied to 2005 and 2010 Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images of a portion of the Northeast China to detect wetland dynamic between the two dates. The change vector analysis method (CVA) uses 6 bands of TM images to detect wetland dynamic. The tassled cap transformation is used to create three change images (change in brightness, greenness, and wetness). A new method--- Comprehensive Change Detection Method (CCDM) is introduced to detect forest dynamic change. The CCDM integrates spectral-based change detection algorithms including a Multi-Index Integrated Change Analysis (MIICA) model and a novel change model called Zone, which extracts change information from two Landsat image pairs. The MIICA model is the core module of the change detection strategy and uses four spectral indices (differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), differenced Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (dNDVI), the Change Vector (CV) and a new index called the Relative Change Vector Maximum (RCVMAX)) to obtain the changes that occurred between two image dates. The CCDM also includes a knowledge-based system, which uses critical information on historical and current land cover conditions and trends and the likelihood of land cover change, to combine the changes from MIICA and Zone. Related test proved that CCDM method is simple, easy to operate, widely applicable, and capable of capturing a variety of natural and anthropogenic disturbances potentially associated with land cover changes on different landscapes. However, this method has not been used in other country and wetland dynamic detection. In this study, we introduce CCDM method to check its efficiency in detecting wetland dynamic in the Northeast China and compared with traditional method (the change vector analysis and the tassled cap transformation ).",

As a pre-campaign of the KORUS-AQ, MAPS (Megacity Air Pollution Studies)-Seoul was conducted from May to July, 2015. During this campaign, six Pandora instruments continuously provided total column density of O3 and NO2 over Korea. These measurements will be continued until the end of 2016 covering the KORUS-AQ campaign period and beyond for the initial validation of TROPOMI measurements. To assess the variation of O3 and NO2, data were collected from Pandora, Dobson spectrophotometer, Brewer spectrophotometer, other ground-based in situ measurements and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Ozone column density from Pandora exhibited significantly high correlation (R2 > 0.8) with the ground-based Dobson and Brewer spectrophotometers. Due to the detector anomaly and wide spatial pixel coverage, O3 values from OMI showed lower correlation (R2 > 0.6) with the Pandora. Even though six Pandoras were scattered across the country, O3 data showed similar distribution, in accordance with the low spatial variability of ozone. On the contrary, NO2 distribution pattern showed large difference at each site, which showed peak at around 10 a.m., with larger diurnal variability in urban area than that in rural area by more than 5 times. As most of Pandora sites do not have on-site in situ NO2 measurements, other in situ data from the nearest Air Korea stations were used for the comparison. The comparison result showed significant correlation, although, the correlation coefficient was relatively lower than that of O3. Pandora measurements agreed well with the ground based instruments and OMI satellite data with averaged residuals less than 2% in O3. In case of NO2 Pandora measurements showed similar trend with in situ measurements.",

            "abstract": "Programs which intend to maintain or enhance carbon (C) stocks in natural ecosystems are promising, but require detailed and spatially explicit C distribution models to monitor the effectiveness of management interventions. Savanna ecosystems are significant components of the global C cycle, covering about one fifth of the global land mass, but they have received less attention in C monitoring protocols. Our goal was to estimate C storage across a broad savanna ecosystem using field surveys and freely available satellite images. We first mapped tree canopies at 2.5 m resolution with a spatial subset of high resolution panchromatic images to then predict regional wall-to-wall tree percent cover using 30-m Landsat imagery and the Random Forests algorithms. We found that a model with summer and winter spectral indices from Landsat, climate and topography performed best. Using a linear relationship between C and % tree cover, we then predicted tree C stocks across the gradient of tree cover, explaining 87 % of the variability. The spatially explicit validation of the tree C model with field-measured C-stocks revealed an RMSE of 8.2 tC/ha which represented ~30% of the mean C stock for areas with tree cover, comparable to studies based on more advanced remote sensing methods, such as LiDAR and RADAR. Sample spatial distribution highly affected the performance of the RF models in predicting tree cover, raising concerns regarding the predictive capabilities of the model in areas for which training data is not present. The 50,000 km2 has ~41 Tg C, which could be released to the atmosphere if agricultural pressure intensifies in this semiarid savanna.",

            "abstract": "Recently, it has been suggested that the predictability of ENSO has changed in the last few decades, with reduced forecast skill in the 2000’s relative to earlier decades. We investigate this issue within the context of a statistically stationary stochastically forced multivariate linear dynamical system. Using a Linear Inverse Model (LIM) constructed from observed tropical Pacific oceanic and atmospheric anomalies, it is suggested that decadal changes in realized ENSO forecast skill (for both the LIM and the forecast models of the North American Multi Model Ensemble) may also reflect variations of noise and not necessarily a change in the underlying predictability of tropical Pacific coupled dynamics. That is, some ENSO events are inherently less predictable than others due to the relative importance of different physical processes (eg, surface or thermocline feedbacks) as initially excited by random weather forcing, and periods when such events are more often randomly excited will be periods of reduced forecast skill. A contrast is also drawn with a marked change in (perfect model) tropical Pacific predictability found between two extended simulations of the NCAR CESM1 coupled model, run under fixed 1850 and 2000 radiative forcing conditions, respectively. Diagnosis of surface and thermocline feedbacks in these models (as well as some CMIP5 models) shows how the potential ENSO predictability of some models may appear more sensitive to certain base state changes due to errors in these feedbacks. Finally, the observations-based LIM is used to show that the weak warm event evolution during 2014 was an expected consequence of a tropical Pacific thermocline anomaly that projected weakly on the optimal ENSO precursor, despite the corresponding relatively large equatorial Pacific domain-integrated warm water volume anomaly. In fact, repeating the 2014 LIM forecast by replacing the initial thermocline anomaly with that of spring 1997 yields pronounced warming. In contrast, initial conditions this year are much more consistent with a potentially large, and potentially predictable, 2015/16 event.",

With advantages of unique inert chemical characteristics and sensitive solubilities with temperature, dissolved noble gases in speleothem inclusion water were recently proposed to retrieve terrestrial temperature history. In order to accurately apply this newly-developed speleothem noble gas temperature (NGT) as a reliable proxy, a fundamental issue about behaviors of noble gases in the karst should be first clarified. In this study, we measured noble gas contents in air and dripping water to evaluate any ratio deviation between noble gases. Cave dripping water samples was collected from three selected caves, Shihua Cave in northern China, Furong Cave in southwestern, and Gyukusen Cave in an island located in the western Pacific. For these caves are characterized by a thorough mixing and long-term storage of waters in a karst aquifer by the absence of seasonal oxygen isotope shifts. Ratios of dripping water noble gases are statistically insignificant from air data. Helium isotopic ratios in the dripping water samples match air value. The results indicate that elemental and isotopic signatures of noble gases from air can be frankly preserved in the epikarst and support the fidelity of NGT techniques.",

            "abstract": "Transionospheric radio signals experience both amplitude and phase variations as a result of propagation through a turbulent ionosphere; this phenomenon is known as ionospheric scintillations. As a result of these fluctuations, GPS receivers lose track of signals and consequently induce position and navigational errors. Therefore, there is a need to study these scintillations and their causes in order to not only resolve the navigational problem but in addition develop analytical and numerical radio propagation models.\nWe investigate the multi-fractal structure of the turbulent ionospheric plasma by analyzing the L1 GPS signal at 50 Hz sampling rate using the Canadian High Arctic Ionospheric Network (CHAIN) measurements. We consider the power fluctuations of the signal. Differential signal is constructed for different time lags, the distribution of the differential signal is non-Gaussian, this is believed to be the result of the non-linearity of the system. In order to take into account the non-linear aspect we fit the Probability Density Function to the Castaing distribution, this latter allows the variance of the distribution to vary by assuming a log-normal distribution of the variance convoluted with a Gaussian distribution. The intermittency of the signal is considered by estimating the flatness of the distribution (or Kurtosis) that is the fourth normalized moment of the PDF. It has been found that the intermittency is predominant for small scales.\nThe second problem tackled is the optimization of the detrending frequency which delimit the scintillation contribution from the slow variation of the signal due to the ionospheric background variability and the motion of the GPS satellite. In order to achieve this characterization we investigate the behavior of the entropy of the system for various temporal scales, this multi-scale analysis is performed using the wavelet analysis technique.",

            "abstract": "The Chengdu Plain, which is located in the west of the Sichuan Basin, is the largest plain and the fastest-growing area in southwest China. The Chengdu Plain is considered one of the hotspot areas in China. The pollution pattern in this area is unique due to the hilly topography, humid and stagnant weather. To investigate the composition and major sources of the ambient PM2.5, a one-year observation was performed at five sites in the Chengdu Plain during August, 2013 to August, 2014. The five sites contained three urban background sites and two rural background sites. Samples were analyzed for major water-soluble ions, organic carbon (OC), element carbon (EC), and trace elements. The Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) receptor model based on the combined data from five locations was applied to identify and quantify the likely sources. The annual mean mass concentration of PM2.5 in Chengdu Plain was 81 μg·m-3 with the maximum in winter and the minimum in summer. Eight main factors were identified for the PM2.5 fraction: vehicle emission, secondary nitrate, biomass burning and waste incineration emission, secondary sulfate, Mo-related manufacturing, fugitive dust, coal combustion and industry pollution. The five-site annual mean contributions of each source were 13%, 19%, 9%, 25%, 2%, 13%, 9% and 10%,respectively, to PM2.5, while exhibiting large spatial variability. The contribution of secondary sulfate to the PM2.5 mass was largest at all sites, indicating severe secondary pollution in the region. Biomass burning and waste incineration emission made larger proportion at rural sites than that of urban sites, while the vehicle emission was larger at urban sites. The Enrichment factors for Cd, Zn, Pb, As, Cu and Mo in PM2.5 were larger than 100 indicated that those elements were largely from anthropogenic origins. Cd, As and Cu can mainly originate from nonferrous metal industry, while Mo may mainly generated from ferromolybdenum and Mo powder manufacture. The contribution of Mo-related manufacturing profile was largest at a rural site which is located in the north of the Chengdu Plain, where several small-scale Mo metal processing factories scattered around. The analysis of the combined data from five sites helped to study the common origins affecting the whole area and the spatial variability of the different locations.",

            "abstract": "Chlorine isotopic compositions in HCl released during evolved gas analysis (EGA) runs have been detected by the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument on the Curiosity rover ranging from approximately -9‰ to -50‰ δ37Cl, with two spatially and isotopically separated groups of samples averaging -15‰ and -45‰. These extremely low values are the first such detection of any known natural material; common terrestrial values very rarely exceed ±5‰, and the most extreme isotopic signature yet detected elsewhere in the solar system are values of around +24‰ on the Moon. The only other known location in the solar system with large negative chlorine isotopes is the Atacama Desert, where perchlorate with -14‰ δ37Cl has been detected. The Atacama perchlorate has unusual Δ17O signatures associated with it, indicating a formation mechanism involving O3, which suggests an atmospheric origin of the perchlorate and associated large isotopic anomalies. Identification of non-zero positive Δ17O signatures in the O2 released during EGA runs would allow definitive evidence for a similar process having occurred on Mars.\nPerchlorate is thought to be the most likely source of HCl in EGA runs due to the simultaneous onset of O2 release. If perchlorate is indeed the HCl source, atmospheric chemistry could be responsible for the observed isotopic anomalies, with variable extents of perchlorate production producing the isotopic variability. However, chloride salts have also been observed to release HCl upon heating; if the timing of O2 release is merely coincidental, observed HCl could be coming from chlorides. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the fractionation factor of perchlorate reduction is 0.93, meaning that differing amounts of post-deposition reduction of isotopically normal perchlorate to chloride could account for the highly variable Cl isotopes. Additionally, post-deposition reduction could account for the difference between the two Cl isotopic groups if perchlorate is the HCl source, as the residual perchlorate after reduction will be isotopically heavy. Therefore, conclusive determination of the origin of HCl released during EGA is vital to understanding the origin of this large δ37Cl anomaly.",

Understanding and managing the impacts of climate change on the urban forest trees and natural communities will help us maintain their environmental, cultural, and economic benefits. Tree Inventory can provide important information on tree species, height, crown width, overall condition, health and maintenance needs. This presentation will demonstrate that a trees database system is necessary for developing a sustainable urban tree program. Virginia State University (VSU) campus benefits from large number and diversity of trees that are helping us by cleaning the air, retaining water, and providing shade on the buildings to reduce energy cost. The objectives of this study were to develop campus inventory of the trees, identify the tree species, map the locations of the trees with user-friendly tools such as i-Tree Eco and geospatial technologies by assessing the cost/benefit of employing student labor for training and ground validation of the results, and help campus landscape managers implement adaptive responses to climate change impacts. Data was collected on the location, species, and size of trees by using i-Tree urban forestry analysis software. This data was transferred to i-Tree inventory system for demonstrating types of trees, diameter of the trees, height of the trees, and vintage of the trees. The study site was mapped by collecting waypoints with GPS (Global Positioning System) at the trees and uploading these waypoints in ArcMap. The results of this study showed that: (i) students make good field crews, (ii) if more trees were placed in the proper area, the heating and cooling costs will reduce, and (iii) trees database system is necessary for planning, designing, planting, and maintenance, and removal of campus trees Research sponsored by the NIFA Grant, “Urban Forestry Management” (2012-38821-20153).",

            "abstract": "Methanogenesis, the biological process of methane production, is the final step of natural organic matter degradation. In studying natural methanogenesis, important questions include how fast methanogenesis proceeds and how methanogens adapt to the environment. To address these questions, we propose a new approach – biogeochemical reaction modeling – by simulating the metabolic networks of methanogens.\nBiogeochemical reaction modeling combines geochemical reaction modeling and genome-scale metabolic modeling. Geochemical reaction modeling focuses on the speciation of electron donors and acceptors in the environment, and therefore the energy available to methanogens. Genome-scale metabolic modeling predicts microbial rates and metabolic strategies. Specifically, this approach describes methanogenesis using an enzyme network model, and computes enzyme rates by accounting for both the kinetics and thermodynamics. The network model is simulated numerically to predict enzyme abundances and rates of methanogen metabolism.\nWe applied this new approach to Methanosarcina barkeri strain fusaro, a model methanogen that makes methane by reducing carbon dioxide and oxidizing dihydrogen. The simulation results match well with the results of previous laboratory experiments, including the magnitude of proton motive force and the kinetic parameters of Methanosarcina barkeri. The results also predict that in natural environments, the configuration of methanogenesis network, including the concentrations of enzymes and metabolites, differs significantly from that under laboratory settings.",

Diatom-based Southern Ocean sea surface and sea ice reconstructions by the USGS Pliocene Research Interpretations and Synoptic Mapping (PRISM) Group suggest an average +2° summer SST anomaly during the 3.3-3.0 Ma interval relative to modern.\nHere, we present a reconstruction of Pliocene sea surface conditions from a marine sediment core collected at IODP Site U1361, on the continental rise of the Wilkes Land margin. U1361 biogenic silica concentrations document the alternation of diatom-rich and diatom-poor lithologies; we interpret 8 diatom-rich mudstones within this sequence to record interglacial conditions between 3.8 and 2.8 Ma, across the transition from obliquity control to precession control on East Antarctic ice volumes. This progression also preserves 3 packages of interglacial sediments within the 3.3-3.0 PRISM interval, providing an opportunity for direct comparison to proximal PRISM site Eltanin 50-28. Diatom assemblages in both cores are characterized by Fragilariopsis barronii and Rouxia antarctica, extinct species with an inferred ecological preference for waters south of the polar front. However F. weaveri, an extinct diatom with inferred preference for more northerly waters and moderate abundance in E50-28, has not been identified at U1361. This may indicate that the polar frontal zone migrated across E50-28 (62° 54’S) but remained north of U1361 (64° 25’S) during the mid-Pliocene. This interpretation is bolstered by the low abundance of extant polar front species (e.g., Thalassiosira oliverana, T. lentiginosa) at U1361; these diatoms dominate the E50-28 assemblage. In contrast, the U1361 assemblage includes a number of extant sea ice indicators (F. sublinearis, F. curta, Chaetoceros resting spores) that are rare or absent in E50-28. Ongoing work seeks to place the U1361 PRISM interval in the context of a longer record, to examine whether the 3.3 Ma onset of cooling in the Ross Sea, identified from ANDRILL sediments, is also recorded on the East Antarctic margin.",

Upon making landfall, conspicuous mid-to-high-latitude stratiform cloud decks with high reflectivity are observed along with the ARs in satellite imagery. The cloud-radiative forcing (CRF) associated with these clouds has only been preliminarily established (e.g., Luo and Tung 2015). Their climatological impacts are not understood, yet the related cloud microphysics and radiation processes are poorly represented in global climate models.\nWe studied the correlations between observed variables including the ECMWF-Interim horizontal water vapor fluxes (IVT) integrated from 1000—300 hPa, CERES-derived cloud water path and CRF, and MODIS cirrus reflectance before, during, and after the ARs impinged on the southwest and northwest coasts of North America (NA) in Nov—March, 2000–2008, with 60 ARs affecting the southwest coast (southwest ARs), and 60 ARs affecting the northwest coast (northwest ARs, Dettinger et al., 2011). Anomalies were calculated by subtracting the average over all time steps.\nFor the southwest ARs, a significant increase of ice clouds took place around the landfalling regions with IVT anomalies >130 kg/m/s on landfalling day-1 and day+0. On day+1, a substantial increase of ice clouds with 50% reduction of IVT anomalies was found along with the ARs. On day+2 to day+3, positive IVT anomalies existed over the central and eastern US. These anomalies could be attributed to the southwest ARs and the secondary ARs that rooted in the Gulf of Mexico and made landfall over central and eastern US. Many parts of the NA continent were covered under ice cloud decks.\nThe IVT anomalies for the northwest ARs were >250 kg/m/s on day-1 to day+0, and approximately 120 kg/m/s on day+1. Nevertheless, the northwest ARs were not observed to make landfall concurrently with the secondary landfalling ARs from the Gulf of Mexico. Only a small part of the NA continent was covered by a slight increase of ice clouds along with the ARs on day+1 to day+3.\nDifferences in the amount and spatial distribution of continental ice clouds in different AR scenarios thereby imply different regional CRF; such implications will be further discussed at time scales relevant to climate processes in the presentation.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - poster_AGU_Rodriguez.pdf\n“Conoce tu rio” (Learn about your river) is a Citizen Science-“Para La Naturaleza” Project with the purpose of providing citizens effective monitoring methods for water quality and macro invertebrates. Through the monthly monitoring of Rio Grande de Manatí watershed in Puerto Rico, volunteers gained the knowledge and skills necessary to conduct the same methodology in other rivers of Puerto Rico. This is the case of the Rio Bauta Abajo-Orocovis group, initiated by a volunteer of “Conoce tu Rio”. The new group has the objective of monitoring the water quality, shrimps and other macro invertebrate diversity and abundance in a stream reach of Rio Bauta Abajo, Orocovis, Puerto Rico. The group is also part of the EPA Equipment Loan Program for Pathogen and Water Quality Monitoring. Shrimps and macro invertebrates are captured using nets. In this ongoing project, preliminary results show that 5 of the 17 shrimp species of Puerto Rico and the freshwater crab have been captured in the monitoring point of Rio Bauta Abajo. The most abundant species captured was Atya scabra representing 70% of the abundance. The second most abundant species was Xiphocaris elongata representing 20% of the abundance. We also found a large number of gravid females of two shrimp species. Sixty percent of captured Atya scabra were gravid while 100% of the captured Xiphocaris elongata were gravid. Water quality is within the standard except for phosphorous and nitrogen. The most abundant species inhabit different habitats in the river. Atya scabra is found in the riffles and Xiphocaris elongata is found in the stream borders and or pools. The high number of gravid females suggests that the dry season is the reproductive season for this two species. The high concentration of phosphorous and nitrogen suggest that in the area there area either crops of animals facilities whose runoff is getting to the river. This monitoring group expects to continue motivating citizens to monitor the water quality in other rivers of Puerto Rico, to raise awareness about the conservation of the rivers and to disseminate the results of their study to the general public and the government agencies. Puerto Rico is suffering a drought and this is a critical moment to raise awareness about the conservation of the water resources and its flora and fauna.",

However, heavily polluted leachate generated by excess rainwater percolating through the landfill waste is the major drawback of this practice. Evapotranspiration (ET) cover systems are increasingly being used as alternative cover systems to minimize percolation by evapotranspiration. Leachate recirculation is one of the least expensive options for leachate treatment. The combination of ET cover systems and leachate recirculation can be an economical and environment-friendly practice for landfill leachate management. An interactive real-time decision support system is being developed to better manage leachate irrigation using historical and forecasting weather data, and real time soil moisture data. The main frame of this system includes soil water modules, and plant-soil modules. An inverse simulation module is also included to calibrate certain parameters based on observed data when necessary. It would be an objectives-oriented irrigation management tool to minimize landfill operation costs and negative environmental impacts.",

            "abstract": "Taiwan is one of the most tectonically active regions in the world and is prone to landslides due to steep topography, large earthquakes and frequent typhoons. Landslides often affect and alter the river valleys beneath them, producing knickpoints on longitudinal river profiles, segmenting valleys into mixed bedrock–alluvial rivers and affecting river incision for tens to thousands of years. This study investigates the origin and evolution of complex channel morphologies, terraces and river capture along a 20km stretch of the Upper Da-Jia River in the Heping area of Taiwan. Through GIS analysis and field studies, we explore controls on river channel sinuousity, terrace development and river capture in relation to tectonic and climatic forcing, rock erodibility and landslides. High channel sinuousity is proposed as the result of a coupling between bank erosion and landslides. We discuss three types of landslide-induced meanders and increased sinuousity: (a) depositional-push meanders, (b) failure-zone erosional meanders, and (c) complex-erosional meanders. We also investigate spatial variation in channel morphology (slope, width) and the distribution and heights of river terraces within the Upper Da-Jia watershed associated with periods of widespread valley filling from landslide activity. Examples of river capture provide further evidence of the dynamic interactions between river incision, landslides and associated changes in channel morphology and terrace development within steep rapidly uplift, eroding and evolving mountain belts.",

Chemical accidents make chemicals spread to the environment via various routes such as dispersion into ambient air, soil, and surface/ground water media. Especially, soil and groundwater contamination by chemical accidents become a secondary source to have a long term effect on human health and environment. Strength of long term effect by soil and groundwater contamination depends largely on inherent characteristics of a chemical and its fate in soil and groundwater. Therefore, in this study, we developed a framework on how to determine what kind of chemicals is more important in management scheme in terms of soil and groundwater contamination during chemical accidents. We ranked approximately fifty chemicals using this framework which takes into account an exposure into soil and groundwater, toxicity, persistence, and bioaccumulation of a chemical. This framework helps to prepare systematically the management plan for chemical related facilities. Furthermore, results from our study can make a policy maker have interests in highly ranked chemicals and facilities.",

In this frequency range, density variations within the firn create a layered structure that cause reflections. The thicknesses of the layers are of the order of centimeters in the top 100 meters, so that there can be hundreds to thousands of layers.\nIn the incoherent approach of modelling, the radiative transfer equation is applied to each layer. In the coherent approach, the fluctuation dissipation theorem with a layered medium Green’s function is used to calculate the brightness temperature. However, layer roughness effects have not been accounted for. Rough surface scattering would cause coupling of the intensities in all directions and coupling between vertical and horizontal polarizations.\nWe use a “partially coherent” approach. The snow firn is divided into “blocks” that include multiple layers separated by rough interfaces. The block size is defined such that a coherent incident wave will be attenuated to approximately 50% of its original amplitude upon transmission through the block. Within the block, we treat the wave scattering by rough surfaces coherently by using use the 2nd order small perturbation method (SPM2). The SPM2 is an efficient analytic method that obeys energy conservation. The block size can be as small as 10 meters for the top layers because of strong density fluctuations, but can be hundreds of meters deeper within the snow firn because of the smaller density variations at greater depths. We calculate the bistatic scattering and transmission coefficients for each block. Finally the scattering and emission from multiple blocks are combined incoherently by using a cascade approach of the input and output intensities of the block.\nUsing the partially coherent approach, we can obtain the brightness temperatures of layered snow firn when there are hundreds or thousands of layers with hundreds or thousands of rough interfaces. Model predictions of brightness temperatures and their variations with observation angle, polarization, and frequency will be shown in the presentation. Implications of these results for future remote sensing studies of ice sheet thermal mission and temperature profile retrieval will also be discussed.",

            "abstract": "Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) accounts for 20-70% of atmospheric fine aerosol. NOx plays crucial roles in SOA formation and consequently affects the composition and yield of SOA. SOA component speciation is incomplete due to its complex composition of polar oxygenated and multifunctional species. In this study, ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry (UHR MS) was applied to improve the understanding of NOx effects on biogenic SOA formation by identifying the elemental composition of SOA. Additional research aim was to investigate oligomer components that are considered as a driving force for SOA formation and growth. In this study α-pinene SOA from photochemical reaction was examined. SOA formation was performed in the absence and presence of NOx at dry condition (<5% RH) of room temperature (~25oC) in ~8 m3 KNU smog chamber. SOA was collected on Teflon-coated glass fiber filter, which was extracted using acetonitrile and analyzed by ultrahigh resolution 15T FT-ICR MS. UHR MS data were interpreted in various ways including molecular formula, Kendrick diagram, van Krevelen diagram, and double bond equivalent values. Substantially large fractions of them are nitrogen containing species. Thousands of individual species of SOA were identified. For SOA in the absence of NOx. intensity normalized mean O/C, H/C, N/C, OM/OC ratios were 0.43, 1.52, 0.02, and 1.68, respectively. For SOA in the presence of NOx, those ratios were 0.52, 0.95, 0.08, and 1.48, respectively. 4 different oligomer formation mechanisms (addition, H abstraction, hydrolysis and de-hydrolysis reaction) were examined on the basis of SOA compositions. Detailed discussion will be presented on the molecular structure and building block of oligomers in SOA as well as the evolution of individual elemental composition by multi-generation reactions.

            "abstract": "A growing body of literature suggests that human-induced climate change may cause significant changes in precipitation patterns, which could in turn influence future flood levels and frequencies and water supply and management practices. Although climate models produce full three-dimensional simulations of precipitation, analyses of model precipitation have focused either on time-averaged distributions or on individual timeseries with no spatial information. We describe here a new approach based on identifying and characterizing individual rainstorms in either data or model output. Our approach enables us to readily characterize important spatio-temporal aspects of rainstorms including initiation location, intensity (mean and patterns), spatial extent, duration, and trajectory. We apply this technique to high-resolution precipitation over the continental U.S. both from radar-based observations (NCEP Stage IV QPE product, 1-hourly, 4 km spatial resolution) and from model runs with dynamical downscaling (WRF regional climate model, 3-hourly, 12 km spatial resolution). In the model studies we investigate the changes in storm characteristics under a business-as-usual warming scenario to 2100 (RCP 8.5). We find that in these model runs, rainstorm intensity increases as expected with rising temperatures (approximately 7%/K, following increased atmospheric moisture content), while total precipitation increases by a lesser amount (3%/K), consistent with other studies. We identify for the first time the necessary compensating mechanism: in these model runs, individual precipitation events become smaller. Other aspects are approximately unchanged in the warmer climate. Because these spatio-temporal changes in rainfall patterns would impact regional hydrology, it is important that they be accurately incorporated into any impacts assessment. For this purpose we have developed a methodology for producing scenarios of future precipitation that combine observational data and model-projected changes. We statistically describe the future changes in rainstorm characteristics suggested by the WRF model and apply those changes to observational data. The resulting high spatial and temporal resolution scenarios have immediate applications for impacts assessment and adaptation studies.",

Batch adsorption experiments demonstrated that the composite adsorbents were able to adsorb a wide range of organic contaminants (volatile organic compounds, pharmaceuticals and endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), and nitrosamine disinfection byproducts) with high capacities. Here we further examine the performance of the adsorbents for the simultaneous removal of 8 pharmaceuticals and EDCs with rapid small-scale column tests (RSSCT). Results show that the order of breakthrough in RSSCT is in general consistent with the affinity determined via batch tests. As expected, the maximum amount of adsorption for each compound obtained from RSSCT is identical to or less than that obtained from batch tests (with only one exception), due to adsorption kinetics. However, despite the very different input concentration (1 mg/L vs. 100 mg/L) and contact time (2 min empty bed contact time vs. 16 hour equilibrium time) used in RSSCT and batch tests, the maximum amount of pharmaceuticals and EDCs adsorbed under RSSCT is still about one half of that under equilibrium batch tests, validating the approach of using batch tests with much higher input concentrations to determine adsorption capacities. Results of a pilot-scale column test in a drinking water treatment plant for pharmaceuticals removal will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "The convergence of full-waveform inversion can be improved by extending the velocity model along either the subsurface-offset axis or the time-lag axis. The extension of the velocity model along the time-lag axis enables us to linearly model large time shifts caused by velocity perturbations. This linear modeling was based on a new linearization of the scalar wave equation in which perturbation of the extended slowness squared was convolved in time with the second time derivative of the background wavefield. The linearization was accurate for reflected events and transmitted events. We determined that it can effectively model conventional reflection data as well as modern long-offset data containing diving waves. It also enabled the simultaneous inversion of reflections and diving waves, even when the starting velocity model was far from being accurate. We solved the optimization problem related to the inversion with a nested algorithm. The inner iterations were based on the proposed linearization and on a mixing of scales between the short- and long-wavelength components of the velocity model. We significantly improved the convergence rate by preconditioning the extended model to balance the amplitude-versus-angle behavior of the wave-equation and by imposing wavelength continuation of the gradient in the outer loop. Numerical tests performed on synthetic data modeled on the Marmousi model and on Chevron’s FWI blind-test data demonstrated the global convergence properties as well as the high-resolution potential of the proposed method.",

            "abstract": "Paterae and mountains are some of the most distinguishing and well-distributed surface features on Io, and they reveal the role of tectonism in Io’s crust. Paterae, similar to calderas, are volcano-tectonic collapse features that often have straight margins. Io’s mountains are some of the highest in the solar system and contain linear features that reveal crustal stresses. Paterae and mountains are often found adjacent to one another, suggesting possible genetic relationships. We have produced twelve detailed regional structural maps from high-resolution images of relevant features, where available, as well as a global structural map from the Io Global Color Mosaic. The regional structural maps identify features such as fractures, lineations, folds, faults, and mass wasting scarps, which are then interpreted in the context of global and regional stress regimes. A total of 1048 structural lineations have been identified globally. Preliminary analyses of major thrust and normal fault orientations are dominantly 90° offset from each other, suggesting the maximum contractional stresses leading to large mountain formation are not a direct result of tidal extension. Rather, these results corroborate the model of volcanic loading of the crust and global shortening, leading to thrust faulting and uplift of coherent crustal blocks. Several paterae, such as Hi’iaka and Tohil, are found adjacent to mountains inside extensional basins where lava has migrated up normal faults to erupt onto patera floors. Over time, mass wasting and volcanic resurfacing can change mountains from young, steep, and angular peaks to older, gentler, and more rounded hills. Mass wasting scarps make up 53% of all features identified. The structural maps highlight the significant effect of mass wasting on Io’s surface, the evolution of mountains through time, the role of tectonics in the formation of paterae, and the formation of mountains through global contraction due to volcanism.",

            "abstract": "Since 2010, the Minority Education Through Traveling and Learning in the Sciences (METALS) program, a collaboration among San Francisco State Univ., the Univ. of Texas at El Paso, the Univ. of New Orleans, and Purdue Univ., has created meaningful, field-based geoscience experiences for underrepresented minority high school students. METALS activities promote excitement about geoscience in field settings and foster mutual respect and trust among participants of different backgrounds and ethnicities. These gains are strengthened by the collective knowledge of the university partners and by faculty, graduate and undergraduate students, scientists, and science teachers who guide the field trips and who are committed to encouraging diversity in the geosciences. Through the student experiences it provides, METALS has helped shape and shift student attitudes and orientation toward geoscience, during and beyond their field experience, just as these students are poised at the critical juncture from high school to college. A review of the METALS findings and summative evaluation shows a distinct pattern of high to moderately high impact on most students in the various cohorts of the program. METALS, overall, was perceived by participants as a program that: (1) opens up opportunities for individuals who might not typically be able to experience science in outdoor settings; (2) offers high-interest geology content in field contexts, along with social and environmental connections; (3) promotes excitement about geology while encouraging the development of mutual respect, interdependence, and trust among individuals of different ethnicities; (4) influences the academic choices of students, in particular their choice of major and course selection in college. Summative data show that multiple aspects of this program were highly effective. Cross-university collaborations create a dynamic forum and a high-impact opportunity for students from different backgrounds to meet and develop friendships. Such collaborations also expose students to a network of professionals and mentors who can help them navigate career and educational paths. Taken as a whole, the results of the program and our evaluations suggest that the multi-university character of METALS is particularly beneficial for both students and mentors.",

A numerical method based on ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is presented to solely or jointly assimilate point-scale soil water head data, point-scale soil water content data, surface soil water content data and groundwater level data. This study investigates the performance of EnKF under different types of data, the potential worth contained in these data, and the factors that may affect estimation accuracy. Results show that for all types of data, smaller measurements errors lead to faster convergence to the true values. Higher accuracy measurements are required to improve the parameter estimation if a large number of unknown parameters need to be identified simultaneously. The data worth implied by the surface soil water content data and groundwater level data is prone to corruption by a deviated initial guess. Surface soil moisture data are capable of identifying soil hydraulic parameters for the top layers, but exert less or no influence on deeper layers especially when estimating multiple parameters simultaneously. Groundwater level is one type of valuable information to infer the soil hydraulic parameters. However, based on the approach used in this study, the estimates from groundwater level data may suffer severe degradation if a large number of parameters must be identified. Combined use of two or more types of data is helpful to improve the parameter estimation.",

Here, we compare various independent climate proxies from the terrestrial, marine and ice-core domains to re-evaluate the regional and global significance of the China loess with special emphases to the Quaternary portion. The results confirm that the intensity of loess deposition in China is closely coupled with the northern high latitude climate from the over-orbital to millennial scales, and that loess accumulation rates (LAR) and loess particle-size reflect many features of the northern high latitude ice conditions. Consequently, correlating the loess and marine records could offer the possibility for addressing the hemispheric climate links.\nOur loess-marine correlations show that both records are broadly coupled during the Pleistocene. However, numerous decoupled features exist between the two records. Marine oxygen isotope record shows a general trend of increased ice-volume during the Pleistocene. This trend has no clear reflection in the loess LAR and grain-size data. A prominent change at ~ 430 ka, referred to as the Mid-Brunhes Event (MBE), is clearly documented in both marine and EPICA ice records while its reflections in loess are rather ambiguous. Both marine and EPICA data show a cooler-than-average interglacial for the marine-oxygen isotope stage 13 (MIS-13) while a series of terrestrial records show a warm-extreme interglacial for the northern hemisphere. During a number of glacial intervals, such as MIS-16, MIS 14, MIS-12 and MIS-3, interglacial-level of loess grain-size are observed while they have no obvious reflections in the marine and EPICA ice records. Based on a multi-proxy approach, we argue that these decoupled features between the loess and marine records are attributable to the asymmetrical behaviors of the Pleistocene climates between the southern and northern hemispheres.",

Current efforts associated with the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) aim to increase freshwater flow into this region. This study describes preliminary results of geophysical surveys in the lakes conducted to assess changes in the groundwater chemistry as part of a larger hydrologic and geochemical study in the Everglades Lakes region.\nMarine geophysical profiles were conducted in Alligator Creek (West Lake) and McCormick Creek systems in May, 2014. Data included marine electromagnetic (EM) profiles and soundings, water depth measurements, surface water conductivity and salinity measurements. A GSSI Profiler EMP-400 multi-frequency EM conductivity meter continuously recorded in-phase and quadrature field components at 1, 8, and 15 KHz. The system was deployed in a flat bottomed plastic kayak towed behind a motorized skiff. Lake water depths were continuously measured with a sounder/chart plotter which was calibrated with periodic sounding rod measurements. At periodic intervals during the survey, the profiling was stopped and surface water conductivity, temperature and salinity are recorded with a portable YSI probe on the tow boat. Over 40,000 discrete 3-frequency EM measurements were collected.\nThe data were inverted to 2-layer models representing the water layer thickness and conductivity and the lake bottom conductivity. At spot locations, models were constrained with water depth soundings and surface water conductivity measurements. At other locations along the profiles, the water depth and conductivity were allowed to be free, but the free models were generally consistent with the constrained models. Multilayer sub-bottom models were also explored but were found to be poorly constrained. In West Lake, sub-bottom conductivities decreased from 400 mS/m in the west to 200 mS/m in the east indicating a general W to E decrease in groundwater salinity. In the McCormick Creek system, sub-bottom conductivities increased from 200 mS/m at the north end of Seven Palm Lake to over 650 mS/m at the southern end of Monroe Lake indicating a general N to S increase in ground water salinity. Additional profiles are planned in August, 2015.",

With the benefit of the extended science missions, we have acquired and systematically examined over 14,000 before and after Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) observations, called NAC temporal pairs. From this growing dataset, we have discovered a dynamic Moon with over a hundred new resolved craters and over 26,000 smaller features we define as splotches. These splotches lack a distinguishable crater rim, but alter the observed reflectance of the surface by a few percent. Some of these splotches contain very small primary or secondary craters, but the diameter is too small (< 3 pixels) to be clearly identified and measured in NAC images. However, many of the splotches are directly linked to recent impact events and are thought to be secondary disturbances of the regolith. Robinson et al. (2014) identified nearly 250 splotches around an 18 m impact crater that formed on 17 March 2013 [2]. The shape of some of the splotches indicated a direction of emplacement, which pointed back to the primary crater. In addition, other large populations of splotches exist around other new impacts as well, which support the hypothesis that the emplacement of distal ejecta from nearby craters may form them.\nUsing statistics gathered from these NAC temporal pairs and Monte Carlo simulations, we can estimate the timespan in which the entire lunar surface is affected by these small surface changes. This is important, in order to estimate the rate and understand the risk imposed by these small primary and secondary surface changes.\n",

They are characterized by strong sunward plasma flows caused by poleward-directed electric fields in the region of the ionosphere equatorword of the auroral zone. To examine the effects subauroral electric fields have on ITM coupling and magnetospheric-ionospheric convection we are developing an empirical model of SAPS using data acquired by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) spacecraft which have made decades of in-situ measurements of ionospheric ion drifts, composition, and precipitating auroral particles. These measurements are used to characterize the subauroral electric fields relative to the location of the auroral boundary at varying magnetic local times and magnetic activity levels. As a critical component of this model, we have developed a model of the nightside zero energy electron precipitation boundary equatorward of the auroral oval parameterized by AE and MLT, using boundary identifications derived from DMSP data. We will use this model to create a global subauroral potential model and perform a superposed epoch study of SAPS fields in relationship to the auroral boundary during selected geomagnetic storms as a function of storm phase. A global empirical model of SAPS electric fields of this kind is required to realistically model thermosphere-ionosphere coupling and inner-magnetospheric convection.",

The Atmospheric concentration of N2O has increased by 20% since pre-industrial era, and this increase plays a significant role in shaping anthropogenic climate change. However, compared to CO2- and CH4-related research, fewer studies have been performed in assessing and predicting the spatiotemporal patterns of N2O emission from natural and agricultural soils. Here we used a coupled biogeochemical model, DLEM, to quantify the historical and future changes in global terrestrial N2O emissions resulting from natural and anthropogenic perturbations including climate variability, atmospheric CO2 concentration, nitrogen deposition, land use and land cover changes, and agricultural land management practices (i.e., synthetic nitrogen fertilizer use, manure application, and irrigation etc.) over the period 1900-2099.\nWe focused on inter-annual variation and long-term trend of terrestrial N2O emission driven by individual and combined environmental changes during historical and future periods. The sensitivity of N2O emission to climate, atmospheric composition, and human activities has been examined at biome-, latitudinal, continental and global scales. Future projections were conducted to identify the hot spots and hot time periods of global N2O emission under two emission scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). It provides a modeling perspective for understanding human-induced N2O emission growth and developing potential management strategies to mitigate further atmospheric N2O increase and climate warming.",

            "abstract": "Recent demonstrations of the retrieval of vegetation solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) emission from satellite platforms have opened up the possibility of remotely monitoring photosynthetic function, in addition to the structural and biochemical parameters that characterize the current capabilities of vegetation observing systems. These satellite retrievals, from platforms such as GOSAT, GOME-2, and most recently NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2), provide powerful evidence of the correlation between vegetation productivity and SIF at seasonal to annual timescales, and at spatial resolutions of tens to hundreds of kilometers. The Chlorophyll Fluorescence Imaging Spectrometer (CFIS) was recently developed for OCO-2 validation purposes and provides an airborne capability to help fill the spatial gap between leaf- or canopy-level observations of SIF flux and extensive satellite footprints. The flexibility of an airborne instrument likewise allows for studies of the temporal variability of SIF emission over consecutive days, or with meteorological variability throughout a day. CFIS is a high resolution (<0.1nm) spectrometer covering the 740-770nm wavelength range, optimized for SIF quantification. Here we present an overview of the instrument design and capabilities, along with the retrieval methodology. An evaluation of data collected during initial campaigns conducted during the spring and summer of 2015 are also presented, demonstrating variability within and between days for campaigns spanning multiple days in the Midwest US and Northern California. Results will be compared to OCO-2 data as well as flux-tower measurements made during the CFIS flights.",

            "abstract": "Mongolia has historically experienced winter disasters, called dzuds in Mongolian, and posed serious damages in the livestock sector. For example, a series of dzuds in 2000-2002 killed more than 11 million livestock, and that in 2010 killed over 10 million livestock. For effective risk assessment of this disaster, we are now developing a livestock population model. In this model, livestock die when their weights are very low, and the weights are calculated by energy balance. The energy intake is calculated as a product of potential and relative intake. Potential intake is determined by weight, and relative intake is a function of biomass amount in surrounding grassland. In winter, accessibility to grass (function of snow depth, air temperature, and wind speed) is also considered. On the other hand, energy consumption is the sum of those by thermoregulation and grazing activity. Energy loss by thermoregulation is a function of weight and climatic conditions (at present air temperature and wind speed). Energy loss by grazing activity is calculated from biomass density and condition. We plan to validate and calibrate this model by using data in Mongolian grassland, and then to use for dzud risk assessment of that country.",

However, fugitive methane emissions from many major end-use sectors of the natural gas supply chain have not been quantified yet. This presentation introduces new tools for estimating emission rates from mobile methane measurements, and examines results from recent field measurements conducted downwind of several industrial plants using a specialized vehicle equipped with fast response methane sensor. Using these data along with local meteorological data measured by a 3-D sonic anemometer, a Bayesian approach is applied to probabilistically infer methane emission rates based on a modified Gaussian dispersion model. Source rates are updated recursively with repeated traversals of the downwind methane plume when the vehicle was circling around the targeted facilities. Data from controlled tracer release experiments are presented and used to validate the approach. With access via public roads, this mobile monitoring method is able to quickly assess the emission strength of facilities along the sensor path. This work is developing the capacity for efficient regional coverage of potential methane emission rates in support of leak detection and mitigation efforts.",

            "abstract": "Recent years have seen extreme changes in the Arctic. Marginal ice zones (MIZ), or areas where the \"ice-albedo feedback\" driven by solar warming is highest and ice melt is extensive, may provide insights into the extent of these changes. Furthermore, MIZ play a central role in setting the air-sea CO2 balance making them a critical component of the global carbon cycle. Incomplete understanding of how the sea-ice modulates gas fluxes renders it difficult to estimate the carbon budget in MIZ. Here, we investigate the turbulent mechanisms driving mixing and gas exchange in leads, polynyas and in the presence of ice floes using both field and laboratory measurements.\nMeasurements from unmanned aerial systems (UAS) in the marginal ice zone were made during 2 experiments: 1) North of Oliktok Point AK in the Beaufort Sea were made during the Marginal Ice Zone Ocean and Ice Observations and Processes EXperiment (MIZOPEX) in July-August 2013 and 2) Fram Strait and Greenland Sea northwest of Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, Norway during the Air-Sea-Ice Physics and Biogeochemistry Experiment (ASIPBEX) April – May 2015.\nWe developed a number of new payloads that include: i) hyperspectral imaging spectrometers to measure VNIR (400-1000 nm) and NIR (900-1700 nm) spectral radiance; ii) net longwave and net shortwave radiation for ice-ocean albedo studies; iii) air-sea-ice turbulent fluxes as well as wave height, ice freeboard, and surface roughness with a LIDAR; and iv) drone-deployed micro-drifters (DDµD) deployed from the UAS that telemeter temperature, pressure, and RH as it descends through the atmosphere and temperature and salinity of the upper meter of the ocean once it lands on the ocean’s surface.\nVisible and IR imagery of melting ice floes clearly defines the scale of the ice floes. The IR imagery show distinct cooling of the skin sea surface temperature (SST) as well as an intricate circulation and mixing pattern that depends on the surface current, wind speed, and near-surface vertical temperature/salinity structure. Individual ice floes develop turbulent wakes as they drift and cause transient mixing of an influx of colder surface (fresh) melt water. We capture a melting and mixing event that explains the changing pattern observed in skin SST and is substantiated using laboratory experiments.",

            "abstract": "Hydrocarbon seeps support distinct benthic communities capable of utilizing reduced chemical compounds for nutrition. In recent years, methane seepage has been increasingly documented along the continental slope of the U.S. Atlantic margin. In 2012 and 2013, two seeps were investigated in this region: a shallow site near Baltimore Canyon (410-450 m) and a deep site near Norfolk Canyon (1600 m). Both sites contain extensive mussel beds and microbial mats. Sediment cores and grab samples were collected to quantify the abundance, diversity, and community structure of benthic macrofauna (>300 mm) in relationship to the associated sediment environment (organic carbon and nitrogen, stable isotopes 13C and 15N, grain size, and depth) of mussel beds, mats, and slope habitats. Macrofaunal densities in microbial mats were four times greater than those present in mussel beds and slope sediments. Macrofaunal communities were distinctly different both between depths and among habitat types. Specifically, microbial mat sediments were dominated by the annelid families Dorvilleidae, Capitellidae, and Tubificidae, while mussel habitats had higher proportions of crustaceans. Diversity was lower in Baltimore microbial mat habitats, but higher in mussel and slope sediments compared to Norfolk seep habitats found at deeper depths. Multivariate statistical analysis identified sediment carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratios and 13C values as important variables for structuring the macrofaunal communities. Higher C:N ratios were present within microbial mat habitats and depleted 13C values occurred in sediments adjacent to mussel beds found in Norfolk Canyon seeps. Differences in the quality and source of organic matter present in the seep habitats are known to be important drivers in macrofaunal community structure and associated food webs. The multivariate analysis provides new insight into the relative importance of the seep sediment quality in supporting dense macrofaunal communities compared to other seeps found throughout the region.",

            "abstract": "Sedimentary pigments are biomarkers of photosynthetic organisms, most commonly derived from aquatic bacteria and algae but also with potential terrigenous sources. We detected a diverse pigment assemblage with variable down-core distributions in Great Salt Lake (GSL) sediments deposited since ca. 280 ka (GLAD1-GSL00, core 4). The most abundant pigments included derivatives of chlorophyll a, most likely from algae or cyanobacteria, bacteriochlorophyll c from green sulfur bacteria, okenone from purple sulfur bacteria, and scytonemin from UV-exposed cyanobacteria.\nScytonemin is a biomarker for colonial cyanobacteria exposed to UV-radiation. In GSL it has potential sources from bioherms on the shoreline or microbiotic soil crusts from the adjacent Great Basin Desert. Scytonemin concentration was highest in the Upper Salt and Sapropel (USS) unit, deposited between 11.5-10 ka in shallow water (ca. 10 m), following deep pluvial Lake Bonneville (30-18 cal ka), the Provo lake level (ca. 18-15 cal ka), and the Gilbert transgression (11.6 cal ka). Scytonemin concentration was very low in sediments deposited during the deep lake phases, even though bioherms were prominent shoreline features. The USS was deposited under hypersaline waters and contained remarkably low concentrations of photosynthetic pigment derivatives that would be expected in organic-matter-rich sediments deposited under productive surface waters or anoxic bottom waters. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotopic data point toward a desert soil crust source for scytonemin in the USS, similar to what we previously observed in the Holocene Black Sea sapropel.\nWe propose that increased aridity supported the widespread occurrence and erosion of microbiotic soil crusts during deposition of the USS. This is consistent with interpretations of Great Salt Lake hydrology, pointing toward a broader regional aridity event. Holocene sediments above the USS also contain scytonemin at relatively high concentration, consistent with persistent arid/semi-arid conditions.",

At the Ordway Swisher Biological Station (OSBS) in Florida, the core terrestrial NEON site in the Southeast U.S., we are developing a framework applicable to all NEON sites for mapping and analyzing species composition. In this region, small changes in topography (elevation varies by only 20 m at OSBS) along with fire history are the dominant controls on tree species composition. To discriminate species, we use compare support vector machines (SVMs) with possibilistic classifiers (POCs), which may classify species as unknown and represent ambiguity among spectrally similar species better than common classifiers than (SVM). Species classification was most accurate (90%) using POC in the dominant upland longleaf pine forest type (where most trees belonged to just two species: Pinus palustris and Quercus laevis). It was lower (<60%) using SVM and in the hardwood hammocks (where > 10 hardwood species commonly co-occur, including multiple Quercus). For co-occurring hardwood species that were difficult to separate spectrally, we combined the NEON hyperspectral data with additional data sets (global and regional plant trait databases, state-level maps of ecosystem type, and U.S. Forest Service inventory data) in a possibilistic framework to increase the separability of species identity. We then generate a landscape-scale map of species composition at OSBS. Combining this species map with a LIDAR-derived topography, we show that species associations vary with topography. For example, some Quercus species tend to co-occur with each other in uplands, but not in mesic hammocks. We examine potential factors causing changes in community composition, including topography, water table depth, soil type, current fire management regime, and historical land use. By combining the NEON hyperspectral and LIDAR data with detailed records prescribed fire, we also examine how fire regime (frequency and year since last burn) affect fuel quantity and leaf chemistry.",

The Institute for Student Astronomical Research was founded in order to provide a means for high school and early undergraduate students to engage in meaningful and relevant scientific research. A major goal is to give students the experience of true-to-life scientific investigation from the planning and proposal stages to the data collection and analysis, writing up and presenting of scientific findings and finally to the publication of results. Furthermore, the Institute is designed to collect data on how involvement in the Science Research Seminars influences educational and career choices for students in longitudinal studies following participants for several years. In the first year of the online course of the Institute 10 student teams conducted original research and published their findings in peer-reviewed journals. Lessons learned from the pilot year are being applied to the Institute as efforts to scale up the program are underway.",

Our evaluation of mangrove peat and Acropora palmata sea-level indicators from geological investigations provides 503 sea-level index points and 242 limiting dates. We subdivide the database into 21 regions based on the availability of data, tectonic setting, and distance from the former Laurentide ice sheet. Most index points (75%) and limiting dates (90%) are <8 ka, although there is an unusual temporal distribution with the greatest amount of the data (~28%) occurring between 6-8 ka. We reassess and screen radiocarbon and U/Th ages of mangrove peat and coral data. We use the stratigraphic position (overburden thickness) of index points account for sediment compaction, and use the paleotidal model of Hill et al. (2011) to account for Holocene changes in paleotidal range. A noisy-input Gaussian process regression model calculates that the rates of RSL change were highest during the early Holocene (3-8 mm/yr) and have decreased over time (< 2 mm/yr), which is related to the reduction of ice equivalent meltwater input and collapse of the proglacial forebulge during the Holocene. The sea-level reconstructions demonstrate that RSL did not exceed the present height (0 m) during the Holocene in the majority of locations, with the exception of a small highstand (<2 m) on the northern coast of South America along the Orinoco Delta and Suriname/Guyana located furthest away from the former Laurentide Ice Sheet. The different sea-level histories are an ongoing isostatic response to deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet and suggest subsidence resulting from collapse of the proglacial forebulge reaches further south than previously considered.",

            "abstract": "Carbon and nitrogen turnover in peatlands is of considerable interest because peat is a large reservoir of stored carbon that could emit greenhouse gases in response to climate change. Because peat cores preserve a long-term record of system carbon and nitrogen dynamics, it is possible to use stable isotopes as markers of changes in carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics over time. Here, we used δ15N and δ13C patterns throughout the depth profile of peat cores to understand controls over C-N cycling in the Marcell S1 forested bog in northern Minnesota. In multiple regression analyses, δ15N and δ13C correlated strongly with depth, plot location, %C, %N, and each other. Negative correlation of δ15N with %N presumably reflected removal of 15N-depleted N via denitrification, diffusion, or plant N transfer via mycorrhizal fungi. A step increase in the depth coefficient for δ15N of ~3‰ from -25 cm to -35 cm suggested that the N removal process primarily operates at a discrete depth corresponding to the juncture between aerobic and anaerobic layers defined by the water table. Higher δ15N and lower δ13C in plots closer to uplands may reflect distinct hydrology and accompanying shifts in C and N dynamics in the lagg area fringing the bog. The Suess effect (declining δ13CO2 since the Industrial Revoluation) and aerobic decomposition lowered δ13C in recent surficial samples. Small increases in δ13C at -112 cm (4300 calibrated years BP) and -85 cm (3800 calibrated years BP) may reflect C dynamics during a suspected transitional fen stage (based on paleoecology at a nearby bog), when reduced methanotrophy retained less 13C-depleted carbon derived from methane than in later periods. The C/N decreased until about -85 cm and thereafter remained steady, suggesting that the active zone of aerobic processing during drought may extend to this depth. The inflection point in calculated carbon accumulation rates at this depth supports this conclusion.",

This study attempts to establish a relationship between the change of landscape parameter in a Budyko equation and the change of vegetation (represented by NDVI) in Yellow River Basin and Hai River Basin of China, where vegetation and regional hydrology changed significantly during the past 30 years. It is found that the ratio of landscape parameter change to NDVI change has a good relationship with the aridity index, and thus vegetation change can be converted into landscape parameter change. Then the NDVI elasticity of runoff is introduced and formulized under the Budyko framework.

This problem is even more acute where more complex unsaturated flow paths are considered, such as within semi-confined alluvial systems. Researchers at The University of Queensland have developed an experimental study within the Condamine Alluvium, a significant aquifer in semi-arid eastern Australia, is used to determine groundwater recharge mechanisms for three distinct soil types (two vertosols and one chromosol) on both irrigated and non-irrigated areas. This variety of soil types, including shrink-swell clays, overly a higher permeability sand and gravel unsaturated zone and aquifer. The analysis uses 15-minute soil moisture data from Sentek EnviroSCAN Probe devices installed at 16 sites, with eight sensors in each site at depths from 100 to 4000mm. The vertosols exhibited signs of dynamic preferential flow paths due to the shrink swell properties of the soil. Precipitation rate and initial soil moisture content affect the infiltration response times for the three soils, with the chromosols requiring multiple precipitation events before experiencing any significant soil moisture storage changes in the lower depths (2000 – 4000mm). Storage changes below the root zone to a depth of 4m indicate large rates of potential recharge, up to 1300mm for the two years of data obtained. However, minimal rise has been observed in the water table (~12 m depth), potentially due to the highly transmissive sand and gravel aquifer. The analysis has shown that only very high temporal resolution monitoring of soil storage changes can effectively capture the dynamic preferential flow water flux. Lower temporal resolution monitoring, at the daily scale or greater, will bias the storage change estimates towards the matrix flow component and risk significant underestimation of the total unsaturated zone water flux providing potential recharge to aquifers.",

Yet, the burgeoning availability of high-resolution (<=2 m) imagery and ongoing advances in computing power and analysis tools raises the prospect of performing ecosystem mapping at fine spatial scales over large study domains. Here we demonstrate cutting-edge mapping approaches over a ~35,000 km² study area on Alaska’s North Slope using calibrated and atmospherically-corrected mosaics of high-resolution WorldView-2 and GeoEye-1 imagery: (1) an a priori spectral approach incorporating the Satellite Imagery Automatic Mapper (SIAM) algorithms; (2) image segmentation techniques; and (3) texture metrics. The SIAM spectral approach classifies radiometrically-calibrated imagery to general vegetation density categories and non-vegetated classes. The SIAM classes were developed globally and their applicability in arctic tundra environments has not been previously evaluated. Image segmentation, or object-based image analysis, automatically partitions high-resolution imagery into homogeneous image regions that can then be analyzed based on spectral, textural, and contextual information. We applied eCognition software to delineate waterbodies and vegetation classes, in combination with other techniques. Texture metrics were evaluated to determine the feasibility of using high-resolution imagery to algorithmically characterize periglacial surface forms (e.g., ice-wedge polygons), which are an important physical characteristic of permafrost-dominated regions but which cannot be distinguished by medium-resolution remote sensing. These advanced mapping techniques provide products which can provide essential information supporting a broad range of ecosystem science and land-use planning applications in northern Alaska and elsewhere in the circumpolar Arctic.",

            "abstract": "We have developed a hybrid method to forecast far-field tsunamis by combining traditional, least-squares inversion for initial sea surface displacement (LSQ) and time reverse imaging (TRI). This method has the same source representation as LSQ, which involves dividing the source region into a grid of “point” sources. For each of these, a tsunami Green’s function (GF) is computed using a basis function for sea surface displacement whose support is concentrated near the grid point. Instead of solving the linear inverse problem for initial sea surface displacement using regularized least-squares, we apply the TRI method to estimate initial sea surface displacement at each source grid point by convolving GFs with time-reversed observed waveforms recorded near the source region. This tsunami-source estimate is then used to forecast tsunami waveforms at greater distance. We apply this method to the 2011 Tohoku, Japan tsunami because of the availability of an extensive set of high-quality tsunami waveform recordings. The results show that the method can predict tsunami waveforms having good agreement with observed waveforms at near-field stations not part of the source estimation, and excellent agreement with far-field waveforms. The spatial distribution of cumulative sea surface displacement agrees well with other models obtained in more sophisticated inversions, but the temporal resolution of this method does not resolve source kinematics. The method has potential for application in tsunami warning systems, as it is computationally efficient and can be applied to estimate the initial source model by applying precomputed Green's functions in order to provide more accurate and realistic tsunami predictions.",

The University of Arizona (UA) runs an operational 1.8-km resolution Weather and Research Forecast (WRF) model for IPC, which is incorporated into IPC near and real-time forecasts for hydro, solar and wind generation, load servicing and a large-scale wintertime cloud seeding operation to increase winter snowpack. Winter snowpack is critical to IPC, as hydropower provides ~50% of the company’s generation needs. In efforts to improve IPC’s near-term forecasts and operational guidance to its cloud seeding program, IPC is working extensively with UA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) to improve WRF performance in the complex terrain of central Idaho. As part of this project, NCAR has developed a WRF based cloud seeding module (WRF CS) to deliver high-resolution, tailored forecasts to provide accurate guidance for IPC’s operations. Working with Boise State University (BSU), IPC is conducting a multiyear campaign to validate the WRF CS’s ability to account for and disperse the cloud seeding agent (AgI) within the boundary layer. This improved understanding of how WRF handles the AgI dispersion and fate will improve the understanding and ultimately the performance of WRF to forecast other parameters. As part of this campaign, IPC has developed an extensive ground based monitoring network including a Remote Area Snow Sampling Device (RASSD) that provides spatially and temporally discrete snow samples during active cloud seeding periods. To quantify AgI dispersion in the complex terrain, BSU conducts trace element analysis using LA-ICP-MS on the RASSD sampled snow to provide measurements (at the 10-12 level) of incorporated AgI, measurements are compare directly with WRF CS’s estimates of distributed AgI. Modeling and analysis results from previous year’s research and plans for coming seasons will be presented.",

The hydromodifications associated with urbanization results in increased runoff rates and volumes and increased peak flows which can lead to increased erosion and stream destabilization, decreased evapotranspiration, decreased ground water recharge, increases in pollutant loading, and localized anthropogenic climate change or Urban Heat Islands. Stormwater management is shifting from a drainage-efficiency focus to a natural systems focus. The natural system focus, referred to as Low Impact Development (LID), or Green Infrastructure, uses best management practices (BMPs) to reduce the impacts caused by urbanization hydromodification. Currently there are two modeling approaches used to evaluate BMPs in urban watersheds, conceptually-based coarse resolution hydrologic models and high-resolution physically-based models. Conceptual urban hydrology-hydraulic models typically are used to determine peak flow hydrographs within a watershed based on uniform rainfall, the basins size, shape, and percent of impervious land cover. Physically-based hydrologic models simulate integrated surface and subsurface water flow. Here, we use high-resolution physically based hydrologic models of the urban hydrologic cycle with explicit inclusion of the built environment. We compare the inclusion and exclusion of LID features to evaluate the parameterizations used to model these components in more conceptually based models. Differences in response are discussed and a road map is put forth for improving LID representation in commonly used urban water models.",

            "abstract": "Sinuosity is an emergent characteristic of meandering rivers. In bedrock rivers, climate (Stark 2009) and bedrock lithology (Johnson and Finnegan 2015) likely influence sinuosity. Comparing trends in sinuosity between and along rivers with different climates, lithology, and tectonics has the potential to shed light on what controls sinuosity. However, measuring sinuosity in a meaningful way is challenging.\nThe length scale over which sinuosity is calculated affects the measurement. For example, a river with many tight curves generates greater sinuosities with a shorter length scale, and a river with a curved valley might generate greater sinuosities with a longer length scale. Therefore, to find the distribution of sinuosity across length scales, a method is needed that can compare sinuosities at a variety of length scales.\nTo achieve this goal, we made a tool that calculates sinuosities across many length scales along a river and derives both the maximum sinuosity and the length scale at which these maximums occur for each point on the river.\nUsing digital elevation models (DEMs) of a number of landscapes with varying climate, lithology and uplift rate, we extracted river networks using a flow accumulation method. From this, our code works within the ArcGIS Python window. It applies a moving window to calculate sinuosity at each point along the river for a wide range of length scales. All the points’ maximum sinuosities can be displayed, even if they are derived from different length scales. Because the code is run within ArcGIS, it is easy to display these sinuosity data as attributes of the original river networks.\nThis tool opens new possibilities for tracking patterns in sinuosity along and between rivers. Our preliminary data suggests that this method will be useful for interpreting trends in sinuosity and learning about what factors influence them.",

Microbial mats in Little Hot Creek (LHC), California contain 4 distinct layers with different microbiota. Each layer of the mat is supersaturated with regard to calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which increases with depth. Total organic carbon decreases with depth through the mat.\nWe used 13C-labeled bicarbonate incubations of each mat layer to calculate growth rates of organic carbon and CaCO3 within the mat. Incubations were also amended with Mn or Mg to test their effect on rates of CaCO3 and organic carbon formation. The Mn-amended top layer increased CaCO3 precipitation and organic carbon growth. Mn increased organic carbon production in the lowest layer to a lesser extent, but not growth of CaCO3. Mn addition had no effect on growth rates in the two intervening layers. Mg amendment stimulated only organic carbon formation in the top layer, with little to no effect on the lower layers or overall CaCO3 formation.\nWe attribute the elevated CaCO3 precipitation noted after Mn addition to increased oxygenic photosynthetic activity. Oxygenic photosynthesis requires Mn as an enzyme cofactor and promotes carbonate precipitation. We propose that the phototrophic community was responsible for most of the CaCO3 precipitation in the upper layer. Phototrophs gradually moved upwards for optimal access to sunlight, and as the mat grew, “tenant” microorganisms inhabited the lower carbonate layers while the “builders” remained on top. The relatively constant percentages of inorganic carbon below the top layer combined with observed minimal CaCO3 precipitation under laboratory conditions suggest that additional research into potential metabolisms that impact carbonate formation would be informative. These results improve our understanding of the linkages between microbial metabolisms, carbonate precipitation in microbial mats, and the potential of microbial mats to mineralize.",

            "abstract": "A major challenge for the geoscience community is the training and education of current and next generation big data geoscientists. In wildfire research, there are an increasing number of tools, middleware and techniques to use for data science related to wildfires. The necessary computing infrastructures are often within reach and most of the software tools for big data are freely available. But what has been lacking is a transparent platform and training program to produce data science experts who can use these integrated tools effectively. Scientists well versed to take advantage of big data technologies in geoscience applications is of critical importance to the future of research and knowledge advancement. To address this critical need, we are developing learning modules to teach process-based thinking to capture the value of end-to-end systems of reusable blocks of knowledge and integrate the tools and technologies used in big data analysis in an intuitive manner. WIFIRE is an end-to-end cyberinfrastructure for dynamic data-driven simulation, prediction and visualization of wildfire behavior.\nTo this end, we are openly extending an environment we have built for “big data training” (biobigdata.ucsd.edu) to similar MOOC-based approaches to the wildfire community. We are building an environment that includes training modules for distributed platforms and systems, Big Data concepts, and scalable workflow tools, along with other basics of data science including data management, reproducibility and sharing of results. We also plan to provide teaching modules with analytical and dynamic data-driven wildfire behavior modeling case studies which address the needs not only of standards-based K-12 science education but also the needs of a well-educated and informed citizenry.\nAnother part our outreach mission is to educate our community on all aspects of wildfire research. One of the most successful ways of accomplishing this is through high school and undergraduate student internships. Students have worked closely with WIFIRE researchers on various projects including the development of statistical models of wildfire ignition probabilities for southern California, and the development of a smartphone app for crowd-sourced wildfire reporting through social networks such as Twitter and Facebook.",

            "abstract": "Landscapes are patterns in a dynamic steady-state, due to competing processes that smooth or sharpen features over large distances and times. Geomorphic transport laws have been developed to model the mass-flux due to different processes, but are unreasonably effective at recovering the scaling relations of landscape features. Using a continuum approximation to compare experimental landscapes and the observed landscapes of the earth, one finds they share similar morphodynamics despite a breakdown of classical dynamical similarity between the two. We propose the origin of this effectiveness is a different kind of dynamic similarity in the statistics of initiation and cessation of motion of groups of grains, which is common to disordered systems of grains under external driving. We will show how the existing data of sediment transport points to common signatures with dynamical phase transitions between “mobile” and “immobile” phases in other disordered systems, particularly granular materials, colloids, and foams. Viewing landscape evolution from the lens of non-equilibrium statistical physics of disordered systems leads to predictions that the transition of bulk measurements such as particle flux is continuous from one phase to another, that the collective nature of the particle dynamics leads to very slow aging of bulk properties, and that the dynamics are history-dependent. Recent results from sediment transport experiments support these predictions, suggesting that existing geomorphic transport laws may need to be replaced by a new generation of stochastic models with ingredients based on the physics of disordered phase transitions. We discuss possible strategies for extracting the necessary information to develop these models from measurements of geomorphic transport noise by connecting particle-scale collective dynamics and space-time fluctuations over landscape features.",

The microphysical and chemical properties of these emitted aerosols govern their ability to act as ice nuclei, both in near-field contrails and for cirrus formation downstream. During the ACCESS-II (Alternative Fuel Effects on Contrails and Cruise Emissions) campaign, NASA DC-8 CFM56-2-C1 engine emissions were sampled systematically at a range of cruise-relevant thrust levels and at several altitudes. Sampling was done aboard the NASA HU-25 Falcon aircraft, which was equipped with a suite of aerosol and gas-phase instruments focused on assessing the effects of burning different fuel mixtures on aerosol properties and their associated contrails. Here we present in-flight measurements of particle chemical composition made by a High-Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS). The AMS was able to sufficiently resolve near-field (within 100m) aircraft emissions plumes. Low-sulfur HEFA (hydro-processed esters and fatty-acids) and JetA fuels yielded particles that contained 11 and 8% sulfate, respectively, compared to 30% sulfate contribution for traditional JetA fuel. Each of the fuels produced organic aerosol with similarly low oxygen content. Lubrication oils, which are not a combustion product but result from leaks in the engine, were likely a dominant fraction of the measured organic mass based on mass-spectral marker analysis. These results are compared to similar engine conditions from ground-based testing.",

About 50 stations are used at epicentral distances of up to 55 km.

            "abstract": "I have been fortunate to be able to follow a varied career path from economic geology, to environmental geochemistry, to geochemistry and human health, to environmental disasters. I have been privileged to collaborate with many exceptional scientists from across and well beyond the earth sciences (e.g., public heath, engineering, economics, emergency response, microbiology). Much of this transdisciplinary work has intriguing links back to economic geology/geochemistry. Geological characteristics of different ore deposit types predictably influence the environmental and health impacts of mining, and so can help anticipate and prevent adverse impacts before they occur. Geologic maps showing potential for natural occurrences of asbestos or erionite are analogous to permissive tract maps used for mineral-resource assessments, and can be correlated with epidemiological data to help understand whether living on or near such rocks poses a risk for developing asbestos-related diseases. Mineral particles that are taken up by the human body along inhalation or incidental ingestion exposure routes are “weathered” by reactions with diverse body fluids that differ greatly in composition between and along the different exposure routes. These in vivo chemical reactions (e.g., dissolution, alteration, metal complexation, oxidation/reduction, reprecipitation) are in ways analogous to processes of ore deposit formation and weathering, and some can be shown (in collaboration with toxicologists) to play a role in toxicity. Concepts of ore petrography and paragenesis can be applied to interpret (in collaboration with pathologists) the origin, physiological implications, and toxicity effects of mineral matter in human tissue samples obtained by biopsy, transplant or autopsy. Some disaster materials can originate from mining- or mineral-processing sources, and methods originally developed to study ore deposits or mining-environmental issues can also be applied to understand many disaster materials. These examples illustrate an appropriate core role for earth scientists in transdisciplinary research: applying our expertise and toolkits to help understand topics well beyond earth sciences, but doing so in collaboration with experts from disciplines that traditionally examine those topics.",

Although changes of considerable magnitude have happened in the past, current understanding of Arctic systems is not yet sufficient to enable useful predictions. Scientific observations span a very limited period in the Arctic, and do not encompass even fairly recent (Little Ice Age, Medieval Climate Anomaly) periods of climate change. One way to address this would be to extend the period of observation, but the situation is urgent. As an alternative, various types of proxy data can serve a similar function. It is suggested that archaeological sites with good organic preservation are not only sources of data on past human behavior and cultural organization, but also valuable resources for paleoenvironmental reconstruction, with potential similar to other paleoenvironmental proxy records. The sites tend to be located at or near places that are still occupied today, thus providing locally relevant data. They also tend to incorporate the same range of species that are important for subsistence and food security today, so that one can examine how changes affected those species in the past in a fairly direct manner. Yet, just as new methods increase our ability to retrieve and study this information, global climate change poses a dire threat, both to the wealth of organic data in such sites, and to many of the sites themselves. Global change-related threats including increased coastal erosion and the warming and thawing of permafrost are major and imminent threats to the archaeological and paleoecological record.",

            "abstract": "In this study, we examine topography and erosion in Taiwan, where high rates of tectonic convergence, easily erodible bedrock, and a highly erosive climate have produced some of the steepest landscapes and highest erosion rates in the world. Through a combined analysis of topography throughout the Central Range and cosmogenic radionulcide 10Be erosion rates measured in quartz purified from river sediment, we show that Taiwan preserves broad (up to 10-20 km2) areas of anomalous, low slope, low relief terrain and exhibits a wide range of short-term (103-104 yr) 10Be erosion rates (0.1 to ~10 mm/yr) within topography that has been exhuming at 3-5 mm/yr for at least the past 1.5 Ma. The extreme landscape disequilibrium observed in Taiwan highlights the variation in erosion and morphology that mountain belts can exhibit despite strong tectonic forcing and a highly erosive climate. The wide range in cosmogenic erosion rates observed in Taiwan is a direct consequence of the presence of low slope, low relief topography within a rapid uplifting and exhuming orogen. Low relief, slowly eroding areas are consistently found at high elevations near the main topographic divide of the Central Range and in the upstream headwaters where it is more likely to preserve relict topography. Their existence in combination with constant, rapid background exhumation suggest that Taiwan has seen large scale shifts in mean elevation over the last 2 Ma, a conclusion that challenges classic notion of orogeny evolution in Taiwan, the archetype example of arc-continent collision and rapid mountain around the world. Conversely, because Taiwan exhibits rapid rock uplift, frequent landslides and high rates of erosion, it may be the type landscape where dynamic landscape process of river capture and in situ formation of low relief landscape allow for the highest range of millennial scale erosion rates anywhere in the world. Either way, this study highlights that spatial variation erosion rate and landscape morphology (e.g., slope, relief) is possible within rapidly deforming mountain belts, with important implications for interpreting tectonics and factors controlling landscape evolution.",

We review recent evidence that the effects coastal geometry will create substantial spatial variations in the changes in flooding frequency with scales of order 100km. Using a simple model of the evolution of coastal property values we demonstrate that a consequence of sea level rise is that the appreciation of coastal properties will peak, and then decline relative to higher properties. The time when the value reach a maximum is shown to depend upon the demand for the coastal property, and the local rate of change of flooding frequency due to sea level rise. The simple model is then extended to include, in an elementary manner, the effects on the value of adjacent but higher properties. We show that the effect of increased flooding frequency of the lower properties leads to an accelerated appreciation of the value of upland properties and an accelerated decline in the value of the coastal properties. We then provide some example calculations for selected sites. We conclude with a discussion of comparisons of the prediction of the analyses to recent data, and then comments on the impact of sea level rise on tax base of coastal communities.",

            "abstract": "Climate extremes, such as drought and heat waves, are forecast to be more frequent and severe with climate change. As a consequence, such events will become increasingly important drivers of future ecosystem dynamics and function. We experimentally imposed two extreme growing season drought events in a central US grassland to assess the impacts of multiple droughts on ecosystem response and recovery dynamics. The first extreme drought (with growing season precipitation totals lower than the driest two year period of the 1930s US Dust Bowl)reduced aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) below the lowest level measured in this grassland for almost thirty years. The extreme reduction in ecosystem function with the first two-year drought was a consequence of reduced productivity of the two dominant functional groups in this grassland - C4 grasses and C3 forbs. However, the most abundant (dominant) C3 forb was negatively impacted by the drought more than the dominant C4 grass. This differential sensitivity led to a reordering of species abundances within the plant community. Yet, despite this large shift in plant community composition, which persisted post-drought, ANPP recovered completely the year after drought. This rapid recovery in function was due to a rapid demographic response by the dominant C4 grass, which compensated for loss of the dominant C3 forb. Because of this shift in composition to greater C4 grass dominance, we expected that the second drought would have a greater impact on ecosystem function of plots that had not experienced drought. However, contrary to these expectations, previously droughted plots were more sensitive to drought than those plots that had not experienced drought. Thus, the legacy of drought (shift in community composition) made this grassland more sensitive to subsequent drought. Overall, our results suggest that low resistance of ecosystem function to an extreme climatic event does not preclude rapid ecosystem recovery. However, despite rapid recovery from drought, legacies of drought may increase sensitivity to future extreme events.",

            "abstract": "We present the first 3D shear velocity model extending well offshore of New Zealand's South Island, imaging the lithosphere beneath Campbell and Challenger plateaus. Our model is constructed via linearized inversion of both teleseismic (18 –70 s period) and ambient noise-based (8 – 25 s period) Rayleigh wave dispersion measurements. We augment an array of 29 ocean-bottom instruments deployed off the South Island’s east and west coasts in 2009-2010 with 28 New Zealand land-based seismometers. The ocean-bottom seismometers and 4 of the land seismometers were part of the Marine Observations of Anisotropy Near Aotearoa (MOANA) experiment, and the remaining land seismometers are from New Zealand’s permanent GeoNet array. Major features of our shear wave velocity (Vs) model include a low-velocity (Vs<4.3km/s) body extending to at least 75km depth beneath the Banks and Otago peninsulas, a high-velocity (Vs~4.7km/s) upper mantle anomaly underlying the Southern Alps to a depth of 100km, and discontinuous lithospheric velocity structure between eastern and western Challenger Plateau. Using the 4.5km/s contour as a proxy for the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, our model suggests that the lithospheric thickness of Challenger Plateau is substantially greater than that of Campbell Plateau. The high-velocity anomaly we resolve beneath the central South Island exhibits strong spatial correlation with subcrustal earthquake hypocenters along the Alpine Fault (Boese et al., 2013). The ~400km-long low velocity zone we image beneath eastern South Island underlies Cenozoic volcanics and mantle-derived helium observations (Hoke et al., 2000) on the surface. The NE-trending low-velocity zone dividing Challenger Plateau in our model underlies a prominent magnetic discontinuity (Sutherland et al., 1999). The latter feature has been interpreted to represent a pre-Cretaceous crustal boundary, which our results suggest may involve the entire mantle lithosphere.",

            "abstract": "Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of sea-ice are key descriptors of the surface boundary between ice and atmosphere. High resolution (meter-scale) and accurate (cm-scale) DEM data are required to correctly understand surface-atmosphere interactions in arctic environments. Beyond that, high-quality DEM data is also needed to understand sea ice stability and quantify the suitability of sea ice as a means of navigation both on and through the ice.\nDue to the stringent accuracy requirements of sea ice topography mapping, Lidar data are often used to generate sea ice DEMs. Despite their proven performance, Lidar sensors are expensive and difficult to operate especially in harsh and remote Arctic environments. Hence, alternative more efficient solutions need to be found.\nTo address this issue, this study is investigating the applicability of two recent technical innovations to sea ice DEM production: (1) We analyze the performance of Structure from Motion (SfM) techniques for sea ice topography mapping. SfM is an image processing technique that has recently gained momentum in the geosciences and enables high-quality DEM production from images of uncalibrated off-the-shelf cameras; (2) we investigate the applicability of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) as platform for our camera systems. UAS have significant advantages for Arctic applications due to their high flexibility, low-cost, and ability to fly in environments deemed risky for manned operations. Combined, SfM and UAS may result in an intriguing alternative to traditional sensors.\nUsing data from a 2015 field campaign near Barrow, Alaska, we showcase the DEM measurement performance that can be achieved with UAS-based sensors and SfM processing. In addition to showing examples of DEM products, we will provide results of an extensive performance analysis where DEM measurements were compared to ground observations and DEMs from alternative sources. To analyze the impact of flight-track information on DEM quality, we first process our data with high-quality flight track information and investigate the degradation of DEM accuracy as flight-track accuracy is reduced. We also investigate the impact of lighting conditions—an important issue in the Arctic—on SfM performance.",

They provide a means to experiment with physics in a tangible, visual way, often providing insights into the problem. Over the last two years, we have been developing course and laboratory materials for an undergraduate geophysics course primarily taken by non-geophysics majors, including engineers and geologists. Our aim is to provide the students with resources to build intuition about geophysical techniques, promote curiosity driven exploration, and help them develop the skills necessary to communicate across disciplines.\n\nUsing open-source resources and our existing research code, we have built modules around simulations, with supporting content to give student interactive tools for exploration into the impacts of input parameters and visualization of the resulting fields, fluxes and data for a variety of problems in applied geophysics, including magnetics, seismic, electromagnetics, and direct current resistivity. The content provides context for the problems, along with exercises that are aimed at getting students to experiment and ask ‘what if...?’ questions. In this presentation, we will discuss our approach for designing the structure of the simulation-based modules, the resources we have used, challenges we have encountered, general feedback from students and instructors, as well as our goals and roadmap for future improvement. We hope that our experiences and approach will be beneficial to other instructors who aim to put simulation tools in the hands of students.",

            "abstract": "Our research site is within the UC Davis Putah Creek Riparian Reserve in Davis, CA; climate is semi-arid and soils are sandy loams and silts. We are conducting three types of controlled release experiments in the field: 1) Gas mixture, a continuous release of methane, sometimes with other gases included, with the composition and release rate changing over time to allow examination of various hypotheses, 2) E10 (gasoline with 10% ethanol): a continuous release of E10 NAPL at rate equal to documented low rate releases from underground storage tanks (USTs) that are difficult or impossible to detect with current practical approaches (<0.04 gallons per day); 3) E85: release at same rate as the E10 release. In the field experiments, gas or NAPL is released from a stainless steel drive point with 0.5 cm slotted section at 1 m bgs; we monitor temperature, pressure, moisture content, and soil gas composition in the soil, and efflux of carbon dioxide, methane, oxygen, water vapor, and other species to/ from soil to atmosphere. Periodic coring allows examination of the microbial community composition with depth. Laboratory microcosm and column tests assisted in planning the E10 and E85 field experiments above, evaluated the effect of moisture content on methane oxidation, and allowed testing and refinement of the monitoring approaches in the field\nWe found that up to 40% of the methane released can be accounted for by efflux from soil to the atmosphere. The percentage in the efflux depends on the rate of release, and, based on literature and our microcosms with methane-spiked PCRR soils, we hypothesize that the very low moisture content of the soils in this drought year limits in situ methane oxidation. Efflux of carbon dioxide accounted for up to 20% of the E10 release rate under our lab column conditions, which we believe were oxygen-limited compared to the field conditions. We also detected low molecular weight hydrocarbons in the column efflux, though the concentrations were small and the total efflux accounted for a very small fraction of the E10 release rate. On the basis of the lab tests, the field experiments for E10 and E85 release were started in 2015. Selected results of these experiments will be discussed in the conference presentation.",

Different types of economic instruments have been applied to manage water resources, such as water-related taxes and charges (water pricing, environmental taxes, etc.), subsidies, markets or voluntary agreements. Hydroeconomic models (HEM) provide useful insight on optimal strategies for coping with droughts by simultaneously analysing engineering, hydrology and economics of water resources management. We use HEMs for evaluating the potential of economic instruments on managing drought risk at river basin scale, considering three criteria for assessing drought risk: reliability, resilience and vulnerability. HEMs allow to calculate water scarcity costs as the economic losses due to water deliveries below the target demands, which can be used as a vulnerability descriptor of drought risk.\nTwo generic hydroeconomic DSS tools, SIMGAMS and OPTIGAMS ( both programmed in GAMS) have been developed to evaluate water scarcity cost at river basin scale based on simulation and optimization approaches. The simulation tool SIMGAMS allocates water according to the system priorities and operating rules, and evaluate the scarcity costs using economic demand functions. The optimization tool allocates water resources for maximizing net benefits (minimizing total water scarcity plus operating cost of water use). SIMGAS allows to simulate incentive water pricing policies based on water availability in the system (scarcity pricing), while OPTIGAMS is used to simulate the effect of ideal water markets by economic optimization.\nThese tools have been applied to the Jucar river system (Spain), highly regulated and with high share of water use for crop irrigation (greater than 80%), where water scarcity, irregular hydrology and groundwater overdraft cause droughts to have significant economic, social and environmental consequences. An econometric model was first used to explain the variation of the production value of irrigated agriculture during droughts, assessing revenue responses to varying crop prices and water availability. Hydroeconomic approaches were then used to show the potential of economic instruments in setting incentives for a more efficient management of water resources systems.",

Evidence shows that grazers are a top-down control on algae in streams; however, the specific feedbacks between overall stream metabolism, grazer effects, and nutrient cycling have been variable and little is known about these interactions at nutrient levels below ambient. To further our understanding of these linkages, a nutrient depletion chamber was created and paired with high-resolution in situ sensors to estimate stream metabolism and characterize nitrate uptake (UNO3) pathways (i.e. plant uptake and denitrification). The Plexiglas chamber blocks flow and nutrient supply, inserts into upper sediments, allows light in and sediment-water-air interactions to occur. At Gum Slough Springs, FL, nitrate was reduced from ambient levels (1.40 mg N/L) to below regulatory thresholds (ca. 0.20 mg N/L) within one week. Paired chambers with and without the presence of snails (Elimia floridensis) were deployed across submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV; Vallisneria americana) and algae (Lyngbya) substrates. Results show that GPP and UNO3 were higher under SAV (70 g O2/m2/d and 300 mg NO3/m2/d, respectively) and a general lack of nutrient limitation even at low [NO3]. Grazer effects differed by vegetation type as it alleviated the reduction of NO3 levels and GPP under SAV but enhanced the decrease of algal GPP and NO3 levels over time. Continued work includes estimating grazer effects on denitrification, quantifying snail nutrient excretion contributions, and scaling up all estimates from the patch to reach level. Overall, this study will further our understanding of grazer-production-nutrient interactions within stream systems, making it possible to predict changes in feedbacks when one part of the biotic or abiotic ecosystem is altered.",

            "abstract": "West watersheds in the United States are increasingly affected by a combination of novel climate conditions (such as snow-to-rain regime shifts), extreme events (droughts and floods), wildfire behavior, and forest mortality. We term the interaction and feedback between these processes “disturbance science.” Existing ecohydrologic models are often ill-suited for understanding the independencies and feedbacks within disturbance science, particularly coupled process-level interactions between multiple climate, ecosystem, and hydrologic drivers.\nWe have developed a unique multi-physics ecohydrologic framework—the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS)—to better understand basin-scale disturbance science. We demonstrate the framework using a well-instrumented small watershed in northern New Mexico, a watershed that has been exposed to moderate wildfire, drought-induced forest mortality, and frequent flooding events in the last 5-10 years. We modeled wildfire behavior is modeled using the FIRETEC platform as well as direct observations from the 2013 fire season, including litter bulk load and canopy destruction. Ecologic changes were simulated using a novel 2D spatial dynamic vegetation model that captures spatiotemporal vegetation response to climate change.\nWe examined three representative disturbance-driven scenarios: (1) pristine pre-fire vegetation, (2) observed moderate fire behavior, and (3) modeled intense fire conditions, focusing on short- and long-term hydrology to illustrate impacts over a range of temporal scales. Results show dramatic post-disturbance impacts on hydrologic regimes with significant changes to baseflow (in response to reduced basin-wide transpiration) and streamflow in response to convective precipitation events (linked to removal of groundcover). These flashy, or rapid, runoff events are a key driver of catastrophic erosion, with deleterious impacts to the catchments and downstream channel morphology often exhibited in Mountain West. Results also highlight opposing responses to long-term reductions in baseflow and increased propensity of flashy storm events, both of which significantly alter water resource availability, altering the ability of these systems to support ecological and social functions such as the energy-water nexus.",

Future rover missions will need to focus on a variety localitions including those that provide the best possibility for the preservation of organic matter. Volcanic glass and basalt flow surfaces are favored environments for microbial colonization on Earth and this may have been similar on an early Mars. Trace metals and nutrients from easily weathered surface would have provided nutrients as well as substrates for chemolithoautotrophs. In regions of igneous activity, successive flows could overrun microbial communities, trapping potential organic signatures between flows.\nHere we present experimental evidence for the preservation of organic matter between lava flows and that flow interfaces may be excellent sites for exploratory efforts in the search for Martian biosignatures. We performed a series of experiments using the infrastructure of the Syracuse Lava Project that allows for natural-scale lava flows of up to several hundred kilograms. We subjected cyanobacterial organic matter to overrun by lava under a variety of conditions. In all cases organic matter was preserved between lava flows as chars on the overrun ‘colonized” lava and as thin shiny carbon coatings on the overriding flow. The carbon coatings are likely the result of rapid heating and pyrolysis of organic matter that sears to the underside of the overriding lava. Controls yielded no positive signatures for organic matter.\nWe also tested the degree to which the organic matter could be detected remotely using technologies that are found on the Mars Science Laboratory or planned for future missions. We employed elemental and stable isotopes analysis, and Raman spectroscopy. Elemental analysis demonstrated that organic carbon and nitrogen remain in the charred material and that the carbon and nitrogen isotopes of the chars do not deviate significantly from the precursor organic matter (-24.3‰ cyanobacterial biomass; -24.2‰ black carbon). Raman spectroscopy revealed spectra for black carbon, even from the thinnest carbon coatings on overriding lava surfaces. These findings demonstrate that if organic matter is preserved beneath lava flows it may be readily detectable.",

California produces half the nation’s specialty crops (fruits, vegetables, and nuts) and is a leader in beef and dairy production. California also has 10% of the forestland west of the Mississippi, including many economically and ecologically important forest types. The USDA Regional Climate Sub Hub for California was created in 2014 to help land users (farmers, ranchers, and forest land owners) cope with climate variability and change, via two-way linkages with producers of climate information.\nIn its first year and a half, the Sub Hub has formed partnerships with California’s many other climate-focused organizations, including state and federal government, universities, and NGOs. The Sub Hub coordinates climate-related work among several USDA agencies (ARS, FS, NRCS, and others), which formerly had no mechanism to do so. The Sub Hub also works with other federal climate programs (such as the DOI’s CA Landscape Conservation Cooperative, with which the Sub Hub is engaged in a multi-year assessment to balance conservation and agriculture in the Central Valley). State government agencies, such as the Natural Resources Agency and the Department of Food and Agriculture, are key partners for priority-setting and data-sharing. One of the Sub Hub’s crucial synergies is with UC Cooperative Extension, which provides insight into land users’ needs and provides an outlet to deliver Sub Hub products on the ground.\nIn response to stakeholder concerns, the Sub Hub’s 2015-16 emphasis is the ongoing California drought. The Sub Hub’s current stakeholder-focused projects include (1) a climate vulnerability assessment of California rangelands, including detailed maps of likely vegetation change and suggestions for location-specific adaptation options; (2) a comprehensive climate-related update of Cooperative Extension’s widely used Forest Stewardship Series for private landowners; (3) a study on climate information needs of California nut growers; and (4) a series of sector-specific fact sheets on drought impacts and adaptation. To succeed, these efforts must acknowledge that land users do not seek climate information in isolation; rather, they need to integrate it with other components of their decision-making.",

These details are important when it comes to understanding the large thrust earthquakes that can occur in the region, such as the Mw7.8 25 April 2015 event. We take two approaches to add to the community knowledge about the structure of this area. First, we make new measurements on the existing IRIS Passcal Himalayan Nepal Tibet (HIMNT) data set. This array was operated from late 2001 through 2002. We collect two-station phase measurements for Rayleigh waves from teleseismic events at periods of 25 to 125 s. We estimate the uncertainty in these measurements, and invert the weighted measurements to produce phase-velocity models covering an area from 85˚ to 88˚ longitude, and 26˚ to 30˚ latitude. We evaluate the models on several grid sizes, and select the preferred model based on data coverage and uncertainty estimates.\nThe second approach is to better constrain the focal mechanisms and depths of aftershocks of the 25 April 2015 event. We use the Cut and Paste (CAP) method with locally and regionally recorded waveforms (<30˚ distance), as well as teleseismic body waves. We use a 1-D velocity model based on the phase-velocity results from HIMNT, and experiment with varying this 1-D model for different event-station paths. We use both body waves and surface waves, where possible, and perform a grid search over depth. The dip and depth of the focal mechanisms provide important information on the geometry of the plate interface, and potentially of smaller thrusts, and add constraints on the interpretation of the phase-velocity models.",

We investigated the response of Rs to the single and combined effects of elevated [CO2] and warming in soybean plants over a complete growing season using Temperature by Free Air CO2 enrichment technology under field conditions. The treatments were: control, elevated [CO2] (eC), high temperature (eT), and elevated [CO2]+high temperature (eT+eC). Given that photosynthetic rates in eT+eC grown plants were not higher than in plants grown under eC, we hypothesized that Rs would increase only slightly in plants grown under eT+eC compared to eC plants, due to the increase of temperature. Contrary to our prediction, our preliminary results showed that plants grown under the warming treatments had low Rs, thus eT+eC had lower Rs than eC. The response of Rs to these factors was consistent at two different plant high levels (canopy and five nodes down the canopy). Changes in Rs were explained by variations in the carbohydrate content. Our results indicate that the response of Rs to changes in [CO2] and temperature will depend on the carbohydrate availability of plant tissues and thus on how photosynthesis is affected by this environmental factors.",

Monitoring and predicting landslide movements can keep an adequate safety level for human beings in those situations. This paper indicated a newly developed Stereo Multi-sensor Landslide Monitoring Network (SMSLMN) based on a uniform temporal geo-reference. Actually, early in 2003, SAMOA (Surveillance et Auscultation des Mouvements de Terrain Alpins, French) project was put forwarded as a plan for landslide movements monitoring. However, SAMOA project did not establish a stereo observation network to fully cover the surface and internal part of landslide. SMSLMN integrated various sensors, including space-borne, airborne, in-situ and underground sensors, which can quantitatively monitor the slide-body and obtain portent information of movement in high frequency with high resolution. The whole network has been deployed at the Xishan landslide, Sichuan, P.R.China.\nAccording to various characteristic of stereo monitoring sensors, observation capabilities indicators for different sensors were proposed in order to obtain the optimal sensors combination groups and observation strategy. Meanwhile, adaptive networking and reliable data communication methods were developed to apply intelligent observation and sensor data transmission. Some key technologies, such as signal amplification and intelligence extraction technology, data access frequency adaptive adjustment technology, different sensor synchronization control technology were developed to overcome the problems in complex observation environment. The collaboratively observation data have been transferred to the remote data center where is thousands miles away from the giant landslide spot. These data were introduced into the landslide stability analysis model, and some primary conclusion will be achieved at the end of paper.",

Little known marine organisms that inhabit midwater have developed strategies for swimming and feeding that ultimately contributes to their evolutionary success, and may inspire engineering solutions for societally relevant challenges. Fluid mechanics governs the interactions that midwater organisms have with their physical environment, but limited access to midwater depths and lack of non-invasive methods to measure in situ small-scale fluid motions prevent these interactions from being better understood. Significant advances in underwater vehicle technologies have only recently improved access to midwater. Unfortunately, in situ small-scale fluid mechanics measurement methods are still lacking in the oceanographic community.\nHere we present DeepPIV, an instrumentation package that can be affixed to remotely operated underwater vehicles that quantifies small-scale fluid motions from the surface of the ocean down to 4000 m depths. Utilizing ambient, suspended particulate in the coastal regions of Monterey Bay, fluid-structure interactions are evaluated on a range of marine organisms in midwater. Initial science targets include larvaceans, biological equivalents of flapping flexible foils, that create mucus houses to filter food. Little is known about the structure of these mucus houses and the function they play in selectively filtering particles, and these dynamics can serve as particle-mucus models for human health. Using DeepPIV, we reveal the complex structures and flows generated within larvacean mucus houses, and elucidate how these structures function.",

We present a set of models designed to quantify the spatial patterns of near surface drying potential across a landscape with significant variability in above canopy radiation load and canopy coverage. We examined the degree to which these two factors drive drying potential and whether relatively wet and non-burnable areas persist in the landscape during the fire season. Specifically, we measured near-surface temperature and humidity at sites across the landscape, as well as precipitation, solar radiation, and wind speed at a subset of these sites. These observations were then used to evaluate, train, and drive a fuel moisture model that includes sub-components for canopy interception of both precipitation and radiation. The precipitation interception is modelled using a Rutter model approach that accounts for evaporation from the canopy. Radiation interception was modelled using hemispherical photos of the canopy combined with modelled sun locations and ratios of direct to diffuse radiation. A novel model was developed to simulate the moisture of standardized fuel sticks at four different size classes and was evaluated using an independent dataset. Finally, the modelled fuel moisture was used to estimate potential fire-line intensity and ignition probability. Preliminary results indicate that downwelling longwave radiation from the canopy is counteracted by less radiation during the day. This balance leads to smaller spatial variability of daytime minimum fuel moisture which is influenced by both night time and daytime conditions due to moisture storage.",

The island which has big tectonic movement phenomena was Sumatra Island. We monitored long deformation process during interseismic and coseismic of three earthquakes in this Island. The three earthquakes were Mentawai 2008, Padang 2009 and North Sumatra 2012 earthquakes. We used Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DINSAR) and Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite in order to monitor the displacement. We used GAMIT software for GPS and open source software ROYPAC for DINSAR. Sumatra GPS Array (SUGAR) Networks were used to analyze the displacement rate.\nThe result of displacement was very different year to year, Mw 7.6 Padang earthquake had 15.8 cm up and caused subduction zone of trench Sumatra movement about 1.8 cm to 7 cm up. The displacements was continued by Mw 7.7 Mentawai earthquake 2008. We monitored intersesismic, coseismic and postseismic phase. Coseismic phase was 0.222m in horizontal direction and 0.1415 m in vertical direction (SLBU station). The interseismic phase was smaller about 0.118 m in BSAT stations (south east direction). The biggest deformation was detected during interseismic and postseismic North Sumatra 2012 earthquakes with deformation 0.300-3.00 meter.",

            "abstract": "Despite being deeply buried, the topography and geophysical characteristics of the multi-ring Chicxulub impact structure are reflected on the now subaerial Yucatan Peninsula with aligned arcs of cenotes (sinkholes), forming the “Ring of Cenotes”. A pending question is the determination of the geological, geochemical, structural features and associated processes that have led to void development, and the upwards propagation of the voids, cross cutting over 1000 m of super-deposited carbonate sequences.\nDrawing from the published literature on drill core and geophysical surveys undertaken by Pemex, UNAM, and IODP/ICDP, numerical modeling, and general carbonate platform hydrothermal reactive transport models, we provide a conceptual model for the genesis of the Ring of Cenotes.\nIn horizontally bedded carbonate platforms, geothermal gradients will drive convective flow, with strong vertical components specifically in the platform center. In the Yucatan Platform, a high occurrence of anhydrite and dolomite at depth evokes early burial dolomitization and anhydritization, sourcing Mg from seawater.\nThe Chicxulub impact near the center of the platform produced a low permeability and high thermal conductivity melt rock that arguably extends to the basement rock at 3.5 km below surface. Heat of impact enforced the pre-existing geothermal circulation pattern, and even with depletion of the heat of impact, the high thermal conductivity of the crystalline melt would lead to enhanced geothermal gradients in the center of the platform.\nThe cenotes overlying the crater are deep (150+ m) vertical shafts with most (but not all) breaching the surface. The pit geomorphology suggests a bottom-up formation. Excess Si in the shallow groundwater points to a convective circulation with strong vertical components geochemically linking the granodioritic basement rock to the surface. Water temperature and conductivity profiles support ongoing vertical flux in some deep pit cenotes.\nWithin this framework, we argue for the formation of the Ring of Cenotes by hydrogeothermal convective circulation in the post-impact carbonate sequences, leading to spatially focused dissolution at depth, with voids initiated along the crater edge effectively propagating upwards, often breaching the surface.",

Water use for agriculture greatly expanded since the early to mid 1900s, partly in response to drought. Over the last several decades there have been significant advances in the efficiency of irrigation technologies, which have changed from flood irrigation, to center pivot, then to LEPA systems. Here we present a synthesis of monitoring and modeling to investigate changes in water availability across this vast region that is dominated by agriculture. Our integrated Landscape Hydrology Model (LHM) was used to quantify hourly hydrologic fluxes including evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge across a range of observed climate conditions including the current drought. These simulations are coupled to groundwater models for the region to investigate the sustainability of current water use practices and the impacts of aquifer depletion on water budgets. Simulations are compared to measured water levels that have been synthesized across the region from presettlement to today, and with remotely sensed estimates from the GRACE satellite. Finally, we present simulations that quantify the likely impacts of projected climate changes from the CMIP5 forecasts of global climate.",

These data can be used to improve hazard forecasts and emergency response efforts, and also allow users to economically and safely observe and quantify lava flow inflation and emplacement on spatially and temporally useful scales. We used a small fixed-wing UAV with a modified point-and-shoot camera to repeatedly map the active front of the 2014-2015 Kīlauea lava flow over a one-month period in late 2014, at times with a two-hour repeat interval. An additional subsequent flight was added in July, 2015. We used the imagery from these flights to generate a time-series of 5-cm resolution RGB and near-infrared orthoimagery mosaics and associated digital surface models using structure from motion. Survey-grade positional control was provided by ground control points with differential GPS. Two topographic transects were repeatedly surveyed across the flow surface, contemporaneously with UAV flights, to independently confirm topographic changes observed in the UAV-derived surface models. Vertical errors were generally 10 cm. Inside our 50 hectare study site, the flow advanced at a rate of 0.47 hectares/day during the first three weeks of observations before abruptly stalling out <200 m from Pahoa Village road. Over 150,000 m3of lava were added to the study site during our period of observations, with maximum vertical inflation >4 m. New outbreak areas, both on the existing flow surface and along the flow margins, were readily mapped across the study area. We detected sinuous growing inflation ridges within the flow surface that correlated with subsequent outbreaks of new lava, suggesting that repeat UAV flights can provide a means of better predicting pahoehoe lava flow behavior over flat or uneven topography. Our results show that UAVs can generate accurate and digital surface models quickly and inexpensively over rapidly changing active pahoehoe lava flows.",

            "abstract": "Increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, higher temperatures, altered precipitation patterns, and other climate change impacts have already begun to affect US agriculture and forestry, with impacts expected to become more substantial in the future. There have been a number of studies of climate change impacts on agriculture or forestry. However, relatively few studies explore climate change impacts on both agriculture and forests simultaneously, including the interactions between alternative land uses and implications for market outcomes. Additionally, there is a lack of detailed analyses of the effects of stabilization scenarios relative to unabated emissions scenarios. Such analyses are important for developing estimates of the benefits of those stabilization scenarios, which can play a vital role in assessing tradeoffs associated with allocating resources across alternative mitigation and adaptation activities. We provide an analysis of the potential benefits of global climate change mitigation for US agriculture and forestry through 2100, accounting for landowner decisions regarding land use, crop mix, and management practices. The analytic approach involves a combination of climate models, a crop process model (EPIC), a dynamic vegetation model used for forests (MC1), and an economic model of the US forestry and agricultural sector (FASOM-GHG). We find substantial impacts on productivity, commodity markets, and consumer and producer welfare for the stabilization scenario relative to unabated climate change, though the magnitude and direction of impacts vary across regions and commodities. Although there is variability in welfare impacts across climate simulations, we find positive net benefits from stabilization in all cases, with cumulative impacts ranging from $32.7 billion to $54.5 billion over the period 2015-2100. Our estimates contribute to the literature on potential benefits of GHG mitigation and can help inform policy decisions weighing alternative mitigation and adaptation actions.",

Broadband continuum measurements at wavelengths of 0.5 and 1.6 mm probe the thermal and dielectric properties of the nucleus subsurface. High-resolution spectroscopic measurements of 8 molecular lines in the submillimeter (H2O, H217O, H218O, CO, NH3, and three lines of CH3OH) constrain the abundance, velocity, and temperature of gases in the coma. These measurements allow MIRO to study the nucleus and coma as a coupled system.\nUsing its two continuum channels, MIRO has mapped the thermal properties of the nucleus subsurface (depths from millimeters to tens of centimeters), and generally finds its properties to be consistent with very porous, dusty material. We see temperature variations due to diurnal and seasonal changes in insolation, and also see evidence for subsurface ice in some regions. This talk will provide an update on our observations of variations over time, variations with temperature, and variations in composition. We also will report on our attempts to detect the continuum thermal emission of dust in the coma. MIRO's spectroscopic observations have shown the abundance and velocity of gas as it comes off the nucleus to vary with time and location. The regions MIRO sees as particularly active are generally consistent with activity reported by other instruments. Moving away from the nucleus, MIRO is sensitive to the three-dimensional structure of the coma. We will present an update on our understanding of that structure, which is influenced by the shape of the nucleus, nucleus rotation, and processes acting within and on the coma. Our ultimate goal is to develop a coupled model of the nucleus and coma, tracing the processes by which solar heating of the surface drives sublimation of subsurface ice and generation of dust, and how gases and dust evolve in the coma.\nPart of this work was conducted at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract to NASA.

            "abstract": "Renewable energy is fundamental for sustaining and developing society. Solar and wind energy are promising sources because of their decreased environmental impact relative to conventional energy sources, improved efficiency, and increased use. A key challenge with renewable energy production is the generation of accurate renewable energy forecasts at varying spatial and temporal scales to assist utility companies in effective energy management. Specifically, this research applies the Analog Ensemble (AnEn) methodology to short-term (0-48 hour) wind speed forecasting for power generation and short-term (0-72) hour solar power measured (PM) output predictions. AnEn uses a set of past observations corresponding to the best analogs of a deterministic numerical weather prediction model to generate a probability distribution of future atmospheric states: an ensemble of analogs. Currently the AnEn methodology equally weights predictors and only handles 1D(time). We determine an optimal distribution of predictor weights based upon parameter characteristics, investigate spatial variations in the application of the methodology and develop a theory expanding the methodology into 2D. The AnEn methodology improves short-term prediction accuracy, decreases computational costs and provides uncertainty quantification allowing utility companies to manage over- or under power generation for renewable energy sources.",

            "abstract": "Transpressional structures related to deformation along the Greater San Andreas Fault are largely responsible for creating the complex morphology and steep topography in the Southern California Borderland. The numerous anastamosing strike slip faults dissecting the area are responsible for creating its complex morphology and present a seismic hazard to nearshore communities. Submarine slope failures tend to nucleate on faulted steep topography and could generate a tsunami dangerously close to densely populated urban areas. We present evidence for a tsunamogenic landslide originating from Catalina Island and directed toward the mainland. Radiometric dates of fossils collected during coring cruises and ROV dives during 2014-15 provide age control for high-resolution 2D and 3D seismic reflection profiles collected near Santa Catalina Island and Pilgrim Banks. These refine our established sequence stratigraphic subsidence history for Catalina Island, and enable us to constrain the timing of the landslide deposit, as well as other landslide deposits and faults. Although the slide is pre-Holocene, the threat of another tsunamogenic landslide directed at urban southern California is increased by gradual tilting of the Catalina block toward mainland California. Our study demonstrates that investigations using a combination of bathymetry, 2D and 3D MCS can be used to map submerged marine terrace deposits and those can then be used as offset markers for paleoseismic investigations. The subsided marine terrace record has potential paleoseismologic applications on over 20 submerged seamounts and islands in Southern California, as well as applications in providing constraints on Quaternary sea level history.",

            "abstract": "Microbial hydrocarbon degradation is environmentally significant and applicable to contaminated site remediation practices only when hydrocarbons (substrates) are physically bioaccessible to bacteria in soil matrices. Powerful X-rays are produced by synchrotron radiation, allowing for bioaccessible pores in soil (larger than 4 microns), where bacteria can be accommodated, colonize and remain active, can be visualized at a much higher resolution. This study visualized and quantified such bioaccessible pores in intact field-aged, oil-contaminated unsaturated soil fractions, and examined the relationship between the abundance of bioaccessible pores and hydrocarbon biodegradation. Using synchrotron-based X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) at the Canadian Light Source, a large dataset of soil particle characteristics, such as pore volumes, surface areas, number of pores and pore size distribution, was generated. Duplicate samples of five different soil fractions with different soil aggregate sizes and water contents (13, 18 and 25%) were examined. The method for calculating the number and distribution of bioaccessible pores using CT images was validated using the known porosity of Ottawa sand. This study indicated that the distribution of bioaccessible pore sizes in soil fractions are very closely related to microbial enhancement. A follow-up aerobic biodegradation experiment for the soils at 17 °C (average site temperature) over 90 days confirmed that a notable decrease in hydrocarbon concentrations occurred in soils fractions with abundant bioaccessible pores and with a larger number of pores between 10 and 100 µm. The hydrocarbon degradation in bioactive soil fractions was extended to relatively high-molecular-weight hydrocarbons (C16-C34). This study provides quantitative information about how internal soil pore characteristics can influence bioremediation performance.",

            "abstract": "A new initiative, namely OASIS (the Observatory for Atmosphere Space Interaction Studies), has called for a very large-aperture high-power (VLAHP) lidar as its first step forward to acquire the unprecedented measurement capabilities for exploring the space-atmosphere interaction region (SAIR). Currently, there exists a serious observational gap of the Earth’s neutral atmosphere above 100 km. Information on neutral winds and temperatures and on the plasma-neutral coupling in the SAIR, especially between 100 and 200 km, is either sparse or nonexistent. Fully exploring the SAIR requires measurements of the neutral atmosphere to complement radar observations of the plasma. Lidar measurements of neutral winds, temperatures and species can enable these explorations. Many of these topics will be addressed with the VLAHP lidar.\nDiscoveries of thermospheric neutral Fe, Na and K layers up to nearly 200 km at McMurdo, Antarctica and other locations on Earth, have opened a new door to observing the neutral thermosphere with ground-based instruments. These neutral metal layers provide the tracers for resonance Doppler lidars to directly measure the neutral temperatures and winds in the thermosphere, thus enabling the VLAHP lidar dream! Because the thermospheric densities of these metal atoms are many times smaller than the layer peak densities near 90 km, high power-aperture product lidars, like the VLAHP lidar, are required to derive scientifically useful measurements. Furthermore, several key technical challenges for VLAHP lidar have been largely resolved in the last a few years through the successful development of Fe and Na Doppler lidars at Boulder. By combining Rayleigh and Raman with resonance lidar techniques and strategically operating the VLAHP lidar next to incoherent scatter radar and other complementary instruments, the VLAHP lidar will enable new cutting-edge exploration of the geospace. These new concepts and progresses will be introduced in this paper.",

An experimental multi-beam lidar transmitter at the University of Illinois overcomes this problem by the simultaneous generation of a fan of closely-spaced near-vertical beams from a single high-power pulsed laser, allowing for the resolution of horizontal features on the order of tens of meters and the capture of dynamic events such as billows and overturnings. This transmitter is coupled with a digital receiver that allows for quickly variable vertical resolution that can be dynamically varied to match the scale of observed features.",

            "abstract": "The Muckleshoot basin of western Washington, sandwiched between the Seattle Uplift on the west and the Cascade Range on the east, is deforming under north-south shortening and clockwise rotation of the north Cascadia forearc. Accommodating the regional strain are crustal faults in the Puget Lowland that cluster around three azimuths: east-west, northwest-southeast, and north-northwest-south-southeast. Evidence for all three groups appears on the periphery of the Muckleshoot basin. In this study, we add gravity measurements to an existing database to better define the geometry of the Muckleshoot basin and its relation to previously mapped faults appearing on the basin margins. A northwest-trending gravity high bisects the basin into two sub-basins, a larger one to the south and a smaller one to the north. We suggest that the gravity high is associated with a deep basement structure and its orientation is consistent with northward-directed crustal shortening. Regional-residual separation methods and derivative maps show pronounced magnetic lineations that extend faults expressed along the basin margins to east-west trending faults that cross the Puget Sound. Three intersecting cross-sectional models produced for this study are consistent with the following hypotheses: (1) the northwest-trending White River and Green River faults mapped on the eastern basin margin appear as south-verging, steeply dipping reverse faults in the central basin; (2) the north-northwest trending Franklin fault, mapped previously as a strike-slip fault, projects into the basin and shows little vertical offset in the single profile it crosses, and (3) the northwest trajectory of both the White River and Green River faults appears to curve southward as the faults traverse the Muckleshoot basin, following east-west oriented gravity and magnetic anomalies that cross the Puget Sound. Results from the study suggest that the faults and folds in Muckleshoot basin are actively interacting with other faults in the Puget Lowland to accommodate regional strain in the overriding plate.",

            "abstract": "The characterization of changes in ecosystem productivity as a consequence of water stress and changing precipitation regimes is critical in defining the response of tropical ecosystems to water stress and projecting future land cover transitions in the East African tropics. Through the analysis of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), soil moisture, rainfall and reanalysis data, this paper characterizes the 2010-11 drought in tropical East Africa. We demonstrated that SIF, a proxy of ecosystem productivity, varied with water availability during the 2010-11 drought. A comparison of the 2010-11 drought to previous regional droughts revealed that the consecutive failure of rainy seasons in fall 2010 and spring 2011 yielded a drought that is distinguished not only in intensity, but also in spatial and temporal extent as compared to an average of previous regional droughts: the 2010-11 event extended further east and with greater intensity in the southern hemisphere. Anomalously low SIF values during the 2010-11 drought are strongly correlated with those of soil moisture and precipitation. SIF also demonstrated a stronger temporal sensitivity to accumulated water deficit as compared to the conventional Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which approximates photosynthetic potential (chlorophyll content and leaf mass), from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Anomalously high rainfall during the dry seasons preceding failed rainy seasons suggest that the seasonality of East African rainfall may be transitioning from a regime characterized by biannual monsoons to one with increasing convective rainfall. Rising boundary layer height during the dry season further substantiates this conclusion by suggesting a transition towards increased deep convection during the summers. This work demonstrated the unique characteristics of the 2010-11 East African drought, and the ability of SIF to track the levels of water stress during the drought.",

The design and operation of such portfolio of water supply sources merits decisions of what and when to expand, and how much to use of each available sources accounting for interest rates, economies of scale and hydrologic variability. The present research provides a framework and an integrated methodology that optimizes the expansion of various water supply alternatives using dynamic programming and combining both short term and long term optimization of water use and simulation of water allocation. A case study in Bahia Do Rio Dos Sinos in Southern Brazil is presented. The framework couples an optimization model with quadratic programming model in GAMS with WEAP, a rain runoff simulation models that hosts the water supply infrastructure features and hydrologic conditions. Results allow (a) identification of trade offs between cost and reliability of different expansion paths and water use decisions and (b) evaluation of potential gains by reducing water system losses as a portfolio component. The latter is critical in several developing countries where water supply system losses are high and often neglected in favor of more system expansion. Results also highlight the potential of various water supply alternatives including, conservation, groundwater, and infrastructural enhancements over time. The framework proves its usefulness for planning its transferability to similarly urbanized systems.",

            "abstract": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) is important greenhouse and ozone-depleting gase. Although many efforts have been paid to N2O emissions, the spatial and temporal variability of N2O emissions still subject to large uncertainty. Application of the eddy covariance method for N2O emissions research would allow continuous ecosystem level flux measurements. The caveat, however, is need for high precision and high frequency measurements in field. In this study, an open-path, quantum cascade-laser-based eddy covariance N2O sensor has been deployed nearly continuously since May 2015 over a corn field at the W.K. Kellogg Biological Station site in SW Michigan. The field precision of the N2O sensor was assessed to be 0.1 ppbv at 10 Hz, and the total consumption was ~ 40 W, allowing the system to be powered solely by solar panels. The stability of the sensor under different temperature and humidity was tested within an environmental chamber. Spectroscopic experiments and cospectra analyses were carried out to study specific corrections associated with the sensor for eddy covariance techniques, including the line broadening effect due to water vapor and high frequency flux attenuation owning to sample path averaging. Ogive analyses indicated that the high-frequency N2O flux loss due to various damping effects was comparable to those of the CO2 flux. The detection limit of flux was estimated to be 0.3 ng N s-1 m-2 with a flux averaging interval of 30 minutes. The results from the EC system were also compared with ground measurements by standard static chambers (SC). Overall, more than 150 individual chamber measurements were taken within the footprint of the EC system. We found good correlation between the EC and SC methods given the spatiotemporal differences between the two techniques (R2 = 0.75). Both methods detected increased emissions during afternoon as compared to morning and night hours. Differences between EC and SC were also studied by investigating spatial variability with a footprint model. Our results indicate diurnality of ecosystem level N2O emissions may have important consequences for both field and global scale budgets and highlight the need of more continuous measurements for future investigation.",

            "abstract": "Increasing evidence is showing the relevance of land cover change on the regional mean climate. However, the mechanisms that explain these interactions remain a challenge in land – atmosphere interactions science. This challenge is particularly significant in understanding the role of vegetation change on climate extremes and aridity, which has been barely addressed by the literature.\nIn this paper we focus on this gap by investigating the effects of land use and land cover change on selected climate extremes indices and aridity in non-Amazonian South America over an area of about 3 million km2. We run a 3 ensemble climate model nudged with the ERA-Interim reanalysis and stretched to 25 km resolution for present (year 2005) land cover relative to realistic historic vegetation distribution. The most important results of this experiment are that the degree of change in vegetation structure determines whether extreme daytime temperatures will increase or decrease, particularly during the dry season. This is because a large change in surface roughness promotes increased wind speeds and heat advection, whereas a small change in surface roughness does not increase wind and can increase heat build-up in the atmosphere since the sensible heat flux also increases. We also put these results in a wider context of land surface – atmospheric feedbacks by looking at the corresponding change in aridity (precipitation / potential evapotranspiration). This shows the processes that drive the changes in temperature extremes also determine whether significant changes in aridity occur, since all the change in aridity can be prescribed to changes in potential evaporation, or atmospheric water demand.\nWe propose a conceptual model of the mechanisms that explain these alterations which is an advance in understanding land-atmosphere interactions and provides evidence of the main mechanisms responsible of changes in the feedbacks because of changes in natural vegetation.",

            "abstract": "About 20% of the world’s population relies on melting snow for their main water supply. Many of these areas are mountainous and there is limited in situ monitoring of snow accumulation and melt due to few stations and the lack of representativeness of these stations in this complex terrain. Most of the existing stations only collect precipitation and temperature data, thus modeling of snowmelt often uses temperature as an index for the full energy balance needed to physically model melt. Across the Western United States (U.S.), there are currently about 700 snow telemetry (SNOTEL) stations that monitor precipitation and temperature, as well as snow water equivalent (SWE) and snow depth. Across the Southern Rocky Mountains in the central-western U.S., 90 SNOTEL stations have been operating since the late 1970s or mid-1980s. These stations were used to estimate the daily snowmelt rate as a function of the daily average air temperature, in millimeters of snow melt per day per degrees Celsius, over half-month periods to consider the seasonality of incoming solar radiation. The spatio-temporal variability of melt was then evaluated based on the location, topography, and canopy characteristics for each station. It is expected that this melt rate spatio-temporal variability can applied to other continental regions across the globe.",

            "abstract": "Northeast China (NEC, hereinafter) is a relatively complex block in Northeast Asia, which was formed in Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras due to the closing of Paleoasian Ocean (west) and the subduction of ancient Pacific plate (east). Unlike its neighbor North China Craton(NCC), NEC is not a typical craton but more like a craton margin which is more active and could probably tell us more about how a craton-like block is affected by subduction. It is a best place to study intra-continental volcanism: Mesozoic and Cenozoic volcanoes are widespread in the whole area, resulting in many famous volcanic zones: Changbai and Jingpohu in the east, Wudalianchi in the north, Arshan and Dalenuor in the west. Here we try to find the seismic evidence of where these volcanoes originated from and how they indicate the possible inner connection between the subduction of slabs and the evolution of NEC. We use dispersion curves respectively obtained from earthquake Two-Station Method (TSM)and Ambient Noise Tomography (ANT) to invert 3-D shear wave velocity structure beneath NEC. Unlike Helmhotz and Ekional tomography who requires evenly distributed station but can give estimates of uncertainty automatically, the TSM method could be done with uneven stations and more important, could obtain phase velocities of long periods and with less noise. We first get high - resolution tomographic figure of a wide range from 6s to 160s and give estimate of uncertainties of each period by bootstrap method. After obtaining high-resolution phase velocity maps, we invert for shear wave velocity using the Bayesian Monte-Carlo method of Shen et al., 2013, in which the Moho depth is constrained by receiver function results from Tao et al., 2014. Our results shows that the sources of the volcanoes are not the same: Changbai has the strongest and deepest source which may be directly supplied by a mid-lower mantle source; Arshan and Dalenuor have strong low velocity anomaly in upper mantle but vanish when going deeper; Wudalianchi has a shallowest source which only confines in crust and uppermost mantle and may come from low velocity zones in the east through preexisting faults.",

Imparting scientific knowledge to the public in one direction, however successfully done, could be called \"transmission.\" It's not until the public responds that you have \"communication,\" or maybe a better word would be \"conversation.\"\nThe National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) has been working on a project for use in its educational visitor center that not only attempts to engage the public with concise, accurate scientific information, but also to help the public respond, in order to create a communicative circuit. Using an interactive game platform, visitors can immerse themselves in a voyage of scientific discovery by choosing a character and building a story line based on multiple selections, a version of a “build your own adventure” experience. We are exploring ways to capture data from these interactions in order to inform additional program development based on areas of greatest interest to the public. The game could thus be used to update existing exhibits so they better reflect those areas of interest, making them more relevant and engaging to visitors, and expanding opportunities for dialogue between science centers and members of the public.",

            "abstract": "Microbial mats are formed by microorganisms working in coordinated symbiosis, often benefitting the community by controlling the local geochemical or physical environment. Thus, the ecology of the mat depends on the individual roles of microbes organized into niches within a larger architecture. Chemolithotrophic Fe-oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) form distinctive Fe oxyhydroxide biominerals which constitute the building blocks of the mat. However, the majority of our progress has been in understanding the overall community structure. Understanding the physical mat structure on the microbial scale is important to unraveling FeOB evolution, the biogeochemistry and ecology of Fe-rich habitats, and ultimately interpreting FeOB biosignatures in the rock record.\nMats in freshwater and marine environments contain strikingly similar biomineral morphologies, yet they are formed by phylogenetically distinct microorganisms. This suggests that the overall architecture and underlying genetics of freshwater and marine mats has evolved to serve particular roles specific to Fe oxidation. Thus, we conducted a comparative study of Fe seep freshwater mats and marine hydrothermal mats. We have developed a new approach to sampling Fe mats in order to preserve the delicate structure for analysis by confocal and scanning electron microscopy.\nOur analyses of these intact mats show that freshwater and marine mats are similarly initiated by a single type of structure-former. These ecosystem engineers form either a hollow sheath or a twisted stalk biomineral during mat formation, with a highly directional structure. These microbes appear to be the vanguard organisms that anchor the community within oxygen/Fe(II) gradients, further allowing for community succession in the mat interior as evidenced by other mineralized morphologies. Patterns in biomineral thickness and directionality were indicative of redox gradients and temporal changes in the geochemical environment. These observations show that the FeOB create the structure of the environment for the entire microbial community, acting as environmental engineers. Furthermore, they leave behind distinctive signatures of environmental conditions (e.g. presence of oxygen, hydrothermal pulsing), which can be recorded in the rock record.",

            "abstract": "Food security risk assessments can provide decision-makers with actionable information to identify critical system limitations, and alternatives to mitigate the impacts of future conditions. The majority of current risk assessments have been scenario-led and results are limited by the scenarios - selected future states of the world’s climate system and socioeconomic factors. A generic scenario-neutral framework for food security risk assessments is presented here that uses plausible states of the world without initially assigning likelihoods. Measures of system vulnerabilities are identified and system risk is assessed for these states. This framework has benefited greatly by research in the water and natural resource fields to adapt their planning to provide better risk assessments. To illustrate the utility of this framework we develop a case study using livestock heat stress risk within the pastoral system of West Africa. Heat stress can have a major impact not only on livestock owners, but on the greater food production system, decreasing livestock growth, milk production, and reproduction, and in severe cases, death. A heat stress index calculated from daily weather is used as a vulnerability measure and is computed from historic daily weather data at several locations in the study region. To generate plausible states, a stochastic weather generator is developed to generate synthetic weather sequences at each location, consistent with the seasonal climate. A spatial model of monthly and seasonal heat stress provide projections of current and future livestock heat stress measures across the study region, and can incorporate in seasonal climate and other external covariates. These models, when linked with empirical thresholds of heat stress risk for specific breeds offer decision-makers with actionable information for use in near-term warning systems as well as for future planning. Future assessment can indicate under which states livestock are at greatest risk of heat stress; when coupled with assessments of additional measures (e.g. water and fodder availability) can inform on alternatives that provide satisfactory performance under a wide range of states (e.g. optimal cattle breed, supplemental feed, increased water access).",

            "abstract": "The Upper Ordovician Rowland Member (Drakes Formation) exposed in the Cincinnati Arch region displays a suite of unusual facies that appear to record an environmental transition during the Late Ordovician. The Rowland displays four well-defined lithofacies, each containing a distinct biofacies. Proximal facies consist of green to gray shaly lime mudstones (often dolomitized), with ripples and desiccation cracks; these facies are sparsely fossiliferous, but show an abundance of infaunal filter feeders indicated by glauconite-filled burrows. These facies pass downramp into pale medium-bedded argillaceous micritic limestones, which are also sparsely fossiliferous but locally contain abundant deposit feeding organisms including brachiopods, small bryozoans, mollusks, and non-calcified algae. Select horizons yield rugosan and large colonial corals. These micritic beds often interfinger with a series of thick skeletal grainstone lenses that represent tidally influenced high-energy shoals and are exceptionally rich in well-preserved gastropods. To the north, these grainstones pass abruptly into offshore gray shaly packstone facies more typical of the Cincinnatian and contain a higher diversity of epifaunal brachiopods and ramose bryozoans.\nCompared to upramp facies of older Cincinnatian cycles, those of the Rowland show a greater thickness, relatively more micrite and glauconite, and higher abundance of corals and gastropods. These changes appear to be associated with a strong transgression underlain by a regional (and possibly global) lowstand erosional surface, as well as the Waynesville carbon isotope excursion. Additionally, these facies are correlative with similar transgressive facies in other regions, which also overlie regional lowstand unconformities. Increased micrite production instead of skeletal carbonates and the abundance of herbivorous? gastropods rather than echinoderms and bryozoans may indicate large-scale eutrophication and algal production. Ecologically, these events may signify a change in overall taxonomic composition and replacement of incumbent taxa that post-dates the Richmondian invasion. Together, the lithologic and biologic facies patterns of the Rowland may be associated with a rapid rise in base level and the Boda global warming event.",

            "abstract": "Nearly all channels experience unsteady flows, from gradually varying snowmelt driven hydrographs to rapidly changing rain driven or regulated hydrographs. Despite this, the impacts of hydrograph form on bedload transport processes remain poorly understood. A set of flume experiments was conducted at the University of Idaho’s Stream Lab to investigate whether hydrograph form (rapid vs gradual changes in flow) alters transport rates and mobile grain sizes for a given discharge as well as armor persistence and total transport volume during a high flow event. Prior to experiments the flume was run to equilibrium with limited sediment feed to armor the bed. Experiments included four steady state runs and nine hydrograph runs that used five different hydrograph forms. The rate of change in flow between time-steps varied in the hydrographs but minimum and peak flows and total estimated transport capacity were held constant.\nInitial data analysis suggests that hydrograph form does indeed impact total transport volumes, transport rates, and transported grain sizes. More rapidly changing hydrographs transported a larger total volume of sediment and had greater transport rates at peak flow than hydrographs with slower rates of change. All hydrographs displayed counter-clockwise hysteresis in transport rates with the exception of the most gradually varying run. More rapidly changing hydrographs had coarser bedload material on the rising limb but finer bedload material on the falling limb compared the same flow in more gradually changing hydrographs. Many of these observations may be linked to more significant armor loss promoted by more rapid changes in flow. On the rising limb, rapid changes in flow may increase the unsteady component of shear stress to mobilize larger grains and greater volumes of sediment over short durations compared to the effects of gradual flow increases. This has the potential to destabilize the armor surface and further mobilize surface and subsurface material. Repeat photos and high speed video of the bed surface during experiments will be used to investigate this hypothesis and further work will identify and quantify significant relationships between hydrograph form and bedload transport processes.",

The global expression of this change in substrates that reflect multiple carbon pools provides important evidence that many events reflect persistent, global redistribution of carbon between reduced and oxidized stocks. As the diversity of records documenting any event grows, however, discrepancies in the expression of carbon isotope change among substrates are almost always revealed. These differences in magnitude, pace, and pattern of change can complicate interpretations of global carbon redistribution, but under ideal circumstances can also provide additional information on changes in specific environmental and biogeochemical systems that accompanied the global events.\nHere we evaluate possible environmental influences on new terrestrial records of the negative carbon isotope excursions (CIEs) associated with multiple hyperthermals of the Early Eocene, which show a common pattern of amplified carbon isotope change in terrestrial paleosol carbonate records relative to that recorded in marine substrates. Scaling relationships between climate and carbon-cycle proxies suggest that that the climatic (temperature) impact of each event scaled proportionally with the magnitude of its marine CIE, likely implying that all events involved release of reduced carbon with a similar isotopic composition. Amplification of the terrestrial CIEs, however, does not scale with event magnitude, being proportionally less for the first, largest event (the PETM). We conduct a sensitivity test of a coupled plant-soil carbon isotope model to identify conditions that could account for the observed CIE scaling. At least two possibilities consistent with independent lines of evidence emerge: first, varying effects of pCO2 change on photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination under changing background pCO2, and second, contrasting changes in regional hydroclimate during the PETM and subsequent hyperthermals. These mechanisms have very different implications for the reconstruction of environmental conditions, and resolving the correct interpretation will require new, complimentary records of plant and soil conditions associated with the Early Eocene hyperthermals.",

            "abstract": "Studies of agriculture often focus on yields and calories, but overlook the production of diverse nutrients needed for human health. Nutritional production is particularly important in low-income countries, where foods produced correspond largely to those consumed. Through an analysis of crops, livestock, and animal products, this study aims to quantify the nutritional differences between household-level production and consumption in the Millennium Village at Bonsaaso, Ghana. By converting food items into their nutritional components it became clear that certain nutritional disparities existed between the two categories. In Bonsasso, 64-78% of households exhibited deficiencies in the consumption of Calcium, Fat, and/or Vitamin A despite less than 30% of households showing deficiencies on the production side. To better understand these differences, k-means clustering analysis was performed, placing households into groups characterized by nutritional means. By comparing the households in these groupings, it was clear that clusters formed around certain nutritional deficiencies. The socioeconomic characteristics of these groupings were then studied for correlations, concentrating on number of people at the household, sex and age of household head, and dependency ratio. It was found that clusters with high dependency ratios (the number of working persons in the household to non-working persons) exhibited a large variety of, and often drastic, nutritional deficiencies. In fact, the cluster with the highest average dependency ratio exhibited deficiencies in every nutrient. In light of these findings, regional policies may look to target households with a large number of dependents, and package nutrients for household distribution based on the characteristics of these clusters.",

            "abstract": "The amplitude of convection-induced long wavelength dynamic topography is uncertain. One advocacy of small amplitude dynamic topography invokes the observed small free air anomaly and GTR (free air gravity-topography ratio). We investigate this problem by inversing mantle structure constrained by long wavelength geoid, free air anomaly, gravity gradient and recently compiled high accuracy residual topography. Although geoid, free air anomaly and gravity gradient essentially include the same information, they are sensitive to mantle structure at different depth. Residual topography provides direct constraints on mantle convection. However, previous estimates of residual topography are usually with large uncertainty. We use recently compiled high accuracy point measurements of residual topography to constrain our inversion. We include lateral viscosity variation (temperature dependent viscosity, shallow viscosity heterogeneity, LVV) in our inversion since previous forward models suggests that LVV affects the surface gravitational and topography signals significantly. Our results indicate that considering LVV in the inversion does not change the misfit significantly, in contrary to previous forward models, suggesting (1) the over-fitting in previous 1D viscosity profile inversions or (2) temperature induced lateral viscosity variation are balanced by other effects at long wavelength features (2-8 degree). Although the inverted mantle structure is non-unique, all models predict larger than ~ 1.0 km amplitude long wavelength dynamic topography, consistent with the long wavelength components of the recent residual topography observations. Our analysis indicates that the relationship between free air gravity and topography depends on sphere harmonic degrees (wavelength). Thus the small amplitude free air gravity anomaly does not require small amplitude dynamic topography. We propose that despite GTR is quite helpful in deciphering the compensation depth of topography, it should not be used to estimate compensation depth based on global distributed observations on Earth.",

New data from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission, launched in 2013, allows for a thorough study of the electrically conductive nature of the Martian ionosphere. Determinations of the electrical conductivity will be made using in-situ atmospheric and ionospheric measurements, rather than scientific models for the first time. The objective of this project is to calculate the conductivity of the Martian atmosphere, whenever possible, throughout the trajectory of the MAVEN spacecraft. MAVEN instrumentation used includes the Neutral Gas and Ion Mass Spectrometer (NGIMS) for neutral species density, the Suprathermal and Thermal Ion Compositions (STATIC) for ion composition, temperature and density, the Magnetometer (MAG) for the magnetic field strength and the Langmuir Probe and Waves (LPW) for electron temperature and density. MAVEN key parameter data are used for these calculations. We compare our results with previous, model-based estimates of the conductivity. These results will allow us to quantify the flow of atmospheric electric currents which can be analyzed further for a deeper understanding of the Martian ionospheric electrodynamics, bringing us closer to understanding the mystery of the loss of the Martian atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Top-down approaches in hydrology offer the possibility to predict water fluxes at the catchment scale based on the interpretation of the observed hydrological response at the catchment itself. Doing hydrology backwards (inferring precipitation and evapotranspiration rates at the catchment scale from streamflow measurements, see Kirchner (2009)) can be a useful methodology for estimating water fluxes at the catchment and regional scales. Previous studies using this inverse modeling approach have been performed in regions (UK, Switzerland, France, Eastern US) where energy-limited (in winter and early spring) and water-limited conditions (in summer) prevail during a large period of the year. However, such approach has not been tested in regions characterized by a quasi-constant supply of water and energy (e.g. humid tropics). The objective of this work is to infer annual rates of precipitation and evapotranspiration over the last decade in 10 catchments located in Mexico’s tropical humid regions. Hourly discharge measurements during recession periods were analyzed and parameters for the nonlinear storage-discharge relationship of each catchment were derived. Results showed large variability in both catchment-scale precipitation and evapotranspiration rates among the selected study sites. Finally, a comparison was done between such estimates and those obtained from remotely-sensed data (TRMM for precipitation and MOD16 for evapotranspiration).",

            "abstract": "The Acasta Gneiss Complex (AGC) of the Slave Craton in the Northwest Territories, Canada, contains some of Earth’s oldest continental crust. It is characterized by a range of compositionally diverse gneisses with crystallization ages of 3.3 to > 4.0 Ga1-5. The AGC has undergone a multistage history of metamorphism and deformation. Given these post-crystallization processes, the extent of Nd isotope heterogeneity suggested by published4-7 whole rock Sm-Nd analyses of these rocks has been called into question. Criticisms include the likelihood of mixed lithologies at the hand-sample scale and the potential for open-system behavior of the Sm-Nd isotopic system in these rocks. We obtained whole rock compositional, Sm-Nd and Lu-Hf isotope data paired with Hf in zircon and Nd in titanite and apatite data to further evaluate the isotope record, and use U-Pb and Lu-Hf of zircon as a basis for identifying mixed or complex samples. Preferential preservation of Lu-Hf over Sm-Nd isotope systematics in multiply deformed, complex rocks may be controlled by the minerals that dominate the Hf and Nd budgets, with the majority of the Hf effectively sheltered in zircon and the Nd largely hosted in accessory phases such as apatite and titanite. This composite dataset enables us to evaluate the possibility that Hf and Nd isotopic systematics have been decoupled in these samples that have such critical bearing on our understanding of early crust-forming processes.\n[1]Bowring and Williams (1999).

This study shows that the latitude location of the upper-tropospheric warm- center (T) coincides with the subtropical anticyclone, and its longitude location is determined by the zonal distribution of vertical gradient of heating/cooling (QZ), which is different from the Gill’s model. Since both convective heating and radiation cooling decrease with height in the upper troposphere, the heating/cooling generates vertical northerly/southerly shear, leading to a warm/cold center being developed between heating profile in the east/west and cooling profile in the west/east.\nThe location of the UTTM coincides with the South Asian High (SAH) and is between a radiation cooling in the west and the Asian-monsoon convection heating source in the east. The UTTM is sensitive to this convective heating: increased heating in the source region in a general circulation model causes intensification of both the SAH and UTTM, and imposing periodic convective heating there results in oscillations in the SAH, UTTM, and vertical motion to the west with the same period. Diagnoses of reanalysis indicate that such an inherent subtropical T-QZ relation is significant at interannual timescale. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the feedback of atmospheric circulation to rainfall anomalies is an important contributor to the regional climate anomaly pattern.",

Average soil water content, temperature and deep percolation fluxes are linked to weathering and soil formation processes. Model input (temperature and precipitation) for the last 25 000 years was generated on a daily time by combining palaeoclimate data and the WXGEN weather generator. The soil-landscape model was applied to a 48 km2 semi-natural catchment in Southern Spain, with soils developed on granite.\nModel-generated runoff was used for a first validation against discharge observations. Next, soil formation output was contrasted against experimental data from 10 soil profiles along two catenas. Field data showed an important variation in mobile regolith thickness, between 0,44 and 1,10m, and in chemical weathering along the catena. Southern slopes were characterized by shallower, stonier and carbon-poor soils, while soils on north-facing slopes were deeper, more fine-textured and had a higher carbon content. Chemical depletion fraction was found to vary between 0,41 and 0,72. The lowest overall weathering intensity was found on plateau positions. South facing slopes revealed slightly lower weathering compared to north facing slopes. We attribute this to higher runoff generation and physical erosion rates on north facing slopes, transporting weathered material downslope. Model results corroborate these findings and show continuously wet soils on north-facing slopes with more runoff generation and a steady deep percolation flux during the wet winter season. On south-facing slopes, infiltration is higher and percolation is more erratic over time. Soils on the footslopes then were shown to be significantly impacted by deposition of sediment through lateral erosion fluxes.",

This information has traditionally been developed through the use of triggers for heat indices which combine humidity and temperature. The criteria typically used numeric thresholds and did not consider impact from a particular heat episode, nor did it factor seasonality or population acclimation.\nIn 2013, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California, San Diego in collaboration with the Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment, of the California Environmental Protection Agency and the NWS completed a study of heat health impact in California, while the NWS San Diego office began modifying their criteria towards departure from climatological normal with much less dependence on humidity or heat index. The NWS changes were based on initial findings from the California Department of Public Health, EpiCenter California Injury Data Online system which documents heat health impacts. Results from the UCSD study were finalized and published in 2014; they supported the need for significant modification of the traditional criteria.\nIn order to better understand the impacts of heat on community health, medical outcome data were provided by the County of San Diego Emergency Medical Services Branch, which is charged by the County’s Public Health Officer to monitor heat-related illness and injury daily from June through September. The data were combined with UCSD research to inform the modification of local NWS heat criteria and establish trigger points to pilot new procedures for the issuance of heat alerts. Finally, practices and procedures were customized for each of the county health departments in the NWS area of responsibility across extreme southwest California counties in collaboration with their Office of Emergency Services. The end result of the collaboration was to better define temperature thresholds relative to local climate, levels of heat related responses and activation, as well as to develop standardized terminology on public notifications. In 2014, the County of San Diego Office of Emergency Services incorporated heat alerts into the emergency push notification system for 2 significant heat waves.",

            "abstract": "The goal of a hydraulic fracture treatment program is to activate a discrete fracture network (DFN) that connects as much of the reservoir as possible and produces pathways for the extraction of hydrocarbons at the production well. The activated DFN usually grows outwards from the treatment well along the direction of the local maximum horizontal stress, SHmax. However, individual fractures in the DFN will have varying orientations that need not align with the overall azimuth or growth. The orientations of the individual fractures are determined by which pre-existing fractures generated from geological processes. The idealized cases of pure shear failures from long term deformation are likely oriented about 30 degrees from the direction of the maximum principal stress at the time of their activation and are not necessarily aligned with the current SHmax. Generally, pre-existing fracture sets do not align with SHmax ,and these multiple sets will be activated and grow in an en-echelon fashion to create a connected network that can move fluid away from the well.\nWe use mechanisms from microseismic data, combined with a stress inversion, to constrain the fracture orientations associated with microseismic events. We examine a number of stages from the zipper-frac completion of half pad in the Horn River Basin, where generally two fracture sets are activated during the completion. However, we observe, potentially due to subtle rotations in the stresses throughout the completion, that different fractures are activated with space. This heterogeneity in orientation relative to SH­max is critical input for the geomechanical models on how treatment design programs influences the propagation of fluid and proppant into the reservoir.",

            "abstract": "The goal of SOCRATES is to resolve the critical but underexplored role of the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS) in climate change. The mission would provide the suite of measurements required to quantify UTLS transport pathways and their contribution to UTLS composition, and to evaluate the radiative forcing implications of changes in UTLS composition forced by expected changes in these pathways as the climate evolves. The discrimination and quantification of UTLS transport pathways requires simultaneous measurement of several key trace gases and aerosols with high precision, accuracy, and vertical resolution. Furthermore, aerosols and clouds, often present in the UTLS, complicate the measurement of trace gases. The SOCRATES sensor is a 23-channel Gas Filter Correlation Radiometer (GFCR), referred to as GLO (GFCR Limb solar Occultation), with heritage from HALOE on UARS, and SOFIE on AIM. GLO measures aerosol extinction from 0.45 to 3.88 µm, important radiatively active gases in the UTLS (H2O, O3, CH4, N2O), key tracers of UTLS transport (HCN, CO, HDO), gases important in stratospheric O3 chemistry (HCl and HF), and temperature from cloud top to 50 km at a vertical resolution of < 1 km. Improved pointing knowledge will provide dramatically better retrieval precision in the UTLS, even in the presence of aerosols, than possible with HALOE. In addition, the GLO form factor is only of order 10% of that of HALOE, and costs for a constellation of GLO sensors is within the cost cap of a NASA Earth Venture mission. The SOCRATES mission concept is a 6-element constellation of autonomous small satellites, each mated with a GLO sensor, and deployed from a single launch vehicle. The SOCRATES/GLO approach reaps the advantages of solar occultation: high precision and accuracy; robust calibration; and high vertical resolution, while mitigating the sparse coverage of a single solar occultation sensor. We present the SOCRATES science case, and key elements of the SOCRATES mission and GLO instrument concepts.",

Hypoxia exerts an influence on the stability of minerals and organic debris, direction of nutrient flux at the sediment-water interface, and the extent of benthic-pelagic coupling. This study aimed to address fundamental questions related to sediment phosphorus (P) dynamics in response to transient bottom water hypoxia particularly on P effluxes at the sediment-water interface and P burial (as authigenic/vivianite P) under two pathways: remineralization of organic P (coupled C−P pathway) and reductive dissolution of ferric Fe-bound P (coupled Fe−P pathway). Authigenic phosphate isotope data suggest that the regeneration of inorganic P in the sediment from organic matter degradation (remineralization) is the predominant, if not sole, pathway for authigenic P precipitation in the sediments. Interestingly, ferric Fe-bound phosphate oxygen isotopes are heavier than equilibrium. This means that the ferric Fe-bound P pool in these sediments is largely composed of particulate P from terrestrial sources composed primarily of Fe phyllosilicates plus potentially vivianite that are largely resistant against dissolution in the anoxic sediment column. These results collectively support the predominance of coupled C−P pathway of P cycling, rather than Fe−P coupling, in hypoxic environment in the Chesapeake Bay.\n ",

Which applications, social media venues and outreach mechanisms solicit the most valuable feedback? Of the dizzying toolkit available for community-building, which tools should receive time, attention and dedication? Finally, how does it all relate to better geoscience research?\nResearch projects in the geosciences are rapidly becoming more interdisciplinary, requiring use of broader data-sets and a multitude of data-types in an effort to explain questions important to both the scientific community and the general public. Effective use of the data and tools available requires excellent community communication and engagement across disciplines, as well as a manner to easily obtain and access those data and tools.\nFor over two years, the EarthCube project has sought to create the most active and engaged community possible, bringing together experts from all across the NSF GEO directorate and its many-faceted disciplines. Initial efforts focused on collecting insight and opinions at in-person “end-user workshops,” and informal organization of interest groups and teams. Today, efforts feature an organizational structure with dedicated internal communication and outreach groups.\nThe EarthCube Office has been largely responsible for coordination of these groups and the social media and Internet presence of the project to date, through the creation and curation of the EarthCube.org website, social media channels, live-streaming of meetings, and newsletters. Measures of the effectiveness of these efforts will be presented, to serve as potential reference and guidance for other projects seeking to grow their own communities. In addition, we will discuss how the Office’s role in outreach and engagement has changed over the past year with the creation of the Engagement and Liaison Teams, and what it signifies for the Office’s role in EarthCube’s future.",

            "abstract": "In China, the tree peony (Paeonia suffruticosa) is well known as the “king of flowers” since ancient times. The springtime flowering of it attracts a great number of tourists every year. Under the current background of rapid climate change, the flowering time of the tree peony has changed accordingly, which affected the travel arrangements of tourists. This paper is concerned with developing a panel data model to describe the relationship between full-flowering date (FFD) of the tree peony (Zhongyuan cultivar group) and relevant temperature change in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River. Then FFD time series at 24 sites in the period 1955–2011 were reconstructed using the above-mentioned model. At last, spatial and temporal variations in FFD were analysed. The results showed that the panel data model could simulate the FFDs of the tree peony accurately, with explained variance (R2)>0.65 and the root-mean-square error (RMSE)＜4.0 in the steps of double cross-validation. The simulated 57-year mean FFDs in the distribution area generally followed the latitudinal gradient. The FFDs in this area have advanced by 6 to 9 days over the past 57 years, at the rate of 0.8 to 1.8 days/decade. Compared with the other sub-areas in this area, the eastern forelands of Taihang Mountains and Luliang Mountains showed clearer advances of FFD. These conclusions reflected the comprehensive impact of climate change and the foehn on phenophases and are helpful for historical climate studies and festival events management",

            "abstract": "We present recent work towards developing a methodology for quantifying uncertainty in Greenland’s 21st century contribution to sea-level rise. While we focus on uncertainties associated with the optimization and calibration of the basal sliding parameter field, the methodology is largely generic and could be applied to other (or multiple) sets of uncertain model parameter fields. The first step in the workflow is the solution of a large-scale, deterministic inverse problem, which minimizes the mismatch between observed and computed surface velocities by optimizing the two-dimensional coefficient field in a linear-friction sliding law. We then expand the deviation in this coefficient field from its estimated \"mean\" state using a reduced basis of Karhunen-Loeve Expansion (KLE) vectors. A Bayesian calibration is used to determine the optimal coefficient values for this expansion. The prior for the Bayesian calibration can be computed using the Hessian of the deterministic inversion or using an exponential covariance kernel. The posterior distribution is then obtained using Markov Chain Monte Carlo run on an emulator of the forward model. Finally, the uncertainty in the modeled sea-level rise is obtained by performing an ensemble of forward propagation runs. We present and discuss preliminary results obtained using a moderate-resolution model of the Greenland Ice sheet. As demonstrated in previous work, the primary difficulty in applying the complete workflow to realistic, high-resolution problems is that the effective dimension of the parameter space is very large.",

One of the most common relationships, used in the current Global Precipitation Measurement retrieval algorithm for example, assigns the density of snow as a constant tenth of the density of ice (0.1g/m^3). This assumption stands in contrast to the results of derived m-D relationships of snow particles, which imply decreasing particle densities at larger sizes and result in particle masses orders of magnitude below the constant density relationship.\nIn this study, forward simulations of bulk cloud properties (e.g., total water content, radar reflectivity and precipitation rate) derived from measured size distributions using several historical m-D relationships are presented. This expands upon previous studies that mainly focused on smaller ice particles because of the examination of precipitation-sized particles here. In situ and remote sensing data from the GPM Cold season Experiment (GCPEx) and Canadian CloudSAT/Calypso Validation Program (C3VP), both synoptic snowstorm field experiments in southern Ontario, Canada, are used to evaluate the forward simulations against total water content measured by the Nevzorov and Cloud Spectrometer and Impactor (CSI) probe, radar reflectivity measured by a C band ground based radar and a nadir pointing Ku/Ka dual frequency airborne radar, and precipitation rate measured by a 2D video disdrometer.\nThere are differences between the bulk cloud properties derived using varying m-D relations, with constant density assumptions producing results differing substantially from the bulk measured quantities. The variability in bulk cloud properties derived using different m-D relations is compared against the natural variability in those parameters seen in the GCPEx and C3VP field experiments.",

            "abstract": "Chromium(III)-bearing minerals, commonly found in serpentinite and ultramaphic rocks, are ubiquitous in California soils and along convergent plate boundaries worldwide. Elevated concentrations of carcinogenic Cr(VI) have been measured in groundwater throughout the state, even in aquifers untouched by anthropogenic contamination. In most natural systems, manganese oxides are the only known, kinetically viable, oxidant of Cr(III). Numerous laboratory studies have demonstrated a finite capacity of Mn-oxides to generate Cr(VI) before surface alterations inhibit further Cr-oxidation. The extent to which these processes dictate the inhibition, and subsequent regeneration, of Mn-oxidation capacity within structured soils and sediments is not well understood. Here we use artificial soil aggregates made of Fe(III),Cr(III)-hydroxide-coated quartz sand and surrounded by aerated solute flow (pH 8, 30mM HEPES, 10mM HCO3-) to investigate C(VI) generation within ultramafic rock derived sediment and processes inhibiting manganese reactivity. We found that while Cr(VI)-production scaled with Cr-mineral solubility; Cr(VI) effluent concentrations from aggregates of both lower and higher solubility Cr(III)-minerals peaked very soon after reaction with birnessite (within 2 days and 4 days, respectively). Once Cr(VI) production plateaued (t=22 days) aggregate influent was acidified (pH 5, 30mM C2H3O2-). Despite increasing Cr(III) solubility at lower pH, aqueous Cr(VI) production further decreased. A secondary pulse of Cr(VI) generation was seen only after the surrounding solute returned to initial conditions (pH 8).

            "abstract": "Most scientists agree that greenhouse gases (GHG) such as carbon dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) are major contributors to the global warming trend and climate change. One effort to mitigate anthropogenic sourced CO2 is through carbon capture and sequestration. Depleted oil and gas reservoirs due to their known trapping capability, in-place infrastructure, and proximity to carbon emission sources are good candidates for possible CO2 storage. The Vedder formation is one of three reservoirs identified in the San Joaquin Basin that meets standards for possible storage. An analysis of net fluid production data (produced minus injected) from discovery to the present is used to determine the reservoir volume available for CO2 storage. Data regarding reservoir pressure response to injection and production of fluids include final shut-in pressures from drill stem test, static bottom-hole pressure measurements from well completion histories, and idle well fluid level measurements for recent pressure data. Proprietary experimental pressure, volume and temperature data (PVT), gas oil ratios (GOR), well by well permeability, porosity, and oil gravity, and relative permeability and perforation intervals are used to create static and dynamic multiphase fluid flow models. All data collected was logged and entered into excel spreadsheets and mapping software to create subsurface structure, reservoir thickness and pressure maps, cross sections, production/injection charts on a well-by-well basis, and both static and dynamic flow models. This data is used to determine storage capacity and the amount of pressure variance within the field to determine how the reservoir will react to CO2 injection and to gain insight into the subsurface fluid movement of CO2. Results indicate a homogenous field with a storage capacity of approximately 26 Million Metric Tons of CO2. Analysis of production by stream and pressure change through time indicates a strong water drive. The connection to a large and active aquifer allows pressure changes to be spread over large areas. Flow modeling will help to determine the impact that the water influx will have on storage capacity and EOR production potential.",

            "abstract": "Ecological Niche Modeling (ENM) is a collection of techniques to find a ”fundamental niche”, the range of environmental conditions suitable for a species’ survival in the absence of inter-species interactions, given a set of environmental parameters. Traditional approaches to ENM face a number of obstacles including limited data accessibility, data management problems, computational costs, interface usability, and model validation. The MERGANSER system, which stands for Modeling Ecological Residency Given A Normalized Set of Environmental Records, addresses these issues through powerful data persistence and flexible data access, coupled with a clear presentation of results and fine-tuned control over model parameters. MERGANSER leverages data measuring 72 weather related phenomena, land cover, soil type, population, species occurrence, general species information, and elevation, totaling over 1.5 TB of data. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, MERGANSER uses higher-resolution spatial data sets than previously published models. Since MERGANSER stores data in an instance of Apache SOLR, layers generated in support of niche models are accessible to users via simplified Apache Lucene queries. This is made even simpler via an HTTP front end that generates Lucene queries automatically. Specifically, a user need only enter the name of a place and a species to run a model. Using this approach to synthesizing model layers, the MERGANSER system has successfully reproduced previously published niche model results with a simplified user experience. Input layers for the model are generated dynamically using OpenStreetMap and SOLR’s spatial search functionality. Models are then run using either user-specified or automatically determined parameters after normalizing them into a common grid. Finally, results are visualized in the web interface, which allows for quick validation. Model results and all surrounding metadata are also accessible to the user for further study.",

Since the 1999 Chi-Chi earthquake (Mw=7.6), more than a decade of GPS records reveal postseismic deformation across Taiwan and have been used for afterslip and lithospheric rheology studies. Previous researches show that this earthquake has experienced rapid afterslip on deeper part of Chelungpu fault with slip rates decreased within years [Hsu et al., 2002 and 2007]. Other postseismic deformation signals were modeled by assumed Maxwell viscoelastic relaxation with heterogeneous lower crust and upper mantle [Rousset et al., 2012; Tang et al., 2015], which suggest that the pattern of vertical displacements is more sensitive to the geometry of heterogeneous viscoelastic lithospheric structure. To improve the spatial coverage of observation, this study processed both ERS and Envisat SAR images from 1999-2008 with PSInSAR techniques, and the result provide a better illustration of Line-Of-Sight (LOS) deformation field which is near to vertical. Both GPS and PSInSAR results reveal that the surface displacement rates (horizontal or vertical?) of eastern Taiwan are higher than interseismic rates after a decade, and this feature may reveal the importance of low viscosity zone beneath central range of Taiwan.\nWith the benefits from GPS and PSInSAR data, we intend to test other posssible viscosity and the geometry of viscoelastic structure. We adopt coseismic fault geometry and slip distribution of the Chi-Chi earthquake based on previous studies, and build a set of 2D rheological models with an elastic upper-crust layer overlain a viscoelastic lower-crust layer and a viscoelastic upper mantle. The depths of the two layer boundaries are determined according to subsurface tectonic and velocity structures inferred by previous literatures. We employ the finite element method (FEM), Pylith, to estimate the postseismic surface deformation corresponding to different viscosities. Benefit from the flexibility of FEM mesh building, we are able to model surface viscoelastic deformation corresponding to different geometry of viscoelastic structures, and the results are compared with our geodetic measurements for determining the best-fit rheological model.",

This terrane is bounded by the Main Boundary Thrust to the north and by the Main Frontal Thrust (MFT) to the south. For a long time, the MFT was long considered a blind system; only recently have surface exposures been identified, tied to large historical earthquakes. In many maps, the MFT is drawn as a single, continuous fault. However, it is actually composed of many fault segments, with overlaps and steps, whose timing and structural linkage are poorly constrained. This complex fault system represents the frontal portion of the large, active megathrust that is accommodating the India-Eurasia collision.\nWe present some of the first seismic reflection profiles ever acquired across these thrusts. These profiles were acquired with a 7 ton Vibroseis source and a 264 channel seismic recording system over three field seasons in 2014 and 2015. As part of our study, we acquired 12 serial 2D profiles totalling ~70 km across a right-step of the fault system, where both fault segments have been identified as having slipped in the1934 Mw8.4 Nepal-Bihar earthquake. Our data image to a depth of 2-2.5 km and constrain the geometries and kinematics of these overlapping faults, with associated folding. Our data show that the faults are listric, that they overlap for over 10 (?) km along strike and produce short wavelength (~1 km) fault-propagation folds and longer wavelength fault-bend folds.\nFault slip in this area has led to the progressive uplift and abandonment of strath terraces. Our new data will allow us to constrain the dips and kinematics of the different fault segments in order to convert uplift rates into slip rates on the fault segments, to more accurately assess the rate of shortening on the MFT in central Nepal.",

Our study focuses on changes to hydrological extremes and threshold responses across the Colorado River basin due to forest fires, infestations, and stress-induced tree mortality using a scenario-based approach to estimate forest cover disturbance. Scenarios include static vegetation reductions and dynamic reductions in forest compositions based on three CMIP5 global climate models and one emission scenario (1950-2099). For headwater systems, large intra-year variability exists, indicating the influence of climate on these snowmelt driven basins. Strong seasonality in flow responses are also noted; in the Piedra River higher runoff occurs during freshet under a no-forest condition, with the greatest changes observed for maximum streamflow. Conversely, during the recessional period, flows are lower in scenarios with reduced forest compositions. Low-flows appear to be affected in some basins but not others; for example small headwater systems demonstrate higher low-flows with increased disturbance. Global Climate Model scenarios indicate a range of responses in these basins, characterized by lower peak streamflow but with higher winter flows. This response is influenced by shifts in water, and energy balances associated with a combined response of changing climate and forest cover compositions. Results also clearly show how changes in extreme events are forced by shifts in major water balance parameters (runoff, evapotranspiration, snow water equivalent, and soil moisture) from headwater basins spanning a range of hydrological regimes and ecological environments across the Colorado.",

            "abstract": "Debris flows are rapid mass movements in which elevated pore pressures are sustained by a viscous fluid matrix with high concentrations of fine sediments. Debris flows may form from coarse-grained wet granular flows as fine sediments are entrained from hillslope and channel material. Here we investigate whether abrasion of the rocks within a granular flow can produce sufficient fine sediments to create debris flows. To test this hypothesis experimentally, we used a set of 4 rotating drums ranging from 0.2 to 4.0 m diameter. Each drum has vanes along the boundary ensure shearing within the flow. Shear rate was varied by changing drum rotational velocity to maintain a constant Froude Number across drums. Initial runs used angular clasts of granodiorite with a tensile strength of 7.6 MPa, with well-sorted coarse particle size distributions linearly scaled with drum radius. The fluid was initially clear water, which rapidly acquired fine-grained wear products. After each 250 m tangential distance, we measured the particle size distributions, and then returned all water and sediment to the drums for subsequent runs. We calculate particle wear rates using statistics of size and mass distributions, and by fitting the Sternberg equation to the rate of mass loss from the size fraction > 2mm.\nAbundant fine sediments were produced in the experiments, but very little change in the median grain size was detected. This appears to be due to clast rounding, as evidenced by a decrease in the number of stable equilibrium resting points. We find that the growth in the fine sediment concentration in the fluid scales with unit drum power. This relationship can be used to estimate fine sediment production rates in the field. We explore this approach at Inyo Creek, a steep catchment in the Sierra Nevada, California. There, a significant debris flow occurred in July 2013, which originated as a coarse-grained wet granular flow. We use surveys to estimate flow depth and velocity where super-elevation occurred, to calculate a unit power of 4.5 KW/m2. From this we predict that 14% of the coarse mass is converted to fine sediment by abrasion per km. At that rate, the increase in fines concentration may have been sufficient to cause a wet granular flow to evolve into a debris flow within the first 1 km of its > 4km travel distance.",

            "abstract": "The leakage of Agulhas Current water into the South Atlantic is now thought to be a major player in global climate change. Its volume is linked to the strength and position of southern westerlies. Past changes in the westerly winds over the southern ocean have been noted on glacial-interglacial timescales, in response to both Northern Hemispheric conditions and changes in Antarctic ice volume. The Pliocene to Pleistocene transition, associated cooling and Northern Hemisphere glaciation may have related to changes in Antarctica and the Southern Ocean, affecting both the position and strength of southern westerly winds. A northward shift in the westerlies, observed in past records of glaciation events, is thought to restrict the flow of warm, salty water from the Indian Ocean into the Atlantic, potentially impacting the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and North Atlantic SSTs. A weakening of the Agulhas Leakage therefore could transmit changes in the southern hemisphere to the northern hemisphere. Much of the Agulhas leakage is carried in small eddies rotating off the main flow south of Cape Horn. High ocean model resolution (< 1/2°) is therefore required to realistically simulate the leakage's response to the overlying wind field. Here we run a series of global high-resolution ocean model (1/6°) experiments using the MITgcm to test the effect of a shift in the southern hemisphere westerlies on the Agulhas Leakage, during a past climate (Pliocene) warmer than today. A prescribed perturbation of the winds near South Africa shows a significant increase in Agulhas eddies into the Atlantic. Following this, we have performed longer simulations (> 25 model years) on the simulated Pliocene Ocean reflecting past shifts in the wind field quantify changes in Agulhas Leakage transport and salinity anomalies into the South Atlantic. We then investigate whether there is any corresponding change in North Atlantic Deep Water formation and the overall response of the AMOC from the Agulhas Leakage changes.",

            "abstract": "Sea-level rise throughout the 21st century will result in increased flood exposure as current flood levels are achieved more frequently and new flood levels result in more widespread inundation. To increase the resiliency of coastal communities and allow populations to respond and recover to these hazards, it is important to develop a place-based understanding of how storm surge exposure, impacts, and community vulnerability will change over time. This work uses a GIS-based methodology to develop and map a quantitative index of physical and social vulnerability for New York City populations within existing and predicted flood zones to assess overall risk at the intersection of exposure and vulnerability. This index may be used to inform decision makers about the heterogeneous landscape of community-level vulnerability in New York City.\nBoth the physical and socio-economic impacts of flooding events are often unevenly distributed, with socially vulnerable groups most likely to experience a disproportionate share of the detrimental effects. When both physical and socio-economic vulnerability are present in combination, the risk to populations is exacerbated. The combination of social vulnerability, critical infrastructure at risk, and exposure to hazard provides a metric to rank neighborhood risk to flood hazards through a quantitative vulnerability index that characterizes site-specific levels of risk to flood hazard. Results show that a range of mitigation and hazard preparation strategies, and a variety of response and recovery assistance measures are required to address the diversity of local-level flood risks. For some locations the greatest threat is the physical exposure to floodwaters while in other areas social vulnerability compromises the ability of the community to recover from even low exposure flood events. In many locations several elements of vulnerability overlap to create a heightened overall risk to flood events. These areas may require more intensive or specialized planning to protect people and infrastructure from flood impacts.",

            "abstract": "Natural variations in water resources are often thought of as reflecting seasonal and interannual forcings in atmospheric water fluxes. Such variations are readily observed in streamflows in response to precipitation and lags due to basin water storage. These forcings also result in time-varying infiltration into the subsurface and variable aquifer recharge. Low-pass filtering in the subsurface, which can retain seasonal and interannual variability in hydrologic inputs but remove high-frequency variability, can modify responses of groundwater systems to precipitation forcings. Because of the filtering, we hypothesize that groundwater relations to seasonal and interannual precipitation forcing may possibly have greater statistical significance than relations between streamflow and precipitation. To quantify the relations, we correlate monthly time series of groundwater and streamflow in the eastern United States (US) to precipitation and climate indices. We focus on interannual differences in seasonal groundwater level highs and lows in wells to evaluate how precipitation affects groundwater extreme conditions in any year. To quantify differences in climatic and hydrogeologic settings, we correlate the spatial and temporal patterns from empirical orthogonal function analysis of the seasonal groundwater anomalies to precipitation and climate indices. Results indicate a north-south gradient in significant relations (95% confidence) between seasonal high anomalies to the El Nino/Southern Oscillation as indicated by the Multivariate ENSO Index (MEI), with stronger relations in the southern and northern parts of the eastern US. Preliminary results indicate that relations between groundwater and MEI are more significant than previously thought. Additional analysis will examine, through statistical analysis and modeling, if the low-pass filtering of high-frequency variability of hydrologic inputs in the subsurface allows for clearer teleconnection between groundwater and climatic modes.",

            "abstract": "Naturally occurring gas hydrates contain signi cant amounts of natural gas which might be produced in the foreseeable future. Thus, it is necessary to understand the pore-space characteristics of hydrate reservoirs, especially the pore-scale distribution of hydrate and its interaction with the sediment. The goal of our research is to examine the distribution of hydrate in the pore space and the influence of hydrate pore-scale distribution on seismic velocities and sonic logs. We conducted laboratory measurements to obtain information about the distribution of hydrate in the pore space of synthetic porous media (glass beads). We used Tetrahydrofuran (THF) as a guest molecule since THF hydrate is a proxy for naturally occuring hydrate. We used micro X-ray computed tomography (MXCT) to image hydrate distribution in the pore space. In addition, we investigated the influence of hydrate saturation and distribution on ultrasonic velocities simultaneously with the MXCT imaging. We installed a torlon vessel and a cooling system in the MXCT scanner which allows us to form hydrate in the MXCT scanner at atmospheric pressure and a temperature of approximately 2°C. Both, MXCT images and ultrasonic velocity measurements, indicate that THF hydrate forms in the pore space while residual brine coats the grain surfaces and fills small pores. Our observations are in accordance with the pore-filling model of the effective medium theory of hydrate-bearing sediments. Based on this knowledge, it may be possible to calibrate seismic and well logging data to calculate the amount of natural gas stored in a hydrate reservoir. This information will help to make decisions regarding the producibility of methane hydrates and to develop safe production schemes.",

            "abstract": "The warm Late Cretaceous is thought to have been characterized by open Arctic Ocean temperatures upwards of 15°C (Jenkyns et al., 2004). The high temperatures and low equator-to-pole temperature gradient have proven difficult to reproduce in paleoclimate models, with the role of the atmospheric hydrologic cycle in heat transport being particularly uncertain. Here, sediments, coprolites and fish teeth of Santonian-Campanian age from two high-latitude mixed terrestrial and marine sections on Devon Island in the Canadian High Arctic (Chin et al., 2008) were analyzed using a suite of organic and inorganic proxies to evaluate the temperature and salinity of Arctic seawater. Surface temperature estimates were derived from TEX86 estimates of near-shore, shallow (~100 meters depth) marine sediments (Witkowski et al., 2011) and MBT-CBT estimates from terrestrial intervals and both suggest mean annual temperatures of ~20°C, consistent with previous estimates considering the more southerly location of Devon Island. The oxygen isotope composition of non-diagenetic phosphate from vertebrate coprolites and bony fish teeth were then measured, giving values ranging from +13‰ to +19‰. Assuming the TEX86 temperatures are valid and using the temperature calibration of Puceat 2010, the δ18O values of coprolites imply Arctic Ocean seawater δ18O values between -4‰ and -10‰, implying very fresh conditions. Lastly, the δD of precipitation will be estimated from the hydrogen isotope composition of higher plant leaf waxes (C-25, C-27, C-29 and C-31 n-alkanes) from both terrestrial and marine intervals. Data are used to model the salinity of seawater and the meteoric relationship between δD and δ18O, thereby helping to evaluate the northern high-latitude meteoric water line of the Late Cretaceous.",

            "abstract": "Microalgae play important roles in the global carbon budget. Phytoplankton, including microalgae, are responsible for around 50% of global primary production, and also hold promise as a viable renewable biofuel source. Research has been underway for decades to realize the full potential of algal biofuels at the commercial scale, however, uni-algal ponds are typically threatened by collapse due to microalgal grazing and parasite invasions. Recently, it has been proposed that functionally diverse microalgal-bacterial communities can achieve high biomass and/or lipid yields, and are more stable (less susceptible to invasion) than a monoculture. Similar positive diversity-productivity relationships have been observed in a wide range of ecosystem studies, but the purposeful maintenance of a diverse microbiome is less common in managed systems. In our work, a trait based dynamic energy budget model was developed to explore emergent microalgal community structure under various environmental (e.g. light, temperature, nutrient availability) conditions. The complex algal community can be reduced into functional groups (guilds). Each guild (algae or bacteria) is characterized by distinct physiological traits (e.g. nutrient requirement, growth rate, substrate affinity, lipid production) constrained by biochemical trade-offs. These trait values are derived from literature and information encoded in genomic data. Metabolism of the algae and the bacterial species (symbiotic or non-symbiotic) are described within a dynamic energy budget framework. The model offers a mechanistic framework to predict the optimal microalgal community assemblage towards high productivity and resistance to invasion under prevailing environmental conditions.",

Poorly understood interactions of marginal currents with glaciers and ice-shelves are reported to have a sea level rise potential of about 50 m. The Moscow University Ice Shelf (MUIS) and Totten Glacier (TG) system alone accounts for one-eighth of East Antarctic Ice Sheet discharge, roughly the same as estimated for total Western Antarctic Ice Sheet drainage. Observational studies of the circulation, stratification, and exchange of oceanic, shelf and melt waters in the adjacent Sabrina Basin began in in the austral summer of 2014, with a unique set of shipboard measurements aboard the RVI Nathaniel B. Palmer.\nAmong them are, for the first time over Antarctic margins, simultaneous underway profiling of ocean currents, temperature and salinity. Optimally averaged and quality controlled data from the Shipboard Acoustic Dopper Current Profiler (SADCP) and Underway Conductivity/Temperature/Depth (uCTD) system are analyzed to map flow patterns from the surface to the bottom. Unprecedented spatial (~1 km) and temporal (~30 min) profiling allowed the completion of multiple synoptic sections that effectively resolved the main characteristics of the slope (ASC) and Antarctic Coastal Current (ACoC). Adjusted geostrophic currents and volume transport across these sections were calculated for density layers spanning surface and thermocline waters with oceanic and shelf origin.\nAfter following the western flank of the Dalton Ice Tongue (DIT) to the south, the ACoC turns westward and continues alonog the MUIS front toward TG. Injection of meltwater to the ACoC at varying levels is revealed along this path. Highly contrasting bottom topography is also observed to differentially steer bottom waters. A smooth sedimentary dome found below the Dalton Polynya appears to drive an interior recirculation; whereas a relaitvely rough and narrow escarpment flank in front of MUIS accelerates westward flow, channels inflow to sub-ice cavities and likely intensifies vertical mixing.",

We compared the results with those of streams and a cold spring. We aimed to assess the hot springs for evidence of addition of mantle mass, specifically water and carbon and (2) determine the processes that control the chemical and isotopic evolution of the hot springs. Understanding the source(s) of heat for the springs and if the chemical and isotopic characteristics show evidence of mantle processes is an important goal of the Project for Rift Initiation, Development and Evolution (PRIDE). The temperature of the hot springs ranged from 35 to 80 ºC. High temperature anomalies are observed between latitudes 10 to 11, 12 to 13 and 15 to 16 degrees south along the rift axis. The δD and δ18O for the cold spring, hot springs and streams had a similar range, were positively correlated and lie on the trend of the local meteoric water line. We suggest negligible contribution of water from a connate or magmatic source and limited oxygen exchange from water-rock interaction or CO2 exchange from deep sedimentary carbonates. The DIC concentrations of the hot springs are higher (5 to 61 mg C/L) than those of streams (2 to 28 mg C/L) indicating addition of carbon to the DIC pool during the circulation of some springs. The range in the δ13CDIC of the hot springs (-17 to -8‰) is broader and lower compared to streams (-12 to -5‰) due to addition of carbon with a δ13CDIC of -15‰ to the spring water during circulation. Our results indicate that (1) the source of water for the hot springs is meteoric, (2) the hot springs have not experienced extensive water-rock interaction due to fast circulation suggesting highly permeable fault zones, (3) the source of carbon in the DIC of the hot springs is mostly CO2(g) from the soil zone and (4) the springs are heated by normal geothermal gradients by deep circulation along the faults.",

In this study we present the formation of micro-diamonds in micro-cracks by C:O:H bearing fluids in a bimineralic eclogite. The studied rock sample is a kyanite- bearing and bimineralic eclocite from the Roberts Victor mine, South Africa. Relicts of the former kyanite bearing eclogite are still present within the bimineralic eclogite. The presence of these metastable relicts suggest very low fH2O during the phase transition from the kyanite- bearing into the bimineralic eclogite. The micro-diamond forming reaction was triggered by fluids during the breakdown of kyanite in the kyanite bearing eclogite. Our results show that the C:O:H ratio in the fluid controls the diamond-forming reaction as the ratio changes due to the movement of planar defect structures in garnet in the bimineralic eclogite. This process leads to the formation of isotopically light carbon molecules and under favorable thermodynamic, stoichiometric and kinetic conditions micro diamonds can be formed. High-spatial-resolution synchrotron based FT-IR and RAMAN spectrometry have been used to map the distribution of C:O:H-bearing volatiles around micro diamonds in planar defect structures in garnet. In micro diamond bearing planar defect structures, a correlation between C:O:H-bearing volatiles can be identified whereas in micro diamond free planar defect structures no correlation of the different C:O:H containing volatiles is visible. The conclusions from our study shows that C:O:H-bearing volatiles, and their distribution pattern around the studied micro cracks provide insight into the formation process of micro diamonds in natural bimineralic eclogites.",

The algorithm used in this study was based on a cirrus detection technique called CO2 slicing method, modified as described below. The weighting functions which represent sensitivity profiles were calculated at each channel in the TIR band of GOSAT. The channels were reconstructed as sets of several spectral channels for each height level based on the peak heights of the weighting functions. Subsequently, the channel combinations were optimized based on simulation studies for several temperature profile patterns for each latitude and temperature at 500 hPa. The observed data in 2010 were analyzed using these optimized channels. Global cloud amounts and their seasonal variations were validated using Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) data. Results show some differences of cloud amounts and heights between GOSAT and CALIPSO, which might be caused by surface temperature biases, the inverse layer, the difference of sensitivity of sensors, and marine stratocumulus clouds. However, the characteristics of horizontal distributions derived using the slicing method were generally agreed with those obtained from CALIPSO and reported in previous researches. In addition, comparison of cloud top height using collocated data showed good agreement and clouds with optical thickness less than 0.1 are detectable using this method.",

The new transfer method has no relationship with lunar phase, therefore, the precision of the results is improved, and error analysis suggests that the uncertainty of the transferred method is about 2.2-2.6%, smaller than the lunar Langley calibrations. At the same time, the calibration time is also saved.\nThe Sun-Sky-Lunar photometer numbered #1202 and located on the roof of Institute of remote sensing and digital earth (RADI) in Beijing was used in this study. The extraterrestrial calibration coefficients were got by using Langley calibration performed at Ali with a height of 5053 m above sea level in Tibet. The new lunar calibration coefficients were obtained with the new method. And then the nocturnal AODs were calculated, which are well consistent with the daytime observations. The differences between two AODs obtained with transferred calibration coefficients and lunar Langley method were also compared in this study.\nIn this study, Lidar observation results was also presented to compare with the lunar observations, the results show that the nocturnal AODs have the same variation tendency and well consistence with the Lidar observations.",

ATLS technology has the potential to be used for snow measurement studies in locations that are unsafe or inaccessible to humans throughout the winter season. Alternative Terrestrial Laser Systems (TLS) have thus far proven to produce low temporal resolution and are high in cost. ATLS, on the other hand, is a unique system that can generate high temporal resolution at a low cost. In order for the progression of ATLS to continue, the data from the system needs to be validated by determining if ATLS scans are a viable method for the measurement of snow depth. To complete the validation, two specific objectives have been identified: 1) the ability of ATLS to measure snow depth and 2) to produce high quality resolution measurements over varying distances of ATLS scans. For this, both ATLS and validation measurements were taken throughout two winter seasons near McCall, Idaho. Preliminary results of the study indicate that the ATLS is capable of fulfilling these two objectives.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - DGK_AGU15.pdf\nThe high sensitivity of mountain glaciers to even small perturbations in climate, combined with a near global distribution, make alpine glaciers an important target for terrestrial paleoclimate reconstructions. The geomorphic remnant of past glaciers can yield important insights into past climate, particularly in regions where other methods of reconstruction are not possible. The quantitative conversion of these changes in geomorphology to a climate signal, however, presents a significant challenge. A particular need exists for a versatile climate reconstruction method applicable to diverse glacierized regions around the globe. Because the glacier equilibrium line altitude (ELA) provides a more explicit comparison of climate than properties such as glacier length or area, ELA methods lend themselves well to such a need, and allow for a more direct investigation of the primary drivers of mountain glaciations during specific events. Here, we present an ELA model for quantifying changes in climate based on changes in glacier extent, while accounting for differences in glacier width, glacier shape, bed topography, ice thickness, and glacier length. The model furthermore provides bounds on the ΔELA using Monte Carlo simulations. These methods are validated using published mass balances and ELA measurements from 4 modern glaciers in the European Alps. We then use this ELA model, combined with a surface mass and energy balance model, to estimate the changes in temperature/precipitation between the Younger Dryas (constrained by 10Be surface exposure ages) and the present day for three glacier systems in the Graubϋnden Alps. Our results indicate an ELA depression in this area of 257 m ±45 m during the Younger Dryas (YD) relative to today. This corresponds to a 1.3 °C ±0.36 °C decrease in temperature or a 156% ±30% increase in precipitation relative to today. These results indicate the likelihood of a predominantly temperature-driven change rather than a strong dependence on precipitation. We apply these same methods to additional areas around the globe to obtain preliminary, self-consistent estimates of temperature/precipitation for multiple regions. These methods and results enhance our understanding of the global and regional patterns in the climate system during the YD.",

            "abstract": "In addition to being critical to the prediction of satellite orbits, total mass density is a fundamental property of the thermosphere. Density measurements from accelerometers on the CHAMP satellite have revealed quasi-steady state distributions of density structures around the globe, density responses to changing solar and geomagnetic activity, and spatial structures of wave-like phenomena along the orbit. However, a basic limitation on the time scale of any observable phenomenon is the ~90-minute orbital period. Thus, single-satellite missions like CHAMP are unable to measure the time derivative of density or the mass flux divergence (MFD) at a single point in the atmosphere. While the two accelerometer-carrying GRACE satellites could theoretically measure the density time derivative, in practice this measurement is hampered by the very low-signal levels in the tenuous atmosphere at the ~500-km GRACE orbits, as well as inter-satellite biases and drifts.\nThe Array of Neutral Density Relative Observations Measuring Divergence in the Atmosphere (ANDROMEDA) is a constellation of CubeSats aimed at improving our understanding of atmospheric dynamics by measuring and interpreting the characteristics of traveling atmospheric disturbances as well as the distribution of MFD in the thermosphere. The ANDROMEDA constellation consists of two to three identical CubeSats spaced approximately 300 km apart and making multi-point measurements of total mass density with an accuracy of <2%. The mass density measurements will be made using a novel torque balance technique enabled by an extremely accurate attitude determination and control system (ADCS) that actively compensates for atmospheric disturbance torques. The benefit of the torque-balance technique is the high level of inter-satellite accuracy. The constellation will be deployed from the ISS and will make observations between 400 km and 250 km altitude as the satellite orbits decay. Distance between the spacecraft will be controlled by modifying the relative ballistic coefficients through small changes in the angle of attack.\nIn this poster, we present the ANDROMEDA science objectives and requirement flow-down. We then describe the constellation design and present a series of measurement simulations showing the feasibility of this approach.",

Raised coral terraces with recognizable notches and meter-scale terrace risers are often exposed and well preserved along promontories and nearby smaller islands. Varying elevations of the lower terrace were measured in Burgos and Badoc, Ilocos Norte (2 to 3 m amsl), San Esteban, Ilocos Sur (1.4 m amsl), and Bacnotan, La Union (1.2 m amsl). Initial 14C- and 230Th-dating of fossil corals from the lower terraces in Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, and La Union reveals ages that range from ~7.5 ky to ~3.5 ky. Young coral ages (~1 ky) were meanwhile obtained from the upper terraces of Badoc Island, Ilocos Norte at 4 to 5 m amsl. Based on preliminary coral ages, we infer that the older (~7.5 ky to ~6 ky) fossil corals are related to the mid-Holocene marine transgression while younger attached corals (~1 kyr) could represent the age of the terrace surface prior to emergence. Alternatively, a large wave event may have also transported the young fossil corals on the mid-Holocene transgressive reef platform. Emergence of the coral terraces may be attributed to regional sea level changes and possibly accumulated uplift from aseismic and seismic processes along the Manila Trench and nearby faults. Varied deformation patterns of the raised coral terraces further provide constraints on local tectonic controls and upper plate structures of the subduction zone.",

            "abstract": "Climatological records show annual precipitation maximum values on the northeast side of Mt. Tamalpais in the San Francisco Bay Area, which is typically the leeward side during winter precipitation events. The town of Kentfield, CA, about five kilometers to the northeast of the mountain, has a significantly higher annual-average rainfall than adjacent locations, particularly compared with stations to its north and south. One hypothesis regarding this phenomenon is that the topography if Mt. Tamalpais creates convergence on the leeward side, thereby enhancing precipitation. If prevailing southwesterly winds during rainfall events are interrupted by the mountain and then flow around either side, converging on leeward side, then enhanced cloud formation and precipitation would replace the divergent flow characteristic to leeward slopes. A second hypothesis is that Mt. Tamalpais is narrow relative to the advective scale of orographically triggered precipitation. If the mountain is relatively narrow, precipitation from clouds generated orographically on the upwind side might not develop and fall until air within the clouds has reached the leeward side, where Kentfield lies. With a network of surface weather stations, we analyze precipitation accumulations to quantify the Kentfield rainfall maximum over a series of rainfall events during 2015. For these rainfall events, we evaluate how well a 1.1-km resolution WRF-ARW model reproduces the precipitation observations. To the extent that the model agrees with observations, we investigate mechanisms underlying the rainfall maximum by analyzing patterns of low-level wind convergence downwind of Mt. Tamalpais and patterns of vertical velocity and cloud and rain-water mixing ratios in vertical cross sections across Mt. Tamalpais, parallel to the wind flow for each rainfall event. Cross-sectional mixing ratio analyses provide evidence of precipitation development and advection and test the second of the aforementioned hypotheses. Wind convergence and vertical velocity produced by the model downwind of the mountain help test the plausibility of the first hypothesis.",

Proxy records for the late Paleozoic suggest a wide range of potential CO2 values, but the range of values that allows for the growth of large ice sheets is much smaller. A prescribed slab ocean with diffusive heat transport (using modern heat fluxes) was used for those experiments, but lacks the ability to accurately capture the ocean dynamics of the Paleozoic. Here, within the NCAR Community Earth System Model framework, we use a fully dynamic ocean model to explore Permian ice sheet growth under more realistic conditions. Fully coupled CESM simulations for two CO2 levels (280 & 560 ppm) are run until the ocean equilibrates (~1500-2000 years). Climatologies from those simulations are then used to drive a three-dimensional dynamic ice sheet model in an asynchronous coupling, in which the ice sheet model is run until the ice sheets equilibrate. The ice sheet geometry and height are then used to update the coupled ocean-atmosphere model, which is run for ~20 years, until the climate system re-equilibrates. Preliminary results show that ice sheet growth at the higher CO2 value is small in comparison with ice sheet growth in the lower CO2 environment, which is consistent with previous late Paleozoic modeling studies. The latitudinal temperature gradient is also steeper at 280 ppm CO2 than at 560 ppm, though the dynamic ocean buffers some of these changes relative to what they would be for a slab ocean.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU 2015 Poster.pdf\nWith the advent of nanosatellite constellations, we define here a new method to derive neutral densities of the lower thermosphere from multiple similar platforms travelling through same regions of space. Because of similar orbits, the satellites are expected to encounter similar mean neutral densities and hence experience similar drag if their drag coefficients are equivalent. Utilizing free molecular flow theory to bound the minimum possible drag coefficient possible and order statistics to give a statistical picture of the distribution, we are able to estimate the neutral density alongside its associated error bounds. Data sources for this methodology can either be from already established Two Line Elements (TLEs) or from raw data sources, in which an additional filtering step needs to be performed to estimate relevant parameters. The effects of error in the filtering step of the methodology are also discussed and can be removed if the error distribution is Gaussian in nature. This method does not depend on prior models of the atmosphere, but instead is based upon physics models of simple shapes in free molecular flow. With a constellation of 10 satellites, we can achieve a standard deviation of roughly 4% on the estimated mean neutral density. As additional satellites are included in the estimation scheme, the result converges towards the lower limit of the achievable drag coefficient, and accuracy becomes limited by the quality of the ranging measurements and the probability of the accommodation coefficient. Data is provided courtesy of Planet Labs and comparisons are made to existing atmospheric models such as NRLMSISE-00 and JB2006.",

            "abstract": "Among techniques for determining Fe3+/FeT of natural glasses, XANES affords high precision, spatial resolution, and sample throughput and consequently has become widely used. However, because XANES determinations depend on standardization against materials of known Fe3+/FeT, they are only as accurate as the methods used for calibration. In many cases, calibration is performed with Mossbauer spectroscopy. Accurate determination of Fe3+/FeT by Mossbauer spectroscopy is the subject of a long-standing controversy, in part owing to debate as to the influence of recoilless fraction on the area ratios of room temperature (RT) Mossbauer absorption doublets associated with paramagnetic Fe2+ and Fe3+ in silicate glasses. Recoilless fraction effects for glasses are comparatively subtle, and so characterization efforts have not always produced statistically resolvable effects, in part because glasses produce broadened line shapes that degrade analytical precision, but both theoretical considerations of bond strengths and abundant evidence from minerals demonstrate that RT Mossbauer analyses will overestimate Fe3+/FeTof Fe-bearing silicates.\nCottrell & Kelley (2011) used the basalt XANES calibration of Cottrell et al. (2009) to show that the average Fe3+/FeT of MORB glasses is close to 0.16, but this calibration depends chiefly on RT Mossbauer spectra of a suite of standard glasses. New cryogenic (10 K) Mossbauer spectra of these same glasses suggests a correction factor, C, of 1.1, where [Fe3+/FeT(corrected)]=[Fe3+/FeT (RT)]/([Fe3+/FeT (RT)]+C(1-[Fe3+/FeT(RT)]). If this correction is applied to the XANES data, the median of MORB glasses is ~0.15. Because recoilless fractions are not exactly unity even at 10 K, this correction represents a minimum; however the 10 K data are in good agreement with Fe3+/FeT predicted for the Mossbauer standards by the wet-chemistry-based model of Kress and Carmichael (1991) based on the synthesis fO2. The precision of XANES for the determination of Fe3+/FeT is ±0.005; the absolute accuracy is tied to the accuracy of the technique used to calibrate. For Mossbauer, accuracy is likely closer to ±0.02",

            "abstract": "We present a method to infer long-term fault slip rate distributions using topography by coupling a three-dimensional elastic boundary element model with a geomorphic incision rule. In particular, we used a 10-m-resolution digital elevation model (DEM) to calculate channel steepness (ksn) throughout the actively deforming southern Santa Cruz Mountains in Central California. We then used these values with a power-law incision rule and the Poly3D code to estimate slip rates over seismogenic, kilometer-scale thrust faults accommodating differential uplift of the relief throughout geologic time. Implicit in such an analysis is the assumption that the topographic surface remains unchanged over time as rock is uplifted by slip on the underlying structures. The fault geometries within the area are defined based on surface mapping, as well as active and passive geophysical imaging. Fault elements are assumed to be traction-free in shear (i.e., frictionless), while opening along them is prohibited. The free parameters in the inversion include the components of the remote strain-rate tensor (εij) and the bedrock resistance to channel incision (K), which is allowed to vary according to the mapped distribution of geologic units exposed at the surface. The nonlinear components of the geomorphic model required the use of a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, which simulated the posterior density of the components of the remote strain-rate tensor and values of K for the different mapped geologic units. Interestingly, posterior probability distributions of εij and K fall well within the broad range of reported values, suggesting that the joint use of elastic boundary element and geomorphic models may have utility in estimating long-term fault slip-rate distributions. Given an adequate DEM, geologic mapping, and fault models, the proposed paleogeodetic method could be applied to other crustal faults with geological and morphological expressions of long-term uplift.",

More than 100 scientists engaged in field data collection, original research, and ecosystem modeling to link climate, physical oceanography, plankton, fishes, seabirds, marine mammals, humans, traditional knowledge and economic outcomes. Over the six-year period of the program hundreds of multidisciplinary datasets coming from a variety of instrumentation and measurement platforms within thirty-one categories of research were processed and curated by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Earth Observing Laboratory (EOL).\nFor the investigator proposing a field project, the researcher performing synthesis, or the modeler seeking data for verification, the easy discovery and access to the most relevant data is of prime importance. The heterogeneous products of oceanographic field programs such as the Bering Sea Project challenge the ability of researchers to identify which data sets, people, or tools might be relevant to their research, and to understand how certain data, instruments, or methods were used to produce particular results.\nEOL, as a partner in the NSF funded EarthCollab project, is using linked open data to permit the direct interlinking of information and data across platforms and projects. We are leveraging an existing open-source semantic web application, VIVO, to address connectivity gaps across distributed networks of researchers and resources and identify relevant content, independent of location. We will present our approach in connecting ontologies and integrating them within the VIVO system, using the Bering Sea Project datasets as a case study, and will provide insight into how the geosciences can leverage linked data to produce more coherent methods of information and data discovery across large multi-disciplinary projects.",

Aerosol loading is much higher in summer, due largely to high levels of biogenic secondary organic aerosol and sulfates. Aerosol loading is lowest in winter. Aerosol optical properties relevant to radiative forcing have been measured continuously at the Appalachian Atmospheric Interdisciplinary Research facility (AppalAIR) since the summer of 2009. AppalAIR is the only site in the eastern US to house co-located NOAA ESRL and NASA AeroNET instrumentation and is located in the mountains of Boone, NC. Lower tropospheric sub-micron (PM1) light scattering and absorption coefficients measured over seven summers and six winters are presented here, in addition to PM1 organic and sulfate aerosol mass concentrations measured during summers 2012-2013 as well as winter 2013. The objective is to determine the influence of aerosol sources and meteorology along the air mass back-trajectories on aerosol loading and composition. PM1 aerosol mass was dominated by organic aerosol and sulfate during the periods measured. Aerosol light scattering and organic aerosol concentrations were positively correlated during summer with temperature and solar flux along the parcel back-trajectory and negatively-correlated with rainfall along the back-trajectory. Wet deposition was a major factor in the difference between the upper and lower scattering coefficient quartiles for both summer and winter. Summer PM1 light scattering coefficient declined by approximately 30-40% since 2009, with smaller decreases during winter months. Long-term studies of aerosol optical properties from the regionally-representative AppalAIR site are necessary to determine the relationships between changing SE U.S. air quality and aerosol effects on regional climate and weather.",

The results were evaluated by comparing with radar observations, showing that NBEs occurred mainly in strong echo area. NBEs located with our method are distributed between 6-18 km with a clear dividing line at about 14 km: positive NBEs (84%) occurred mainly in 6-14 km while the negative (16%) concentrated in 14-18 km, consistent with previous work based on the detection of multi-station network. The comparison of results at different stages showed that the trend of NBEs occurrence was consistent with the thunderstorm motion, and the location data averaged over 30-minute time window evidently proved the tracking capability of NBE detection for severe thunderstorms. Therefore, the NBE detection based on the single-station magnetic measurement could be used as a convenient approach for monitoring the development of convective thunderstorms, especially when they are far beyond the detection range of meteorological radars. New measurements in summer of 2015 will be examined by comparing the location result with that derived from a long-baseline network of LF magnetic sensors using the time-of-arrival technique.",

While the pace at which current distributions will shift is hard to quantify, predictions of where climatically suitable areas will be in the future can allow us to map 1) areas currently occupied by a species or vegetation type unlikely to persist through the end of this century (vulnerable stands), 2) areas likely to do better in the future and serve as nuclei for population expansion (expanding stands), and 3) areas likely to act as climate refugia (persisting stands).\nWe quantified the vulnerability of 27 individual plant species and 27 vegetation types in the San Francisco Bay Area as well as the conservation importance, vulnerability, and resilience of selected management sites for climate change resilient conservation. To this end, we developed California-wide models of species and vegetation distributions using climate data from the 2014 California Basin Characterization Model at a 270 m resolution, projected to 18 different end-of century climate change scenarios. Combining these distribution models with high resolution maps of current vegetation, we were able to map projected vulnerable, expanding, and persisting stands within the Bay Area.\nWe show that vegetation and species are expected to shift considerably within the study region over the next decades; although we also identify refugia potentially able to offset some of the negative impacts of climate change. We discuss the implications for managers that wish to incorporate climate change in conservation decisions, in particular related to choosing species for restoration, identifying areas to collect seeds for restoration, and preparing for expected major vegetation changes. Our evaluation of individual management sites highlights the need for stronger coordination of efforts across sites to prioritize monitoring and protection of species whose ranges are contracting elsewhere.\nFinally, we present and discuss novel ways in visualizing and communicating condensed predictions and their uncertainty to land managers and challenges inherent.

Regolith materials create a blanket on top of the bedrock with a thickness that depends on its spatial distribution along the watershed (i.e. proximity to the river nickpoint in the southermost part of the watershed). Furthermore bedrock along the watershed is characterized by a system of heterogeneous fractures that apparently drive the formation of corestones and associated spheroidal fracturing and rindlets. In this study we used a combination of geophysical methods to better understand changes in regolith thickness and how the spatial distribution and density of fractures varies with topography and proximity to the nickpoint. Indirect and non-invasive geophysical methods included ground penetrating radar, GPR, terrain conductivity, and electrical resistivity imaging, ERI, and were constrained with direct methods (i.e. boreholes) already available from previous studies. Geophysical methods were consistent in imaging lateral changes in regolith distribution and fracture density along the watershed and showed the potential of multi-method approaches to better understand critical zone processes at multiple scales of measurement and high spatial resolution.",

In this study, the historical runoff and sediment export from 16 major rivers in Taiwan are investigated and separated into an early stage (1970-1989) and a recent stage (1990-2010) to illustrate the changes of both runoff and sediment export. The mean daily sediment export from Taiwan Island in the recent stage significantly increased by >80% with subtle increase in daily runoff, indicating more sediment being delivered to the ocean per unit of runoff in the recent stage. In the early stage, 1 km3 runoff could transport sediment of 1.10 Mt. However, the 2x larger runoff now transported 3.38 Mt sediment which is ~3x larger than in the early stage. The medians of the runoff depth and sediment yield extremes (99.0-99.9 percentiles) among the 16 rivers increased by 6.5%-37% and 62%-94%, respectively, reflecting the disproportionately magnified response of sediment export to the increased runoff. Taiwan is facing increasing event rainfall intensity which has resulted in chain reactions on magnified runoff and sediment export responses. As the globe is warming, rainfall extremes, which are proved to be temperature-dependent, very likely intensify runoff and trigger more sediment associated hazards. This seems the Taiwan’s destiny facing high rainfall intensity and having erodible lithology. We are afraid that so far engineering still could not resist the power of nature.",

            "abstract": "The Nueces Bay (NB) system has been found to be ecologically unsound due to the loss/alteration of habitat and flow regimes required by indicator species and compromised nutrient cycling and sediment loading. The management practices of freshwater inflow regimes to NB concentrates on surface water flows and does not account for groundwater inflows, though submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) has been identified as a source of freshwater and limiting nutrients that could significantly impact bay salinities and nutrient loading. To encompass the range of spatio-temporal variabilities occurring between groundwater (GW) and surface-water (SW), multiple methods, including resistivity imaging, geochemical tracers, and radioisotopes, are applied in conjunction to identify SGD sources. Preliminary continuous resistivity profile surveys identified multiple possible GW upwelling paths from which thirteen stations were chosen in NB and two stations in Nueces River (NR). A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of initial geochemical, nutrient and radioisotope data, shows that 76% of the variation in the data is explained by three factors: seasonality, freshwater inflows, and reducing environment. Significant seasonal variation is seen in average SW salinity (37psu in September 2014 to 4psu in June 2015), Ra-224 (359dpm/L in September to 636dpm/L in December), Ra-226 (268dpm/L in September to 570 dpm/L in December), ammonium (1.3μM in September to 5.5μM in April), and chlorophyll-α (3.99μg/L in December to 12.3 μg/L in April). Additionally, short-lived radioisotopes Rn-222 and Ra-224 are consistently elevated near the NR mouth, the inflow from Gum Hollow Creek, and a single station in the middle of the Bay indicating more localized, active SGD sources. However, only the stations in NR and at the NR mouth show consistently strong correlations to chlorophyll-α, phosphate, and silicate, with the river station closest to NB having the highest concentrations of nitrogen nutrients and the river station furthest from NB having the lowest. Thus there appears to be a SGD source in NR near the mouth that is contributing more nitrogen nutrients to NB than the river would alone. This study demonstrates the necessity for a multi-method approach to assessing SGD coastal embayments in the presence of SW inflows.",

Recent improvements in sampling infrastructure have allowed us to collect large volumes of crustal fluids (~104 L) from Circulation Obviation Retrofit Kits (CORKs) placed in boreholes located on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge (JdFR). We detected viruses within these fluids by TEM and epifluorescence microscopy in samples collected from 2010 to 2014. Viral abundance, determined by epifluorescence counts, indicated that concentrations of viruses in subsurface basement fluids (~105  ml-1) are lower than the overlying seawater, but are higher in abundance than microbial cells in the same samples. Analysis of TEM images revealed distinct viral morphologies (rod and spindle-shaped) that resemble the morphologies of viral families infecting archaea. There are very few, if any, direct observations of these viral morphologies in marine samples, although they have been observed in enrichment cultures and their signature genes detected in metagenomic studies from hydrothermal vents and marine sediments. Analysis of metagenomes from the JdFR crustal fluids revealed sequences with homology to archaeal viruses from the rudiviridae, bicaudaviridae and fuselloviridae. Prokaryotic communities in fluids percolating through the basaltic basement rock of the JdFR flank are distinct from those inhabiting the overlying sediments and seawater. Similarly, our data support the idea that the viral assemblage in these fluids is distinct from viral assemblages in other marine and terrestrial aquatic environments. Our data also suggest that viruses contribute to the mortality of deep subsurface prokaryotes through cell lysis, and viruses may alter the genetic potential of their hosts through the processes of lysogenic conversion and horizontal gene transfer.",

            "abstract": "In their stratigraphic records, silicic caldera volcanoes display wide ranges of eruptive styles and volumes. However, relationships between frequency and magnitude are often complex, and the forecasting of future activity is inherently problematic. Taupo volcano, New Zealand, provides a unique opportunity to investigate eruptive histories from a hyperactive, large silicic magmatic system with eruptive volumes that span 3-4 orders of magnitude, and show no clear relationships with the repose period. Taupo hosted the world’s most recent supereruption at 25.4 ka, which discharged 530 km3 of magma in the episodic 10-phase Oruanui event. Only 5 kyr later, Taupo revived, with 3 dacitic eruptions from 21.5-17 ka and 25 rhyolite eruptions from 12-1.7 ka. Here we use trends in whole rock, glass and mineral chemistry to show how the magma system reestablished following the Oruanui event, and to consider what processes influence the state of the modern volcano. The post-Oruanui dacites reflect the first products of the rebuilding silicic magma system, as most of the Oruanui mush was reconfigured or significantly modified in composition following thermal fluxing accompanying post-caldera collapse readjustment. Compositional variations within the younger rhyolites at <12 ka reflect fine-scale temporal changes in mineral phase stability, closely linked to the development, stabilization and maturation of a new silicic mush system. For the most recent eruptions, the system underwent destabilization, resulting in increased volumes of melt extraction from the silicic mush. Orthopyroxene Fe-Mg diffusion timescales indicate that the onset of rapid heating and priming of the silicic mush occurred <100 years prior to the <2.15 ka eruptions, with subsequent melt accumulation occurring in only decades. The largest post-Oruanui eruption at 232 AD culminated from elevated mafic magma supply to the silicic mush pile, rapid melt accumulation and high differential tectonic stress build up, leading to one of the largest and most violent Holocene eruptions globally. The latest eruptions of Taupo highlight the multiple controls on the timing of eruptions, and demonstrate how the magmatic system can rapidly change behavior to generate large eruptible melt bodies on timescales of direct relevance to humans and monitoring initiatives.",

Basically, we model great earthquake generation as frictional instability on the subjecting plate boundary. So, spatio-temporal variation in slip velocity on the plate interface should be monitored and forecasted. Although, we can obtain continuous dense surface deformation data on land and partly at the sea bottom, the data obtained are not fully utilized for monitoring and forecasting. It is necessary to develop a physics-based data analysis system including (1) a structural model with the 3D geometry of the plate interface and the material property such as elasticity and viscosity, (2) calculation code for crustal deformation and seismic wave propagation using (1), (3) inverse analysis or data assimilation code both for structure and fault slip using (1)&(2). To accomplish this, it is at least necessary to develop highly reliable large-scale simulation code to calculate crustal deformation and seismic wave propagation for 3D heterogeneous structure. Actually, Ichimura et al. (2014, SC14) has developed unstructured FE non-linear seismic wave simulation code, which achieved physics-based urban earthquake simulation enhanced by 10.7 BlnDOF x 30 K time-step. Ichimura et al. (2013, GJI) has developed high fidelity FEM simulation code with mesh generator to calculate crustal deformation in and around Japan with complicated surface topography and subducting plate geometry for 1km mesh. Further, for inverse analyses, Errol et al. (2012, BSSA) has developed waveform inversion code for modeling 3D crustal structure, and Agata et al. (2015, this meeting) has improved the high fidelity FEM code to apply an adjoint method for estimating fault slip and asthenosphere viscosity. Hence, we have large-scale simulation and analysis tools for monitoring. Furthermore, we are developing the methods for forecasting the slip velocity variation on the plate interface. Basic concept is given in Hori et al. (2014, Oceanography) introducing ensemble based sequential data assimilation procedure. Although the prototype described there is for elastic half space model, we will apply it for 3D heterogeneous structure with the high fidelity FE model.",

Though relative roughness was considered in quantifying flow through a single rough fracture (SRF) previously, additional factors such as the distribution of rough elements and bending degree of streamlines are rarely considered before. Semi-empirical friction factor (f) and discharge per unit width (q) equations are first deduced based on the consideration of relative roughness, roughness elements distribution and streamline reattachment length in this study. A horizontal SRF model is set up and a series of experiments and simulations are performed. Main conclusions are drawn: recirculation of streamlines occurred in the rough element and its intensity increases with the entering angle of the streamlines into the element and Reynolds number (Re); streamlines are discontinuously distributed when asperity height is large, leading to departure from Darcy’s law (non-linear flow); the non-linearity of flow increases with the asperity height and Re; the relative roughness for not affecting water flow through a SRF should be much less than 0.033, a benchmark value commonly used previously for neglecting the roughness effect; the revised f and q equations under laminar flow through a SRF are shown to be better than previously proposed equations.",

            "abstract": "The Amazonian floodplains and wetlands cover one fifth of the basin and are highly productive promoting diverse biological communities and sustaining human populations with fisheries. Seasonal inundation of the floodplains fluctuates in response to drought or extreme rainfall as observed in the recent droughts of 2005 and 2010 where river levels dropped to among the lowest recorded. We model and evaluate the historical (1940–2010) and projected future (2010-2100) impacts of droughts and floods on the floodplain hydrology and inundation dynamics in the central Amazon using the Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS) and the Terrestrial Hydrology Model and Biogeochemistry (THMB). Simulated discharge correlates well with observed discharges for tributaries originating in Brazil but underestimates basins draining regions in the non-Brazilian Amazon (Solimões, Japuŕa, Madeira, and Negro) by greater than 30%. A volume bias-correction from the simulated and observed runoff was used to correct the input precipitation across the major tributaries of the Amazon basin that drain the Andes. Simulated hydrological parameters (discharge, inundated area and river height) using corrected precipitation has a strong correlation with field measured discharge at gauging stations, surface water extent data (Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites (GIEMS) and NASA Earth System Data Records (ESDRs) for inundation), and satellite radar altimetry (TOPEX/POSEIDON altimeter data for 1992–1998 and ENVISAT data for 2002–2010). We also used an ensemble of model outputs participating in the IPCC AR5 to drive two sets of simulations with and without carbon dioxide fertilization for the 2006–2100 period, and evaluated the potential scale and variability of future changes in discharge and inundation dynamics due to the influences of climate change and vegetation response to carbon dioxide fertilization. Preliminary modeled results for future scenarios using Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 indicate decreases in projected discharge and extent of inundated area on the mainstem Amazon by the late 21st century owing to influences of future climate change only.",

An integrated inventory of anthropogenic emissions of twelve HMs (Hg, As, Se, Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni, Sb, Mn, Co, Cu and Zn) in the three biggest metropolitan areas, including Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region and Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, are developed for 1980–2012 by combining with detailed activity data and inter-annual dynamic emission factors which are determined by S-shaped curves on account of technology progress, economic development, and emission control. The results indicate total emissions of twelve HMs in the three metropolitan regions have increased from 5448.8 tons in 1980 to 19054.9 tons in 2012, with an annual average growth rate of about 4.0%. Due to significant difference in industrial structures and energy consumption compositions, remarkable distinctions can be observed with respect to source contributions of total HM emissions from above three metropolitan areas. Specifically, the ferrous metal smelting sector, coal combustion by industrial boilers and coal combustion by power plants are found to be the primary source of total HM emissions in the BTH region (about 34.2%), YRD region (about 28.2%) and PRD region (about 24.3%), respectively. Furthermore, we allocate the annual emissions of these heavy metals in 2012 at a high spatial resolution of 9 km × 9 km grid with ArcGIS methodology and surrogate indexes, such as regional population and gross domestic product (GDP). The peak of HM emissions are mainly distributed over the grid cells of Beijing, Tianjin, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, Handan and Baoding in the BTH region; Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Ningbo in the YRD region; Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Dongguan, Foshan in the PYD region, respectively. Additionally, monthly emission proﬁles are established in order to further identify the temporal emission characteristics of HMs.\nKey words: heavy metals (HMs), emission inventory, time-varying dynamic emission factor, temporal and spatial characteristics, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region, Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region, Pearl River Delta (PRD) region, China",

            "abstract": "The Sumatran Fault Zone (SFZ) accommodates a significant component of the strike-slip motion of oblique convergence along the Sumatra subduction zone. Previous studies have suggested that the slip rates of the SFZ increase from south to north. However, recent work shows that the slip rates may not vary along the SFZ [Bradley et al., 2015]. New data are needed to help confirm these results, and to assess slip-rate variability and fault segmentation in more detail. This information is vital for seismic hazard assessment for the region. We have therefore installed and operated the SuMo (Sumatran Fault Monitoring) network, a dense GPS campaign network focused around the SFZ.\nFrom 2013-2015 we selected and installed 32 GPS monuments over the southern part of the SFZ. The network comprises of three transects. The first transect is around the location of the great 1900 earthquake, at the Musi segment. Two transects cover the Manna segment, which saw its last great earthquake in 1893, and the Kumering segment, which saw two great earthquakes in 1933 (M 7.5) and 1994 (M 7.0).\nWe have now conducted three GPS campaign surveys for these stations (3-4 days of measurement for each occupation site), and established 5 semi-permanent cGPS stations in the area. The processed data show that the campaigns sites are still too premature to be used for estimating slip rates, but from the preliminary results for the semi-permanent stations we may see our first signal of deformation. More data from future survey campaigns will help us to estimated revised slip rates.\nIn addition to the science goals for our project, we are this year starting a project called \"SuMo Goes to School,\" which will aim to disseminate information on our science to the schools that house the SuMo GPS stations. The SuMo project also achieves capacity building by training students from Bengkulu University in geodesy and campaign GPS survey techniques.",

It could also be a potential tool to mitigate the anthropogenic effect on climate change. However, the current level of scientific understanding of surface albedo on global warming potential is medium to low. In order to investigate the anthropogenic impact of surface albedo on climate, different scenarios of urban surface albedo over continental US using the WRF model are simulated.\nIn this study, the change in surface albedo applies to rooftops, pavements, and walls of urban land cover grid cells. The two groups of simulations (low and high albedo) were compared to determine the impacts of elevating urban surface albedo and to account for the uncertainty in the errors or noise introduced by the slightly different initial conditions. The results are represented as the differences in surface temperature and the top of the atmosphere radiation between the two scenarios when urban surface albedos are elevated from 0.15 to 0.40. The ensemble mean of all potential outcomes as a whole, instead of individual initial conditions, shows that the impact of elevating surface albedo has a cooling effect that is robust at both local and regional scales during the summer season.\nMore refined analyses of urban areas will provide insights on surface albedo impacts in specific regions. Future analyses may address changes in CO2 equivalence.",

            "abstract": "Rates of permafrost thaw within the discontinuous permafrost zone are expected to accelerate with permafrost fragmentation. However quantification of drivers of permafrost change remain elusive due to the non-linearity of feedbacks in space and time. Given the extent of permafrost in Canada, there is significant interest in the mechanisms associated with land cover change as climate change and disturbance intensifies.\nWe quantify the variability of rates of thaw associated with structural characteristics of the land surface within a discontinuous permafrost watershed in the NWT, Canada. Results are compared to an isolated permafrost watershed in Alberta, which may exemplify the northern discontinuous landscape in ~350 years. Three airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) datasets have been collected in 2008, 2011 and 2015, coincident with digital photogrammetry (2008), thermal infrared (2011) and bathymetry (2015) within both watersheds. Rates of change of land elevation associated with permafrost thaw within plateaus and peatlands are quantified using non-linear spatial regression, and compared with topographic and vegetation derivatives.\nResults indicate that increasing fragmentation of discontinuous permafrost plateaus results in exponential thaw. Rates of thaw become linear with decreasing complexity. Accelerating thaw is related to substantial Picea mariana mortality (up to 45%), increased gap fraction within 1-2 m of plateau edges, and shrub succession (average growth ~0.2 m yr—1) at the 0-2m boundary within the 7-year period. Thaw rate in parts is also complicated by understory succession within the area of local convexity between the plateau and slope edge and linear thaw pathways. Greatest rates of thaw and vegetation mortality (~30-50%) are found on plateaus with populous tremuloides. In the central boreal watershed, vegetation succession at peatland margins is associated with increased drying and changes to runoff trends over the last 40 years. Increased channelization of runoff along plateau and fen flow pathways combined with growth of short vascular vegetation may increase drying and promote rapid succession. A simple model indicates that the discontinuous permafrost zone could be similar to that of the central boreal forest in less than 300 years.",

The lack of a unique signature therefore results in an inability to distinguish the contribution of a particular source to a sediment mixture if all the FAs from each source exhibit identical or very similar isotopic values. Several factors may contribute to the variability (or lack thereof) in the isotopic values of individual FAs examine from differing sources.\nSamples from several sources in the South Tobacco Creek Watershed (STCW) in Manitoba, Canada, were collected during three sampling periods in each of 2012 and 2013 for a total of six sampling periods. The sampling design incorporated factors which were expected to affect the CSSI signal of the FAs within the same sampling period (e.g. spatial variability), throughout the growing season (temporal variability) and between seasons and crop rotations.\nPrevious CSSI tracing attempts have used total organic carbon (TOC) and a sample’s corresponding soil bulk carbon isotope value (13Cbulk) as part of the calculation for soil apportioning i.e. determining the contribution from unique sources to a particular sediment mixture sample. Samples from the STCW were analyzed for TOC and 13Cbulk values for the sampling periods mentioned above to determine spatial and temporal variability. Some of the CSSI data for FAs used as potential tracers is also presented. The suitability of using TOC and 13Cbulk values in contrast to CSSI values and complementary quantitative data for soil apportioning and tracing is discussed.",

It is found that continental-scale coldness by cold air outbreaks (CAOs) tend to preferentially occur within a week after stronger mass circulation events defined as the peak time when the net mass transport across 60°N in the upper warm or the lower cold air branch exceeds ~88×109 kg s-1. During weaker mass circulation events when the net mass transport across 60°N is below ~71.6×109 kg s-1, most areas of the mid-latitudes are generally in mild condition except the northern part of Western Europe. Composite pattern of circulation anomalies during stronger mass circulation events greatly resemble that of the winter-mean, with the two main routes of anomalous cold air outbreaks being along the climatological routes of polar cold air, namely, via East Asia and North America. The Siberian High shifts westward during stronger mass circulation events, opening up a third route of cold air outbreaks through Eastern Europe. The relationship of CAOs with Arctic Oscillation (AO) is less robust because temporal changes of AO are resulted from a small imbalance between the poleward and equatorward branches of the mass circulation. Only when the poleward branch leads the equatorward branch (44% of all cases), CAOs tend to take place within a week after a negative phase of AO. The daily ERA-Interim reanalysis data set for the 32 winters in 1979–2011 were used in this study.",

Students from groups historically underrepresented in the geosciences may face additional challenges in that they often have a less robust support structure to help them navigate the university environment and may be less aware of professional opportunities in the geosciences.\nUNAVCO, manager of NSF’s geodetic facility, hosted four students during summer 2015 internship experience aimed to help them develop skills that will prepare them for research internships and skills that will help them advance professionally. Students spent eight weeks working with UNAVCO technical staff learning how to use equipment, prepare instrumentation for field campaigns, among other technical skills. Interns also participated in a suite of professional development activities including communications workshops, skills seminars, career circles, geology-focused field trips, and informal interactions with research interns and graduate student interns at UNAVCO.

            "abstract": "Bed forms are one of the few geomorphic phenomena whose field and laboratory geometric scales have significant overlap. This is similarly true for scales of sediment transport. Whether in the lab or field, at low transport stages and high Rouse numbers where suspension is minimal, sand fluxes scale nonlinearly with transport stage. At high transport stages, and low Rouse numbers where suspension is substantial, sand transport scales with rouse number. In intermediate cases deformation of bed forms is a direct result of the exchange of sediment between the classically suspended and bed load volumes. These parameters are straightforwardly measured in the laboratory. However, practical difficulties and cost ineffectiveness often exclude bed-sediment measurements from studies and monitoring efforts aimed at estimating sediment loads in rivers. An alternative to direct sampling is through the measurement of evolution of bed topography constrained by sediment-mass conservation. Historically, the topographic-evolution approach has been limited to systems with negligible transport of sand in suspension. As was shown decades ago, pure bed load transport is responsible for the mean migration of trains of bed forms when no sediment is exchanged between individual bed forms. In contrast, the component of bed-material load that moves in suspension is responsible for changes in the size, shape, and spacing of evolving bed forms; collectively this is called deformation. The difference between bed-load flux and bed-material-load flux equals the flux of suspended bed material. We give a partial demonstration of this using available field and laboratory data and comparing them across geometric and sediment transport scales.",

            "abstract": "Evergreen conifers in boreal and temperate regions undergo strong seasonal changes in photoperiod and temperatures, which characterizes their photosynthetic activity with high activity in the growing season and downregulation during the winter season. Monitoring the timing of the transitions in evergreens is difficult since it’s a largely invisible process, unlike deciduous trees that have a visible budding and senescence sequence. Spectral reflectance and the photochemical reflectance index (PRI), often used as a proxy for photosynthetic light-use efficiency, provides a promising tool to track the transition of evergreens between inactive and active photosynthetic states. To better understand the relationship between PRI and photosynthetic activity and to contrast this relationship between plant functional types, the spring recovery of an evergreen forest and mixed deciduous forest was monitored using spectral reflectance, chlorophyll fluorescence and gas exchange. All metrics indicate photosynthetic recovery during the spring season. These findings indicate that PRI can be used to observe the spring recovery of photosynthesis in evergreen conifers but may not be best suited for deciduous trees. These findings have implications for remote sensing, which provides a promising long-term monitoring system of whole ecosystems, which is important since their roles in the carbon cycle may shift in response to climate change.",

            "abstract": "The Elwha River recently underwent the largest dam removal project in history with the deconstruction of the Elwha and Glines Canyon Dams. According to recent USGS and USBR estimates, the project released 21±3 million m3 of sediment, approximately 420,000 m3 of which was gravel and cobble. Much of the coarse sediment released from the reservoir deposits has been stored in the channel bed and floodplain. Our project focuses on the gravel and cobble sediment budget for the middle and lower Elwha Rivers for pre- and post-removal periods. Prior to removal, the reduction in sediment load caused by the dams likely led to coarsening and incision despite regular lateral channel change, with the floodplain representing an important source of bed material. Air photo analysis (1939–2015) and creation of a map of relative floodplain elevation (topographic surface minus elevation of nearby vegetation line) helped test the hypothesis that post-dam (but pre-removal) floodplain deposits were built to a lower elevation than pre-dam surfaces. Preliminary results indicate that pre-removal but post-dam banks are, on average, lower than older banks, suggesting that floodplain built during the period when dams were in place did not completely replace sediment eroded from nearby banks. Bank erosion thus almost certainly represented a net source of sediment for the channel, and differences in the size distributions of eroded and deposited material could have had important geomorphic implications. Facies mapping and surface and sub-surface sampling on recent bars and along cut banks allow us to compare the coarseness of pre- and post-dam bulk deposits. We note that the coarsest fraction in eroding banks may be correlated to riffle location. In addition, bulk sampling in recently exposed reservoir deposits allows us to estimate the gravel and cobble fractions of the pulse of sediment released to the downstream river after the final portion of Glines Canyon Dam was removed in August 2014.",

But about half of these TV weathercasters have experienced obstacles to reporting climate change – citing lack of time to research and produce material, in addition to lack of access to appropriate visuals/graphics and access to trusted scientific information.\nClimate Matters is an NSF funded program that partners with broadcast meteorologists to deliver scientifically sound climate change information to the public that is local and relevant. A team of climate scientists, meteorologists, data analysts, journalists, and multimedia artists analyze and prepare content on a weekly basis so that it may be readily included in a broadcast weather segment, online or during community outreach. The program started as a pilot project with just one meteorologist in 2010 before Climate Central launched a full-time, nationwide program in 2012. Since then, Climate Matters has grown to include over 250 meteorologists strong and in more than 100 markets across the country, including Spanish language TV stations.",

It will yield an unprecedented three-dimensional view of Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets, ice shelves and sea ice. These flights will provide a yearly, multi-instrument look at the behavior of the rapidly changing features of the Greenland and Antarctic ice. Data collected during IceBridge will help scientists bridge the gap in polar observations between NASA's Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) -- in orbit since 2003 -- and ICESat-2, planned for 2017. ICESat stopped collecting science data in 2009, making IceBridge critical for ensuring a continuous series of observations. IceBridge will use airborne instruments to map Arctic and Antarctic areas once a year at a minimum, with new campaigns being developed during the Arctic melt season. IceBridge flights are conducted in the spring and summer for the Arctic and in the fall over Antarctica. Other smaller airborne surveys around the world are also part of the IceBridge campaign.\nIceBridge actively engages the public and educators through a variety of outlets ranging from communications strategies through social media outlets, to larger organized efforts such as PolarTREC. In field activities include blog posts, photo updates, in flight chat sessions, and more intensive live events to include google hangouts, where field team members can interact with the public during a scheduled broadcast. The IceBridge team provides scientists and other team members with the training and support to become communicators in their own right.\nThere is an exciting new initiative where IceBridge will be collaborating with Undergraduate and Graduate students to integrate the next generation of scientists and communicators into the Science Teams. This will be explored through partnerships with institutions that are interested in mentoring through project based initiatives.",

            "abstract": "To properly model soil thermal performance in unsaturated porous media, for applications such as SBTES systems, knowledge of both soil hydraulic and thermal properties and how they change in space and time is needed. Knowledge obtained from pore scale to macroscopic scale studies can help us to better understand these systems and contribute to the state of knowledge which can then be translated to engineering applications in the field (i.e. implementation of SBTES systems at the field scale). One important thermal property that varies with soil water content, effective thermal conductivity, is oftentimes included in numerical models through the use of empirical relationships and simplified mathematical formulations developed based on experimental data obtained at either small laboratory or field scales. These models assume that there is local thermodynamic equilibrium between the air and water phases for a representative elementary volume. However, this assumption may not always be valid at the pore scale, thus questioning the validity of current modeling approaches. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the validity of the local thermodynamic equilibrium assumption as related to the effective thermal conductivity at pore scale.\nA numerical model based on the coupled Cahn–Hilliard and heat transfer equation was developed to solve for liquid flow and heat transfer through variably saturated porous media. In this model, the evolution of phases and the interfaces between phases are related to a functional form of the total free energy of the system. A unique solution for the system is obtained by solving the Navier-Stokes equation through free energy minimization. Preliminary results demonstrate that there is a correlation between soil temperature / degree of saturation and equivalent thermal conductivity / heat flux. Results also confirm the correlation between pressure differential magnitude and equilibrium time for multiphase flow to reach steady state conditions. Based on these results, the equivalent time for steady-state heat transfer is much larger than the equivalent time for steady-state multiphase flow for a given pressure differential. Moreover, the wetting phase flow and consequently heat transfer appear to be sensitive to contact angle and porosity of the domain.",

            "abstract": "Advances in the field of environmental magnetism have led to exciting new applications for this field. Magnetic minerals are ubiquitous in the environment and tend to have an affinity for heavy metals. It has been demonstrated that magnetic properties are often significantly related to concentrations of heavy metals and/or pollution loading index (PLI). As a result, magnetic techniques have been used as proxy for determining hot spots of several types of pollution produced from a diversity of anthropogenic sources.\nMagnetic measurements are non-destructive and relatively inexpensive compared to geochemical analyses. The utility of environmental magnetic methods varies widely depending on biological, chemical and physical processes that create and transform soils and sediments. Applications in the direction of mapping heavy metals have been studied and shown to be quite useful in countries such as China and India but to date, little research has been done in the US. As such, there is need to expand the scope of research to a wider range of soil types and land uses, especially within the US.\nThis study investigates the application of environmental magnetic techniques to mapping of heavy metal concentrations and PLI at the Formosa Mine Superfund Site, an abandoned mine about 25 miles southwest of Roseburg, OR. Using hotspot analysis, correlation and cluster analyses, interactions between metals and magnetic parameters are examined in relation to environmental factors such as proximity to seeps and adits. Preliminary results suggest significant correlation of magnetic susceptibility with certain heavy metals, signifying that magnetic methods may be useful in mapping heavy metal hotspots at this site.",

In Beijing, the capital city of China, there has been serious land subsidence due to overexploitation of ground water during the recent decades. Five major subsidence tunnels have formed. Across the Beijing plain area, the ground is sinking at the rate of 30-100mm/year. Uneven subsidence leads to ground fissure and building destruction, and has caused great economical and property loss. To better characterize and understand regional land subsidence evolution, it is critical to monitor the time-series dynamics of subsidence, and capture the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of the subsidence evolution. Interferometric SAR technique, as it provides high spatial resolution and wide range of observation, have been successfully used to monitor regional ground deformation.\nThe objective of this study is to derive time-series regional land subsidence dynamics in Beijing, and based on which, analyze and assess the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of the evolution using cluster analysis. First, ENVISAT ASAR (2003-2009 years, 28 scenes, track number: 218) datasets during 2003-2010 covering Beijing plain area were utilized to obtain time-series subsidence rate using Persistent Scatter InSAR (PS-InSAR) technique provided in SARProz software. Second, time-series subsidence characteristics of the PS points were analyzed and the PS points were clustered based on Self-Organization feature Maps (SOM) algorithm considering environmental factors such as groundwater level and lithologic characters.\nThis study demonstrates that based on InSAR measurements and SOMs algorithm, the spatial-temporal heterogeneity of land subsidence evolution can be captured. Each cluster shows unique spatial-temporal evolution pattern. The results of this study will facilitate further land subsidence modeling and prediction at regional spatial scale.",

The denial of climate change and its costs (ranging from denial of basic principles to using high discount rates to reduce the current value of future losses, and supported by fossil fuel companies and their many political allies) has delayed an effective response to a problem that gets worse and more costly the longer action is delayed. The central role of fossil fuels in our economies and of fossil fuel interests in our politics leads many to worry about the costs of change while denying or ignoring the costs of business as usual. Rational decision makers would not be so selective, either about the evidence or about the costs and benefits that hang in the balance.\nEffective communication can help call attention to the evidence and to the costs and benefits that have been neglected.  Our society has no formal rules requiring scientists to become activists, even when the results of their work provide sound reasons for taking action. But ideals of citizenship and humanitarianism provide strong justification for those who choose to engage with the issues. A reticent scientist might feel that her job is done once the results of her research are published. The rest is arguably the responsibility of others—of politicians, journalists and citizens in general, to learn the relevant facts (now available as part of the published literature) and to bring those facts to bear in decisions ranging from the personal to the political and economic. But I urge scientists who feel this way to reconsider—not because their view of where the real responsibility lies is wrong, but because they are in a position to make a difference. In situations like these, where powerful interests are threatened by inconvenient facts, scientists can be very effective communicators: they have high credibility with the public (as deniers' repeated claims to scientific authority ironically confirms), and those who do take on the public role of communicating science can help to counter the propaganda and distortions of science deniers.",

These dust concentrations in the Caribbean often exceed United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards for particulate matter of 2.5 microns or less (PM 2.5) which could have serious implications for human health in the region. Air pollution has become a major issue in the Caribbean because of urban development, increased vehicle emissions and growing industrialisation. However, the majority of territories in the Caribbean do not have routine air quality monitoring programmes and several do not have or enforce air quality standards for PM2.5 and PM10. As a result, the Caribbean Institute for Meteorology and Hydrology (CIMH) has taken the initiative to provide dust and air quality forecasts for the Eastern Caribbean using the advanced WRF-Chem modeling system.\nThe applications of the WRF-Chem modelling system at CIMH that are currently being focused on are the coupled weather prediction/dispersion model to simulate the release and transport of constituents, especially Saharan dust transport and concentration; and as a coupled weather/dispersion/air quality model with full interaction of chemical species with prediction of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10). This will include future applications in the prediction of ozone (O3) and ultraviolet (UV) radiation as well as examining dust radiative forcing and effects on atmospheric precipitation and dynamics. The simulations are currently initialised at 00Z for a seven day forecast and run at 36 km resolution with a planned second domain (at 12 km) for air quality forecasts. Preliminary results from this study will be presented and compared to other dust forecast models currently used in other regions. This work also complements in situ measurements at Ragged Point, Barbados (oldest dust record since 1965), Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guiana and Puerto Rico. The goal of this study is to develop a health warning system for the developing countries of the Eastern Caribbean in order to mitigate against adverse health effects by persons most vulnerable.",

Along with our partners from non-governmental, corporate, academic and government sectors and tens of thousands of farming families, we have worked actively in five states in India and two provinces in Vietnam for the last five years to understand how sustainable and climate smart farming practices can be monitored at small-holder farms. Here, any approach to monitor farming must begin by accounting for the tremendous management variability from farm to farm and also the current inability to ground-truth remote sensing data due to lack of relaible basic parameters (e.g., yields, N use, farm boundaries) which are necessary for calibrating empirical/biogeochemical models. While we continue to learn from new research, we have found that it is crucial to follow some steps if sustainable farming programs are to succeed at small-holder farms\nDemographic data collection and GPS plot demarcation to establish farm size and ownership\nBaseline nutrient, water & energy use and crop yield determination via surveys and self-reporting which are verifiable through farmer networks given the importance of peer to peer learning in the dissemination of new techniques in such landscapes\n“Sustainable” practice determination in consultation with local universities/NGO experts\nMeasurements on representative plots for 3-4 years to help calibrate biogeochemical models and/or empirical equations and establish which practices are truly “sustainable” (e.g., GHG emission reduction varies from 0-7 tCO2e/acre for different sustainable practices).\nPropagation of sustainable practices across the landscape via local NGOs/governments after analyzing the replicability of identified farming practices in the light of local financial, cultural or socio-political barriers.\n We will present results from representative plots (including soil and weather parameters, GHG emissions, yields, inputs, economic and environmental savings), farmer surveys and diary data; and discuss our key conclusions based on our approach and the analysis of the collected data which was enabled by use of a commercially available comprehensive agricultural data collection software.",

Because of the small size of these reservoirs, many of them are locally managed and provide an opportunity to investigate various management strategies on in-lake and downstream water quality. We studied three small, urban reservoir-watershed systems in the SFB subjected to differing water quality impairments to determine which management strategies might be most effective for improving water quality.\nThe three study reservoir-watershed systems were monitored biweekly for water quality at the reservoir inlets and outlets and in the lakes through surface to bottom depth profiles. Measurements included pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, temperature, nutrients, and metal concentrations. In addition, sediment cores were collected and analyzed for metal and nutrient concentrations, with chronologies assigned based on Pb-210 and Cs-137 data.\nOne watershed-reservoir system is managed with the reservoir cyclically empty (during winter months) and full (during summer months), whereas the other two watershed-reservoir systems are managed with the reservoir always full, albeit to varying levels. Results indicate the ideal management strategy depends upon the primary pollutant of interest and may not be the same in all urban reservoir-watershed systems. However, overall water quality may generally be improved with continuously full reservoirs with occasional, controlled drawdown. Continuing experiments are investigating the role of microbes in pollutant cycling in these reservoirs it their relation to reservoir full versus reservoir cyclically empty management strategies.",

            "abstract": "Extensive recurring slope lineae (RSL) activity has been detected in Valles Marineris on Mars and coincides with regions where water ice fogs appear [1]. The origin of the water driving RSL flow is not well understood, but observational evidence suggests atmospheric processes play a crucial role [2]. Provided the atmospheric vapor concentration is high enough, water ice fogs can form overnight if the surface temperature cools below the condensation temperature. Correlations between dust storms and flow rates suggest that atmospheric dust opacity, and its influence on air temperature, also has a significant effect on RSL activity.\nWe investigate planetary boundary layer processes that govern the hydrological cycle and dust cycle on Mars using a mesoscale atmospheric model to simulate the distribution of water and dust with respect to regional atmospheric circulations. Our simulations in Valles Marineris show a curious temperature structure, where the inside of the canyon appears warmer relative to the plateaus immediately outside. For a well-mixed atmosphere, this temperature structure indicates that when the atmosphere inside the canyon is saturated and fog is present within Valles Marineris, fog and low-lying clouds should also be present on the cooler surrounding plateaus as well. However, images taken with the Mars Express High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) show instances where water ice fog appeared exclusively inside the canyon. These results have important implications for the origin and concentration of water vapor in Valles Marineris, with possible connections to RSL. The potential temperatures from our simulations show a high level of stability inside the canyon produced dynamically by sinking air. However, afternoon updrafts along the canyon walls indicate that over time, water vapor within the chasm would escape along the sides of the canyon. Again, this suggests a local source or mechanism to concentrate water vapor is needed to explain the fog phenomenon appearing within the confines of the canyon in Valles Marineris.\n[1] Möhlmann et al.

Dielectric contrasts between englacial materials, including ice, water, and impurities, allow the detection of internal stratigraphy and some characterization of englacial properties. Here we describe the design and the 2014-2015 deployments of an autonomous stationary ice-penetrating radar system that was tested on a large outlet glacier of the Icefield Ranges of southwest Yukon, Canada. The radar system was deployed within a kilometer of an ice-marginal lake that is dammed by the Kaskawulsh Glacier and drains annually in a subglacial jökulhlaup. It was programmed to perform a series of soundings every few hours and was left unattended over the course of 6 weeks in 2014 and 7 weeks in 2015, while the lake level was monitored with a pressure transducer and time-lapse imagery. The 2014 dataset is characterized by a marked decrease in englacial reflector strength and coherence during the drainage of the ice-dammed lake. We interpret these data as a significant change in englacial saturation associated with the flood. The 2015 dataset post-dates the flood and provides an opportunity to examine more subtle changes in englacial and subglacial properties. Radar mapping in the vicinity of the deployment locations provides context for the time-dependent measurements, also showing significant differences before and after lake drainage.",

            "abstract": "Taiwan is known as one of the best field areas to study the interactions between tectonics, climate and surface processes. One of the main feedback components is the tendency of topography to increase orographically localized precipitation, but it is unclear how climate may have changed over time as Taiwan topography developed. We present results from two regional general circulation models (RegCM4, REMO) to evaluate dynamical and physical atmospheric changes associated with variations in the height of the Taiwanese Central Range. A series of experiments are conducted with topography systematically varying between 0 and 100% of the modern. To best reproduce the Taiwanese topography, our experiments are performed with a horizontal resolution of 10-20km.\nOur current simulations focus on the understanding of the temporal and spatial evolution of climate in response to surface uplift. Our first objective is to assess the ability of the regional models to simulate modern climate over Taiwan. An initial comparison between simulated and observed data indicates that the limited-domain models perform very well in capturing the spatial precipitation pattern over Taiwan. Simulated high precipitation occurs along the Central Range with maximum annual precipitation in the northeast. Decreasing precipitation rates towards to west and southwest can be observed in model and observational data. Models with spatial resolutions of 50km or more are not capable to reproduce the observed pattern. Our second objective is to investigate the effect of Pliocene growth of the Central Range on regional climate over Taiwan. Preliminary model results indicate that precipitation over Taiwan strongly correlates with topography. Reducing the topography in our model domain results in a significant decrease in precipitation across the entire island. Our goal is to evaluate the climate sensitivity to a range of mountain topographies and quantify threshold elevations needed to induce the modern precipitation magnitudes and pattern over Taiwan. Thus, we provide specific predictions of elevation, precipitation and other climate parameters that can be directly compared with paleoclimate and paleoaltimetry proxies from Taiwan.",

Many domains in the Earth Sciences have recently expressed the need for better discovery, access, and sharing of scientific samples and collections (EarthCube End-User Domain workshops, 2012 and 2013, http://earthcube.org/info/about/end-user-workshops), as has the US government (OSTP Memo, March 2014). The Internet of Samples in the Earth Sciences (iSamples) is an initiative funded as a Research Coordination Network (RCN) within the EarthCube program to address this need. iSamples aims to advance the use of innovative cyberinfrastructure to connect physical samples and sample collections across the Earth Sciences with digital data infrastructures to revolutionize their utility for science. iSamples strives to build, grow, and foster a new community of practice, in which domain scientists, curators of sample repositories and collections, computer and information scientists, software developers and technology innovators engage in and collaborate on defining, articulating, and addressing the needs and challenges of physical samples as a critical component of digital data infrastructure.\nA primary goal of iSamples is to deliver a community-endorsed set of best practices and standards for the registration, description, identification, and citation of physical specimens and define an actionable plan for implementation. iSamples conducted a broad community survey about sample sharing and has created 5 different working groups to address the different challenges of developing the internet of samples – from metadata schemas and unique identifiers to an architecture of a shared cyberinfrastructure for collections, to digitization of existing collections, to education, and ultimately to establishing the physical infrastructure that will ensure preservation and access of the physical samples. Creating awareness of the need to include physical samples in discussions of reproducible science is another priority of the iSamples RCN.",

The temperature index reconstructions show that the late 20th century was the warmest period in Asia over the past millennium. The temperature field reconstructions illustrate that temperatures in central, eastern, and southern China during the 11th and 13th centuries, and in western Asia during the 12th century, were significantly higher than those in other regions, and comparable to levels in the 20th century. Except for the most recent warming, all identified warm events showed distinct regional expressions and none were uniform over the entire reconstruction area. The main finding of the study is that spatial temperature patterns have, on centennial timescales, varied greatly over the last millennium. Moreover, seven climate model simulations, from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), over the same region of Asia, are all consistent with the temperature index reconstruction at the 99 % confidence level. Only spatial temperature patterns extracted as the first empirical orthogonal function (EOF) from the GISS-E2-R and MPI-ESM-P model simulations are significant and consistent with the temperature field reconstruction over the past millennium in Asia at the 90 % confidence level. This indicates that both the reconstruction and the simulations depict the temporal climate variability well over the past millennium. However, the spatial simulation or reconstruction capability of climate variability over the past millennium could be still limited. For reconstruction, some grid points do not pass validation tests and reveal the need for more proxies with high temporal resolution, accurate dating, and sensitive temperature signals, especially in central Asia and before AD 1400.",

We have constructed a landform evolution model that combines sediment transport with channel avulsion to study the evolution of a fan-forming channel network over timescales of decades to hundreds of thousands of years. We aim to address two related questions: (1) what were the characteristics of water discharge (flow magnitude and duration); and (2) what are the associated implications for the responsible climatic environment (e.g. amount and frequency of precipitation sourcing the fans).\nThe model uses a cellular network with a grid spacing set equal to the channel width. Two end-members of sediment are transported through the channel network: gravel bedload and fine grained material that is deposited overbank as a function of distance and elevation difference from an active channel. Overbank deposition creates channel levees, which must be overtopped for the channel to undergo an avulsion. By recording the relative amounts of bedload and overbank deposition, the 3-D stratigraphy is recorded as the fan is constructed.\nUsing measures such as channel width, relative proportions of channel versus overbank deposited sediment, and frequency of channel branching, output is statistically compared with digital elevation models that we been produced from high-resolution CTX and HiRISE stereo pairs. Our modeling suggests that the fans formed from many flow events over many thousands of years, in agreement with estimations based on geomorphological observations by [2]. We are continuing to refine the model to test for varying patterns of precipitation, duricrusts, and limits on sediment supply in the source basin catchments.\n[1] Grant, J.A., Wilson, S.A., 2011.

            "abstract": "The Walker Lane accommodates ~20% of dextral strain between the Pacific and North American Plates on discontinuous sets of predominately northwest-striking right- and easterly striking left-lateral faults. Located west of dextral faults of the central Walker Lane and east of the Sierra Nevada frontal fault system is a region of normal faults and asymmetric basins where geodetic studies define ~5 mm/yr of northwest-directed dextral strain. As this region is devoid of major strike-slip fault systems, how strain is accommodated is poorly understood. To elucidate the long-term tectonic development of this region, we are compiling paleomagnetic data from late Oligocene ash-flow tuffs to determine magnitudes of vertical-axis rotation. This data set will be compared with ongoing and complementary studies of subsurface basin geometry and recent fault-slip motions to ultimately understand the tectonic development of this enigmatic part of the Walker Lane.\nPaleomagnetic directions were collected from structural-blocks where multiple ash-flow tuffs crop out in stratigraphic succession, and at least one sampled unit has a previously established reference direction. This approach will allow for determination of the magnitude of vertical-axis rotation at each locality and provide an opportunity to infer paleomagnetic reference directions for other ash-flow tuffs. Preliminary paleomagnetic data have identified statistically-significant magnitudes of vertical-axis rotation (~20-50° clockwise) west of central Walker Lane dextral faults. Magnetostratigraphic correlations to the geomagnetic time scale have refined ages for several ash-flow tuffs, and span ~5 Ma of the late Oligocene (chrons: 6Cn.3n-10r). The results of this research will not only elucidate the manner in which dextral shear is accommodated in this portion of the Walker Lane, but also provide an extensive data set for establishing Oligocene ash-flow tuff paleomagnetic reference directions and regional correlations.",

            "abstract": "Adaptation to risks from climate change and sea-level rise is particularly important in Australia, where 70% of the population live in major coastal cities and 85% within 50km of the coast. Adaptation activity focuses at local government level and, in the absence of strong leadership from central government, the extent to which local councils have taken action to adapt is highly variable across the nation. Also, although a number of councils have proceeded as far as identifying their exposure to risk and considering adaptation options, this fails to translate into action. A principal reason for this is concern over the response from coastal residents to actions which may affect property values, and fear of litigation. A project is underway to support councils to understand their risks, evaluate adaptation options and proceed to action. This support will consist of a three-pronged framework: provision of information, a tool to support decision-making, and a community forum. Delivery involves research to understand the barriers to adaptation and how these may be overcome, optimal methods for delivery of information, and the information needs of organizations, action-takers and communities. The presentation will focus on the results of consultation undertaken to understand users’ information needs around content and delivery, and how understanding of these needs has translated into design of the framework. A strongly preference was expressed to learn from peers, and a challenge for the framework is to understand how to inject adaptation knowledge which is up-to-date and accurate into peer-to-peer conversations. The community forum is one mechanism to achieve this. The basic structure and delivery mechanisms of the framework are shown in the attached.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - SokolovAGU2015Corrected.pdf\nWe present and demonstrate a new tool, EEGGL (Eruptive Event Generator using Gibson-Low configuration) for simulating CMEs (Coronal Mass Ejections).\nCMEs are among the most significant space weather events, producing the radiation hazards (via the diffuse shock acceleration of the Solar Energetic Particles – SEPs), the interplanetary shock waves as well as the geomagnetic activity due to the drastic changes of the interplanetary magnetic field within the “magnetic clouds” (\"flux ropes”). Some of this effects may be efficiently simulated using the “cone model”, which is employed in the real-time simulations of the ongoing CMEs at the NASA-Goddard Space Flight Center. The cone model provides a capability to predict the location, time, width and shape of the hydrodynamic perturbation in the upper solar corona (at ~0.1 AU), which can be used to drive the heliospheric simulation (with the ENLIL code, for example). At the same time the magnetic field orientation in this perturbation is uncertain within the cone model, which limits the capability of the geomagnetic activity forecast. The new EEGGL tool http://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/analysis/EEGGL/recently developed at the Goddard Space Flight Center in collaboration with the University of Michigan provides a new capability for both evaluating the magnetic field configuration resulting from the CME and tracing the CME through the solar corona. In this way not only the capability to simulate the magnetic field evolution at 1 AU may be achieved, but also the more extensive comparison with the CME observations in the solar corona may be achieved.\nBased on the magnetogram and evaluation of the CME initial location and speed, the user may choose the active region from which the CME originates and then the EEGGL tools provides the parameters of the Gibson-Low magnetic configuration to parameterize the CME. The recommended parameters may be used then to drive the simulation of CME propagation from the low solar corona to 1 AU using the global code for simulating the solar corona and inner heliosphere. The Community Coordinated Modeling Center (CCMC) provides the capability for CME runs-on-request, to the heliophysics community.",

            "abstract": "Tropical forest soils store more carbon (C) than any other terrestrial ecosystem and exchange vast amounts of CO2, water, and energy with the atmosphere. Much of this C is leached and stored within deeper soil layers, but we know exceedingly little about the fate of this C or the microbial communities that drive deep soil biogeochemistry. From the data that do exist, most organic matter (OM) in tropical soils appears associated with mineral particles, suggesting deep soils may provide greater C stabilization due to organo-metal co-precipitation and mineral-surface interactions. However, few studies have evaluated sub-surface soils in tropical ecosystems, the turnover times of deep soil C, and sensitivity of this C to global environmental change.\nTo address this critical research need, we quantified C pools, microbial communities and soil radiocarbon turnover times in bulk soils and soil fractions [free light (unprotected), dense (mineral-associated)] from 0-140 cm in replicate soil pits in the Luquillo Experimental Forest, Puerto Rico. Unsurprisingly, we found soil C, nitrogen, and root and microbial biomass all declined exponentially with depth; total C stocks dropped from 5.5 % at the surface to <0.5% at 140cm depth. Soil OM 14C and mean turnover times were variable across replicate horizons, ranging from 3-1500 years at the surface (0-20 cm), to 5000-40,000 years at 140 cm depth. Soil C in the mineral associated fraction was much older than the free light fraction C, which reflected modern 14C at all depths.\nIn comparison to temperate deciduous forests, these 14C values reflect far older soil C, and OM decomposition that highly favors free light C pools, even at depth. While previous work suggests these low C tropical subsoils contain small but metabolically active microbial communities at depths of ~100cm, these organisms appear highly OM limited, and preferentially degrade recent inputs.\nIn the coming half century, tropical forests are predicted to see a 2 – 5 ° C temperature increase and substantial differences in rainfall amount and timing. The data described here represent baseline data for a site now undergoing a 4°C warming experiment; upcoming research will examine soil C storage and mean residence times during and post-warming to improve numerical models of ecosystem warming effects in tropical forests.",

The Michoacan block is bounded by the N-NE segment of the Rio Balsas in the east, and the Colima graben in the west, the Chapala-Oaxaca fault to the north, and the Middle America Trench to the south.\nNorthern boundary is formed with the Chapala-Oaxaca fault zone (Harrison y Johnson, 1985). The Cotija half-graben is the end-tip of this fault zone. A combined radiometric and paleomagnetic analyses in the Cotija half-graben were carried out (Rosas-Elguera, et al, 2003). Radiometric dates between 31.60 and 8.39 Ma confirm both the southern extension of the Sierra Madre Occidental and the early mafic Tans-Mexican Volcanic Belt succession at the northern part of the Michoacan block. Paleomagnetic data indicate a counterclockwise rotation of ~ 24° about a vertical axis for the Michoacan block.\nThe Michoacan-Guanajuato Volcanic Field forms an area of extensive monogenetic volcanism. This volcanic field contains more than 1000 eruptive centers distributed over an area of 40,000 Km2. The Chapala-Oaxaca fault zone separates the northern MGVF and the southern MGVF.\nHasenaka and Carmichael (1987) recognized three different petrologic associations in the MGVF: calc-alkaline rocks typical arc characteristic, K2O-rich alkaline rocks with relatively high MgO contents and TiO2-rich alkaline rocks with relatively low MgO contents.\nWe present the aeromagnetic results (after Consejo de Recursos Minerales, 1999) which suggest a clear relationship between the geologic features and the magnetic response.",

Aerosol scattering and absorption were measured aboard the NASA P-3B aircraft during the Deriving Information on Surface conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality (DISCOVER-AQ) using a TSI Nephelometer and a Radiance Research Particle Soot Absorption Photometer (PSAP), respectively. To isolate the effect of aerosols on photolysis rates, cloud-free case studies were identified using aircraft videos for the four DISCOVER-AQ deployments: Baltimore, MD-Washington, D.C. in July 2011, the California Central Valley in January/February 2013, Houston, TX in September 2013, and Denver, CO in July 2014. For these case studies, absorption measurements at 470 and 532 nm were extrapolated to the Nephelometer wavelengths (450 and 550nm) using the 470-532nm absorption Angstrom exponent (AAE470-532) to calculate aerosol extinction and SSAs at these wavelengths. Photolysis rates were modeled using the Tropospheric Ultraviolet model version 5.2 (TUV 5.2) for three scenarios: 1) an aerosol-free case, 2) using a spectrally-flat SSA at 550nm and 3) using a spectrally-dependent SSA derived from scattering and absorption measurements. Modeled photolysis rates were compared to those measured aboard the P-3B during DISCOVER-AQ. The relationship between airborne measurements of water soluble organic carbon (WSOC) made by a Particle-Into-Liquid-Sampler (PILS), AAE470-532 and model/measurement discrepancies were explored to assess the influence of aerosol composition on photolysis rates. Additional comparisons between photolysis rates modeled with vertically-resolved aerosol optical properties and those modeled using column-average values were performed to assess the influence of aerosol vertical distribution on photolysis rates.",

This algorithm is (1) magnitudes faster than conventional methods, (2) accurate to less than 0.1% error, and (3) modular. The modularity of this methodology means that researchers can modify their geology/terrain or gravity data, and only the modified component needs to be re-run.

To better understand the role of strike-slip tectonism in shaping Ganymede’s complex icy surface, we perform a detailed mapping of key examples of strike-slip morphologies (i.e., en echelon structures, strike-slip duplexes, laterally offset pre-existing features, and possible strained craters) from Galileo and Voyager images. We focus on complex structures associated with grooved terrain (e.g. Nun Sulcus, Dardanus Sulcus, Tiamat Sulcus, and Arbela Sulcus) and terrains transitional from dark to light terrain (e.g. the boundary between Nippur Sulcus and Marius Regio, including Byblus Sulcus and Philus Sulcus). Detailed structural interpretations suggest strong evidence of strike-slip faulting in some regions (i.e., Nun and Dardanus Sulcus); however, further investigation of additional strike-slip structures is required of less convincing regions (i.e., Byblus Sulcus). Where applicable, these results are synthesized into a global database representing an inferred sense of shear for many of Ganymede’s fractures. Moreover, when combined with existing observations of extensional features, these results help to narrow down the range of possible principal stress directions that could have acted at the regional or global scale to produce grooved terrain on Ganymede.",

            "abstract": "Communicating research results to a non-specialist audience can be challenging. Strategies that work well in lab group meetings, such as using acronyms and jargon, may fall flat with 7th graders or Congressional staffers. Empowering real-world audiences with our stories helps raise awareness and inform decision-making, whether it’s related to family food purchases or national policy. Ideally, we scientists, engineers and researchers directly connect with our audiences, responding spontaneously and actively, distilling our messages into conversational morsels that resonate with them. One tool that I have found useful is deeply rooted in the “tao” of improvisational theater.\nWhy improv? Improv is dancing as if no one is watching, baking from scratch, and playing jazz flute. Improv is Iron Chef, MacGyver with a license to thrill, or the game-winning play. Research is inspired improvisation. And improv can teach us a lot about how to play, how to feel comfortable and present even while flailing, and how to truly listen. Effective science communicators listen. In fact, therein lies the power of “yes …”, a building block of improvisational theater. “Yes …” is both collaborative (“yes, and …”) and innovative (“yes, because …”), and investment in an attitude of saying “yes …” demonstrates an intent to listen.\nImprov is not any one specific thing so much as a process by which we do things. Skills that strengthen communication, such as spontaneity, authenticity and connectivity, are honed through philosophies inherent in improv. This presentation highlights improv-based activities that enhance science communication with purpose, vividness, and emotion.",

NASA’s high-altitude airborne laser altimeter, LVIS (the Land Vegetation, and Ice Sensor) has produced high-accuracy surface maps over a wide variety of science targets for the last 2 decades. Recently NASA has funded the transition of LVIS into a full-time NASA airborne Facility instrument to increase the amount and quality of the data and to decrease the end-user costs, to expand the utilization and application of this unique sensor capability. Based heavily on the existing LVIS sensor design, the Facility LVIS instrument includes numerous improvements for reliability, resolution, real-time performance monitoring and science products, decreased operational costs, and improved data turnaround time and consistency. The development of this Facility instrument is proceeding well and it is scheduled to begin operations testing in mid-2016. A comprehensive description of the LVIS Facility capability will be presented along with several mission scenarios and science applications examples. The sensor improvements included increased spatial resolution (footprints as small as 5 m), increased range precision (sub-cm single shot range precision), expanded dynamic range, improved detector sensitivity, operational autonomy, real-time flight line tracking, and overall increased reliability and sensor calibration stability. The science customer mission planning and data product interface will be discussed. Science applications of the LVIS Facility include: cryosphere, territorial ecology carbon cycle, hydrology, solid earth and natural hazards, and biodiversity.",

            "abstract": "Flooding, and the resulting economic damage to roads and property, is associated with natural dams such as beaver dams or log jams. For this reason, humans often remove natural dams; however, river reaches with natural dams provide very different ecosystem services in comparison with free-flowing river reaches. Therefore, the goal of this project is to assess the differences in ecosystem state between these different river reach types in the northeastern United States. We focused on differences in basic chemistry (e.g., dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, and organic carbon) to assess the impact of natural dams on river ecosystem state. Study sites include rivers in the White Mountains and southeastern New Hampshire at locations with beaver dams, beaver ponds, beaver meadows, log jams, and free-flowing reaches. Dissolved oxygen, ORP, pH, temperature, and conductivity were measured in the field with a YSI Professional Plus meter. Water samples were collected for subsequent laboratory analysis of total organic carbon with a Shimadzu TOC-L. Preliminary results show that the chemistry of river water varies with feature type. Most significantly, dissolved oxygen concentrations are highest in free-flowing reaches and lowest in beaver ponds. Although beaver ponds are often associated with lower pH, due the increased concentration of organic acids, some beaver ponds can increase pH when compared to free-flowing reaches on the same river. Early results also show that water chemistry returns quickly to the chemistry typical of the free-flowing river reaches after being altered by a natural dam. Overall, natural dams create a river system that has more heterogeneity, and therefore has opportunities to provide more ecosystem functions, than a purely free-flowing river; this can increase the number of supported instream and riparian species. By increasing the understanding of how natural dams affect the chemistry of river water, river engineers can improve their decisions on how to remove problematic natural dams that increase flooding risks; they can also investigate possibilities to mimic the ecosystem state generated by natural dams in places where these dams are regularly removed.",

            "abstract": "Recent advances in imaging have provided a wealth of 3D datasets that reveal pore space microstructure (nm to cm length scale) and allow investigation of nonlinear flow and mechanical phenomena from first principles using numerical approaches. This framework has popularly been called “digital rock physics”. Researchers, however, have trouble storing and sharing the datasets both due to their size and the lack of standardized image types and associated metadata for volumetric datasets. This impedes scientific cross-validation of the numerical approaches that characterize large scale porous media properties, as well as development of multiscale approaches required for correct upscaling. A single research group typically specializes in an imaging modality and/or related modeling on a single length scale, and lack of data-sharing infrastructure makes it difficult to integrate different length scales.\nWe developed a sustainable, open and easy-to-use repository called the Digital Rocks Portal, that (1) organizes images and related experimental measurements of different porous materials, (2) improves access to them for a wider community of geosciences or engineering researchers not necessarily trained in computer science or data analysis. Once widely accepter, the repository will jumpstart productivity and enable scientific inquiry and engineering decisions founded on a data-driven basis. This is the first repository of its kind. We show initial results on incorporating essential software tools and pipelines that make it easier for researchers to store and reuse data, and for educators to quickly visualize and illustrate concepts to a wide audience. For data sustainability and continuous access, the portal is implemented within the reliable, 24/7 maintained High Performance Computing Infrastructure supported by the Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) at the University of Texas at Austin. Long-term storage is provided through the University of Texas System Research Cyber-infrastructure initiative.",

            "abstract": "Seismicity in Arizona is moderate compared to other parts of the U.S. Intermountain West region. However, large (M6+) damaging earthquakes have occurred in the past suggesting significant regional deformation and associated seismic hazard exist. Seismicity is concentrated in north-central Arizona near the western edge of the Colorado Plateau with scattered activity in the Arizona Transition Zone and the southern Basin and Range province extending towards the Rio Grande Rift. Sparse seismic station coverage had prevented a comprehensive analysis of earthquake source parameters so far. Permanent broadband seismic stations were installed starting in the 1990’s but coverage expanded significantly only in 2006 with the EarthScope Transportable Array and its legacy stations. Utilizing regional three-component broadband waveforms, we attempted seismic moment tensor inversion for all M4+ and M3.5+ earthquakes since 1990 and 2000, respectively. We obtained source parameters (faulting style, depth, seismic moment) for over 40 events in Arizona and vicinity ranging from Mw=3.2 to 5.3 roughly doubling the existing database. Mechanisms along a band extending from northwestern to southeastern Arizona show predominant normal faulting character. T-axes are usually E-W oriented but rotate towards N-S near 35N. Events near the Nevada-Utah border have strike-slip mechanisms with NW-SE oriented T-axes while to the south a few western Arizona strike-slip events have more northerly oriented T-axes. Centroid depths are mainly in the upper 10-15 km with a slight tendency of deeper sources proximal to the Colorado Plateau. The largest earthquake during the last 20 years, an Mw=5.2 event in June 2014, occurred in otherwise quiet southeastern Arizona underscoring the potential for significant earthquake sources throughout most of the state. The main shock at 9-12 km depth has an oblique normal faulting mechanism while the vivid aftershock sequence shows mechanisms that range from strike-slip to normal faulting.",

            "abstract": "When a floating ice shelf melts into an underlying warm salty ocean, the resulting fresh meltwater can rise in a buoyant Ice-Shelf-Water plume under the ice. In certain settings, ice flowing across the grounding line carries a basal layer of debris rich ice, entrained via basal freezing around till in the upstream ice sheet. Melting of this debris-laden ice from floating ice shelves provides a flux of dense sediment to the ocean, in addition to the release of fresh buoyant meltwater. This presentation considers the impact of the resulting suspended sediment on the dynamics of ice shelf water plumes, and identifies two key flow regimes depending on the sediment concentration frozen into the basal ice layer. For large sediment concentration, melting of the debris-laden ice shelf generates dense convectively unstable waters that drive convective overturning into the underlying ocean. For lower sediment concentration, the sediment initially remains suspended in a buoyant meltwater plume rising along the underside of the ice shelf, before slowly depositing into the underlying ocean. A theoretical plume model is used to evaluate the significance of the negatively buoyant sediment on circulation strength and the feedbacks on melting rate, along with the expected depositional patterns under the ice shelf.",

            "abstract": "Flashy delivery of water and sediment had distinct effects on the process of deposition in coeval fluvial megafan and fan delta deposits on opposing shorelines of a paleolake that occupied the Uinta Basin throughout the Eocene. The Tertiary Uinta Basin was an asymmetric continental interior basin with a steep northern margin, adjacent to the block uplift controlling basin subsidence, and a low gradient southern margin. A ~140 km wide fluvial megafan with catchments as far as ~750 km away occupied the southern margin of the lacustrine basin. Within this megafan system, fluvial deposits contain within-channel continental bioturbation and paleosol development on bar accretion surfaces that are evidence of prolonged periods of groundwater flow or channel abandonment. These are punctuated by channel fills exhibiting a suite of both high-deposition rate and upper flow regime sedimentary structures that were deposited by very rapid suspension-fallout during seasonal to episodic river flooding events. A series of small (~8 km wide) and proximally sourced fan deltas fed sediment into the steeper northern margin of the lacustrine basin. 35-50% of the deposits in the delta plain environment of these fan deltas are very sandy debris flows with as low as 5% clay and silt sized material. Detrital zircon geochronology shows that these fan deltas were tapping catchments where mostly unconsolidated Cretaceous sedimentary cover and thick Jurassic eolianites were being eroded. A combination of flashy precipitation, arid climate, catchments mantled by abundant loose sand-sized colluvium, and steep depositional gradients promoted generation of abundant very sandy (5-10% clay and silt sized material) debris flows. In this way, the Wasatch and Green River Formations in the Uinta Basin, Utah, U.S.A. gives us two very different examples of how routing flashy water and sediment delivery (associated with pulses of hyperthermal climate change during the Early Eocene) through different depositional systems produced unique processes of deposition, and also gives us an opportunity to isolate the effects of other variables (e.g. sediment caliber, system gradient, catchment size) that can modulate the flashy precipitation signal in stratigraphy.",

This data can provide insight into coronal structure, energy transport, and evolution in the inner heliosphere. However, in order to take full advantage of this data, researchers need quality models of the inner heliosphere to connect the in situ observations to their coronal and photospheric sources. Developing quality models for this region of space has proved difficult, in part because the only part of the field that is accessible for routine measurement is the photosphere. The photospheric field measurements, though somewhat problematic, are used as boundary conditions for coronal models, which often neglect or over-simplify chromospheric conditions, and these coronal models are then used as boundary conditions to drive heliospheric models. The result is a great deal of uncertainty about the accuracy and reliability of the heliospheric models. Here we present a technique we are developing for improving global coronal magnetic field models by optimizing the models to conform to the field morphology observed in coronal images. This agreement between the coronal model and the basic morphology of the corona is essential for creating accurate heliospheric models. We will present results of early tests of two implementations of this idea, and its first application to real-world data.",

We measured net ecosystem fluxes of COS and CO2 at an established flux tower site in a freshwater marsh in southern California during the growing season. The ecosystem acted as a strong sink of COS. The daytime variations mirrored those of CO2, however, COS uptake continued at night whereas the CO2 flux became very small. During the first part of the field campaign, the marsh was inundated which essentially eliminated surface fluxes, providing ideal test conditions for the COS-based flux partitioning method. The GPP estimates obtained from measured COS fluxes agreed well with thoses calculated using CO2-based partitioning methods. One of the most widely used flux partitioning methods, using the relationship of night-time fluxes and temperature, did poorly due to lack of turbulence at night.

            "abstract": "Prior geologic studies of the San Diego area, including northern Baja California, Mexico, focused on site investigations, characterization of rock formations, or earthquake hazards. No comprehensive, quantitative model characterizing the three-dimensional (3D) geology of the entire area has been developed. The lack of such a model limits understanding of large-scale processes, such as development of ancient landforms, and groundwater movement and availability. To evaluate these regional processes, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) conducted a study to better understand the geologic structure of the San Diego area. A cornerstone of this study is the installation and analysis of 77 wells at 12 multiple-depth monitoring-well sites. Geologic information from these wells was combined with lithologic data from 81 oil exploration wells and municipal and private water wells, gravity and seismic interpretations, and paleontological interpretations. These data were analyzed in conjunction with geologic maps and digital elevation models to develop a 3D geologic model of the San Diego area, in particular of the San Diego embayment. Existing interpretations of regional surficial geology, faulting, and tectonic history provided the framework for this model, which was refined by independent evaluation of subsurface geology. Geologic formations were simplified into five sedimentary units (Quaternary, Plio-Pleistocene, Oligocene, Eocene and Cretaceous ages), and one basal crystalline unit (primarily Cretaceous and Jurassic). Complex fault systems are represented in the model by ten fault strands that maintain overall displacement. The 3D geologic model corroborates existing geologic concepts of the San Diego area, refines the extent of subsurface geology, and allows users to holistically evaluate subsurface structures and regional hydrogeology.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Silvers_AGU2015.pdf\nThe characteristics of clouds in General Circulation Models (GCMs) need to be constrained in a consistent manner with theory, observations, and high resolution models (HRMs). One way forward is to base improvements of parameterizations on high resolution studies which resolve more of the important dynamical motions and allow for less parameterizations. This is difficult because of the numerous differences between GCMs and HRMs, both technical and theoretical. Century long simulations at resolutions of 20-250 km on a global domain are typical of GCMs while HRMs often simulate hours at resolutions of 0.1km-5km on domains the size of a single GCM grid cell. The recently developed mode ICON provides a flexible framework which allows many of these difficulties to be overcome.\nThis study uses the ICON model to compute SST perturbation simulations on multiple domains in a state of Radiative Convective Equilibrium (RCE) with parameterized convection. The domains used range from roughly the size of Texas to nearly half of Earth's surface area. All simulations use a doubly periodic domain with an effective distance between cell centers of 13 km and are integrated to a state of statistical stationarity. The primary analysis examines the mean characteristics of the cloud related fields and the feedback parameter of the simulations.\nIt is shown that the simulated atmosphere of a GCM in RCE is sufficiently similar across a range of domain sizes to justify the use of RCE to study both a GCM and a HRM on the same domain with the goal of improved constraints on the parameterized clouds. The simulated atmospheres are comparable to what could be expected at midday in a typical region of Earth’s tropics under calm conditions. In particular, the differences between the domains are smaller than differences which result from choosing different physics schemes. Significant convective organization is present on all domain sizes with a relatively high subsidence fraction. Notwithstanding the overall qualitative similarities of the simulations, quantitative differences lead to a surprisingly large sensitivity of the feedback parameter. This range of the feedback parameter is more than a factor of two and is similar to the range of feedbacks which were obtained by the CMIP5 models.",

Our study focused on the Coastal Plain of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed (CBW), the Delmarva Peninsula, where the most of wetlands in CBW are densely distributed. The wetland ecosystem plays crucial roles in improving water quality and ecological integrity for the downstream waters and the Chesapeake Bay, and headwater wetlands in the region, such as Delmarva Bay, are now subject to the legal protection under the Clean Water Rules. We developed new wetland maps using time series Landsat images and a highly accurate LiDAR map over last 30 years. These maps show the changes in surface water fraction at a 30-m grid cell at annual time scale. Using GIS, we analyse these maps to characterize changing dynamics of wetland inundation due to the physical environmental factors (e.g., weather variability, tide) and assessed the hydrological connection of wetlands to the downstream water at the watershed scale. Focusing on the two adjacent watersheds in the upper region of the Choptank River Basin, we study how wetland inundation dynamics and the hydrologic linkage of wetlands to downstream water would vary by the local hydrogeological setting and attempt to identify the key landscape factors affecting the wetland ecosystems and functioning. We then discuss the potential of using remote sensing products to improve the physical modelling of wetlands from our experience with SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool).",

At the headwaters of the South Fork Eel River in Northern California, the site of the Eel River Critical Zone Observatory, the temporal and spatial variability of groundwater and effects of depth and speed of water movement on stream chemistry dynamics have been examined by Kim et al. (2014). Through automated ISCO Gravity Filtration System (GFS; Kim et al. 2012, EST), samples of groundwater and stream water have been collected at frequency of one to three days since 2009 from three wells (Well 1 down-slope, Well 3 mid-slope, Well 10 up-slope) and Elder Creek and filtered through 0.45 μm diameter Supor filters. Preliminary analysis of the filters via measurements of optical density (from sample photography under controlled lighting) have served as selection aid for identifying relevant environmental phenomena such as rainstorms and wildfires in the study of reactive particulate phases. Here we investigate solubilization strategies (e.g. strong acid leaching or total digest) for sample pretreatment prior to ICP-MS analysis and the sample time series. Results from ICP analysis of particles are compared with the same temporal points taken of water samples, such as with Mn and Fe. Previous research into the fate and transport of these metals suggest that Mn exists primarily in a dissolved phase while Fe exists in colloidal phases, produced by chemical weathering in the vadose zone, which may be tested with the compositional analysis of the filter particulates. Overall, compositional analyses of filter particles and comparison with water chemistry data will complete the picture of temporal and spatial dynamics of chemical weathering.",

            "abstract": "Surface electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is often used to monitor solute plumes. Inverting the data on a pixel-based grid provides a snapshot of the subsurface conductivity, but even with a large amount of data, the number of model cells outnumbers the amount of independent measurements and sensitivity is variable across the model space. To overcome these problems and converge on a final conductivity image, additional regularization is often imposed, such as smoothness constraints. This regularization can distort the perceived geometry of the plume. Furthermore, extracting information about a plume from a pixelated image requires an additional level of interpretation. In this study, we use moment-based rather than pixel-based parameterization to invert for plume geometry. If we assume a simple Gaussian-shaped plume perturbing the initial background conductivity model, then we can acquire plume location, size, and conductivity value directly from the inversion. Neither regularization nor pixel image interpretation is required. Since we have reduced the dimensionality to only a few model parameters, we are able to explicitly calculate the Jacobian matrix, or the sensitivity of ERT data to model perturbations. If the rows of the Jacobian are independent, each plume moment parameter can be determined uniquely from the data; if they are not independent, parameters can be combined, further reducing dimensionality. By finding the Jacobian with the most independent rows, we can optimize the survey design for plume monitoring.",

            "abstract": "The Neoproterozoic Era was a time of extreme climatic variation as recorded in sedimentary rocks of this age across the globe, leading to a number of controversial hypotheses (e.g. the Snowball Earth glaciations). In eastern Brazil, the Bambuí Gr. is a thick carbonatic-siliciclastic unit that covers the São Francisco Craton and preserves remnants of a Neoproterozoic glaciation and their respective cap carbonate (1). Recent findings of Cloudina in the Januária region (2) suggest that at least part of the sequence might be upper Ediacaran or even Cambrian. Here we present the first carbon-oxygen isotope data for the Jaíba Fm., a ca. 50 m thick carbonate unit that occurs in the topmost portion of the Bambuí Gr. in this same region. The Jaíba Fm. post-dates the cap carbonate sequence and the fossil-bearing layers, and thus was probably deposited in the Ediacaran-Cambrian transition. Three stratigraphic columns were analyzed, and yielded similar ratios. Values of δ13CVPDB are between 0.8 and 3.4 ‰, while δ18OVPDB values are mostly around -8 ‰. These values contrasts with the negative δ13C values found for the base of the Bambuí Gr., followed by highly positive δ13C (up to +14‰) on its middle portion. The unusually high δ13C values are commonly interpreted as evidence for deposition on a restricted basin, such as in a foreland setting. The return to values which are close to the PDB standard in the uppermost Bambuí Gr. might thus indicate a change in the paleogeography and tectonic environment of the basin, suggesting an open, ventilated environment along with a recovery of the biological and hydrological cycle after a Late Neoproterozoic glaciation. Ongoing detailed sedimentological, geochemical and isotopic work might help to further clarify these issues and to provide new clues for unraveling Late Neoproterozoic paleoclimate, paleogeography and ocean chemistry.

The complexity of managing data, publishing data online, and archiving data has not decreased significantly even as computing access and power has greatly increased. The Open Data Repository’s Data Publisher software (\nhttp://www.opendatarepository.org\n) strives to make data archiving, management, and publication a standard part of a researcher’s workflow using simple, web-based tools and commodity server hardware. The publication engine allows for uploading, searching, and display of data with graphing capabilities and downloadable files. Access is controlled through a robust permissions system that can control publication at the field level and can be granted to the general public or protected so that only registered users at various permission levels receive access. Data Publisher also allows researchers to subscribe to meta-data standards through a plugin system, embargo data publication at their discretion, and collaborate with other researchers through various levels of data sharing. As the software matures, semantic data standards will be implemented to facilitate machine reading of data and each database will provide a REST application programming interface for programmatic access. Additionally, a citation system will allow snapshots of any data set to be archived and cited for publication while the data itself can remain living and continuously evolve beyond the snapshot date. The software runs on a traditional LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) server and is available on GitHub (\nhttp://github.com/opendatarepository\n) under a GPLv2 open source license. The goal of the Open Data Repository is to lower the cost and training barrier to entry so that any researcher can easily publish their data and ensure it is archived for posterity.

Special emphasis is placed on CO2 injection, and the particular techniques that are used for this study including model selection, particle tracking proxies, and partial coupling of flow and geomechanics. The proposed process starts with generating a large initial ensemble of reservoir models that reflect a prior uncertainty in reservoir description, including all plausible geologic scenarios. These models are presumed to be conditioned to available static data. In the absence of production or injection data, all prior reservoir models are regarded as equiprobable. Thus, the model selection algorithm is applied to select a few representative reservoir models that are more consistent with observed dynamic responses. A quick assessment of the models must then be performed to evaluate their dynamic characteristics and flow connectivity. This approach develops a particle tracking proxy and a finite element method solver for solving the flow equation and the stress problem, respectively. The shape of CO2 plume is estimated using a particle-tracking proxy that serves as a fast approximation of finite-difference simulation models. Sequentially, a finite element method solver is coupled with the proxy for analyzing geomechanical effects resulting from CO2 injection. A method is then implemented to group the models into clusters based on similarities in the estimated responses. The posterior model set is chosen as the cluster that produces the minimum deviation from the observed field data. The efficacy of non-dominated sorting based on Pareto-optimality is also tested in the current model selection framework. The proposed scheme is demonstrated on a carbon sequestration project in Algeria. Coupling surface deformation data with well injection data enhances the efficiency of tracking the CO2 plume. Therefore, this algorithm provides a probabilistic approach to assessing the migration of the CO2 plume in the aquifer and quantifying the risk associated with sequestration projects. Iterating the selection of clusters can further refine the forecasts of CO2 plume migration.",

            "abstract": "We examined a stratigraphic section of the Johnnie Oolite containing a large Ediacaran negative d13C excursion to evaluate potential effects of diagenesis on Carbonate Associated Nitrate (CAN). Previously, high concentrations of CAN have been determined in this carbonate sequence, potentially pointing to a large perturbation in the marine nitrogen cycle prior to the onset of the d13C excursion. The main source of nitrate within the ocean comes from oxidation of biologically fixed nitrogen. Nitrate enters the carbonate mineral lattice in trace quantities, and may serve as a proxy for the degree of ocean oxygenation as well as for the concentration of fixed nitrogen in the environment. Until now no work has been done to address potential diagenetic alteration of the CAN concentrations. Here we conducted a comparative study between a set of redox-sensitive trace metals, carbonate textures and CAN concentrations in order to place some initial constraints on the extent of diagenetic processes, and in doing so to determine whether the CAN signal within the Johnnie Oolite is primary. We found no clear relationship between CAN and any considered diagenetic markers, pointing to a likely primary nature of the CAN signature. Furthermore, examination of the properties of the ooids that form the rock revealed potential indications of primary environmental changes recorded within the Johnnie Oolite. Ooids are known to form by two distinct mechanisms, which produce either tangential-concentric ooids or radial. Focusing on a single ~3 m stratigraphic section, the North Springs Mountains area, we found a clear shift from tangential-concentric formation at the base to radial formation near the top, with a distinct change occurring between 2-2.5 m. The distinction between ooid formation mechanisms is often thought to be governed by changes in the turbidity of their shallow depositional environments; however, the lack of any marked changes in sedimentary sorting point to a chemical influence in this case. Observed correlations between ooid formation texture and d13C values support this conclusion, and further point towards some distinct shift in the local paleocean chemistry, apparently occurring at the time of substantial changes in CAN content recorded within the rocks.",

The surface hydrology network variability of small streams in the ablation zone of Greenland is poorly understood both spatially and temporally. Using satellites that can spatially resolve the presence and associated properties of small streams, the scientific community is now able to be provided with accurate spatial and temporal analysis of surface hydrology on the ice sheet (that could not have been resolved with other sensors such as those on board MODIS or LANDSAT). In this study we report mapped supra-glacial water networks over a region of the West GrIS (approximately 164 km2) derived from high resolution multispectral satellite imagery from the Quickbird and WorldView – 2 satellites in tandem with a 2 meter stereographic SETSM DEM (digital elevation model). The branching complexity of the identified surface streams is computed from the available DEM as well as the intra- and inter seasonal changes observed in the hydrological system. The stream networks created during the melt season (at several different stages of melting) are compared and discussed as well as the networks mapped between consecutive years for proximate dates. Also, depth and volume estimations for the surface water features identified were extracted via band math algorithms, threshold classifications, and morphological operations. Our results indicate that the higher stream orders have the largest amount of stored surface water per km but the lower stream orders, specifically 1st order with widths of ~ 2 meters, hold more stored surface water overall. We also employ and compare runoff data from the numerical model MAR (Modèle Atmosphérique Régional) to the estimations found using imagery and the DEM.",

Previously drilled borehole data reveal that the unconformity is marked by a basal gravel unit of early Holocene age with boulders up to 30-cm in diameter atop a compacted but unlithified sand and gravel conglomerate (D50=0.6mm) of latest Pleistocene age. We tie these borehole data to a 2D marine multichannel seismic survey along a 255-km reach of the Brahmaputra-Jamuna River, the first survey to image the lowstand valley from the India-Bangladesh border to the confluence with the Ganges (Padma) River. A prominent reflector is imaged along the length of the survey demarcating the valley base and Holocene-Pleistocene unconformity, sloping from ~40m below water level upstream to ~90m below water level at the downstream confluence. The average slope of this paleosurface is ~3x steeper than that of the modern channel bed, which may be the result of lower base level and propagation of a low-relief knickpoint during the last glacial lowstand. Alternatively or in conjunction, the steeper channel gradient may be due to increased basinward subsidence. In addition, the lowstand reflector is tectonically deformed at multiple locations, defining 4 distinct tectonic domains along the length of the survey. We place these tectonic influences on the stream channel in the context of its avulsion history during the Holocene, with evidence that the most recent avulsion of the Old Brahmaputra into the modern Jamuna course ~200ya was induced by tectonic uplift along the western margin of the Shillong Massif (Meghalaya, India). We further propose locations of the modern river that may be affected by tectonically-induced planform changes.",

It may be difficult to identify a suitable model and its corresponding parameters.This study assesses the global sensitivity indices for parameters of multiple models and scenarios on nitrogen processes. The majority of existing nitrogen dynamics models consider nitrification and denitrification as a first-order decay process or a Michaelis-Menten model, while various reduction functions are used to reflect the impact of environmental soil conditions. To determine the model uncertainty, 9 alternative models were designed based on NP2D model in this study. These models have the similar descriptions of nitrogen process but are different in the cal reduction functions of soil water and temperature. A global sensitivity analysis of each models under various scenarios was evaluated. Results show that in our synthetic cases of nitrogen transport and transformation, the global sensitivity indices vary between each models and scenarios. Larger indices for parameters of nitrification are obtained than the ones of denitrification in 6 models, while an inverse relationship is revealed in the rest 3 models. Parameters of soil temperature reduction functions are more sensitive than those of soil water reduction functions. When the soil water and temperature increase separately or together, parameters of denitrification gain their sensitivity, but the indices for parameters of soil temperature reduction functions decrease simultaneously. Our results indicate that identifying important parameters may be biased if ignoring the model and scenario uncertainties. This problem can be resolved by using the global sensitivity indices for multiple models and multiple scenarios. The new indices is useful to determine the relative contributions from different models and scenarios.",

            "abstract": "It is well recognized that thawing permafrost peatlands are likely to provide a positive feedback to climate change via CH4 and CO2 emissions. High-latitude lakes in these landscapes have also been identified as sources of CH4 and CO2 loss to the atmosphere. To investigate microbial contributions to carbon loss from high-latitude lakes, we characterized sediment geochemistry and microbiota via cores collected from deep and shallow regions of two lakes (Inre Harrsjön and Mellersta Harrsjön) in Arctic Sweden in July, 2012. These lakes are within the Stordalen Mire long-term ecological area, a focal site for investigating the impacts of climate change-related permafrost thaw, and the lakes in this area are responsible for ~55% of the CH4 loss from this hydrologically interconnected system. Across 40 samples from 4 to 40 cm deep within four sediment cores, Illumina 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that the sedimentary microbiota was dominated by candidate phyla OP9 and OP8 (Atribacteria and Aminicenantes, respectively, including putative fermenters and anaerobic respirers), predicted methanotrophic Gammaproteobacteria, and predicted methanogenic archaea from the Thermoplasmata Group E2 clade. We observed some overlap in community structure with nearby peatlands, which tend to be dominated by methanogens and Acidobacteria. Sediment microbial communities differed significantly between lakes, by overlying lake depth (shallow vs. deep), and by depth within a core, with each trend corresponding to parallel differences in biogeochemical measurements. Overall, our results support the potential for significant microbial controls on carbon cycling in high-latitude lakes associated with thawing permafrost, and ongoing metagenomic analyses of focal samples will yield further insight into the functional potential of these microbial communities and their dominant members.",

It is, therefore, critical to ensure quality of such VI products and one method of validating VI product quality is cross-comparison with in situ flux tower measurements. In this study, we evaluated the quality of VI time series derived from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) spacecraft by cross-comparison with in situ radiation flux measurements at select flux tower sites over North America and Europe. VIIRS is a new polar-orbiting satellite sensor series, slated to replace National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer in the afternoon overpass and to continue the highly-calibrated data streams initiated with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer of National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Earth Observing System. The selected sites covered a wide range of biomes, including croplands, grasslands, evergreen needle forest, woody savanna, and open shrublands. The two VIIRS indices of the Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the atmospherically-corrected, Top-of-Canopy (TOC) Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) (daily, 375 m spatial resolution) were compared against the TOC NDVI and a two-band version of EVI (EVI2) calculated from tower radiation flux measurements, respectively. VIIRS and Tower VI time series showed comparable seasonal profiles across biomes with statistically significant correlations (> 0.60; p-value < 0.01). “Start-of-season (SOS)” phenological metric values extracted from VIIRS and Tower VI time series were also highly compatible (R2 > 0.95), with mean differences of 2.3 days and 5.0 days for the NDVI and the EVI, respectively. These results indicate that VIIRS VI time series can capture seasonal evolution of vegetated land surface as good as in situ radiometric measurements. Future studies that address biophysical or physiological interpretations of Tower VI time series derived from radiation flux measurements are desirable.",

            "abstract": "Potential losses related to large earthquakes on blind or previously unrecognized thrust faults is of significant concern to southern California, where numerous individual mountain ranges are underlain by active faults. Some of the most hazardous thrust fault systems in Southern California are associated with high-slip-rate faults in the northern portion of the western Transverse Ranges, while the southern region is generally considered to be less seismically active. Determining slip rates on faults bounding the Santa Monica Mountains has been challenging, in part because many of the faults that underlie the range have submarine surface traces. Existing geologic studies predict that these faults slip relatively slowly; however, recent GPS models predict a band of relatively fast contraction on faults that lie beneath the Santa Monica Mountains (Marshall et al., 2013). These geodetic models suggest unrecognized hazard associated with shortening and vertical uplift of this range.\nLate Cenozoic strata in the central Santa Monica Mountains are of sufficient thickness to bury Cretaceous and Paleocene strata above the closure temperature for apatite (U-Th)/He thermochronometry (~70°C). As a result, these older rocks, now exposed in the southern Santa Monica Mountains, may record exhumation associated with fault slip and associated structural deformation of the range. Preliminary apatite (U-Th)/He ages near Las Flores Canyon span from 3.5 to 6.5 Ma, and are the youngest apatite (U-Th)/He ages we are aware of in southern California outside of the transpressional San Andreas system. When plotted as depth beneath the base of the marine Modelo Formation, an inflection in age/depth gradient at 4 Ma is inferred to reflect the onset of fault motion and is consistent with the late Miocene age of the Modelo Formation. Based on average geothermal gradients for the Ventura and Los Angeles basins and an assumed thrust fault dip of 20°, observed apparent exhumation rates are consistent with ~ 2 mm/yr dip slip motion on a thrust fault beneath the Santa Monica Mountains. The results from this study are consistent with geodetic models of high slip rates beneath the Santa Monica Mountains and thus refine our understanding of seismic hazard in southern California.",

            "abstract": "We describe our work on building a web-browser based document reader with built-in exploration tool and automatic concept extraction of medical entities for biomedical text. Vast amounts of biomedical information are offered in unstructured text form through scientific publications and R&D reports. Utilizing text mining can help us to mine information and extract relevant knowledge from a plethora of biomedical text. The ability to employ such technologies to aid researchers in coping with information overload is greatly desirable. In recent years, there has been an increased interest in automatic biomedical concept extraction [1, 2] and intelligent PDF reader tools with the ability to search on content and find related articles [3]. Such reader tools are typically desktop applications and are limited to specific platforms. Our goal is to provide researchers with a simple tool to aid them in finding, reading, and exploring documents. Thus, we propose a web-based document explorer, which we called Shangri-Docs, which combines a document reader with automatic concept extraction and highlighting of relevant terms. Shangri-Docsalso provides the ability to evaluate a wide variety of document formats (e.g. PDF, Words, PPT, text, etc.) and to exploit the linked nature of the Web and personal content by performing searches on content from public sites (e.g. Wikipedia, PubMed) and private cataloged databases simultaneously.\nShangri-Docsutilizes Apache cTAKES (clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System) [4] and Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to automatically identify and highlight terms and concepts, such as specific symptoms, diseases, drugs, and anatomical sites, mentioned in the text. cTAKES was originally designed specially to extract information from clinical medical records. Our investigation leads us to extend the automatic knowledge extraction process of cTAKES for biomedical research domain by improving the ontology guided information extraction process. We will describe our experience and implementation of our system and share lessons learned from our development. We will also discuss ways in which this could be adapted to other science fields.\n[1] Funk et al., 2014.\n[2] Kang et al., 2014.\n[3] Utopia Documents, http://utopiadocs.com\n[4] Apache cTAKES, http://ctakes.apache.org",

            "abstract": "Ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instabilities such as the kink [1] and torus [2] instabilities are believed to play an important role in driving “storage-and-release” eruptions in the solar corona. These instabilities act on long-lived, arched magnetic flux ropes that are “line-tied” to the solar surface. In spite of numerous observational and computational studies, the conditions under which these instabilities produce an eruption remain a subject of intense debate. In this paper, we use a line-tied, arched flux rope experiment to study storage-and-release eruptions in the laboratory [3]. An in situ array of miniature magnetic probes is used to assess the equilibrium and stability of the laboratory flux ropes. Two major results are reported here: First, a new stability regime is identified where torus-unstable flux ropes fail to erupt. In this “failed torus” regime, the flux rope is torus-unstable but kink-stable. Under these conditions, a dynamic “toroidal field tension force” surges in magnitude and causes the flux rope to contract. This tension force, which is missing from existing eruption models, is the J×B force between self-generated poloidal currents in the flux rope and the toroidal (guide) component of the vacuum field. Secondly, a clear torus instability threshold is observed in the kink-unstable regime. This latter result, which is consistent with existing theoretical [4] and numerical [5] findings, verifies the key role of the torus instability in driving some solar eruptions.\nThis research is supported by DoE Contract No. DE-AC02-09CH11466 and by the NSF/DoE Center for Magnetic Self-Organization (CMSO).\n[1] Hood & Priest, Geophys.

Here we demonstrate multiple-parameter correlations that relate each of several Jovian emissions, including bKOM and quasi-periodic bursts, to the SW and IMF impacting the Jovian magnetosphere. The data used are from the Ulysses spacecraft with radio data from the Unified Radio and Plasma wave (URAP) instrument, which provides high-quality remote radio observations of the Jovian emissions. The URAP observations are correlated with SW and IMF data from the relevant instruments on Ulysses, propagated to the nose of the Jovian magnetosphere with a sophisticated code. Because the aphelion of the Ulysses orbit was at the Jovian distance from the Sun, Ulysses spent ample time near Jupiter in 1991-1992 and 2003-2004, which are the intervals analyzed. Our results can be inverted such that radio observations by a Jovian orbiter, such as Cassini or Juno, are able to identify SW/IMF changes based on the behavior of the radio emissions.",

            "abstract": "Wind energy is one of the fastest-growing segments of the world energy market, offering a clean and abundant source of electricity. However, wind energy facilities can have detrimental effects on wildlife, especially birds and bats. Monitoring systems based on marine navigation radar are often used to quantify migration near potential wind sites, but the ability to reliably distinguish between bats and different varieties of birds has not been practically achieved. This classification capability would enable wind site selection that protects more vulnerable species, such as bats and raptors. Flight behavior, such as wing beat frequency, changes in speed, or changes in orientation, are known to vary by species [1]. The ability to extract these properties from radar data could ultimately enable a species based classification scheme. In this work, we analyze the relationship between radar measurements and bird flight behavior in echoes from avifauna.\nDuring the 2014 fall migration season, the UMass dual polarized weather radar was used to collect low elevation observations of migrating birds as they traversed through a fixed antenna beam. The radar was run during the night time, in clear-air conditions. Data was coherently integrated, and detections of biological targets exceeding an SNR threshold were extracted. Detections without some dominant frequency content (i.e. clear periodicity, potentially the wing beat frequency) were removed from the sample in order to isolate observations suspected to contain a single species or bird. For the remaining detections, measurements including the polarimetric products and the Doppler spectrum were extracted at each time step over the duration of the observation.\nThe periodic and time changing nature of some of these different measurements was found to have a strong correlation with flight behavior (i.e. flapping vs. gliding behavior). Assumptions about flight behavior and orientation were corroborated through scattering simulations of birds in flight. The presence of a strong correlation between certain radar measurements and flight behavior would suggest the potential for a broad, species based avian classification algorithm. Such a classification scheme could ultimately help select and monitor wind sites in order to minimize harm to at-risk bird and bat species.",

However, pursuing maximum benefit from natural capital through ecosystem services caused failure by losing ecosystem functions through its trade-offs. Therefore, difference between ecosystem functions and services were demonstrated and would apply human relating perspectives. Assessment results of ecosystem functions and services can be divided 3 parts. Tree growth per year set as the ecosystem function factor and indicated through so called pure function map. After that, relating functions can be driven such as water conservation, air pollutant purification, climate change regulation, and timber production. Overall process and amount are numerically quantified. These functional results can be transferred to ecosystem services by multiplying economic unit value, so function reflecting service maps can be generated. On the other hand, above services, to implement more reliable human demand, human reflecting service maps are also be developed. As the validation, quantified ecosystem functions are compared with former results through pixel based analysis. Three maps are compared, and through comparing difference between ecosystem function and services and inversed trends in function based and human based service are analysed. In this study, we could find differences in PF, FRS, and HRS in relation to based ecosystem conditions. This study suggests that the differences in PF, FRS, and HRS should be understood in the decision making process for sustainable management of ecosystem services. Although the analysis is based on in sort existing process separation, it is important to consider the possibility of different usage of ecosystem function assessment results and ecosystem service assessment results in SDG policy making. Furthermore, process based functional approach can suggest environmental information which is reflected the other kinds of perspective.",

            "abstract": "Tracking terrestrial carbon fluxes and predicting how tropical forests will respond to continuous global change requires accurate estimates of annual changes in the density and distribution of carbon stocks at local to global scales. Existing evidence for tropical forests as a carbon sink is based on a limited number of repeated field measurements (Phillips et al. 1998,Lewis et al. 2009, Brienen et al. 2015), while spatially explicit estimates over large areas are limited to emissions derived from deforestation without being able to account for degradation and gain (Harris et al. 2012, Hansen et al. 2013). Here we use 12 years (2003-2014) of satellite data to quantify wall-to-wall annual net changes in aboveground carbon density, showing that Africa tropical forests are a net carbon source on the order of 72.1 ± 32.9 Tg C yr-1. This net release of carbon consists of losses of 205.0 ± 24.7 Tg C yr1 and gains of -132.9 ± 19.3 Tg C yr1. The net gains result from forest growth; net losses result from both reductions in forest area due to deforestation and in biomass density within forests due to degradation; this last accounting overall for 68.9 % of the losses. We anticipate several advantages over the traditional estimates. It measures carbon lost from forest degradation as well as from deforestation. It measures the gains of carbon in forest growth. Data are available to determine annual changes with associated uncertainty. The approach focuses directly on changes in carbon. While global emissions from fossil fuel stabilized in 2014 for the first time in the past 40 years, results from this study indicate that the annual rate of emissions from tropical forests has tended upward over the latest years of the 2003-2014 period.",

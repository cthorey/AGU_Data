            "abstract": "ePoster - Goebel_indSeism_AGU_2015.pdf\nThe seismogenic response to induced pressure changes provides insight into the proximity to failure of faults close to injection sites. Here, we examine possible seismicity rate changes in response to wastewater disposal and enhanced oil recovery operations in hydrocarbon basins in California and Oklahoma. We test whether a statistically significant rate increase exists within these areas and determine the corresponding timing and location based on nonparametric modeling of background seismicity rates. Annual injection volumes increased monotonically since ~2001 in California and ~1998 in Oklahoma. While OK experienced a recent surge in seismic activity which exceeded the 95% confidence limit of a stationary Poisson process in ~2010, seismicity in CA showed no increase in background rates between 1980 and 2014. A systematic analysis of frequency-magnitude-distributions (FMDs) of likely induced earthquakes in OK indicates that FMDs are depleted in large-magnitude events. Seismicity in CA hydrocarbon basins, on the other hand, shows Gutenberg-Richter type FMDs and b~1. Moreover, the earthquakes and injection operations occur preferably in distinct areas in CA whereas in OK earthquakes occur closer to injection wells than expected from a random uniform process. To test whether injection operations may be responsible for the strongly different seismicity characteristics in CA and OK, we compare overall well density, wellhead pressures, peak and cumulative rates as well as injection depths. We find that average injection rates, pressures and volumes are comparable between CA and OK and that injection occurs on average 0.5 km deeper in CA than in OK. Thus, the here tested operational parameters can not easily explain the vastly different seismogenic response to injection operations in CA and OK, and may only be of secondary importance for the resulting earthquake activity. The potential to induce earthquakes by fluid injection operations is likely controlled by the specific geologic setting and stress state on nearby faults.",

            "abstract": "Current understanding of ecological behaviour indicates that systems can experience sudden and abrupt changes in state, driven either by a large external change in environmental conditions (extrinsically forced), or the result of a set local feedbacks and site-specific interactions (intrinsically mediated responses). Responses mediated by intrinsic processes are notoriously diffi- cult to predict, they can occur as slow environmental variables gradually erode the resilience of the system eventually resulting in threshold transitions between alternative stable states. Finding ways to identify, model and predict such complex ecosystem behavior has been identified as a priority research challenge for both ecology and paleoecology.\nThe paleoecological record can play a role in understanding the processes behind abrupt ecological change because it enables the reconstruction of processes occurring over decadal-centennial timescales or longer. Therefore, paleoecological data can be used to identify the existence of ecological thresholds and to investigate the environmental processes that can lead to loss of resilience and abrupt transitions between alternate states. In addition, incidences of abrupt vegetation changes in the past can serve as palaeoecological model systems; analogues of abrupt dynamics which can be used to test theories surrounding ecological responses to climate change.\nHere, I present examples from a range of terrestrial ecosystems (Holocene environmental changes from a coastal lagoon in the Galapagos Islands; Northern European vegetation changes since the last deglaciation; the North American hemlock decline) demonstrating evidence of abrupt ecosystem change. For each system I present a set of statistical techniques tailored to distin- guish between extrinsic versus intrinsically mediated ecological responses. Examples are provided from both single sites (i.e. landscape scale) and multiple sites (regional-continental scale). These techniques provide a useful way to identify when and where intrinsically mediated responses to environmental change occurs; the next challenge is to understand and quantify the processes that underlie these intrinsic responses.

            "abstract": "Increasing deciduous shrub abundance, productivity, and range in the Arctic comes with the potential for both negative and positive feedbacks to the climate system. This study presents six seasons of eddy covariance measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) and latent and sensible heat fluxes along a shrub gradient in Canada’s Low Arctic. Three flux tower sites with 17, 45, and 64% dwarf birch cover were established within a few kilometers of each other to investigate differences in microclimate, energy and carbon exchanges.\nAs expected, there was greater winter snow depth but less summer soil thaw with greater shrub cover. However, snowmelt timing and speed were usually similar among sites. Despite a reduction in albedo in spring and greater leaf area through summer, latent heat fluxes were consistently lower with greater shrub cover. Offset by small differences in sensible heat fluxes, total seasonal atmospheric heating (combined sensible and latent heat fluxes) was similar among sites. We anticipated greater net uptake of CO2 through the growing season with greater shrub cover. However, that was only the case in some years. There was much more week-to-week and year-to-year variability in CO2 fluxes at the shrubbiest site suggesting photosynthesis and respiration processes were more sensitive to weather variations. Shrub abundance does impact tundra surface-atmosphere exchanges of energy and carbon but these observations also highlight the complexity involved in predicting the net climate feedback effect of current and future Arctic vegetation change.",

            "abstract": "Biochar may improve soil performance by altering soil physical properties such as porosity, density, hydraulic conductivity, and water holding capacity. Because these physical properties of soil-biochar mixtures are associated with the grain size of the soil and the biochar, they may change if biochar particles are physically broken down in the environment. In cold regions, biochar may be fragmented into smaller particles when water in biochar’s internal pores expands during freezing. This expansion may mechanically break particles. In this study we investigate if freeze-thaw cycles affect grain size of biochars produced at two temperatures (350°C and 500°C) from four types of feedstock (mesquite, pine, sewage waste, and miscanthus). Prior to freeze-thaw cycles, biochar’s internal porosity increases with pyrolysis temperature and also varies with feedstock type. In our study, the highest internal porosity is 0.82±0.11 for 500 °C miscanthus biochar and the lowest internal porosity is 0.27±0.01 for 350 °C sewage waste biochar. Our biochars also have different median grain diameter (D50) and aspect ratio (AR). The largest D50 is 4836±132 μm for 350 °C miscanthus biochar and the smallest D50 is 2238±13 μm for 350°C sewage waste biochar. The highest AR is 0.85±0.01 for 500 °C sewage waste biochar and the lowest AR is 0.31±0.01 for 350 °C miscanthus biochar. After characterizing the initial properties of biochars, we saturated our biochar using synthetic rain water and subjected them to 10 freeze-thaw cycles (freeze at -19±3°C for 8 hours and thaw at 20±0°C for 16 hours). We expect that D50 will be reduced and AR will be changed by freeze-thaw cycles and the effect will vary with biochar porosity. Ultimately this work will help constrain how biochar particle size changes due to freezing, which can be extrapolated to understand transients in soil performance associated with biochar particle size.",

In our 3D tomographic inversions, we used passive seismic data recorded between 2009-2012 from a temporary local network as well as active seismic legacy data to constrain the velocity models. We find high P-wave velocities (Vp) underneath regions of elevated topographic relief as well as two low-Vp anomalies that coincide spatially with two attenuating bodies outlined from S-wave shadows during the Krafla rifting episode of 1974-1985. Within the Krafla geothermal reservoir, which is developed for energy production, we imaged a shallow low-Vp/Vs zone overlying a deeper high-Vp/Vs zone and interpreted them as steam- and brine-bearing formations, respectively. Previously undertaken borehole measurements support our findings. A prominent low-Vp/Vs anomaly underlies these zones at rock depths greater than 1.5 km, where a super-heated zone within felsic overlies rhyolitic within the geothermal melt. Calculations systems show that of the most earthquake focal events are mechanisms consistent double-couple source models with only a few clear non-shear source models.",

            "abstract": "Hawaiian volcanoes are distributed en echelon on the islands along two chains, the Loa and Kea trends, that are geographically and geochemically distinct1,2. These geochemical differences may be attributed to source zoning (concentric or bilateral) of the Hawaiian mantle plume (HMP) or to variations in pressure and temperature of melting. Most of these models assume a degree of independence of the two trends that is perhaps not realistic. To explore the isotopic characteristics of two “Kea”-trend volcanoes with transitional signatures, we analyzed 11 samples of Kohala shield-stage tholeiitic lavas and three from Haleakala for high-precision Pb-Nd-Sr-Hf isotopes. These samples are transitional in all isotopic systems between Loa and Kea compositions and cross-over the Pb-Pb boundary3. Minor cross-overs had been documented in Mauna Kea4, Kilauea5, and W Molokai6 basalts. A bilateral or concentric view of the HMP is thus too simplistic. Statistical analysis of the MC-ICP-MS or triple-spike shield tholeiite data (n>600) and the existence of three Pb-Pb trends originating from average Loa indicate that Loa is the dominant mantle source composition on the archipelago. Isotopically, four geochemical groups are identified: Kea (Mauna Kea, Kilauea), average Loa (Mauna Loa, Hualalai, Kauai, Waianae, W. Molokai, Loihi), enriched Loa (Koolau Makapuu, Lanai, Kahoolawe) and transitional Kea (E. Molokai, W. Maui, Haleakala, Kohala). The implications are: 1) HMP source components refresh and grade into and out of existence on a smaller timescale than previously thought; 2) the Kea trend is also heterogeneous; and 3) vertical heterogeneity of the plume is important on a regional scale as well as at the scale of individual volcanoes6.\n1Jackson et al., 1972, GSA Bull. 83, 1-17.\n2Weis et al., 2011, Nat.

Simulated stratocumulus coverage in Community Atmosphere Model version 5 (CAM5) is too small with an abrupt transition to shallow cumulus in the subtropical eastern ocean. To improve the simulation of the smooth transition between stratocumulus and shallow cumulus and reduce the inherent model bias, a unified boundary layer scheme, merging the moist turbulence scheme and shallow cumulus scheme of University of Washington, is proposed. The unified scheme separates the turbulent mass flux into a local transport part by the turbulent process and a nonlocal transport part by the shallow convection in the convective boundary layers. Specific criterion is used to achieve a smooth transition between stratocumulus and shallow cumulus. The new unified scheme with a statistical cloud fraction scheme is able to improve the marine stratocumulus cloud simulation in CAM5. The sub-grid variabilities caused by the convective and turbulent processes are considered in the cloud fraction scheme to improve the coupling process between cloud formation and convective and boundary layer mixing processes.",

            "abstract": "The NASA Langley Research Center airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidars, HSRL-1 and HSRL-2, were deployed for the DISCOVER-AQ (Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from COlumn and VERtically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality) missions. DISCOVER-AQ provided systematic and concurrent observations of column‐integrated, surface, and vertically‐resolved distributions of aerosols and trace gases to improve the interpretation of satellite observations related to air quality. HSRL-1, deployed during the first DISCOVER-AQ mission over the Washington DC-Baltimore region, measured profiles of aerosol backscatter and depolarization (532, 1064 nm) and aerosol extinction and optical thickness (AOT) (532 nm). HSRL-2, the first airborne multiwavelength HSRL, was deployed for the following three DISCOVER-AQ missions over the California Central Valley, Houston, and Denver. HSRL-2 measures profiles of aerosol backscatter and depolarization (355, 532, 1064 nm) and aerosol extinction and AOT (355, 532 nm). Additional HSRL-2 data products include aerosol type, mixed layer depth, and range-resolved aerosol microphysical parameters. The HSRL measurements reveal the temporal, spatial, and vertical variability of aerosol optical properties over these locations. HSRL measurements show that surface PM2.5 concentrations were better correlated with near surface aerosol extinction than AOT scaled by the mixed layer height. During the missions over Washington DC-Baltimore, Houston, and Denver, only about 20-65% of AOT was within the mixed layer. In contrast, nearly all of the AOT was within the mixed layer over the California Central Valley. HSRL-2 retrievals of aerosol fine mode volume concentration and effective radius compare well with coincident airborne in situ measurements and vary with relative humidity. HSRL‑2 retrievals of aerosol fine mode volume concentration were also used to derive PM2.5 concentrations which compare well with surface PM2.5 measurements.",

We used ocean bottom pressure and velocity data from the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) state estimate run at Jet Propulsion Laboratory to quantify the percentage of total transport in various areas of the Southern Ocean that can be explained by ocean bottom pressure measurements. Only low-frequency (> 1-year) transport variations from 1993 to 2011 were considered. We examined the standard deviations, correlation, and percent variance for low-pass filtered transport integrated from 65°S – 40°S for each 1° longitude from 50°E to 150°E by vertically integrating the zonal velocity, the zonal component of the bottom current, and geostrophic current from bottom pressure gradients. We found that the transport computed from bottom pressure explained more of the full transport variability than that calculated from the bottom current.",

            "abstract": "Several models that include the paleogeographic positions of the North China Craton (NCC) in Precambrian supercontinents Nuna and Rodinia were tested in this study using Proterozoic global paleomagnetic database. During ca. 1.8 – 1.4 Ga, the NCC can be placed far from Laurentia and Baltica. In Nuna, the present southern margin of the NCC faced an open ocean, whilst its present northern margin was likely connected to Indian and Australian cratons. In Rodinia, however, during ca. 1.1 – 0.85 Ga, the paleomagnetic data indicate a proximate connection between the NCC and the arctic side of Laurentia. These two models, if both are right, suggest that the NCC may have moved a long distance since the departure from Nuna to the joining of Rodinia. Moreover, paleomagnetic data and our reconstructions require many cratons to drift away from their connections in Nuna after ca. 1.35 Ga. These reconstructions strongly challenges the currently influential speculation of limited breakup of Nuna, which is mainly based on the observation of low abundance of passive margins that were formed during the boring billion years (ca. 1.75 – 0.75 Ga).",

            "abstract": "We present optical visualization experiments of hydraulic fracture propagation within transparent rock-analogue samples containing a network of preexisting fractures. Natural fractures and heterogeneities in rock have a great impact on hydraulic fracture propagation and resulting improvements in reservoir permeability. In recent years, many sophisticated numerical simulations on hydraulic fracturing have been conducted. Laboratory experiments on hydraulic fracturing are often performed with acoustic emission (Micro Earthquake) monitoring, which allows detection and location of fracturing and fracture propagation. However, the detected fractures are not necessarily hydraulically produced fractures which provide permeable pathways connected to the injection (and production) well. The primary objectives of our visualization experiments are (1) to obtain quantitative visual information of hydraulic fracture propagation affected by pre-existing fractures and (2) to distinguish fractures activated by the perturbed stress field away from the injected fluid and hydraulically produced fractures. The obtained data are also used to develop and validate a new numerical modeling technique (TOUGH-RBSN [Rigid-Body-Spring-Network] model) for hydraulic fracturing simulations, which is presented in a companion paper. The experiments are conducted using transparent soda-lime glass cubes (10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm) containing either (1) 3D laser-engraved artificial fractures and fracture networks or (2) a random network of fractures produced by rapid thermal quenching. The strength (and also the permeability for the latter) of the fractures can be altered to examine their impact on hydraulic fracturing. The cubes are subjected to true-triaxial stress within a polyaxial loading frame, and hydraulic fractures are produced by injecting fluids with a range of viscosity into an analogue borehole drilled in the sample. The visual images of developing fractures are obtained both through a port hole on a side of the loading frame and via reflection in a diagonal mirror embedded in a transparent loading block.",

            "abstract": "Northern Tibetan Plateau is the headwater of the Yellow River, the Yangtze River and the Mekong River that support billions of the population. Vegetation change will affect the regional ecosystem and water balances through the changes in biomass and evapotranspiration. Dynamic vegetation growth is determined by physiological, morphological, bioclimatic and phenological properties. These properties are affected by climate variables such as air temperature, precipitation, soil temperature and concentration of CO2, etc. Due to climate change, some parts of the northern Tibetan Plateau are under the threat of desertification. Identifying the places of vegetation degradation and the dominant driven climatic factors will help mitigate the climate change impacts on ecosystem and water resources in this region. In this study, the changes of foliage projective coverages (FPCs) of various plant functional types (PFTs) existed in the northern Tibetan Plateau and the responses of FPCs to the four climate variables over 1957-2009 are examined. The dominant factors among the four climate variables are also identified. The Lund-Potsdam-Jena Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (LPJ-DGVM) is modified and used for the investigation. The modified LPJ-DGVM can better account for soil temperature in the top 0.4-m depth where vegetation root concentrates over the northern Tibetan Plateau. The modified model is evaluated by using monthly and annual soil temperature observed at stations across the region, and the eco-geographic maps that describe plant types and spatial distributions developed from field surveys and satellite images for this region.",

            "abstract": "Land-cover maps are important science products needed for natural resource and ecosystem service management, biodiversity conservation planning, and assessing human-induced and natural drivers of land change. Most land-cover maps at regional to global scales are produced with remote sensing techniques applied to multispectral satellite imagery with 30-500 m pixel sizes (e.g., Landsat, MODIS). Hyperspectral, or imaging spectrometer, imagery measuring the visible to shortwave infrared regions (VSWIR) of the spectrum have shown impressive capacity to map plant species and coarser land-cover associations, yet techniques have not been widely tested at regional and greater spatial scales.\nThe Hyperspectral Infrared Imager (HyspIRI) mission is a VSWIR hyperspectral and thermal satellite being considered for development by NASA. The goal of this study was to assess multi-temporal, HyspIRI-like satellite imagery for improved land cover mapping relative to multispectral satellites. We mapped FAO Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) classes over 22,500 km2 in the San Francisco Bay Area, California using 30-m HyspIRI, Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 imagery simulated from data acquired by NASA’s AVIRIS airborne sensor. Random Forests (RF) and Multiple-Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) classifiers were applied to the simulated images and accuracies were compared to those from real Landsat 8 images. The RF classifier was superior to MESMA, and multi-temporal data yielded higher accuracy than summer-only data. With RF, hyperspectral data had overall accuracy of 72.2% and 85.1% with full 20-class and reduced 12-class schemes, respectively. Multispectral imagery had lower accuracy. For example, simulated and real Landsat data had 7.5% and 4.6% lower accuracy than HyspIRI data with 12 classes, respectively. In summary, our results indicate increased mapping accuracy using HyspIRI multi-temporal imagery, particularly in discriminating different natural vegetation types, such as spectrally-mixed woodlands and forests.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Mayer AGU poster 2015 12 11.pdf\nOrganic matter amendments to soil are widely used as a method of enhancing nutrient availability for crops or grassland. Amendments such as composted manure or greenwaste also have the co-benefits of potentially increasing soil carbon (C) stocks (DeLonge et al., 2013) and diverting organic waste from landfills or manure lagoons. However, application of organic matter amendments can also stimulate emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). In this study we determined how the chemical quality of organic matter amendments affected soil C and N content and GHG emissions during early stage decomposition. California grassland soils were amended with six different amendments of varying C and N content including three composts and three feedstocks (goat and horse bedding and cattle manure). Amendments and soils were incubated in the laboratory for 7 weeks; GHG fluxes were measured weekly. The three feedstocks emitted significantly more GHGs than the composted materials. With the exception of cow manure, N content of the amendment was linearly correlated with global warming potential emitted (R2= 0.66, P <0.0001). C:N ratios were not a significant predictor of GHG emissions. Cow manure stimulated a net loss of C (or C equivalents) in the mineral soil, as expected. However, greenwaste compost also surprisingly resulted in net C losses, while goat bedding, horse bedding, and the other compost were either C neutral or a slight net C sink at the end of the incubation. Ongoing analyses are examining the fate of the C incorporated from the amendment to the soil as occluded or free light fraction, as well as N mineralization rates. Our data suggest that N content of organic matter amendments is a good predictor of initial GHG emissions. The study also indicates that composting greenwaste with N-rich bedding and manure can result in lower GHG emissions and C sequestration compared to the individual uncomposted components.",

The helioseismology data represent 3D flow maps in the depth range of 0-20 Mm, obtained uninterruptedly every 8 hours for almost the whole solar disk with the spatial sampling of two arcsec. We calculate the flow characteristics (such as divergence, vorticity and kinetic helicity) on different spatio-temporal scales from supergranulation to global-scale zonal and meridional flows. We investigate the multi-scale organization of the subsurface flows, including the inflows into active regions, the hemispheric `flip-flop’ asymmetry of variations of the meridional flows, the structure and dynamics of torsional oscillations, and compare the flow behavior with the evolution of the observed magnetic activity.",

            "abstract": "Radiotracers in the environment provide powerful tools for understanding environmental processes. Viewed as an age continuum, methods using shorter-lived radionuclides (<100 y) like 3H, 7Be, 85Kr, 134Cs, and 137Cs generally rely on measurements of radioactive decay in samples. Methods using longer-lived radionuclides (>1,000 y) like 10Be, 14C, 36Cl, and 81Kr generally rely on atom-counting measurements such as accelerator mass spectrometry. Significant challenges exist in the age range between 100 and 1,000 years where useful radiotracers are difficult to measure by either method and can have very low abundance. These challenges are being addressed with more sensitive measurements using both atom counting and radioactive decay, extending the reach of established radiotracers as well as adding new chronometers.\nImprovements in atom-counting methods will be reviewed; the practicality of using 81Kr (abundance ~5×10-13 in atmospheric krypton) for age-dating old aquifers has been established and current work focuses on improving sample utilization efficiency to allow smaller samples to be measured. Better efficiency also brings lower-abundance isotopes within reach, for example 39Ar.\nImprovements in radioactive decay counting will be reviewed; these take advantage of ultra-pure materials to achieve lower backgrounds and are adding new age-dating reach to the environmental science tool-set with intermediate half-life radionuclides, for example 32Si for sediment cores. These methods also improve sensitivity for established radiotracers like 3H and will allow smaller samples to be measured, allowing specific processes to be traced. For example, using 3H as an indicator of carbon cycling through organic compounds in soil systems.\nProgress in both atom counting and decay counting is expanding the use of 39Ar for age-dating aquifers, measuring ocean mixing, and age-dating younger glacial ice. Argon-39 is a challenging intermediate-age radiotracer (269-year half-life) with low abundance (~8×10-16 in atmospheric argon). New decay counting capabilities have expanded worldwide capacity for 39Ar aquifer measurements, while reduced ion backgrounds and increased efficiency have allowed atom-trap trace analysis to support ocean circulation studies in the Atlantic and dating of European glacial ice.",

            "abstract": "Magnetite occurs widely in natural environments in both inorganic and biogenic forms. Discrimination of the origin of magnetite in natural environments has important implications, from searching for past microbial activity to interpreting paleomagnetic and environmental magnetic records in a wide range of settings. In this study, we present detailed rock magnetic and electron microscopic results from marine sediment samples from the continental margin of Oman. Low-temperature magnetic measurements reveal two distinct Verwey transition temperatures (Tv) that are associated with the presence of biogenic and inorganic magnetite. This interpretation is consistent with room temperature magnetic properties and is confirmed by electron microscopic analyses. Our study justifies the use of two distinct Tv temperatures as a diagnostic magnetic signature for discriminating inorganic and biogenic magnetite. Simple low-temperature magnetic measurement (i.e., low-temperature warming of a saturation remanence after field cooling) provides a tool to recognize rapidly the origin of magnetite particles within natural samples. In addition, our analyses reveal progressive down-core dissolution of detrital and biogenic magnetite. We also observe preservation of significant amounts of fine-grained magnetite within sediments that have been subjected to severe diagenetic alteration, despite the expectation that small magnetite grains are prone to dissolution in anoxic marine environments. Preservation of magnetite in such environments is most likely due to protection of fine-grained magnetite inclusions by coarse-grained silicate host minerals.",

            "abstract": "The failure of coupled climate model ensembles to reproduce the increased Antarctic sea ice cover observed by satellites raises grave doubts about our ability to accurately predict the future of the Antarctic climate system. However, when the sea ice record is extended back in time using proxy reconstructions, the disagreement between models and observations is not so apparent. For much of the Southern Ocean, models and proxy reconstructions show an anthropogenic decrease in sea ice cover since the early 1960s, but the magnitude of the response that is small compared to the internal variability of the region. The exception is the Ross Sea, which is the region that explains much of the observed increase in total SIE. There is evidence that the Ross Sea increase also extends back to the 1960s, preceded by a sudden drop in ice cover over the 1950s. Previous work has shown that the different sectors respond to different forcing modes, and that the increased Ross SIE increase may be due to wind forcing. We show that the relationship between Ross SIE and the atmosphere is surprisingly well characterised in the models, and show that the role of direct wind forcing may have been overstated for the 1979-present period.",

Unlike normal distributions, non-normality implies the presence of higher order moments of the distribution that covary with mean and variance. Changes in extreme temperature events therefore cannot be attributed to changes in the mean or variance alone. To more completely characterize the observed changes in temperature distributions, we use quantile regression on long daily temperature records from the Global Historical Climatology Network Database. Quantile regression allows for the quantification of the manner in which distributions of temperature are changing as a function of time at percentiles that span the full distribution. Changes in both the upper and lower tails of the distribution are amplified relative to changes in the median. Spatial patterns of change are also identified using singular value decomposition, and the ability to predict regional variations in relation to the base distribution of temperature change is examined.",

            "abstract": "A multi-proxy speleothem study tracks the regional hydrological variability in Puerto Rico and highlights its close relation to the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Our proxy record extends instrumental observations 600 years into the past, and reveals the range of natural hydrologic variability for the region. A detailed interpretation and understanding of the speleothem climate record is achieved by the combination of multi-proxy measurements, thin section petrography, XRD analysis and cave monitoring results.\nThe speleothem was collected in Cueva Larga, a one mile-long cave system that has been monitored since 2012. MC-ICPMS 230Th/U-dating reveals that the speleothem grew constantly over the last 600 years. Trace element ratios (Sr/Ca and Mg/Ca) as well as stable isotope ratios (δ18O and δ13C) elucidate significant changes in atmospheric precipitation at the site.\nMonthly cave monitoring results demonstrate that the epikarst system responds to multi-annual changes in seepage water recharge. The drip water isotope and trace element composition lack short term or seasonal variability. This hydrological system creates favorable conditions to deduce decadal climate variability from Cueva Larga’s climate record. The speleothem time series mimics the most-recently published AMO reconstruction over the last 200 years with a time lag of 10-20 years. The time lag seems to results from slow atmospheric signal transmission through the epikarst but the effect of dating uncertainties cannot be ruled out. Warm SSTs in the North Atlantic are related to drier conditions in Puerto Rico. During times of decreased rainfall a relative increase in prior calcite precipitation seems to be the main process causing increased Mg/Ca trace element ratios. High trace element ratios correlate to higher δ13C values. The increase in both proxies indicates a shift towards time periods of decreased rainfall.\nOver the past 600 years there are two intervals of increased Mg/Ca and δ13C values lasting several decades in our speleothem record. They are centered around 1680 CE and 1470 CE. The elevated ratios indicate that drier conditions than present occurred in the region during periods of warm Atlantic surface waters. This may be a precursor of conditions now and to come.",

            "abstract": "Paleoseismic records are often considered incomplete due to the difficulty of detecting ruptures in trenches. Events become increasingly difficult to detect as slip decreases, large earthquakes may be missed if the rupture did not pass through the trench, and it is difficult to differentiate between events that occur very close in space and time. One might assume that these difficulties would result in missing or fewer events. Alternatively, misinterpretation of paleoseismic features could result in over-counting, which may be a more significant problem. We test the effects of different models of detectability in paleoseismic studies on the probabilities of large earthquakes in California. We employ the 3D boundary element code RSQSim with a new California fault model, based on the UCERF3 report, to generate synthetic catalogs with millions of events. The simulations incorporate rate-state fault constitutive properties, in complex, fully interacting fault systems. Our catalogs are tuned to match the recurrence intervals at the paleoseismic sites in the UCERF3 report by making adjustments to the normal stress in the model. We compare earthquake probabilities at paleoseismic sites using catalogs that were thinned, prior to tuning, based on different models of event detectability. The first catalog was tuned assuming 100% detectability. The second catalog was thinned using the UCERF3 [Appendix I] probability model of detection, which is based on amount of observed slip at each site. The third catalog was thinned based on a model of detectability that assumes fewer detectable events than given by the UCERF3 model. Finally, the fourth catalog was thinned based on the UCERF3 probability model, but tuned to 25% longer mean recurrence intervals. Comparisons of the different catalogs suggest that the mean recurrence intervals from paleoseismic trenches may be too short, resulting in over-estimation of probabilities.",

            "abstract": "With the object of constraining Iogenic contributions and identifying drivers for variability, we report new observations of neutral sodium in Europa’s exosphere. An R~20000 integral field spectrograph at McDonald Observatory is used to generate Doppler maps of sodium cloud structures with a resolution of 2.8 km/s/pixel. In the five nights of observations since 2011, measurements on UT 6.15-6.31 May 2015 uniquely feature fast (10s of km/s) neutral sodium clouds extending nearly 100 Europa radii, more distant than in any previous findings. During these measurements, the satellite geometry was favorable for the transfer of Na from Io to Europa, located at 1:55 to 4:00 and 3:38 to 4:39 Jovian local time, respectively. Eastward emission (away from Jupiter) extends 10-20 Europa radii retaining the moon’s rest velocity, while westward emission blue-shifts with distance, and a broad range of velocities are measured, reaching at least 70 km/s at 80 Europa radii. These cloud features are distinct from Io’s “banana” and “stream” features, the distant Jupiter-orbiting nebula, and from terrestrial OH and Na contaminant emissions. Io’s production was quiescent during this observation, following an extremely active phase in February 2015. These results are consistent with previous findings that Europa’s Na exosphere has peak emission between midnight and dawn Jovian local time and support the idea that sodium escape from Io can significantly enhance the emission intensity measured at Europa.",

We examine the evolution of this low-velocity, highly attenuating layer using data from the Cascadia Initiative’s Amphibious Array, which provides unprecedented coverage of an oceanic plate from ridge crest to trench to sub-arc. Our study extends the suite of measurements achievable with OBS data, augmenting traditional travel time analysis with integrated attenuation data that are a powerful tool for imaging melt/fluids and the variation of asthenospheric character with age.\nCooling models, coupled with experimentally-derived anelastic scaling relationships, indicate that thermal gradients should cause appreciable decrease in attenuation of teleseismic body waves with increasing age. This long-wavelength cooling trend may be perturbed by highly attenuating melt or volatiles concentrated at the ridge axis or beneath the Cascades arc, depending on melt fraction and pore geometry. Attenuation beyond the trench should be a strong function of the fate of asthenospheric entrainment beneath subducted plates, with implications for mass transfer to the deep mantle as well as recent models of sub-slab anisotropy.\nThe Amphibious Array, with <70 km spacing of OBS and on-land broadband seismometers deployed between 2011 and 2015, provides a dataset of ~1 x 105 arrivals from ~700 Mw>6.0 teleseismic earthquakes. We use a spectral ratio method to compute differential attenuation (Δt*) from body wave teleseisms recorded at OBS and land stations, allowing us to estimate path-integrated quality factor in the upper mantle. Preliminary results reveal variations of ~3 s in differential travel time and >0.5 s in ΔtS* across the 0-10 Ma oceanic plate, demonstrating the strong thermal control on anelasticity. Large values of Δt* observed east of the trench may indicate entrainment of highly attenuating asthenosphere during subduction, although more work is required to categorize and remove the signal of the overriding plate. This work complements previous studies using surface waves and contributes to our developing understanding of anelastic controls on seismic parameters by probing the Earth in a different frequency range.",

In spite of the significance of solar radiation in land surface processes, there have been surprisingly little efforts to develop high resolution solar radiation maps globally, which hindered scaling-up plot level intensive observations on the land surface processes into regional, continental, and global scales. Here, we report MODIS-derived solar radiation (Rg), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and diffuse PAR (dPAR) products over the global land between 2001 and 2014 at 5 km resolution with 4 day intervals. We used MODIS Atmosphere and Land products as inputs to an atmospheric radiative transfer model which computed Rg, PAR and dPAR under all sky conditions. We scaled up instantaneous estimates of the radiation components to the daily sum, and 4 daily mean sum estimates using a simple sinusoidal function. To evaluate Rg, PAR and dPAR products, we used ~80 station data collected in BSRN, FLUXNET and Ameriflux networks which cover a range of climatic zones from the arctic to tropical zones. The computed Rg, PAR, and dPAR products agreed well with in-situ observation data (R2~0.8, RMSE~30%, bias~10%). Based on these products, we show a range of additional products that include the ratio of diffuse PAR to total PAR, the ratio of PAR to total shortwave radiation, and the ratio of GPP to absorbed PAR. Finally, we demonstrate spatial and temporal patterns of Rg, PAR and dPAR over the global land between 2001 and 2014. We plan to open these products to public.",

            "abstract": "Observations of extreme solar energetic particle (SEP) events associated with coronal mass ejection driven shocks have detected particle energies up to a few GeV at 1 AU within the first ~10 minutes to 1 hour of shock acceleration. Whether or not acceleration by a single shock is sufficient in these events or if some combination of multiple shocks or solar flares is required is currently not well understood. Furthermore, the observed onset times of the extreme SEP events place the shock in the corona when the particles escape upstream. We have updated our focused transport theory model that has successfully been applied to the termination shock and traveling interplanetary shocks in the past to investigate extreme SEP acceleration in the solar corona. This model solves the time-dependent Focused Transport Equation including particle preheating due to the cross shock electric field and the divergence, adiabatic compression, and acceleration of the solar wind flow. Diffusive shock acceleration of SEPs is included via the first-order Fermi mechanism for parallel shocks. To investigate the effects of the solar corona on the acceleration of SEPs, we have included an empirical model for the plasma number density, temperature, and velocity. The shock acceleration process becomes highly time-dependent due to the rapid variation of these coronal properties with heliocentric distance. Additionally, particle interaction with MHD wave turbulence is modeled in terms of gyroresonant interactions with parallel propagating Alfven waves. However, previous modeling efforts suggest that the background amplitude of the solar wind turbulence is not sufficient to accelerate SEPs to extreme energies over the short time scales observed. To account for this, we have included the transport and self-consistent amplification of MHD waves by the SEPs through wave-particle gyroresonance. We will present the results of this extended model for a single fast quasi-parallel CME driven shock in the solar corona.",

            "abstract": "R\\\"{o}thlisberger channels are essential components of subglacial hydrologic systems. Deviations from the Nye creep closure of the ice around a R\\\"{o}thlisberger channel have been long recognized and enhancement factors or a more complex rheology for ice have been suggested as ameliorations to account for channels closing faster than predicted. Here we use the\nM\nintegral, a path-independent integral of the equations of continuum mechanics, with a Glen power-law rheology to unify descriptions of creep closure under a variety of stress states surrounding the R\\\"{o}thlisberger channel. The advantage of this approach is that the\nM\nintegral around the R\\\"{o}thlisberger channel is equivalent to the integral around the far field. In this way, the creep closure on the channel wall can be determined as a function of the far-field loading, e.g. antiplane shear as well as overburden pressure. We start by analyzing the case of axisymmetric creep closure and we see that the Nye solution is implied by the path-independence of\nM\nintegral. We then examine the effects of antiplane shear in several geometries and derive scalings for the creep closure rate based on the\nM\nintegral. The results are compared to observations for tunnel closure measurements in a variety of stress states and it is shown that the additional stress components can account for the deviations from the Nye solution. Furthermore, creep closure can be succinctly written in terms of the path-independent\nM\nintegral and the variation with applied shear can be found via scalings, which is useful for subglacial hydrology models.",

            "abstract": "The accurate retrieval of cloud properties such as cloud top height from satellite imagery is important for early warning of severe weather development and for reliable aviation weather forecasts. This paper describes a comparison between cloud top height products (Stereo-CTH), determined using an algorithm based on stereoscopy, and operational cloud top height products which are generated by using the Clouds from AVHRR Extended (CLAVR-x) cloud processing system. Both methods work with Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) data, and in limited cases, we also compare with data from CALIPSO. The Stereo-CTH algorithm is based on matching images of the same or similar spectral bands acquired quasi-simultaneously by satellites from two or three different vantage points. The CTH product generated by CLAVR-x is based on the Algorithm Working Group (AWG) Cloud Height Algorithm (ACHA) and uses only Infrared (IR) observations from a single sensor.\nThe Stereo-CTH algorithm was applied to GOES data when all three satellites (GOES 13-15) were operational at the same time allowing for the generation of a two-satellite CTH in areas of overlap between two satellites and a three-satellite CTH where geographic coverage is available for all three satellites. The comparison was applied to the three-satellite CTH, which is considered the best quality data.\nThe comparison between the two products displays an approximately linear relationship between the Stereo-CTH and the CLAVR-CTH for most of the data as shown in Figure 1. The observed differences are investigated and discussed.",

            "abstract": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) currently exerts the third largest climate forcing of the long-lived greenhouse gases, after CO2 and CH4. N2O is also involved in the destruction of stratospheric ozone. It is produced by microbial activity in soils and oceans, and also by industry. The atmospheric burden of N2O has increased more than 20% from its preindustrial level of ~270 nmol mol-1 (ppb). Much of this increase is related to the application of nitrogen-containing fertilizers, including manure. The NOAA Global Monitoring Division has measured the atmospheric mole fraction of N2O at Earth’s surface in air samples collected around the globe (since the late 1970s) and at in situ sites mostly in the Western Hemisphere (since 1998). ). Measurements of the global burden and growth rate constrain global emissions, e.g. 18.2 ± 2.7 Tg N yr-1 in 2013, where most of the uncertainty is related to uncertainty in the global lifetime. The average growth rate of N2O from 1990 to 2010 was ~0.75 ppb yr-1. Since 2004, however, the growth rate has been increasing, and is now about 25% higher than the 1990-2010 average. Between 2010 and 2013 the growth rate averaged ~0.95 ppb yr-1. As the growth rate increased from 2004-2013, gradients derived from surface, zonal-mean N2O mole fraction, such the mean pole-to-pole difference, and the difference between NH temperate latitudes and the southern polar region, decreased. This suggests a change in the distribution of N2O emissions over this period. We will present our N2O data and examine trends, gradients, and other features that could shed light on recent changes in the growth rate. We will also compare N2O gradients to those of other trace gases, such as SF6.",

Due to land surface rugged geometric structure and different components, pixels in the remote sensing image measured from space are often non-isothermal. Several approaches of decomposing temperatures have been developed recent years. These approaches only focus on two components, soil and leaf. In fact ground-based measurements indicate temperatures of sunlit and shaded leaf are nearly the same while temperatures of sunlit and shaded soil are different significantly. In order to retrieve three component temperatures including leaf, sunlit soil and shaded soil, an analytical parameterized model named FR97 was modified in this paper. The modified FR97 model was calibrated by 4SAIL (Scattering by Arbitrarily Inclined Leaves) model. Bayesian algorithm was used to solve the inversion problem. Finally the inversion algorithm was verified by the airborne observed datasets of Wide-angle Infrared Dual mode line / area Array Scanner (WIDAS) over dense maize area during the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) campaign. The results indicate that the modified FR97 model improves a lot for hotspot effect than original FR97 model. And more accurate component temperatures were retrieved especially for sunlit soil component (RMSE = 1.378°C). ",

One relatively unexplored topic has been the effect of dynamically generated coherent structures on the diffusion coefficient. On the other hand, recent simulations and observations evidence that intermittency and the presence of coherent structures such as current sheets are the norm in space and astrophysical plasmas. Previous works have utilized the synthetic realization of data that typically has a Gaussian probability density function of magnetic field increments and currents. The fields generated this way do not take into account the effects of intermittency and coherent structures on the diffusion coefficient, and thus the potential influence of structures on diffusion has not been properly assessed. In this study we employ fields generated from dynamical simulations of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence and reduced magnetohydrodynamic, as well as a scheme for generating synthetic intermittency, to examine the effects of spatial structures and intermittency on the diffusion of charged particles.",

            "abstract": "The development of conceptual models for solute migration in discrete fracture networks has typically been based on a combination of core logs, borehole geophysics, and some form of single-well hydraulic test using discrete zones. More rarely, interwell hydraulic tests and interwell tracer experiments are utilised to directly explore potential transport pathways. The latter methods are less widely employed simply due to potentially significant increases in the cost and effort in site characterization. To date however there is a paucity of literature comparing the efficacy of the standard procedure with what should be more definitive identification of transport pathways using interwell methods. In the present study, a detailed comparison is conducted by developing conceptual models from three separate data sets, the first based on core logs, geology and single-well hydraulic tests, the second based on a large suite of pulse interference tests, and the third based on a series of radially-divergent and injection-withdrawal tracer experiments. The study was conducted in an array of five HQ-sized wells, 28-32 m in depth and arranged in a five star pattern, 10 m on a side. The wells penetrate the contact between a Cambrian-aged limestone, and underlying Precambrian gneiss. The core was logged for potentially open fractures using a ranking system, and 87 contiguous hydraulic tests were conducted using a 0.85-m packer spacing. A total of 57 pulse interference tests were conducted using two wells as injection points, and 11 tracer experiments were conducted using either sample collection or in-situ detection via a submersible fluorometer. The results showed very distinct conceptual models depending on the data set, with the model based on the single-well testing significantly over-predicting the number and connection of solute transport pathways. The results of the pulse interference tests also over predict the transport pathways, but to a lesser degree. Quantification of the pore volume using the various data sets was also undertaken and shows agreement with the general observations.",

In this study, an integrated approach is adopted to accomplish the following: (1) map the spatial distribution of areas that are witnessing land subsidence, (2) quantify the rates of land subsidence, and (3) identify the factors causing the observed subsidence. A three-fold approach is applied: (1) use of interferometric techniques to assess the spatial distribution of land subsidence and to quantify the rates of subsidence, (2) generate a GIS database to encompass all relevant data and derived products, and (3) correlate findings from the radar exercise with relevant spatial and temporal datasets (e.g., remote sensing, geology, fluid extraction rates, distribution of urban areas, etc.). Three main areas were selected: (1) central and northern parts of the KSA, (2) areas surrounding the Ghawar oil/gas field, and (3) the Harrat Lunayyir volcanic field. Applications of two-pass, three-pass, and SBAS radar interferometric techniques over central KSA revealed the following: (1) subsidence rates of up to -15 mm/yr were detected; the spatial distribution of the subsided areas that were extracted using the various interferometric techniques are similar, (2) subsided areas correlated spatially with the distribution of: (a) areas with high groundwater extraction rates as evidenced from the analysis of field and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data, (b) agricultural plantations as evidenced from the analysis of field and temporal Landsat data, (c) urban areas (e.g., Buraydah City), (d) outcrops of carbonates and anhydrite formations (e.g., Khuff and Jilh formations), (3) subsidence could be related to more than one parameter.

The model includes seismicity in non-overlapping areas and comprehensively explains the seismicity on the basis of point process models, which include the stationary Poisson model, the aftershock decay model following Omori-Utsu's law, and/or the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model. By use of this model, we examine the possibility of remote triggering of the 2011 M6.4 eastern Shizuoka earthquake in the vicinity of Mt. Fuji that occurred 4 days after the Mw9.0 Tohoku-Oki earthquake and 4 minutes after the M6.2 off-Fukushima earthquake that located about 400 km away, and that of the 2014 Mw7.9 Rat Islands earthquake that occurred within one hour after the Mw6.7 Kermadec earthquake that located about 9,000 km away and followed two large (Mw6.9, 6.5) earthquakes in the region. Both target earthquakes occurred during the passage of surface waves propagating from the previous large events. We estimated probability that the time interval is shorter than that between consecutive events and obtained dynamic stress changes on the faults. The results indicate that the M6.4 eastern Shizuoka event may be rather triggered by the static stress changes from the Tohoku-Oki earthquake and that the Mw7.9 Rat Islands event may have been remotely triggered by the Kermadec events possibly via cyclic fatigue.",

            "abstract": "Fallout radionuclide ratios, such as the ratio of Beryllium-7 to Lead-210 (7Be/210Pb), are used to determine the age of suspended sediment or fraction of “new” sediment in suspension. In the application of these models new suspended sediment is often assumed to originate from recent landscape surface erosion that is delivered to the stream network. Fallout radionuclide deposition can vary across watersheds and on an event basis in a single watershed due to factors such as storm type, atmospheric height, and storm origin. In the White Clay Creek watershed within the mid-Atlantic USA, single-event deposition of 7Be varies from 15 – 177 Bq m-2 and 210Pb varies from 0 – 10 Bq m-2. 7Be/210Pb ratios vary from 7.9 to 20 in event precipitation and from 0.8 to 12.8 on suspended sediment. “New” sediment varies from 4 – 71% over the course of these events. A computation of the 7Be mass balance during events shows that the majority of 7Be is retained within the catchment. During summer thunderstorms, less than 1% of 7Be deposited on the watershed exits in the stream channel during that event. Therefore, the entirety of the 7Be exiting the watershed on suspended sediment is less than the total activity deposited on the channel in direct precipitation. We attribute this to the new tagging of subaerial fluvial deposits with event precipitation; hence “new” suspended sediment originates from within the channel rather than from surface erosion. During extreme events, such as Hurricane Irene, less of the suspended sediment has been newly tagged by precipitation (4 – 28%) and a larger proportion (3-4%) of the 7Be deposited on the watershed exits during the event. Ongoing work in the Difficult Run watershed in northern Virginia will test the regional applicability of these findings. Water quality efforts to determine the source of sediment using fallout radionuclides must consider the stream channel as well as landscape sources of “new” sediments, particularly during summer thunderstorms in watersheds with subaerial but not fully submerged fluvial deposits.",

            "abstract": "The extent of the Solar Wind influence on Jupiter’s X-ray aurora is yet to be understood. To probe this relationship, we compare two Chandra X-ray observations of Jupiter: one coinciding with the predicted arrival of an Interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME) and another observation two days later. During the observation coincident with the ICME, we observe a bright auroral enhancement of a factor of 8 in a region normally absent of X-rays. This enhancement occurs ~1 hour before a burst of non-Io Decametric radio emission, believed to be associated with solar wind forward shocks [Hess et al. 2012, 2014]. We also find variation in X-ray auroral periodic behaviour, spatial and spectral distributions.\nWe use magnetosphere-ionosphere mapping [Vogt et al. 2011] to identify the source of ions generating the X-rays and find that they originate from 10:30-18:00 magnetospheric local time (MLT) in regions of the outer magnetosphere close to the magnetopause. The model also maps some precipitation to open field lines. This suggests that X-rays may provide an excellent tool for analysing the Jovian outer magnetosphere and the processes occurring between the Jovian magnetopause and the solar wind.\nAs discovered by Gladstone et al. [2002] discovery, we find an X-ray hot spot that pulses with quasi-periodicity. Measurements of this periodicity suggest 2 distinct ion populations generate the Jovian X-ray aurora: a sulphur/carbon dominated population from the middle to outer magnetosphere with a period of 26 minutes, and a combined oxygen and carbon/sulphur population from close to the magnetopause with a period of 12 minutes. The source region and periodicity support findings by Bunce et al. [2004] that pulsed dayside reconnection could energise the outer magnetosphere and drive X-ray emission\nTo better understand the persistence of these features and/or their relationship to the ICME, we compare these 2011 observations with preliminary analysis of Chandra X-ray observations of Jupiter from 2007. At this time, New Horizons was approaching the planet. We hope that this will provide a useful analogy for the Spring 2016 Juno approach.",

This study expands from previous studies quantifying river suspended sediment and particulate organic carbon loads in the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory, in Puerto Rico. We evaluate the influences on river suspended load due to i) underlying basin geology, ii) hillslope debris and biomass supply, and iii) hurricanes and large storms. In the Mameyes and Icacos catchments of the Luquillo Mountains, we estimate suspended sediment and particulate organic carbon yields over a 25-year period using streamflow discharge determined from stage measurements at 15-intervals, with estimates of discharge replacing gaps in data, and over 3000 suspended sediment samples. We estimate variation in suspended sediment loads over time, and examine variation in particulate organic carbon loads. Mass spectrometry was used to determine organic carbon concentrations. We confirm that higher suspended sediment fluxes occurred i) in the highly weathered quartz diorite catchment rather than the predominantly volcaniclastic catchment, ii) on the rising limb of the hydrograph once a threshold discharge had been reached, and iii) during hurricanes and other storm events, and we explore these influences on particulate organic carbon transport. Transport of suspended sediment and particulate organic carbon in the rivers shows considerable hysteresis, and we evaluate the extent to which hysteresis affects particulate fluxes over time and between catchments. Because particulate organic carbon is derived from the critical zone and transported during high flow, our research highlights the role of major tropical storms in controlling carbon storage in the critical zone and the coastal ocean.",

            "abstract": "Natural disturbances and land management directly change C stored in biomass and soil pools, and can have indirect impacts on long-term C balance. The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), located in Central Rocky Mountains of United States, is of different land ownerships within similar environmental settings, making it an ideal site to examine the impacts of management and disturbances on regional carbon dynamics. Recent advances in the remote sensing of vegetation condition and change, along with new techniques linking remote sensing with inventory records, have allowed investigations that are much more tightly constrained to actual landscape environment, instead of hypothetical or generalized conditions. These new capabilities are built into the Forest Carbon Management Framework (ForCaMF), which is being used by the National Forest System to not only model, but to monitor across very specific management units, the impact of different kinds of disturbance on carbon storage.\nIn this study, we used the ForCaMF approach to evaluate carbon effects of natural disturbances (e.g. wildfire) and land management (e.g. harvests) in GYE National Parks, Wilderness Area and National Forests. As might be expected, wildfire has been the dominant disturbance factor in the carbon cycle of GYE’s administratively protected areas since the mid-1980s, while harvests have dominated storage trends on the managed land in the region’s National Forests. Moving beyond this monitoring result but maintaining the same fidelity to historical vegetation patterns, we are also able to simulate alternative disturbance scenarios to provide landscape-specific insights to forest managers. We can estimate likely carbon storage impacts in GYE protected areas, for example, if more active fire suppression had been pursued since the mid-1980s. Likewise, we can identify differences in current carbon storage on managed lands if high harvest rates during the same period had been moderated. We discuss emerging links between carbon storage and management in GYE, and we consider the potential for expanding this kind of analysis using globally available satellite resources and nationally available inventory data.",

            "abstract": "Methane (CH4) is the second most important greenhouse gas and a target of new emissions regulations in the United States. Despite its importance, there are large uncertainties in its emissions. In the megacity of Los Angeles, anthropogenic CH4 is emitted from a variety of sources including wastewater treatment plants, landfills, oil wells, dairy farms and the natural gas infrastructure. To quantify the methane budget in the basin, it is necessary to understand the spatial and temporal variability of the emission patterns. To address this issue, since 2011, continuous daytime mountaintop remote sensing measurements of CH4 and CO2 have been acquired by a JPL-built Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) at the California Laboratory of Atmospheric Remote Sensing (CLARS) on Mount Wilson. At an altitude of 1.67 km a.s.l., the CLARS-FTS samples the dry-air slant column abundances of CH4 and CO2 (XCH4 and XCO2) by targeting 29 reflection points in the L.A. basin, including a reference point at the observatory.\nUsing this unique dataset and tracer-to-tracer correlation analysis, we derive the monthly trends of top-down methane emissions over a period of nearly four years from 2011 to 2015. Consistent strong emission peaks in winter and weaker peaks in summer were observed during this period. We compare our top-down emissions and bottom-up emissions database to understand the drivers of the observed CH4 monthly emission patterns in the basin.\nCopyright 2015.

These seismic data have been used to measure shear-wave splitting in infer anisotropy within and beneath the Arabian plate. We selected for analysis more than 300 teleseismic recordings between January, 2008 and February, 2015. Individual seismometers located on the crystalline rock of the Arabian shield provide 20 to 30 shear-wave splitting results, whereas seismometers located on volcanic rocks provide 2 to 14 reliable measurements. Here we summarize results obtained from the Tertiary volcanic fields (“harrats”) of western Saudi Arabia, in particular Harrat Lunayyir and Harrat Rahat. Both of these volcanic fields have been active in historic times. Eighteen seismic stations with an average inter-station spacing of 10 km are located within Harrat Lunayyir. Seismic stations there have consistent shear-wave splitting directions ranging from N2°E to N20°W and delay times from 0.7 s to 1.6 s. This volcanic field is of particular interest because in 2009 it experienced abundant seismic activity and measureable crustal deformation that was associated with a dike intrusion into the upper crust (Pallister et al., 2010, Nature Geoscience). However, our analysis does not reveal any anomalous splitting results beneath this harrat. Fifteen seismic stations with an average inter-station spacing of 30 km are located in or adjacent to Harrat Rahat. These show very similar splitting directions to Harrat Lunayyir, ranging from N1°W to N16°W, with delay times of 1.0 s to 1.4 s. Following previous studies, we assume that these delay times are dominantly due to mantle anisotropy, with crustal anisotropy being secondary. Our results indicate a highly uniform fast-direction of anisotropy oriented approximately N10°W beneath these two volcanic fields. The measured orientation is inconsistent with the N40°E absolute plate motion of Arabia, but is consistent with the northward asthenospheric flow originating at the Afar hot spot (Camp and Roobol, 1991). We conclude that Harrat Lunayyir and Harrat Rahat are underlain by asthenosphere with a uniform N10°W flow direction.",

The FAGE (Fluorescence Assay by Gaseous Expansion) apparatus designed for HOx measurements in the Highly Instrumented Reactor for Atmospheric Chemistry (HIRAC) has been calibrated using the conventional method over a range of internal cell pressures (1.8 – 3.8 mbar) and external cell temperatures (270 – 340 K). Two alternative calibration techniques for OH and HO2 were developed using the HIRAC chamber over the same pressure and temperature range to verify the observations. The alternative methods, agreement and disagreement with the conventional calibration methods will be discussed. The outcome of these studies will enable future operation of the FAGE instrument in the HIRAC chamber away from STP conditions.",

We study the counter flow patterns in a wide range of latitudes, focusing on the relationship between the flow directions and the magnetic polarities. We show that the change in the direction of these flows may mark the end of the solar minima and may indicate the start of the next cycle.

            "abstract": "Aso volcano has the largest caldera (18 x 25 km in diameter) in the SW Japan Island Arc, and it formed as the result of four large (VEI=6-7) pyroclastic-eruption cycles. We study the penultimate large eruption cycle, the Aso-3 cycle, which occurred 123 ka with an ejecta volume of more than 150 km3. The processes in the pre-eruptive magma chamber and the magma genesis of the Aso-3 cycle were inferred from geological, petrological, and geochemical data. The geological and petrological data indicate that the pre-eruptive magma chamber was stratified compositionally into three layers: from top to bottom, silicic, intermediate, and mafic magma layers. The three magma layers had a uniform isotope composition, suggesting that all the magmas were generated from a single source. The silicic and intermediate magmas were not generated from the mafic magma by fractional crystallization. The silicic magma has higher Ni content than the mafic magma. This suggests that these magmas were produced by partial melting of the same mafic crust but with differing amounts of partial melting: the silicic magma was produced by a low degree of partial melting of the source rock without fractional crystallization, and the mafic magma was produced by a large degree of partial melting followed by fractional crystallization. The intermediate magma compositions plot on the tie line between the silicic magma and the melt of the mafic magma in variation diagrams, and the intermediate magma has phenocrysts whose compositions are identical with those in the silicic magma. This observation indicates that, before the Aso-3 eruption cycle, a two-layer stratified magma chamber of the silicic and mafic magmas was formed as a result of melting of the mafic crust, which was followed by formation of the intermediate layer as a result of interfacial mixing between the silicic magma and the melt of mafic magma. During the eruption the three-layer stratified magma chamber was tapped from the top to the bottom.",

            "abstract": "Our prior work (Sailor et al., 2015) showed that the Panama Canal locking operations impart a peak vertical acceleration of about 60 mGal (6 x 10-4 m/sec2) to ships as the individual lock chambers are filled or emptied. During a period of 8 to 12 minutes the ship’s elevation changes by over 8 meters. This motion is very repeatable, since it is driven by gravity-fed hydraulics backed up by a huge mass of water. The novelty of the prior work was to demonstrate that the lock-driven vertical acceleration is significant, of relatively long duration, easily observed by the BGM-3 accelerometer/gravimeter, and is equivalent tothe gravity anomaly caused by a moderately-sized seamount. Thus, the lock-induced vertical acceleration is a known external acceleration input that falls within the amplitude and time duration band of interest for marine gravity as well as airborne gravity survey systems.\nHere we report an extension to the prior work, using BGM-3 gravimeter data from the RV Marcus G Langseth and the RV Melville, in addition to the previously-used two datasets from the RV Knorr. The new analysis allows us to compare the quality of the gravity data from these three ships in two ways, using: 1) Differences along nearly perfectly coincident gravity anomaly data profiles collected underway, during passage through calm and narrow channels with little or no vertical ship motion; and 2) Observed vertical-motion-induced accelerations, with no horizontal motion, experienced during lock operations. We use the raw 1-Hz output of the BGM-3 gravimeter and compare various filtering methods. Furthermore, good quality vertical channel GPS is used to compare to the output of our solution of a boundary value problem: Given the observed outputs of the gravimeter, solve for h(t), the elevation of the ship vs time and also for two parameters: initial gravity value prior to vertical motion in the lock and apparent vertical gravity gradient.",

            "abstract": "The audiomagnetotelluric (AMT) method is capable of providing direct evidence of a geothermal resource within the extinct Waiʻanae volcano, Oʻahu, Hawaiʻi. Geothermal systems are becoming an increasingly important energy source worldwide. With electric energy costs in Hawaiʻi the most expensive in the US (30.54 cents/kWh), it is important to investigate the potential of local geothermal resources. Slightly elevated temperature and chloride concentrations, measured in the 1970’s at wells in the upper Lualualei Valley indicate the possibility of a geothermal resource. Previous geophysical investigations: self-potential, rotating quadripole resistivity, and shallow soil temperature surveys in the caldera measured low resistivity values. Resistivity is related to rock characteristics (e.g., porosity, saturation, salinity, temperature, chemistry, and the presence of weathered minerals). We are investigating the area further using the AMT method. We have collected profiles of AMT measurements across the Lualualei Valley and the Waiʻanae caldera boundary. Anthropogenic noise and access in this area is problematic. Electrical noise, originating from power lines along roads and very low frequency radio towers in the vicinity, add noise to the data. Limited access to sites on military lands inhibit data collection. However, preliminary results show that we have successfully imaged the expected higher resistivity values as our profiles cross the mountains bounding the caldera. As data continue to be collected across the Waiʻanae Caldera and Range and we begin modeling our data in two dimensions, we expect to be able to identify water table elevations, detect lateral variability between salt and fresh water saturation, estimate thickness of the freshwater lens and depth to the transition zone, image fault structures at the caldera boundary, and with enough sensitivity to conductivity, we can identify regions of elevated temperature.",

During the earthquake, at least 5 people killed, 65 injured, lots of homes were collapsed and thousands people displaced. Ending the history that no large earthquake occurs at Xianshuihe fault zone for nearly 30 years, this moderate earthquake arouses the highly attention of many seismologists, not only for the serious disaster, but also for the potential seismic risk in and surrounding the epicenter.\nIn order to better understand the seismogenic structure and the seismic risk of the source region, we collect teleseismic waveforms from IRIS and broadband seismograms from seismograph network in Yunnan and its surrounding provinces, and apply CAP method to grid search the focal mechanism and centroid depth of the earthquake. And the rupture process of this event is investigated based on finite fault inversion method. After that, we calculate stress influences on Kangding earthquake from the Wenchuan and Lushan earthquake, and study the stress changes on Xianshuihe Fault caused by the Kanding earthquake to assess the future seismic hazard.\nThe result shows that the epicenter of Kangding earthquake is 101.689°E and 30.262°N, with a focal depth of 9 km and magnitude of about Mw6.0. The two nodal planes of focal mechanism are 235°/82°/-173° and 144°/83°/-8°. Considering the tectonic background, the latter nodal plane is adopted as the parameters of receiver fault while calculating the stress changes on the hypocenter of Kangding earthquake. the major slip is located around the hypocenter, spanning ~8 km along dip and ~10 km along strike with a maximum slip of 0.5 m. The stress accumulation on the Kangding-Daofu segment, surrounding to the epicenter of the 2014 Kangding earthquake, is increased by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake but the influences from the 2013 Lushan earthquake is very weak, which can be ignored. And the stress changes caused by the Kanding earthquake increase the stress accumulations on northwest section of Kangding-daofu segment, which will raise the future seismic hazard.",

            "abstract": "Episodic tremor and slip (ETS) is found in various subduction zones. We have modeled slip of subducting plate interface including the ETS region in Shikoku, and successfully reproduced the characteristics of the segments and recurrences of ETS (Matsuzawa et al., 2013). However, it is important to examine whether our model can explain the characteristics of ETS in the other region. We have tentatively applied our model to the ETS in Cascadia. In our numerical model, a rate- and state- dependent friction law (RS-law) with a cutoff velocity is adopted, as in our previous studies. Low effective normal stress and a low cutoff velocity are assumed at the depth where ETS occur. Negative and positive (a-b) value in the RS-law is assumed within and outside of the ETS region, respectively. In this study, the ETS region is based on the actual distribution of tremor which is located by the monitoring system of Wech (2010). We assume that frictional parameters have similar depth-dependence to our previous study (Matsuzawa et al., 2013). Subducting plate interface is modeled by 203,064 triangular elements, based on the configuration in McCrory et al. (2004). In our numerical result, SSEs recur at the intervals of about 1 year. In addition, SSEs are relatively active between the south of Vancouver Island and the Olympic Peninsula. These characteristics are similar to observations (e.g. Brudzinski and Allen, 2007). Minor ETS activities at the down-dip portion occur between the major ETS activities both in the up-dip and down-dip portion. This feature is similar to the actual ETS in Cascadia (Wech and Creager, 2011). In addition, long-term SSEs recur between the ETS region and shallow locked region where large earthquakes are expected. These long-term SSEs are frequently found around the region with curved plate interface, and may be characterized by the configuration of the plate as in Shikoku (Matsuzawa et al., 2013).",

            "abstract": "Eastern Nevada lay east of the Cordilleran continental divide and experienced continental drainage ponding during the Eocene Epoch. Though recognized for nearly a century, lake deposits of the Elko Formation have yet to be placed in a regional chronostratigraphic context, due primarily to Neogene extension and a paucity of radioisotopic ages. New geochronology is essential for creating robust reconstructions of paleogeography and paloeohydrology from scattered surviving outcrops, and for assessing competing tectonic interpretations for lake basin formation and evolution.\nNew single crystal sanidine 40Ar/39Ar ages for 21 ash beds collected from the Elko Formation and contemporaneous fluvial deposits indicate that lacustrine deposition occurred locally as early as ca. 48.7 Ma, coeval with deposition of the Bridgerian portion of the lacustrine Sheep Pass Formation to the south. Lake Elko’s most expansive phase occurred between ca. 44.0 and 40.5 Ma, resulting in regional overlap of lacustrine strata atop fluvial strata. Based on lithofacies and lithofacies stacking patterns, an up-section transition from overfilled to balanced-fill conditions occurred at ca. 41.3 Ma. This transition led to increasing salinity and lake level variations that formed a prominent 1-4 meter-scale depositional cyclicity characteristic of partly closed lakes that periodically dropped below their sill elevation. The stromatolitic uppermost Elko Formation records proximal volcanism, including several welded ignimbrites, and is overlain by an unconformity of >10 m.y. duration. Initial ponding, the shift to balanced fill conditions, voluminous siliceous volcanism, and subsequent unconformity are interpreted to reflect the progressive NE to SW advance of 500-900 m of topographic uplift and volcanism resulting from rollback of the Farallon slab.\n40Ar/39Ar ages for ash beds at five individual locations suggest that a single ignimbrite, likely the Tuff of Nelson Creek, was deposited across a ~10,000 km2 area of NE NV at 40.45 ± 0.08 Ma, near the end of Elko Formation accumulation. Within this bed, the hydrogen isotope composition of glass hydration waters vary systematically according to paleo-landscape position, recording a 102 ± 20‰ increase in δD values for glasses deposited in lacustrine versus fluvial environments.",

Large and often emergent trees store disproportionately large amounts of aboveground carbon and greatly influence the structure and functioning of tropical rainforests. Despite their importance, controls on the abundance and distribution of emergent trees are largely unknown across tropical landscapes. Conventional field approaches are limited in their ability to characterize patterns in emergent trees across vast landscapes with varying environmental conditions and floristic composition. Here we used a high-resolution light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor, aboard the Carnegie Airborne Observatory Airborne Taxonomic Mapping System (CAO-AToMS), to examine the abundance and distribution of tall emergent tree canopies (ETC) relative to surrounding tree canopies (STC), across the Osa Peninsula, a geologically and topographically diverse region of Costa Rica. The abundance of ETC was clearly influenced by fine-scale topographic variation, with distribution patterns that held across a variety of geologic substrates. Specifically, the density of ETC was much greater on lower slopes and in valleys, compared to upper slopes and ridges. Furthermore, using the CAO high-fidelity imaging spectrometer, ETC had a different spectral signature than that of the STC. Most notably, ETC had lower foliar N than STC, which was verified with an independent field survey of canopy leaf chemistry. The underlying mechanisms to explain the topographic-dependence of ETCs and linkages to canopy N are unknown, and remain an important area of research.",

An important component of invertebrate dispersal and colonization to new areas is the ability to be entrained into the atmosphere.

We have shown previously that aquatic invertebrates can be dispersed long distances in dust storms but the extent of transport of taxa based on diapausing egg size/morphology has not been investigated. Here, we control the wind erosion process in a wind tunnel to test entrainment of diapausing stages of brine shrimp, clam shrimp, tadpole shrimp, fairy shrimp, Daphnia, and the rotifers Brachionus plicatilis and B. calyciflorus into the air by saltation. Diapausing eggs were mixed with sterilized wind-erodible soil. The soil/egg mixture was moistened with distilled water and air dried to form a crust. Dust was generated in a wind tunnel by releasing sand grains that act as saltator material similar to wind-entrained natural sands. Maximum wind velocity was 10m/s and entrained particles were sampled through an isokinetic horizontal intake opening. Aeolian sediment was collected from three points in the system; transfer section for coarse sediment, the pan subtending a settling chamber for finer saltation-sized sediment, and two paper filters for suspension-sized sediment. Samples were then passed through 250 and 350 µm sieves to remove abrader sand and rehydrated with various sterile media depending on the type of organism. We retrieved viable brine, fairy, and tadpole shrimp, ostracods, Daphnia, and diapausing eggs of the rotifers after hydration. This experiment demonstrates that resting stages of many invertebrates can be wind-eroded due to size and egg morphology and remain viable under controlled conditions mimicking dust emission.",

            "abstract": "On average, there are over 5.8 M vehicle crashes each year of which 23% are weather-related. Weather-related crashes are defined as those crashes that occur in adverse weather or on slick pavement. The vast majority of weather-related crashes happen on wet pavement (74%) and during rainfall (46%). Connected vehicle technologies hold the promise to transform road-weather management by providing improved road weather data in real time with greater temporal and geographic accuracy. This will dramatically expand the amount of data that can be used to assess, forecast, and address the impacts that weather has on roads, vehicles, and travelers. The use of vehicle-based measurements of the road and surrounding atmosphere with other, more traditional weather data sources, and create road and atmospheric hazard products for a variety of users. The broad availability of road weather data from mobile sources will vastly improve the ability to detect and forecast weather and road conditions, and will provide the capability to manage road-weather response on specific roadway links. The RWMP is currently demonstrating how weather, road conditions, and related vehicle data can be used for decision making through an innovative Integrated Mobile Observations project. FHWA is partnering with 3 DOTs (MN, MI, & NV) to pilot these applications. One is a mobile alerts application called the Motorists Advisories and Warnings (MAW) and a maintenance decision support application. These applications blend traditional weather information (e.g., radar, surface stations) with mobile vehicle data (e.g., temperature, brake status, wiper status) to determine current weather conditions. These weather conditions, and other road-travel-relevant information, are provided to users via web and phone applications. The MAW provides nowcasts and short-term forecasts out to 24 hours while the EMDSS application can provide forecasts up to 72 hours in advance. The three DOTs have placed readers and external road weather sensors on their maintenance fleet vehicles to collect vehicular and meteorological data. Data from all three states is sent to a processing system called the Pikalert® Vehicle Data Translator (VDT) that quality checks and uses the data to infer current and forecasted weather conditions.",

            "abstract": "The relation between constituent concentrations and stream discharge (C/Q relations) are fundamental to the estimation of fluxes or loads in biogeochemical studies. C/Q relations are useful for understanding nutrient, trace element, and contaminant behavior in response to storm and snowmelt related changes in discharge. The shape and seasonal variation of C/Q relations provides information about availability, mobilization, and release of solutes to streams. The properties of C/Q relations can allude to flowpaths, antecedent moisture conditions, and solute availability. Changes in C/Q relations over time for certain constituents like dissolved organic carbon (DOC) may be indicative of changes in supply that may have resulted from changes in climate, vegetation, or land use and land cover. The focus of this presentation is on a simple method for detection of change in C/Q relations using the LOADEST regression model. The LOADEST model fits a seasonally variable C/Q relation to discrete water quality data. For a continuously gauged stream or river, a relatively long record of C/Q data can be partitioned into distinct periods and regression models can be determined for each period. By running each model with the same discharge record and subsequently plotting each flux time series, differences between models can be visualized graphically. Plotting differences between periods (models) illustrates at what times of year the differences are largest. Running each model with a range of discharges for each day of the year provides additional insight into whether the changes in C/Q relations are evident at all levels of discharge or only at specific levels of discharge. The DOC record (1991 to 2014) from a research watershed at Sleepers River in Vermont was used in this analysis. The analysis showed that there have been increases in DOC concentration for certain seasons and rates of discharge.",

Actionable knowledge for specific applications may be realized when we can determine the margins of user requirements for data products and access. The SWOT Applications team will be launching a SWOT Early Adopters program and are interested in identifying a broad community of users who will participate in pre-launch applications activities including meetings, briefings, and workshops.\nThe SWOT applications program is designed to connect mission scientists to end users and leverage the scientific research and data management tools with operational decision-making for different thematic users and data requirements. SWOT is scheduled to launch in 2020, so simulated hydrology and ocean data sets have been and will continued to be developed by science team members and the SWOT Project in order to determine how the data will represent the physical Earth systems targeted by the mission.\nSWOT will produce the first global survey of Earth's surface water by measuring sea surface height and the heights, slopes, and inundated areas of rivers, lakes, and wetlands. These coastal, lake and river measurements will be used for monitoring the hydrologic cycle, flooding, and climate impacts of a changing environment. The oceanographic measurements will enhance understanding of submesoscale processes and extend the capabilities of ocean state and climate prediction models.",

For SEEs with the minimum energy below 10 keV and the maximum energy above 100 keV, ~85% (~2%) have a double-power-law energy spectrum with a steepening (hardening) above the break energy, while ~13% have a single-power-law energy spectrum at all energies. The average spectral index is ~2.4 below the energy break and is ~4.0 above the energy break. For SEEs detected only at energies <10 keV (>20 keV), they generally show a single-power-law spectrum with the average index of ~3.0 (~3.3). The spectrum of SEEs detected only below 10 keV appears to get harder with increasing solar activity, but the spectrum of SEEs with higher-energy electrons shows no clear correlation with solar activity. We will also investigate whether the observed energy spectrum of SEEs at 1 AU mainly reflects the electron acceleration at the Sun or the electron transport in the interplanetary medium.",

            "abstract": "A research cruise aboard the RV Southern Surveyor (SS2013-V01) conducted in January 2013 offshore east Australia collected regional bathymetric data for the seabed of the continental margin of southern Queensland for the seabed bounded by Noosa Heads in the south and Indian Head, Fraser Island in the north. This newly mapped area presents a particularly steep portion of continental slope (5o to 10 o) that presents numerous submarine landslides, including two ‘whole-of-slope’ features (The Wide Bay Canyon, and Inskip Slides. The slope is also dissected by three large submarine canyons offshore northern Fraser Island, Wide Bay and Noosa Heads (i.e. the Fraser Canyons, the Wide Bay Canyon and the Noosa Canyon). Dredge and core samples were collected from slide scars in the northern, central and southern areas of the bathymetric survey area. The initial examination of the area’s bathymetry, the core and dredge sample sedimentology, and determination of biostratigraphic ages for these sediment samples indicates that the larger, submarine slides present in this study area have probably been shed from the slope since the late Pliocene and that canyon incision is currently active on this portion of the slope. In one case, canyon incision is partly responsible for generating slides due to undercutting and removal of the toe of the slope. Slope sediments are dominantly comprised of hemipelagic muds but the presence of massive coarse sands and graded sands in some cores above erosion surfaces that cut into slope mud units is interpreted to indicate that areas of the southern Queensland continental slope are probably subjected to abrasion by grain-flows and turbidites comprised of shelf-derived sands and upper slope sediment. The results from this voyage confirms and extends previous work on the southeastern Australian continental margin that indicates that sediment transport from the shelf to deep water on this margin is dominated by gravity mass transport and that the margin is in an active phase of deconstruction.",

            "abstract": "This study has been conducted with the aim of comprehending dissociation behavior of MH. The production test was operated in the Daini-Atsumi knoll in the eastern Nankai Trough, Japan. We corresponded the NMR log data acquired from the three wells, which drilled before the test (AT1-MC) and after the test (AT1-LWD1 and AT1-LWD2). NMR log measures T2 relaxation time, and calculates porosity and permeability. We especially focused on the T2 distribution.\nIt is assumed that MH occupied larger pore space in the sandy sediment because the T2 distribution in the MH bearing layer has no peak in the longer time zone at the AT1-MC. However, T2 peak appeared over 33ms zone at the AT1-LWD1 and AT1-LWD2. This phenomenon is observed in the thin MH bearing layers rather than thick one. On the other hand, nothing T2 peak appeared over the 33ms zone in the thick MH bearing layer, but T2 distribution shifts to longer relaxation time in the short time interval. Hence, it is assumed that the MH was dissociated from the contact faces with the grain. In terms of the thermal conductivity, near the grain-grain contact faces are more dissociable than the MH-grain contact; however both of dissociation zones are essentially MH-grain contact faces. Nothing or few MH was observed in the muddy layer at the coring campaign near these wells. Abovementioned, NMR logging detected various changes on the T2 distribution. It seems to indicate the dissociation of MH. And these data gets into alignment with other log data and monitoring data, which are resistivity and temperature measurement. However, as this logging data acquired from each location, there is possibility that the initial condition was originally distinct.\nThis research was conducted as a part of the MH21 research, and the authors would like to express their sincere appreciation to MH21 and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry for providing the permission to disclose this research.",

            "abstract": "As populations become increasingly concentrated in large cities, the world is experiencing an inevitably growing trend towards the urbanisation of disasters. Scientists have contributed significant advances in understanding the geophysical causes of natural hazards and have developed sophisticated tools to predict their effects; while, much less attention has been devoted to tools that increase situational awareness, facilitate leadership, provide effective communication channels and data flow and enhance the cognitive abilities of decision makers and first responders.\nIn this paper, we envisioned the capabilities of a next generation disaster decision support system and hence proposed a state-of-the-art system architecture design to facilitate the decision making process in natural catastrophes such as flood and bushfire by utilising a combination of technologies for multi-channel data aggregation, disaster modelling, visualisation and optimisation. Moreover, we put our thoughts into action by implementing an Intelligent Disaster Decision Support System (IDDSS). The developed system can easily plug in to external disaster models and aggregate large amount of heterogeneous data from government agencies, sensor networks, and crowd sourcing platforms in real-time to enhance the situational awareness of decision makers and offer them a comprehensive understanding of disaster impacts from diverse perspectives such as environment, infrastructure and economy, etc. Sponsored by the Australian Government and the Victorian Department of Justice (Australia), the system was built upon a series of open-source frameworks (see attached figure) with four key components: data management layer, model application layer, processing service layer and presentation layer. It has the potential to be adopted by a range of agencies across Australian jurisdictions to assist stakeholders in accessing, sharing and utilising available information in their management of disaster events.",

            "abstract": "Paleontologic, oceanographic, and ecologic studies suggest gradual shoaling of the Central American Seaway between ~15 to 2 Ma that caused a stepwise shutdown of deep, intermediate, and shallow water exchange between the Pacific Ocean and Caribbean Sea. This diminishing communication has been further associated with changes in surface and deep ocean currents, atmospheric flow, and ultimately regional and global climate. Recent studies of the Isthmus of Panama’s exhumation history, palm phylogenies, and fossil/molecularly derived migration rates, however, suggest that the isthmus may have risen much earlier. An earlier rise scenario would call into question many accepted consequences of this gateway event under the ‘Panama Hypothesis,’ including strengthened thermohaline circulation, North Atlantic Deep Water production, the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation, and the Great American Biotic Interchange. Despite considerable research on the Neogene, few paleoceanographic studies have directly examined long-term changes in the adjacent oceans over the Cenozoic to evaluate the potential for earlier events in the closure history of the seaway. In this study, we extend records of bottom water circulation reconstructed from the Nd-isotopes of fish teeth from several Caribbean International Ocean Discovery Program sediment cores (ODP Sites 998, 999, 1000). These reconstructions clearly depict an increase in Pacific volcanism throughout the Cenozoic and sustained transport of Pacific waters into the Caribbean basin from ~50 to 9 Ma, although there appear to be interesting complexities within the Caribbean basin itself. We also present preliminary investigations into the potential of Nd-isotopic analyses on fossil fish teeth recovered from outcrops and exposures of marine strata across Panama to further elucidate the regional dynamics and shoaling history of the Central American Seaway.",

            "abstract": "Deadly landslides are often mobile landslides, as exemplified by the disastrous landslide that occurred near Oso, Washington in 2014 killing 43. Despite this association, many landslide susceptibility maps do not identify runout areas. We developed a simple, GIS-based method for identifying areas potentially overrun by mobile slides and debris flows. Our method links three processes within a DEM landscape: landslide initiation, transport, and debris-flow inundation (from very mobile slides). Given spatially distributed shear strengths, we first identify initiation areas using an infinite-slope stability analysis. We then delineate transport zones, or regions of potential entrainment and/or deposition, using a height/length runout envelope. Finally, where these transport zones intersect the channel network, we start debris-flow inundation zones. The extent of inundation is computed using the USGS model Laharz, modified to include many debris-flow locations throughout a DEM. Potential debris-flow volumes are computed from upslope initiation areas and typical slide thicknesses.\nWe applied this approach to the main island of Kosrae State, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). In 2002, typhoon Chata’an triggered numerous landslides on the neighboring islands of Chuuk State, FSM, resulting in 43 fatalities. Using an infinite-slope stability model calibrated to the Chuuk event, we identified potential landslide initiation areas on Kosrae. We then delineated potential transport zones using a 20º runout envelope, based on runout observations from Chuuk. Potential debris-flow inundation zones were then determined using Laharz. Field inspections on Kosrae revealed that our resulting susceptibility map correctly classified areas covered by previous debris-flow deposits and did not include areas covered by fluvial deposits. Our map has the advantage of providing a visual tool to portray initiation, transport, and runout zones from mobile landslides.",

            "abstract": "Estimating moment magnitudes using coda waves has proven to be one of the most robust measurements of the size of an earthquake. In most regions, moderate to large size earthquakes can be easily calibrated with 1-D regional path correction of coda waves at low frequencies (f < 0.5 Hz). Above a certain frequency (f > 0.5 Hz) a larger scattering is observed which leads to higher variation for smaller earthquakes which are only recorded at these higher frequencies. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has been improving the number of coda envelope measurements in the Middle East due to significant developments of seismic networks and the recent deployments. We use more than 2000 earthquakes recorded by nearly 60 broad-band stations to investigate the 2-D propagation effects of the coda waves. We have found that coda waves have substantially different propagation properties than the direct waves, and these differences need to be accounted for in the tomographic inversion. The tomographic method separates and simultaneously inverts the Sn-coda and Lg-coda phases for Q over a frequency range of 0.3 to 8 Hz. Initial results of 2-D Q maps are very similar to the direct wave attenuation maps at certain frequencies.",

            "abstract": "It is important to understand what triggers silicic eruptions because of the implications for modern-day systems. The goal of this project is to use phase equilibria modeling (i.e. rhyolite-MELTS) to determine to what extent magmas within the crust are induced to erupt due to external triggers (e.g. earthquakes; new magma injection; neighboring eruptions) and to what extent they naturally evolve to a point where eruption is inevitable (e.g. by fluid exsolution and decrease in magma strength and density). Whole-rock compositions from four rhyolite tuffs across the globe associated with large or supereruptions (Mamaku Tuff, New Zealand; Peach Spring Tuff, SW USA; early and late-erupted Bishop Tuff, California; and Toba Tuff, Indonesia) are studied using rhyolite-MELTS modeling. Key physical properties of magma are strongly affected by the initial volatile content due to fluid exsolution. By running simulations with varying water contents, we can track the evolution of fluid exsolution during crystallization. Isobaric (constrained temperature change at constant pressure) and isochoric (constrained temperature change at constant volume) models were run for the four compositions. In constrained-pressure scenarios, fluid is free to exsolve as crystallization proceeds, and the total system volume can increase or decrease accordingly; this would require deformation of the surrounding crust to accommodate the magma volume change. In constrained-volume scenarios, bubble exsolution is limited to the volume change due to crystallization; in this case, pressure can decrease or increase (if bubbles are absent or present). For fixed-pressure scenarios, fluid exsolution is more extensive and leads to internal triggering, at least for fluid-saturated conditions; external triggering is more likely in fluid-undersaturated conditions. For fixed-volume scenarios, none of the systems cross a fragmentation threshold for the crystal contents typically observed in natural pumice. If isochoric crystallization is a good proxy for the evolution of natural magma bodies, then external triggers are the ultimate cause for eruption of silicic magmas. Bishop compositions seem more prone to internal triggering than Mamaku compositions, particularly for isochoric conditions.",

            "abstract": "Fractures are the natural and essential elements of rock. Fracture systems are the most important features that define rock permeability and strength, as well as their anisotropy properties. Recent advancement in induced fracturing is a core part of the gas/oil shale technology, where fracture monitoring and control became a special topic of interest.\nKrauklis wave (K-wave) is the result of interaction between a fluid mass and elasticity of fracture walls, and it propagates primarily along the fracture systems in the fluid. At the fracture tips and fracture intersections it partially converts into the body waves. It is quite clear that incorporation of K-waves in a theory of wave propagation in fractured rock is one of the most important problems to solve for understanding of their seismic properties.\nOne of the most fundamental properties of fractured rock is a fractal fracture distribution and it is rarely, if ever, taken into account in existing wave propagation theories. However, this property exists on a widest variety of scales and in particular reveals itself in a form of Gutenberg-Richter Law experimentally proven, starting from laboratory measurements and up to the global seismicity.\nWe computed P and S-wave velocities of the rock containing fluid (and proppant) filled fractures, considering the effect of extremely slow and dispersive wave propagation within individual fractures. This was made possible by introducing the concept of “effective fracture-wave volume,” and by evaluating the elastic constants of rock containing a complex, fractal network of fractures. These velocities were used to compute seismic waves reflected normally from a fractured reservoir. We demonstrate that by taking into account the Krauklis wave phenomenon for the fractally distributed fluid-filled fractures, it is possible to explain the observed low-frequency anomalies above the underground natural reservoirs. These anomalies include increase of amplitude and a phase delay of reflected waves as frequency approaches zero.",

            "abstract": "Manganese (Mn) oxide minerals are pervasive throughout a number of surface earth environments as rock varnishes, ferromanganese nodules, crusts around deep-sea vents, and cave deposits among many other marine, freshwater, and terrestrial deposits. Mn(III,IV) oxides are also among the strongest sorbents and oxidants in surface earth environments and are crucial to understanding the fate of organic matter in sedimentary environments. The precipitation of Mn oxide minerals proceeds via both abiotic and biotic oxidation pathways, the latter due to the indirect or direct activity of Mn(II)- oxidizing microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi. Although the precipitation of Mn oxides is believed to be primarily controlled by Mn(II)-oxidizing organisms in most surface earth environments, confirmation of this generally held notion has remained illusive and limits our understanding of their formation on Earth and beyond (e.g., Mars). Previous work provided evidence that O atom incorporation by specific Mn oxidation pathways may exhibit unique and predictable isotopic fractionation. In this study, we expand upon this evidence by measuring the oxygen isotope signature of several biogenic and abiogenic Mn oxide minerals synthesized under a range of oxygen-18 labeled water. These results allow us to determine the relative amount oxygen atoms derived from water and molecular oxygen that are incorporated in the oxide and shed light on corresponding isotope fractionation factors. Additionally, we show that, once precipitated, Mn oxide isotope signatures are robust with respect to aqueous oxygen isotope exchange. The study provides a foundation on which to study and interpret Mn oxides in natural environments and determine which environmental controls may govern Mn(II) oxidation.",

In the first, larger rock falls trigger second vesiculation of magma at depths up to 100 m below the free surface ejecting juvenile bomb and lapilli populations of very variable vesicularity. The second, the topic of this presentation, consists of intervals of minutes to tens-of-minutes duration of low fountaining activity often from multiple locations. Vents may migrate with time, first across the free surface to its margins, and then around the margins, in response to convection processes in the underlying melt.\nAnalysis of short sequences of high-speed, high-resolution video footage shows that the sustained fountaining is maintained by not by a continuous discharge but rather by closely spaced bursting of two-to-five meter-wide bubbles. Bubbles accelerate through the free surface at velocities of 10 to 40 m/s disrupting the viscoelastic crust and forming large fall-back, lacework pyroclasts and smaller highly vesicular bombs and lapilli.",

So far, most drought researches have been focused on precipitation and stream-flow data, although these data are considered to be non-linear. Subsequently, the prediction of drought events has been very difficult in practice. In this study, we targets to analyze the groundwater system as an intermediate stage between precipitation and stream-flow, but still has semi-linear characteristics. By the analysis of past trends of groundwater time-series compared with drought events, we will identify characteristics of fluctuation between groundwater-level and precipitation of the year before the droughts. Then, the characteristics will be tested with recent drought events in Korea. For this analysis, The updated ATGT (Analysis Tool for Groundwater Time-series data program version 1.0 based on JAVA), that was developed for analyzing and presenting groundwater time-series data, basically to identify abnormal changes in groundwater fluctuations, will be presented with additional functions including cross-correlation between groundwater and drought based on the PYTHON language.",

            "abstract": "A new GIS based semi-distributed hydrologic modeling framework is developed for simulating runoff, evapotranspiration and soil moisture at large catchment scale. The framework is based upon the delineation of contiguous and topologically connected Hydrologic Response Units (HRUs). The HRU delineation methodology consists of delineating first order sub-basins and landforms. To reduce the number of computational elements, simulations are performed across a series of cross sections or equivalent cross sections (ECS) in each first order sub-basin using a 2-dimensional, Richards’ equation based distributed hydrological model. Delineation of ECSs is performed by weighting the topographic and physiographic properties of the part or entire first-order sub-basins and has the advantage of reducing the computational time while maintaining reasonable accuracy in simulated hydrologic fluxes. Simulated fluxes from every cross section or ECS are weighted by the respective area from which the cross sections or ECSs were formulated and then aggregated to obtain the catchment scale fluxes.\nSMART pre- and post-processing scripts are written in MATLAB to automate the cross section delineation, model simulations across multiple cross sections, and post-processing of outputs for visualization. The MATLAB Parallel Processing Toolbox is used for simultaneous simulations of cross sections and is further reduced computational time. SMART pre-processing workflow consists of the following steps: 1) delineation of first order sub-basins using a digital elevation model, 2) hillslope delineation, 3) landform delineation in every first order sub-basin based on topographic and geomorphic properties of a group of sub-basins or entire catchment, 4) formulation of cross sections as well as ECSs and 5) extraction of vegetation and soil parameters using spatially distributed land cover and soil information for the 2-d distributed hydrological model. The post-processing tools generate streamflow at the outlet and spatially distributed evapotranspiration and soil moisture across the catchment. SMART modeling framework and the automation procedures improve the toolkit application for regional scale simulations and significantly reduce the model setup and computational times for large catchment scale simulations.",

            "abstract": "Perennial snow and ice fields could be an important archaeological and paleoecological resource for Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve in the central Brooks Range mountains of Arctic Alaska. These features may have cultural significance, as prehistoric artifacts may be frozen within the snow and ice. Globally significant discoveries have been made recently as ancient artifacts and animal dung have been found in melting alpine snow and ice patches in the Southern Yukon and Northwest Territories in Canada, the Wrangell mountains in Alaska, as well as in other areas. These sites are melting rapidly, which results in quick decay of biological materials.\nThe summer of 2015 saw historic lows in year round snow cover extent for most of Alaska. Twenty mid to high elevation sites, including eighteen perennial snow and ice fields, and two glaciers, were surveyed in July 2015 to quantify their areal extent. This survey was accomplished by using both low flying aircraft (helicopter), as well as with on the ground in-situ (by foot) measurements. By helicopter, visual surveys were conducted within tens of meters of the surface. Sites visited by foot were surveyed for extent of snow and ice coverage, melt water hydrologic parameters and chemistry, and initial estimates of depths and delineations between snow, firn, and ice. Imagery from both historic aerial photography and from 5m resolution IKONOS satellite information were correlated with the field data.\nInitial results indicate good agreement in permanent snow and ice cover between field surveyed data and the 1985 to 2011 Landsat imagery-based Northwest Alaska snow persistence map created by Macander et al. (2015). The most deviation between the Macander et al. model and the field surveyed results typically occurred as an overestimate of perennial extent on the steepest aspects. These differences are either a function of image classification or due to accelerated ablation rates in perennial snow and ice coverage between 2011 and 2015. Further work is ongoing to develop a model to guide archaeological and paleoecological snow and ice field surveys. This will entail a fine scale, empirically based model of accumulation and ablation to estimate changes in three dimensional geometries of historically perennial arctic alpine snow and ice fields in the study area.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU 2015-Afshin-Poster.pdf\nEcosystem models are essential tools in forecasting ecosystem responses to global climate change. One of the most challenging issues in ecosystem modeling is scaling while preserving landscape characteristics and minimizing loss of information, when moving from point observation to regional scale. There is a keen interest in providing accurate inputs for ecosystem models which represent ecosystem initial state conditions. Remote sensing land cover products, such as Landsat NLCD and MODIS MCD12Q1, provide extensive spatio-temporal coverage but do not capture forest composition and structure. Lidar and hyperspectral have the potential to meet this need but lack sufficient spatial and historical coverage. Forest inventory measurements provide detailed information on the landscape but in a very small footprint. Combining inventory and land cover could improve estimates of ecosystem state and characteristic across time and space. This study focuses on the challenges associated with fusing and scaling the US Forest Service FIA database and NLCD across regional scales to quantify ecosystem characteristics and reduce associated uncertainties.\nAcross Southeast of U.S. 400 stratified random samples of 10x10 km2 landscapes were selected. Data on plant density, species, age, and DBH of trees in FIA plots within each site were extracted. Using allometry equations, the canopy cover of different plant functional types (PFTs) was estimated using a PPA-style canopy model and used to assign each inventory plot to a land cover class. Inventory and land cover were fused in a Bayesian model that adjusts the fractional coverage of inventory plots while accounting for multiple sources of uncertainty. Results were compared to estimates derived from inventory alone, land cover alone, and model spin-up alone. Our findings create a framework of data assimilation to better interpret remote sensing data using ground-based measurements.",

            "abstract": "Urbanization is the most demographic significant trend of the 21st century particularly in Asia. Characterizing it in a spatial context is difficult given the moderate resolution data provided by traditional sources of demographic data. Previous work on Saigon has shown by using these data together that much more about the correlates and potential consequences of change in the form and expansion of urban change can be learned than with a single data source alone. In this paper, we expand our analysis to two other much different urban and socioeconomic settings: Dhaka and Beijing. Particularly, where the demographic and socioeconomic indicators of change are too infrequent to capture annual change, use of satellites in combination with demographic data may be especially useful for capturing change in exurban and periurban areas, or in smaller cities within larger urban agglomerations.\nUsing spatial regression techniques, we estimate statistical relationships between remotely sensed data sets to assess the ability demographic changes to predict urban changes as detected by two different satellite measures of change 2000-2010 in Dhaka, Saigon, and Beijing. We then predict socioeconomic outcomes associated with emissions and vulnerability proxies. We use two much different types of satellite data -- the Dense Sample Method (DSM) analysis of the NASA scatterometer data and new built-up area data from the Global Human Settlement Layer of the JRC – which respectively proxy for increases in building heights (vertical expansion) and impervious surface-type changes (horizontal expansion). These different data products help us to better understand the evolution of the built environment and urban form, while the underlying demographic data provide information regarding composition of urban population change, at different levels of economic development, built-upness, and population density. Combining these types of data yields important, high resolution spatial information that provides a more accurate understanding of urban processes, particularly in the context of climate change (as shown in Figure 1). Together these will help understand the form of urban change as well as the relationship between urban change, vulnerability and population distribution within and on the periphery of growing cities.",

            "abstract": "This presentation and another presentation led by Dawn Kellett will preface a ten-minute open discussion on how the Himalayan middle crust was developed and emplaced. Current hypotheses are transitioning from a set including wedge extrusion, channel flow with focused denudation, and tectonic wedging to a revised dichotomy: models with intense upper plate out-of-sequence activity (i.e., tunneling of channel flow, and critical taper wedge behavior) versus models in which the upper plate mainly records basal accretion of horses (i.e., duplexing). Critical taper and duplexing offer a simple contrast that can be illustrated via food analogies. If a wedge is critical, it churns internally like a pile of CheeriosTM cereal pushed up an inclined plane. Stacking of a duplex acts like a deli meat-slicing machine: slice after slice is cut from the intact block to a stack of slices, but neither the block (~down-going plate) nor the stack (~upper plate) features much internal deformation. Thus critical taper and channel tunneling models predict much processing via out-of-sequence deformation, whereas duplexing predicts in-sequence thrusting. The two concepts may be considered end-members. Recent work shows that the Himalayan middle crust has been assembled along a series of mainly southwards-younging thrust faults. The thrust faults separate 1-5 km thick panels that experienced similar metamorphic cycles during different time periods. Out-of-sequence deformation is rare, with its apparent significance enhanced because of the high throw-to-heave ratio of out-of-sequence thrusting. Flattening fabrics developed prior to thrusting have been interpreted to record either (1) southwards channel tunneling across the upper plate, or (2) fabric development during metamorphism of the down-going plate. We will argue that the thrust faults dominantly represent in-sequence duplexing, and therefore conclude that the Himalaya and analogous hot orogens behave like other accretionary orogens.",

            "abstract": "Fault damage has a quantifiable influence on the rates and patterns of fluvial erosion. Tectonic stresses can exceed the critical yield of bedrock and cause brittle failure response, generating a heterogeneous distribution of strength and fracture density in the form of fault damage zones within an intact bedrock host formation. Field observations of fault structures in the Southern Alps of New Zealand demonstrate that fluvial processes of erosion and transport are highly sensitive to a significant local increase in erodibility attributed to rock disaggregation and a comparatively smaller critical discharge required to transport fine grained fault gouge and cataclasites. In order to provide quantitative data for a problem that has remained largely conceptual for over a century, we combine models of landscape evolution and rock damage to investigate the influence of fault damage on the rates and patterns of landscape development and adjustment. Model results suggest that high order rivers will align with exposed fault structures due to the relatively rapid erosion and transport of damaged rock if strength is reduced by a factor of 30 relative to surrounding intact bedrock. Observations of NZ fault damage zones indicate that strength reduction by a factor of 1000 is characteristic of cataclasis, far exceeding the threshold factor for channel entrainment. Fault erosion also increases the response rate of landscapes to base level perturbations by an order of magnitude or greater. Further, the relief of structurally aligned valleys creates capacity for substantial transient sediment storage deep within tectonically active landscapes. Sensitivity analysis in a coupled landscape evolution-geodynamics model suggests that fluvial erosion plays an important role in the development of topographic stress and ultimately in the partitioning of strain within active orogens, due primarily to a strong positive feedback response between tectonic strain and fluvial erosion, driven by rock damage and concentrated in fault structures.",

Additionally, for many TGFs the source location will be determined using networks of ground-based very low frequency (VLF) radio receivers.

The water use of the plantations was concerned due to its potential effects on hydrological cycle and regional water resource. Although some studies estimated canopy transpiration (Ec) of the mature black locust plantation, variation in Ec in plantations with different ages was not clear. In this study, we selected two plantations with different ages (12 years and 27 years, denoted as young stand and mature stand, respectively) in similar topographical conditions in Yangjuangou catchment in the central of Loess Plateau. Sap flux density (Fd) and tree biometrics were measured in each stand during the growing season in 2014. Soil water content (SWC) in each plot and meteorological variables in the catchment were simultaneously monitored. Tree transpiration (Et) was derived from Fd and tree sapwood area (As). Canopy transpiration (Ec) was estimated by a product of mean stand sap flux density (Js) and stand total sapwood area (AST). The mean Fd of mature trees was 2-fold larger than that of young trees.However, tree-to-tree variation in Fd among sampled trees within mature stand was evident compared to that within young stand. Mean Et in mature stand was higher than that in young stand. Ec in mature stand was significant higher than that in young stand,with cumulative value of 54 mm and 27 mm respectively. This is attributed to higher Js in mature stand although AST in young is slightly higher than that in mature stand. The patterns of daily Ec during the growing season were similar in both stands during the study period. A exponential saturation model can explain the responses of Ec to vapor deficit pressure (VPD) and solar radiation (Rs) in both stands.The relationship between Ec and SWC was not detected. Our finding suggested that stand age should be taken into consideration when estimated vegetation water use in this region. Further researches on variations in Ec of black locust plantations along a chronosequence and responses of Ec to drought should be conducted to provide useful information on water resource and forest managements in this region.",

            "abstract": "In magmatic arcs the conditions of volatile exsolution exert a direct control on the composition of exsolved magmatic volatiles phases (MVPs), as well as on their parental magmas. The ability to accurately assess the exchange of major and trace elements between MVPs and magmas is key to understanding the evolution of arc magmas. The trace element signatures measured in arc volcanoes, fumaroles, and hydrothermal ore deposits are greatly influenced by the role of MVPs. In order to investigate the interplay and evolution of melts and MVPs we need experimental methods to simulate MVP exsolution that impose minimal external constraints on their equilibration.\nPrevious experiments have focused on evaluating the exchange of elements between aqueous fluids and silicate melts under equilibrium conditions[1,2]. However, the large mass proportion of fluid to melt in these experiment designs is unrealistic. As a result, the idealized compositions of the aqueous fluids may exert a strong control on melt compositions for which they are out of equilibrium, especially at low melt fractions. In contrast, other experiments have focused on the melt during crystallization but must calculate MVP compositions by mass balance[3]. In order to investigate MVPs and magmas during this critical period of MVP exsolution, we present a new two-stage fluid-melt experimental design.\nStage one experiments generate super-liquidus hydrous melts using Laguna del Maule rhyolites and dactites, as analogues for ascending arc magmas. Stage two experiments allow aliquots of stage one melt/glass to crystallize and exsolve MVPs. The design then uses pressure cycling to promote infiltration of in-situ fractured quartz[4] and traps the MVPs as synthetic fluid inclusions. We present results from trial stage 2 experiments, which produced synthetic fluid inclusions consistent with literature values of fluid-melt Cl partitioning[5] and of sufficient size for LA-ICPMS analysis.

            "abstract": "Fukuyama and Olsen (2002) computed the supershear rupture initiation, propagation and termination process due to a passage of high stress drop area (called asperity) using a boundary integral equation method. They found that supershear rupture continued to propagate after the passage through high stress drop area but it died after a certain propagation distance, which depends on the elastic energy released at the high stress drop area. Here, we could reproduce a similar phenomenon in the laboratory. We conducted large-scale biaxial friction experiments using a pair of meter-scaled metagabbro rock specimens (VP=6.9km/s, VS=3.6km/s) at the National Research institute for Earth Science and Disaster Prevention (NIED). We observed several stick slip rupture events that initiated close to an asperity and immediately became supershear ruptures. But after propagating certain distance they died out and co-existing subshear ruptures became prominent. If we look into details, during the supershear rupture, we could see a sequence of rupture acceleration, its short rest and re-acceleration. This feature reminds us of a sequential breakage of small high stress patches as predicted by Fukuyama and Madariaga (2000). These observations might be interpreted under a concept of energy balance where the energy transmission from strain energy released by the asperity to fracture energy consumed at the crack tip was not instantaneously balanced in space. This could be related to the fact that earthquake rupture velocity is rather smooth reported from the finite fault analysis of large earthquakes with seismic waveforms.\n",

The present work aims to evaluate the potential production and factors controlling the biogenic methane generation from Brazilian shales. Multiple anoxic incubations were prepared in order to quantify methane and dioxide carbon generation under wet and dry conditions. Experiments utilized samples collected from Devonian, Permian and Paleogene organic rich shales of Paraná and Taubaté basins, Southeastern Brazil. Production rates of 24 shale samples representing a wide range of total organic carbon and porosity were measured along several months. Carbon isotope values of carbon dioxide and methane enabled further investigation of biogenic gas generation and emission. A discussion regarding biogenic gas production and gas microseepage will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Supercritical CO2 (scCO2) injected into fractured sandstone reservoirs, such as at the In Salah site in Algeria, flows preferentially through the fracture network and invades into the rock matrix if matrix permeability is sufficiently high and capillary entry pressure is sufficiently low. The invading scCO2 displaces resident brine in the matrix downgradient, allowing for additional scCO2 matrix storage. The displaced brine crosses matrix bridges and brine-filled small-aperture regions within fractures between neighboring matrix blocks. To account for preferential scCO2 flow through fractures, scCO2 invasion into the rock matrix, and cross-fracture brine flow, we propose a hybrid continuum-discrete scheme with one fracture continuum (F) and multiple matrix continua (M1 through Mn). The scheme allows for global F-F flow through fractures, local F-M1 flow for scCO2 invasion, local Mi-Mi+1 brine and scCO2 flow, and global Mn-Mn brine flow. The proposed scheme differs from existing continuum-based dual-porosity, dual-permeability, and multiple interacting continua (MINC) schemes in that the matrix-matrix connectivity via bridges and brine-filled regions is considered explicitly, while the existing schemes allow either 0 (e.g., dual-porosity) or 100% (e.g., dual-permeability) matrix-matrix connectivity. The proposed scheme is implemented in the multi-phase multi-component simulator TOUGH2 and demonstrated on a hypothetical, large-scale scCO2 injection and storage case. A sensitivity analysis on different driving forces for fracture-matrix interactions is conducted in both homogeneous and heterogeneous fractures and matrix. It is found that in a thick reservoir, buoyancy enhances scCO2 invasion from fractures into the rock matrix, driving global matrix-matrix brine flow. Without scCO2 invasion into the matrix, the storage capacity and efficiency of CO2 in fractured sandstone, which are proportional to formation compressibility and pressure increase, is small.",

            "abstract": "Arctic permafrost zones cover 25% of the Northern Hemisphere and hold 1672Pg of soil carbon (C) with 277Pg in Arctic permafrost peatlands, which is 1/3 of the CO2 in the atmosphere. This currently protected C is a potential source for increased emissions in a warmer climate. Longer growing seasons resulting in increased plant productivity above and below ground may create new labile C inputs with the potential to affect mineralization of previously stable SOM, known as the priming effect. This study examined the response of soil respiration to labile substrate addition in carbon-rich (42-48 %C) permafrost peatland soils along a N-S transect in the central Mackenzie River Basin (69.2-62.6°N). Active layer and near surface soils (surface Δ14C values > -140.0) were collected from four sites between -10.5 and -5.2 MAT. Soils were spiked with 0.5 mg D-glucose g-1soil, and incubated at 10°C for 23 days to determine potential, short term (i.e., apparent) priming effects.\nOn average glucose addition increased respiration in all samples. One site showed priming evidence in active layer soils despite one-way ANOVA not illustrating statistically significant differences between control and treated final cumulative CO2. Apparent priming effects were seen in two near surface permafrost samples, however cumulative increases in CO2 were not identified as significant. When all results from all sites and depths were considered, the addition of glucose showed no significant effect on total CO2 production relative to controls (p=0.957), suggesting that these sites may be resilient to increased inputs in that little priming evidence was observed. To test the idea that the soils that showed priming effects are of poorer quality, we conducted an additional incubation experiment to explore the biodegradability of these permafrost peatland soils. Soils from these four sites were inoculated and incubated for 17 days. The two sites with observed priming showed the highest biodegradability; suggesting that, compared to other soils, permafrost peat soils may not be sensitive to the priming effect and respond uniquely to warming and increased litter inputs. Therefore C loss from priming decomposition may be trivial when compared to other C loss mechanisms in Arctic permafrost peatlands.",

The DF interfaces between the high-speed flowing transient plasma and the ambient plasma. Ahead of the DFs, magnetic field Bz decreases and it is, called the “dip region.” However, unlike in the high-speed flow and the ambient plasma which can be described by MHD theory, kinetic effects are important in the dip region because the spatial scale is less than the ion gyroradius. Observation and simulation have demonstrated that the dip region is formed by the reflecting ions at the sharp front. Short lived electromagnetic waves are also observed here generated by the reflected ions. In addition, Hall electric field observed in this region is in the opposite direction of the electric field inside the DF. The dipolarization front and the dip region ahead of it formed a set of current systems and they are fundamentally important for understanding the cause of flow braking in the plasma sheet.  ",

Although Banana River, a 50 km long sub-basin of IRL, has an outlet to the ocean through the Port Canaveral locks, the locks remain closed when there is no passing vessel. The lack of direct ocean connection results in limited circulation, long flushing time and poor water quality. Existence of the causeways limits the circulation even more. In this study, the impact of the causeways on flushing time is studied. This study also examines the extent to which constructing a low crested weir adjacent to Port Canaveral can improve flushing in this region. ADCIRC 2DDI is forced with meteorological inputs as well as tides to simulate the hydrodynamic properties of the study area and determine the 2D depth-averaged velocity field for four separate cases: Existing System with and without consideration of the causeways, and modified system (adding a weir near port Canaveral) with and without consideration of the causeways. Passive particles are placed in Banana River, and their movement is tracked using a Lagrangian Particle Tracking Model (LPTM). Transport timescales are then computed, and residence time contours as well as pathlines of selected particles are plotted. Results indicate that the narrow raised pathway section of the causeways acts as a plate which diverts the flow direction and generates eddies in the downstream which causes the particles in the vicinity of the causeways remain in the domain for a longer duration. There is a longer residence time for the case in which the causeways are considered. The results with the added weir suggest a noticeable improvement in ﬂushing time and residence time even for the case in which the causeways are considered in the model.",

However, much remains unknown about the mechanisms and processes that lead to isoprene derived SOA. We present measurements and modeling of a suite of newly detected compounds from isoprene oxidation from laboratory studies at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) as well as in the atmosphere from the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) field campaign. Measurements were made with a high resolution time of flight chemical ionization mass spectrometer utilizing iodide adduct ionization coupled to the Filter Inlet for Gas and AEROsol (FIGAERO) for the simultaneous sampling of the gas and aerosol phases. In the PNNL chamber, isoprene photo-oxidation with dry neutral seed and IEPOX multiphase chemistry on aqueous particles was investigated at a variety of atmospherically relevant conditions. Isoprene photo-oxidation under high HO2 produced unexpectedly substantial SOA at a yield similar to but from a distinctly different mechanism than that from IEPOX uptake. The high HO2 chemistry also resulted in di hydroxy di hydroperoxides as a dominant component of the aerosol. By utilizing the same instrument and ion chemistry during both field and chamber experiments, together with an MCM-based model, we assess the degree to which the different mechanisms are operable in the atmosphere and relevant aerosol chemical and physical properties of the SOA such as volatility and oligomer content.",

            "abstract": "Depleted oil reservoirs are attractive targets for geologic carbon storage (GCS) because they possess proven trapping mechanisms and large amounts of data pertaining to production and reservoir geometry. In addition, CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR) can improve recovery of the remaining oil at recovery factors of 6 to 20% of original oil in place in appropriate reservoirs. CO2 EOR increases the attractiveness of depleted oil and gas reservoirs as a starting point for CCS because the CO2 becomes a commodity that can be purchased by field operators for EOR purposes thereby offsetting the costs of CO2 capture at the power plant.\nIn California, Kern County contains the largest oil reservoirs and produces 76% of California’s oil. Most of the production at depths suitable for CCS combined with CO2 EOR comes from three reservoirs: the Vedder and Temblor formations and the Stevens Sandstone of the Monterey Formation. These formations were evaluated for GCS and CO2 EOR potential at the North and South Coles Levee (Stevens Sandstone), Greeley (Vedder) and McKittrick (Temblor) fields.\nCO2 EOR could be expected to produce an additional 150 million bbls of oil. The total storage space created by pre- and post-EOR fluid production for all three reservoirs is approximately 104 million metric tons (MMT). Large fixed sources in California produce 156 MMT/yr of CO2, and sources in Kern County produce 26 MMT/yr (WESTCARB, 2012). Therefore, the fields could store about four years of local large fixed source emissions and about two thirds of statewide emissions. However, from a global perspective, burning the additional oil produced by CO2 EOR would generate an additional 65 MMT of CO2 if not captured. This would result in a net reduction of greenhouse gas of only 39 MMT rather than the full 104 MMT. If the water produced along with the oil recovered during CO2 EOR operations is not reinjected into the reservoir, the storage space could be much higher.",

Few studies have validated XCO2 analyzed using a PPDF-based method, and no report describes validation for XCH4. In this study, we validated both XCO2 and XCH4 data analyzed using an advanced version of PPDF, PPDF-simultaneous (PPDF-S), by comparing the retrieved data with the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) data (GGG 2012 and 2014 releases) observed at 11 observation sites. As the first step, our validation procedure was applied to the NIES standard products of XCO2 and XCH4 (V02.xx) to confirm its performance. Results show that the biases ±their standard devations, defined by the difference from TCCON data (GGG 2012), were evaluated to be -1.94±1.79 ppm and -7.59±11.8 ppb, respectively, for XCO2 and XCH4, using radiance data used for NIES V02.11, and to be -1.63±1.88 ppm and -6.45±12.2 ppb using data for NIES V02.21. Absolute values of these biases are slightly larger than those from Yoshida et al. (2013) reported as -1.56±1.88 ppm and -6.10±12.3 ppb for XCO2 and XCH4, respectively using radiance data used for NIES V02.00. The validation procedure was then applied to XCO2 and XCH4 analyzed using PPDF-S. Results show that biases are 0.16±1.77 ppm and 4.18±14.3 ppb, respectively, for XCO2 and XCH4 using radiance used for NIES V02.11. They are 0.27±1.72 ppm and 4.54±14.4 ppb using data for NIES V02.21. We conclude that PPDF-S method exhibits better performance for both XCO2 and XCH4 retrieval than for NIES standard products where TCCON (GGG 2012) data are used as validation data, although the standard products might be better for XCH4 if TCCON (GGG 2014) data are used.",

            "abstract": "The 2008 Mw7.9 Wenchuan earthquake produced two co-seismic surface ruptures along Yingxiu-Beichuan fault (~270 km) and the Guanxian-Anxian fault (~80 km) simultaneously in the Longmen Shan thrust belt. Besides, two surface rupture zones were tracked in the southern segment of the Yingxiu-Beichuan rupture zone, one along the Yingxiu fault, the other along the Shenxigou-Longchi fault, which both converged into one rupture zone at the Bajiaomiao village, Hongkou town, where one distinct fault plane with two striation orientations was exposed.\nThe Wenchuan earthquake Fault Scientific Drilling project (WFSD) was carried out right after the earthquake to investigate its faulting mechanisms and rupture process. Six boreholes were drilled along the rupture zones with depths ranging from 600 to 2400 m. WFSD-1 and WFSD-2 are located at the Bajiaomiao area, the southern segment of the Yingxiu-Beichuan rupture zone, while WFSD-4 and WFSD-4S are in the Nanba town area, in the northern part of the rupture zone. Detailed research showed that ~1 mm thick Principal Slip Zone (PSZ) of the Wenchuan earthquake is located at ~589 m-depth in the WFSD-1 cores. Graphite present in the PSZ indicates a low fault strength. Long-term temperature monitoring shows an extremely low fault friction coefficient during the earthquake. Recently, another possible PSZ was found in WFSD-1 cores at ~732 m-depth, with a ~2 mm thick melt layer in the fault gouge, where feldspar was melted but quartz was not, indicating that the frictional melting temperature was 1230°C < T < 1720°C. These two PSZs at depth may correspond to the two co-seismic surface rupture zones. Besides, the Wenchuan earthquake PSZ was also recognized in the WFSD-4S cores, at ~1084 m-depth. About 200-400 µm thick melt layer (fault vein, mainly feldspar), as well as melt injection veins, were observed in the slip zone, where oblique distinct striations were visible on the slip surface.\nTherefore, there are two PSZs in the shallow crust at the southern segment along the Yingxiu-Beichuan fault, and another one along the northern segment. Melt and graphite in the PSZs indicate that the frictional melting and thermal pressurization are the main fault mechanisms during the Wenchuan earthquake. The melt and graphite can be considered as markers of large earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Many natural hazards, including wildfires, volcanic eruptions, and, from the perspective of climate-related hazards, urban heat islands, could be better quantified via the routine availability of hyperspectral thermal infrared remote sensing data from orbit. However, no sensors are currently in operation that provide such data at high-to-moderate spatial resolution (e.g. Landsat-class resolution). In this presentation we will describe a prototype instrument, developed using funding provided by NASA’s Instrument Incubator Program, that can make these important measurements. Significantly, the instrument has been designed such that its size, mass, power, and cost are consistent with its integration into small satellite platforms, or deployment as part of small satellite constellations. The instrument, TIRCIS (Thermal Infra-Red Compact Imaging Spectrometer), uses a Fabry-Perot interferometer, an uncooled microbolometer array, and push-broom scanning to acquire hyperspectral image data cubes. Radiometric calibration is provided by blackbody targets while spectral calibration is achieved using monochromatic light sources. Neither the focal plane nor the optics need to be cooled, and the instrument has a mass of <10 kg and dimensions of 53 cm × 25 cm × 22 cm. Although the prototype has four moving parts, this can easily be reduced to one. The current optical design yields a 120 m ground sample size given an orbit of 500 km. Over the wavelength interval of 7.5 to 14 microns up to 90 spectral samples are possible, by varying the physical design of the interferometer. Our performance model indicates signal-to-noise ratios of the order of about 200 to 300:1. In this presentation we will provide an overview of the instrument design, fabrication, results from our initial laboratory characterization, and some of the application areas in which small-satellite-ready instruments such as TIRCIS could make a valuable contribution to the study of natural hazards.",

Microbes are known to degrade Arctic soil organic carbon (OC) and potentially release vast quantitates of CO2 and CH4. Previously, it has been shown that warming of Arctic soils leads to microbes respiring older carbon. To examine this process, we studied the microbial carbon usage and its relationship to the soil OC composition in active layer soils at five locations along a latitudinal transect on the North Slope of Alaska using the compound specific radiocarbon signatures of the viable microbial community using phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA). Additional geochemical parameters (C/N, 13C, 15N and 14C) of bulk soils were measured. Overall there was a greater change with depth than location. Organic rich surface soils are rich in vegetation and have high PLFA based cell densities, while deeper in the active layer geochemical parameters indicated soil OC was degraded and cell densities decreased. As expected, PLFA indicative of Fungi and Protozoa species dominated in surface soils, methyl-branched PLFAs, indicative of bacterial origin, increased in deeper in the active layer. A group of previously unreported PLFAs, believed to correlate to anaerobic microbes, increased at the transition between the surface and deep microbial communities. Cluster analysis based on individual PLFAs of samples confirmed compositional differences as a function of depth dominated with no site to site differences. Radiocarbon data of soil OC and PLFA show the preferential consumption of younger soil OC by microbes at all sites and older OC being eaten in deep soils. However, in deeper soil, where the C/N ratio suggests lower bioavailability, less soil OC was incorporated into the microbes as indicating by greater differences between bulk and PLFA radiocarbon ages.",

            "abstract": "Recent estimates of significant CO2 efflux from inland waters have spurred interest in respiration of organic matter (OM) as a contributor to regional carbon budgets. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) has been the focus of many investigations, with numerous studies targeting the structural and environmental controls on degradation rates. Very little is known about the reactivity of riverine particulate OC (POC), which can be composed of a range of materials from freshly fixed photosynthetic organic matter to ancient sedimentary OC. This study examines OC reactivity in two watersheds with contrasting land-use, the highly forested Chippewa River basin in Wisconsin (45% forested, 19% agricultural) and the heavily agricultural Minnesota River basin in Minnesota (3% forested, 72% agricultural). The Minnesota and Chippewa rivers are the largest tributary sources of suspended sediment to the Mississippi River upstream of Iowa, and their distinct land-use features lead to a diversity in carbon sources and loads across a small geographic range. Respiration incubations were conducted on the DOC and POC collected at different seasonal and flow conditions from these two rivers. Optical oxygen measurements were used for non-destructive monitoring of incubations at high temporal frequency. Coupled with traditional DOC loss and CO2 production approaches, these experiments allow for comparison of potential CO2 production from DOC and POC, determination of oxygen:carbon respiratory quotients, and compositional changes in OM (e.g. DOM fluorescence, POM elemental composition). We observed potential CO2 production from POC that was 1x and 3x greater than that of DOC at field concentrations in the Chippewa and Minnesota rivers, respectively, for incubation samples collected in spring of 2015. By linking OM respiration rates to metrics such as land use types and environmental variables, these results can help improve estimates of CO2 efflux from rivers across seasonal and spatial gradients.",

These generally propagated westwards, such that the main fault segment beneath the Marmara Sea as a seismic gap. For the nearby megacity Istanbul, rapid seismic hazard assessment is currently of great importance. A key issue is how a strong earthquake in the Marmara Sea can be characterized reliably and rapidly using the seismic network currently operating in this region. In order to investigate this issue, a scenario earthquake on the main Marmara fault is simulated through dynamic modeling based on a 3D structure model. The synthetic datasets are then used to reconstruct the source processes of the causal events with a recently developed iterative deconvolution and stacking method based on simplified 1D earth structure models. The results indicate that, by using certain a-priori information about the fault geometry and focal mechanism, the tempo-spatial slip patterns of the input scenarios can be well resolved. If reasonable uncertainties are considered for the a-priori information, the key source parameters, such as moment magnitude, fault size and slip centroid, can still be estimated reliably, while the detailed tempo-spatial rupture pattern may reveal significant variations. To reduce the effect induced by employing the inaccurate event location and focal mechanism, a new approach for absolute source imaging is proposed and tested. We also investigate the performance of the new source imaging tool for near real-time source inversion under the current network configuration in the Marmara Sea region. The results obtained are meaningful particularly for developing the rapid earthquake response system for the megacity Istanbul.",

            "abstract": "The degree to which fault slip rates and elastic strain accumulation rates are constant in time and space is one the most fundamental, unresolved issues in modern tectonics. Increasingly detailed geologic and geodetic observations from many continental strike-slip faults reveal several well-constrained examples in which strain accumulation and release rates are not temporally constant, being characterized instead by strain super-cycles that span multiple-earthquake cycles and geodetically constrained slip-deficit rates that are either much faster or much slower than the long-term average slip rate of the fault. Such observations call into question a number of basic assumptions about the behavior of faults, including most especially the notion that fault slip and elastic strain accumulation rates are relatively constant through time, as well as the idea that individual faults can be examined in isolation, rather than as components of mechanically integrated systems. In this talk, I will discuss evidence from a number of well-constrained examples in which both strain release (i.e., fault slip) and strain accumulation (fault “loading” rates) are decidedly non-constant. Various mechanisms have been suggested to explain these behaviors, although these remain poorly understood, and deciphering the controls of earthquake occurrence in time and space remains an exciting research frontier.",

A recent Geoscience Employers Workshop, and employers’ input on the “Future of Undergraduate Geoscience Education” survey, identified three major areas.\nGeoscience work requires spatial and temporal (3D & 4D) thinking, understanding that the Earth is a system of interacting parts and processes, and geoscience reasoning and synthesis. Thus, students need to be able to solve problems in the context of an open and dynamic system, recognizing that most geoscience problems have no clear, unambiguous answers. Students must learn to manage uncertainty, work by analogy and inference, and make predations with limited data. Being able to visualize and solve problems in 3D, incorporate the element of time, and understand scale is critical. Additionally students must learn how to tackle problems using real data, including understand the problems’ context, identify appropriate questions to ask, and determine how to proceed.\nGeoscience work requires integration of quantitative, technical, and computational skills and the ability to be intellectually flexible in applying skills to new situations. Students need experience using high-level math and computational methods to solve geoscience problems, including probability and statistics to understand risk. Increasingly important is the ability to use “Big Data”, GIS, visualization and modeling tools. Employers also agree a strong field component in geoscience education is important.\nSuccess as a geoscientist also requires non-technical skills. Because most work environments involve working on projects with a diverse team, students need experience with project management in team settings, including goal setting, conflict resolution, time management and being both leader and follower. Written and verbal scientific communication, as well as public speaking and listening skills, are important. Success also depends on interpersonal skills and professionalism, including business acumen, risk management, ethical conduct, and leadership. A global perspective is increasingly important, including cultural literacy and understanding societal relevance.",

Currently is operating in real time at NEIC (National Earthquake Information Center), IPGS (Institut de Physique du Globe de Strasbourg) and PTWC (Pacific Tsunami Warning Center) for teleseismic distances. In Chile has been implemented at National Seismological Center (CSN) since 2011 for regional distances, obtaining satisfactory results. Here we show the results for 250 Moment Tensors, and how this algorithm has been evolved with the development of the new Chilean National Seismic Network. We compared our solutions with NEIC wphase moment tensors (WCMT) results, and with the Global CMT. Our threshold magnitude move from 6.5 in 2011 down to 5.0 today, our first magnitude is obtained 6 minutes after an earthquake occurs, now wphase magnitude is the authorative magnitude at CSN; more than 90 broadband stations operating in real time have made this possible. Here we present the case of the Mw 8.2 Iquique Earthquake and how wphase algorithm performed for this event from the tsunami early warning point view. We present other large events in southern Peru and Chile. This catalog can be used for operational or scientific purposes, if more stations and seismic data available, it will be possible to characterize earthquakes faster and more accurate, specially for tsunami early warning purposes. Collaboration between regional networks will be essential to issue a fast tsunami warning.",

In this study we assess locations of the energy transfer and deposition by a simulation conducted with a self-consistent inductive-dynamic (including self-consistent solutions of Faraday's law and retaining inertia terms in the plasma momentum equations) ionosphere-thermosphere model. In a 2-D global geometry (dawn-dusk meridian plane), we solve the multifluid-collisional-Hall MHD equations including photochemistry. The preliminary simulation results demonstrate propagation and evolution of the field-aligned currents and the dynamic processes of the formation of the ionospheric Pedersen currents. By comparing locations of the field-aligned currents and ionosphere/thermosphere heating driven by the magnetospheric convection we show that the energy input to the IT system and the energy dissipation occurs in the polar cap instead of regions where the field-aligned currents reside. The implication of these results is that the field-aligned currents are not the primary agent of the energy transfer from the magnetosphere to the IT system.",

The paleomagnetic results yielded well-defined components of magnetization- defining seven polarity zones within the Ocotillo and upper Palm Spring Fm. Correlation to the geomagnetic polarity timescale, using the Bishop Ash near the top of the section as a tie point, places the Brunhes-Matuyama boundary near the base of the Ocotillo Fm, and the Jaramillo, Olduvai, and Reunion normal polarity sub-chrons in the upper Palm Spring Fm. This indicates the upper Palm Spring Fm in the Mecca Hills was deposited between 2.3 and 0.9 Ma. Sites from the Mecca Hills section have mean directions of D = 343, I = 53, α95 =11.3 N = 5 for normal sites, D = 175, I = -50, α95 = 4.9 N = 24 for reverse sites, and normal and reverse sites combined have a mean direction of D = 353, I = 51 α95 = 4.4. This indicates modest (7 degrees) CCW rotation of the section.\nResults from 19 sites (53 samples) of the Pleistocene conglomeritic sandstone from Desert Hot Springs have very well-defined paleomagnetic components. Six of the sites have normal polarity- 13 sites have reverse polarity. Sites with normal polarity have a mean direction of D = 358, I = 45, α95 = 13 and reverse sites have a mean of D = 182, I = -50, α95 = 6.6.The combined mean direction (in tilt-corrected coordinates) is D = 0.7, I = 49, α95 = 5.6 and indicates that 3.1° ± 2.3° of CW rotation has occurred at this location since ~1 to 1.5 Ma.\nResults from 8 sites (35 samples) of the upper-most San Timoteo beds from Live Oak Canyon also have well-defined paleomagnetic components for 6 sites. All of the results have normal polarity, and one site has a direction that is >40 degree from the other sites- the mean of the remaining 5 sites is D = 11, I = 49, k=51, a95=11.\nThe paleomagnetic results from the Coachella Valley collectively indicate that this area has experienced modest (in most cases less than 10 degrees) CW or CCW rotation during the past 1-2 Ma. The lack of variation in amount or sense of rotation as a function of age suggest that rotation has been relatively recent (during the past ~ 1 Ma).",

            "abstract": "Critical zone (CZ) architecture—the spatial distribution of soil and weathered bedrock within a landscape—reflects the integrated effects of weathering and erosion. A goal is to predict subsurface CZ architecture from surface observations: such a Grand Unified Theory of Hillslopes (GUTH) would incorporate processes that transport water, solutes and sediment on hillslopes under topographic, tectonic, and climatic drivers. CZ architecture itself exerts strong control on fluxes. Therefore, feedbacks between CZ structure and internal processes play a role in CZ evolution. Development of GUTH is limited by a paucity of data that reveal the full CZ architecture and its spatial distribution, although efforts by the CZ Observatory community and others have advanced our understanding.\nSubsurface properties can be documented by direct sampling of soil, weathered rock, and fresh rock. Samples allow analysis of chemical and physical properties but generally lack spatial coverage. Geophysical techniques, such as seismic refraction, yield spatially distributed data, but are rarely correlated to sample-based data. Combining distributed and sample data, especially for deep CZ samples, presents an opportunity to advance understanding.\nThermal, biological, and hydrological surface drivers tend to decline in intensity with depth. A significant challenge is therefore identifying and modeling processes that extend weathering downward under declining gradients. Significant gaps exist in models of water flux and chemistry in variably fractured media, of biotic processes (physical and chemical), and of fracture generation. Topographic stress and groundwater dynamics have been advanced as important drivers of CZ evolution. In both cases, the full hillslope must be considered, including dynamics of the lower boundary condition, to model development of a weathered profile. We therefore highlight the need for data and models that consider the hillslope from divide to channel, from surface to fresh rock.",

            "abstract": "East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) rainfall has a profound influence on the lives of billions of people. The seasonal prediction of the EASM rainfall, however, has long been an outstanding challenge in climate science. Traditional seasonal forecast of EASM deals with JJA mean rainfall anomalies, which may not be the best strategy because the EASM rainy season is typically from May to August and pronounced differences exist between early summer (May-June, MJ) and peak summer (July-August, JA): both climatological mean states and the principal modes of interannual variability exhibit distinct spatial and temporal structures. The present study explores the sources and limit of the predictability of the early and peak summer rainfall over the East Asian (EA) region. Since the climate models’ seasonal forecasts have rather limited skills, it is important to find the causes of the low skills, to improve seasonal prediction, and to better estimate the predictability of EASM rainfall. We address this issue by applying predictable mode analysis method.\nFour empirical modes of variability for peak summer rainfall are identified: (a) an equatorial western Pacific-EA teleconnection mode, (b) a western Pacific subtropical high-dipole feedback mode, (c) a central Pacific-ENSO mode, and (d) a Eurasian wave train mode. These modes are named according to the major sources of predictability. Based on the understanding of predictability sources for each mode, a suite of physical-empirical (P-E) models is established to predict the four leading principal components (PCs). All four modes can be predicted with significant cross-validated correlation skills(0.59-0.65). Using the predicted PCs and the corresponding observed spatial patterns, a 35-year cross-validated hindcast over the EA yields a domain-averaged TCC skill is 0.37, which is higher than the MME hind cast skill (0.13). The estimated potential attainable pattern correlation coefficient skill averaged over the entire domain is around 0.61, suggesting that the current models’ prediction may have large rooms to improve.",

            "abstract": "The role of the tropics in past and future climate change has garnered significant attention in recent decades, but debate still exists over climate linkages between the tropics and the middle and high latitudes. Glaciers in tropical mountains are highly sensitive indicators of climate, and glacial landforms left behind by past glacier fluctuations provide key evidence of paleoclimate trends and their forcing mechanisms. We investigated late Quaternary glacial chronology from two glaciated valleys on the Chirripó massif in the Cordillera de Talamanca, Costa Rica. Previous studies in this highland have constrained the most recent deglaciation to 12.4–9.7 ka cal BP based on radiocarbon dates on basal sediments of glacial lakes within the cirque at the head of the Morrenas Valley. However, no studies have been conducted to constrain the ages of the moraines located down valley. We dated the formation ages of these moraines in the Morrenas and Talari valleys using cosmogenic Cl-36 surface exposure dating. Our results indicate a major glacial event ~21–18 ka, broadly synchronous with the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Glaciers during this period advanced 3.2–3.4 km down valley on both sides of the Chirripó massif. Our ages also suggest periods of glacial retreat or standstills ~18–10 ka before complete deglaciation of this highland ~10 ka. These results provide insight into the timing and extent of glacial events in this tropical highland that is of critical importance for reconstructing regional and global climate patterns.",

            "abstract": "The glaciers of the Cordillera Blanca, Peru are rapidly retreating as a result of rising temperatures, transforming the hydrology and impacting the socio-economic and environmental systems of the Rio Santa basin. Documenting the heterogeneous spatial patterns of these changes to understand processes of water storage and flow is hindered by technologic and logistic challenges. Highly complex topography, cloud cover and coarse spatial resolution limit the application of satellite data while airborne data collection remains costly and potentially dangerous. However, recent developments have made Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology a viable and potentially transformative method for studying glacier dynamics and proglacial hydrology.\nThe extreme altitudes (4000-6700m) of the Cordillera Blanca limit the use of 'off the shelf' UAVs. Therefore we developed a low cost multispectral (visible, near-infrared and thermal infrared) multirotor UAV capable of conducting fully autonomous aerial surveys at elevations over 5000m within the glacial valleys of the Cordillera Blanca. Using this platform we have completed repeat aerial surveys (in 2014 and 2015) of the debris covered Llaca Glacier, generating highly accurate 10-20cm DEM's and 5cm orthomosaics using a structure from motion workflow. Analysis of these data reveals a highly dynamic system with some areas of the glacier losing as much as 16m of vertical elevation, while other areas have gained up to 5m of elevation over one year. The magnitude and direction of these changes appears to be associated with the presence of debris free ice faces and meltwater ponds. Additionally, we have mapped proglacial meadow and wetland systems. Thermal mosaics at 10-20cm resolution are providing novel insights into the hydrologic pathways of glacier meltwater including mapping the distribution of artesian springs that feed these wetland systems. The high spatial resolution of these UAV datasets facilitates a better understanding of the spatial variability in and controls on glacier dynamics and proglacial surface/subsurface hydrology within the Cordillera Blanca. We discuss the technical details of the platform, the challenges of conducting UAV surveys at high elevation and share insights from our findings at Llaca Glacier and within the proglacial wetland systems.",

            "abstract": "Titan is the only place in the solar system, besides Earth, to have stable bodies of liquids on its surface. The three large seas and most of the lakes are located in the northern pole area [1]. They are major reservoirs of organic material [2]. Questions related to the variability in composition of the seas [2] and their interaction [3] can be addressed by dedicated observations. For this purpose, the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) observed the area between Ligeia Mare and Kraken Mare, Titan’s two largest seas on February 12, 2015. The location of the specular point was close to the strait that has been suggested to link Ligeia and Kraken [4]. As demonstrated by previous observations of specular reflections on the lakes and seas [5, 6], such observations provide a means to assess the presence of liquids and the dynamics of the liquid surface.\nThe VIMS observation provides images of the strait, named Trevize fretum, with a footprint of about 3 km. It shows a remarkable correlation with the radar images, suggesting that no major changes in the level of the seas have occurred in the last 10 years, a third of a Titan year. Very strong values of I/F at 5-μm suggest specular reflection away from the specular point on the Ligiea outlet. This is consistent with the presence of waves which can be generated by either winds or strong currents between Kraken Mare and Ligeia mare. Such currents can be generated during Titan’s orbital motion around Saturn. We have investigated the volume of liquids that would transit through Trevize fretum during a Titan day and have found that the flow would be in a turbulent regime for the value of the mean anomaly at the time of the VIMS observation. Although subsurface communication between the two seas cannot be ruled out, the present observation underlines the role of the strait in providing exchange of fluids between the two large seas.\nThis work has been performed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under contract to NASA.\n[1] Stofan et al.

            "abstract": "South Asia faces severe challenges to meet the need of water for agricultural, domestic and industrial purposes while coping with the threats posed by climate and land use/cover changes on regional hydrology. South Asia is also characterized by extreme climate contrasts, remote and poorly-monitored headwaters regions, and large uncertainties in estimates of consumptive water withdrawals. Here, we present results from the South Asia Land Data Assimilation System (South Asia LDAS) that apply multiple simulations involving different combination of forcing datasets, land surface models, and satellite-derived parameter datasets to characterize the distributed water balance of the subcontinent. The South Asia LDAS ensemble of simulations provides a range of uncertainty associated with model products. The system includes customized irrigation schemes to capture water use and HYMAP streamflow routing for application to floods. This presentation focuses on two key application areas for South Asia LDAS: the representation of extreme floods in transboundary rivers, and the estimate of water use in irrigated agriculture. We show that South Asia LDAS captures important features of both phenomena, address opportunities and barriers for the use of South Asia LDAS in decision support, and review uncertainties and limitations.This work is being performed by an interdisciplinary team of scientists and decision makers, to ensure that the modeling system meets the needs of decision makers at national and regional levels.",

Leaf age is particularly important for carbon-rich tropical evergreen forests, as leaf demography (leaf age distribution) has been proposed as a major driver of seasonal productivity in these forests.\nWe explore leaf reflectance as a tool to monitor leaf age and develop a novel spectra-based (PLSR) model to predict age using data from a phenological study of 1,072 leaves from 12 lowland Amazonian canopy tree species in southern Peru.\nOur results demonstrate monotonic decreases in LWC and Pmass and increase in LMA with age across species; Nmass and Cmassshowed monotonic but species-specific age responses. Spectrally, we observed large age-related variation across species, with the most age-sensitive spectral domains found to be: green peak (550nm), red edge (680–750 nm), NIR (700-850 nm), and around the main water absorption features (~1450 and ~1940 nm). A spectra-based model was more accurate in predicting leaf age (R2= 0.86; %RMSE= 33) compared to trait-based models using single (R2=0.07 to 0.73; %RMSE=7 to 38) and multiple predictors (step-wise analysis; R2=0.76; %RMSE=28). Spectral and trait-based models established a physiochemical basis for the spectral age model. The relative importance of the traits modifying the leaf spectra of aging leaves was: LWC>LMA>Nmass>Pmass,&Cmass. Vegetation indices (VIs), including NDVI, EVI2, NDWI and PRI were all age-dependent.\nThis study highlights the importance of leaf age as a mediator of leaf traits, provides evidence of age-related leaf reflectance changes that have important impacts on VIs used to monitor canopy dynamics and productivity, and proposes a new approach to predicting and monitoring leaf age with important implications for remote sensing.",

After accumulating `rainfall events' defined as a set of contiguous rainy pixels of TRMM PR measurements for each 2.5 x 2.5 degree grid cell, three different types of regional extreme rainfall events are defined in each grid cell, using the maximum values of near-surface rainfall rate (NSR) and 40-dBZ echo top height (ETH40) in rainfall events; R-only (H-only) extreme events are defined as rainfall events of which the maximum NSR (ETH40) is within top 0.1% but the ETH40 (NSR) is not; RH extreme events are defined as those of which both the maxima of NSR and ETH40 are within top 0.1%.\nOnly a small fraction of rainfall extreme events are found to be related to convective extremes. The results demonstrate that, even in regions where severe convective storms are representative extreme weather events, the heaviest rainfall events are mostly associated with less intense convection. There are robust differences in echo profiles, rainfall characteristics, and local environments between extreme rainfall and convection events, irrespective of region. Extreme rainfall events exhibit lower echo-top height and downward increase of radar reflectivity (Ze) below the freezing level, whereas extreme convection events exhibit more vertically aligned echo structure. The echo and environmental characteristics of extreme rainfall events imply the importance of warm-rain processes in producing extreme rainfall.\nAn important concern regarding the PR measurements in Ku band is significant attenuation by severe hailstorms. We performed a statistical evaluation of the PR measurements using 5-yr measurements obtained during the Baiu season (May-June) using a ground-based C-band radar in Okinawa, Japan, and confirmed that the attenuation correction method for PR reflectivity works correctly, at least qualitatively, in this region. We are also continuing to evaluate this important issue using data from WSR-88D radars in the United States for some of their severe storms.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying bedload transport in mountain stream is of the highest importance for predicting morphodynamics and risks during flood events, and for planning river management practices. At the scale of single flood event, the relationship between water discharge and bedload transport rate often reveals hysteretic loops. When sediment transport peaks before water discharge the hysteresis is clockwise, and this has been related to unlimited sediment supply conditions such as loose sediments left by previous floods on the channel. On the contrary, counterclockwise hysteresis has also been observed and mainly related to limited sediment supply conditions, such as consolidated grains on the bed surface due to long low-flows periods. Understanding the direction and magnitude of hysteresis at the single flood event can thus reveal the sediment availability. Also, interpreting temporal trend of hysteresis could be used to infer the dynamics of sediment sources. This work is focused in the temporal trend of hysteresis pattern of bedload transport in a small (27 km2) glaciarized catchment in the Andes of central Chile (Estero Morales) during the ablation season from October 2014 to March 2015. Bedload was measured indirectly using a Japanese acoustic pipe sensor which detects the acoustic vibrations induced by particles hitting the device. A preliminary analysis of the collected data reveals that hysteresis of single floods due to snow- and glacier-melting index follow patterns according to the season. Clockwise hysteresis is typical in events occurring in late spring and early summer, while counterclockwise appears mostly in the summer season. The hysteresis index tends to decrease from spring to late summer, indicating a progressive shift from clockwise to counterclockwise loops. This pattern suggest that sediment availability decreases overtime probably due to the progressive exhaustion of sediments stored in the channel bed.\nThis research is being developed within the framework of Project FONDECYT 1130378.",

From these spectra, accurate and precise column-averaged abundances of atmospheric constituents including CO2, CH4, H2O, and others are retrieved. Use of TCCON FTS observations is an appropriate way to validate satellite observations (SCIAMACHY, GOSAT, OCO-2). However, our knowledge about TCCON observations is limited. The retrievals from the ground based FTSs report column-averaged abundances, so the concentration distribution along the vertical profile as well as value and location of sources affecting the concentration are mainly unknown. Studying the footprint is especially important for sites located near regions with different emissions or sinks of GHG’s, e.g. for coastal stations, where marine air masses are mixed with continental ones.\nIn this work, we use the National Institute for Environmental Studies (NIES) Eulerian three-dimensional transport model (TM) and the FLEXPART Lagrangian plume diffusion model (LPDM) to determine footprints of operational and future TCCON FTS observational sites. The NIES model was previously used to study the seasonal and inter-annual variability of CO2 and CH4. In paper by Belikov at al. (ACP, 2013) we shows, that the NIES model is able to successfully reproduce the vertical profile of greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, SF6) and the seasonal and inter-annual variability of XCO2 and XCH4. Using this fact, NIES TM CO2concentrations sampled at the level of 1 km above ground and at 13:00 of local time were used to initialize backward tracer simulation with FLEXPART model. The sampling time is selected to fit the overpass time of satellites measuring greenhouse gases and because the NIES TM is more successful at reproducing diurnal tracer variations.\nBased on the FLEXPART back-trajectory simulations, we estimate footprints of operational and future TCCON FTS sites. These footprints are used to test different methods of co-location of XCO2 from TCCON and the NIES model, and TCCON and GOSAT products.",

            "abstract": "High latitude permafrost soils are estimated to store 1,330 – 1,580 Pg C, which account for ca. 40% of global soil C and nearly twice that of atmospheric C. Disproportionate heating of high latitude regions during climate warming potentially results in permafrost thaw and degradation of surficial and previously-frozen soil C. Understanding how newly-thawed soils respond to microbial degradation is essential to predicting C emissions from this region. Laboratory incubations have been a key tool in understanding potential respiration rates from high latitude soils. A recent study found that among the common soil measurements, C:N was the best predictor of C losses.\nHere, we analyzed Alaskan Arctic tundra soils from before and after a nearly 3-year laboratory incubation. Bulk geochemical values as well as the following biomarkers were measured: lignin, amino acids, n-alkanes, and glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGT). We found that initial C:N did not predict C losses and no significant change in C:N between initial and final samples. The lignin acid to aldehyde (Ad:Al) degradation index showed the same results with a lack of C loss prediction and no significant change during the experiment. However, we did find that C:N and Ad:Al had a significant negative correlation suggesting behavior consistent with expectations. The failure to predict C losses was likely influenced by a number of factors, including the possibility that biomarkers were tracking a smaller fraction of slower cycling components of soil C. To better interpret these results, we also used a hydroxyproline-based amino acid degradation index and n-alkanes to estimate the contribution Sphagnum mosses to soil samples - known to have slower turnover times than vascular plants. Finally, we applied a GDGT soil temperature proxy to estimate the growing season soil temperatures before each incubation, as well as investigating the effects of incubation temperature on the index’s temperature estimate.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU2015ver151212.pdf\nOn December 7, 2012, an earthquake doublet (two consecutive earthquakes) occurred in the subducting Pacific slab near the rupture area of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake. A reverse faulting event with a focal depth of ~ 60 km occurred, which was followed by a normal faulting event at a depth of ~ 20 km. The size of the two events were almost the same, Mw 7.2 and the time interval was ~ 10 seconds. When the doublet occurred, 19 ocean bottom pressure gauges were deployed along the trench slope of the Japan Trench, near the epicenter of the doublet and obtained high quality tsunami records. The analyses of the local tsunami waveforms are supposed to improve the fault model and help to understand the rupture process of the doublet, strongly affected by the post-2011 stress state in the subducting slab.\nAs the first step of the analyses, we inverted tsunami waveforms for estimating the initial sea-surface height distribution. Comparing the tsunami source with the Global CMT solution, we found that the subsided area can be reproduced only by the 2nd normal faulting event, but the 1st deep thrust event substantially contributed to form the uplift area. Then we estimated the fault model comprised of two planer rectangles based on the result of the initial sea-surface height inversion of the first step. The depths of the lower edge of the shallower fault plane and the upper edge the deeper fault plane were almost identical, about 40 km. This depth corresponds with the lower limit of the focal depth distribution of the normal faulting intraplate small earthquakes after the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake (Obana et al., 2012). The estimated fault extent of the shallower event of the doublet is consistent with the normal faulting aftershocks activity in depth extent. Seno and Gonzalez (1987) reported a reverse faulting earthquake of Mw 4.7 occurred at a depth of 41 km in 1967 around this area. Since the depth to the upper edge of the fault plane of the compressional event corresponds with the focal depth of this old compressional earthquake, we interpret that a compressional stress field below ~ 40 km have been persistent. Our future study using seafloor observation will clarify the hypocenter location on the rupture plane extent to reveal the relationship between the post-2011 stress state and the rupture processes of the doublet.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU2015_Guy_Arkansas_Earthquakes_vFinal.pdf\nRecent seismicity rate increases in the central United States have been attributed to injection of wastewater from oil and gas production. One example is the Guy-Greenbrier, Arkansas, earthquake sequence, which occurred from July 2010 through October 2011, and was potentially induced by fluid injection into nearby disposal wells (Horton, 2012). Although the Arkansas seismic network is sparse, a single 3-component station WHAR recorded continuous data before, during, and after this earthquake sequence at distances ranging from 2-9 km. Huang and Beroza (2015) used template matching to detect over 100 times the number of cataloged earthquakes by cross-correlating the continuous data with waveform templates based on known earthquakes to search for additional low-magnitude events. Because known waveform templates do not necessarily fully represent all seismic signals in the continuous data, small earthquakes from unknown sources could have escaped detection.\nWe use a method called Fingerprint And Similarity Thresholding (FAST) to detect additional low-magnitude earthquakes that were missed by template matching. FAST enables fast, scalable search for earthquakes with similar waveforms without making prior assumptions about the seismic signal of interest. FAST, based on a data mining technique, first creates compact “fingerprints” of waveforms by extracting discriminative features, then uses locality-sensitive hashing to organize and efficiently search for similar fingerprints (and therefore similar earthquake waveforms) in a probabilistic manner. With FAST, each search query is processed in near-constant time, independent of the dataset size; this computational efficiency is gained at the expense of an approximate, rather than exact, search. During one week of continuous data at station WHAR, from 2010-07-01 to 2010-07-08, FAST detected over 200 uncataloged earthquakes that were not found through template matching. These newly detected earthquakes have the potential to add insight into how earthquake sequences begin, and can provide sensitive, high temporal resolution observations of seismicity evolution with sparse instrumental coverage.",

            "abstract": "Optical mineralogy is not an easy skill to master as an undergraduate, but it is crucial for understanding what the Earth is made out of. It is a supplementary and specific skillset typically taught in a microscope lab supporting lessons on crystallography, chemistry and mineral analysis in the classroom. Mastering the basic skills is required for advancement in courses that utilize thin sections in teaching igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. This project asks: Will exposing undergraduate Earth and environmental studies students to optical microscopy figures in videos prior to lab assist in the acquisition of skills required to describe and distinguish Earth materials? This project is conducted in conjunction with the Blended and Online Learning Design (BOLD) Fellowship offered through the Center for Teaching (CFT) at Vanderbilt University. Eight videos and accompanying pre-lab questions were hosted online weekly in a semester-long, undergraduate Earth materials course. The focus of the design of the videos and supporting questions is specifically on microscopy skills rather than on optics concepts, which is taught post-video. The videos were made available prior to a weekly lab with the intent of familiarizing the student with the types of images and information he/she should obtain with the microscope. Multiple choice, formative-style questions accompany the videos in an online-hosted assignment. These questions are graded on basis of completion and are intended to aid in student metacognition. Subjects include students in the Vanderbilt University Earth Materials course and students from the Hanover College Mineralogy course. The effectiveness of the videos is assessed in two parts: (1) Comparing the homework and lab final grades of the students this year with those of the students last year (2) Analysis of a weekly questionnaire. The answers after each week will be compiled and compared. Collecting data from Vanderbilt University students and Hanover College students diversifies the student population for this study, making it more comprehensive and applicable across different types of institutions. We will use our assessment of the effectiveness of the videos this year to modify and improve the videos and their use in future offerings of the courses.",

            "abstract": "Ouimet et al. (2014; submitted) have recently described broad areas of anomalously low relief and slope that straddle the topographic ridge crest in Taiwan. The areas are anomalous because Taiwan also preserves some of the steepest topography in the world, as expected from the high rates of convergence, exhumation and erosion. In addition, several age-elevation data sets (see Hsu et al. this meeting), using new and previously published ZrnFT, ZrnHe and ApFT ages, show exhumation cooling rates of 3 to 5 mm/yr since ~1.5-2.0 Ma, which is consistent with the exposure of reset zircons beneath the surfaces. Erosion rates of this magnitude, however, are expected to produce significant topographic relief, making it difficult to generate a topographic surface of low slope and low relief centered on the ridge crest. Very young ApFT and ZrnHe ages (e.g., < 0.5 Ma) also suggest a more recent acceleration in exhumation cooling.\nA relatively large area of low relief centered on the top of the submarine accretionary prism south of Taiwan may provide a solution for this conundrum. The area covers ca 1000 km2, has a mean elevation of ca 450 m below sea level and appears to be composed of hard, intact rocks rather than unlithified deep sea muds. Several attempts at gravity and piston coring failed to penetrate the substrate and samples retrieved in the core catcher include rounded clasts of quartz and siltstone. Geophysical studies also show high Vp velocities at relatively shallow depths beneath the sea floor, suggesting the removal of a significant volume of sediment and rock, presumably through erosion. We propose that this low relief plateau serves as a modern analog for the formation of the low relief surfaces that currently straddle the ridge crest in Taiwan.\nIf this interpretation is correct, it suggests a tectonic model in which submarine erosion processes modulate vertical growth of the prism until collision of thick continental crust promotes uplift that outpaces erosion. This requires significant erosion rates (e.g., mm/yr) in the shallow water marine environment. Based on the young ApFT and ZrnHe ages, we propose that emergence of the prism occurred less than about a half a million years ago, and that this hypothesis could be tested by chronologic and thermochronologic data from cores retrieved through submarine drilling.",

            "abstract": "The Manila subduction zone is located at the convergent boundary between the Philippine Sea Plate and the Sunda/Eurasian Plate from offshore Taiwan to northern Luzon of Philippines, where only infrequent M7 earthquakes were observed in modern seismological instrumentation history. The lack of great events (M8+) indicates the subduction fault is either aseismically slipping or is accumulating strain energy toward rapid release in a great earthquake. Here we conduct numerical simulations of earthquake rupture sequences in the framework of rate-state-friction along the 15-19.5ºN segment of the 3D plate boundary with subducted seamounts. Rate-state frictional properties are constrained by laboratory friction experiments conducted on IODP Expedition 349, South China Sea (SCS), drilling samples from the basaltic basement rock under 100ºC – 600ºC, effective normal stress of 50 MPa and pore pressure of 100 MPa.\nDuring the modeled 2000-year period, the maximum magnitude of earthquakes is Mw7. Each sequence repeats every ~200 years and is consisted of three sub-events, event 1 (Mw7) that can overcome the barrier, where dip angle changes most rapidly along the strike, to rupture the entire fault. Events 2 (Mw 6.4) and 3 (Mw 5.7) are of smaller magnitudes and result in north-south segmented rupture pattern. We further quantify the potential of earthquake nucleation by the S-ratio (lower S ratio means the initial stress is closer to peak strength, hence more likely to nucleate an earthquake). The subducted seamount shows higher S-ratios than its surroundings mostly, implying an unlikely nucleate area. Our results are qualitatively similar to 2D subduction earthquake modeling by Herrendörfer et al. (2015, 2-3 events per supercycle and median long-term S is 0.5-1).\nFinally, we plan to use our coseismic rupture model results as inputs for a tsunami propagation model in SCS. Compared to the kinematic seafloor deformation input, our physics-based earthquake source model and its ability to explore a broad range of parameters, including the location and shape of subducted seamounts, will help improve earthquake and tsunami hazards assessment and mitigation in the populated regions around the SCS.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU-NZ-locking2.pdf\nThe Hikurangi subduction margin adjacent to the North Island, New Zealand, displays a variation in interseismic coupling behavior along strike, with shallow coupling in the north and deeper coupling in the south (Wallace et al., 2012). With new information such as an improved interface geometry, a New Zealand-wide seismic velocity model and an increased density and duration of geodetic networks, it is now possible to provide a much more detailed picture of interseismic coupling at the Hikurangi margin than in previous studies. In previous work (Williams and Wallace, 2015), we examined the effects of material property variations on slip estimates for slow slip events (SSEs) along the Hikurangi margin, and found that in cases where the slip is deep or there is good geodetic coverage above the slipping region, heterogeneous models generally predict about 20% less slip than elastic half-space models. Based on those results, we anticipate that interseismic coupling models that account for elastic heterogeneity will also predict similarly lower slip deficit rates in such regions.\nTo explore these ideas, we are developing a new interseismic coupling model for the North Island. We use a New Zealand-wide seismic velocity model (Eberhart-Phillips et al., 2010) to provide elastic properties and an improved Hikurangi interface geometry (Williams et al., 2013) as the basis for our subduction geometry. In addition to the Hikurangi subduction interface, we generate finite element meshes for 20 additional faults that compose the North Island portion of the elastic block model of Wallace et al. (2012). We generate Green’s functions for all faults using the PyLith finite element code (Aagaard et al., 2013), and then use the Defnode geodetic inversion code (McCaffrey, 1995; 2002) to invert for block rotation poles and interseismic coupling. Our revised coupling model should provide better constraints on interseismic coupling in the North Island, and should thus provide a better foundation to inform seismic hazard estimates.",

The sensors are strategically placed to measure snow depth across elevation gradients and local differences in slope, aspect and canopy coverage. The sensors provided near-real-time snow-depth readings during the 2014 and 2015 snow seasons. Also, time series of snow water equivalent (SWE) maps were reconstructed for 2012-2014 using energy-balance modeling with modeled energy forcings (NLDAS), terrain corrections for solar radiation (TOPORAD), and fractional snow cover data (MODIS). We blended the real-time snow-depth readings with the historical SWE reconstructions to interpolate real-time SWE conditions across the basin. Snow-depth readings from all sensors for selected dates in 2014 were converted into SWE estimates using density values from snow-pillow sites in the basin. SWE values for pixels where sensors were located were extracted from the reconstructed 2012-2013 data to develop a time-series array. Using a Nearest-Neighbor algorithm we searched the array for the closest conditions that matched the sensor data, interpolated the residuals between reconstructed versus measured SWE across the basin, and added the interpolated values to the reconstructed SWE. We also blended the sensor measurements with the 2014 reconstruction results that were from the same dates. We evaluated both the historical SWE blending results and the concurrent SWE blending results with the operational networks measurements, finding that the concurrent SWE blending has a slightly lower RMSE compared to that of historical SWE blending. Since the reconstruction results could only be estimated after the end of the season, concurrent SWE blending is not applicable to the real time SWE interpolation even though it has a more accurate estimation. However, the small difference of RMSE between the two approaches informs us that the historical blending is better fitted for real time SWE interpolation.",

Input to the DIRINDEX model comprised 1.) the 3-hourly all-sky and clear-sky GHIs from the GEWEX SRB dataset; 2.) the surface pressure and the atmospheric column water vapor from the GEOS4 dataset; and 3.) daily mean aerosol optical depth at 700 nm derived from the daily mean aerosol data from the Model of Atmospheric Transport and CHemistry (MATCH). The GEWEX SRB data is spatially available on a quasi-equal-area global grid system consisting of 44016 boxes ranging from 1 degree latitude by 1 degree longitude around the Equator to 1 degree latitude by 120 degree longitude next to the poles. The derived DNIs were on the same grid system. Due to the limited availability of the MATCH aerosol data, the model was applied to the years from 2000 to 2005 only. The results were compared with ground-based measurements from 39 sites of the Baseline Surface Radiation Network (BSRN). The comparison statistics show that the results were in better agreement with their BSRN counterparts than the current Surface meteorology and Solar Energy (SSE) Release 6.0 data (https://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/sse/). In this paper, we present results from the model over the entire time span of the GEWEX SRB Release 3.0 data (July 1983 to December2007) in which the MERRA atmospheric data were substituted for the GEOS4 data, and the Max-Planck Aerosol Climatology Version 1 (MAC-v1) data for the MATCH data. As a consequence, we derived a 24.5-year DNI dataset of global coverage continuous from July 1983 to December 2007. Comparisons with the BSRN data show that the results are comparable in quality with that from the earlier application.",

            "abstract": "Shallow lakes can undergo rapid changes in key biotic components. These phenomena, which include loss of submerged macrophytes, fish kills and algal blooms, can occur at sub-seasonal timescales and are often reported to be non-linear, threshold responses to a gradual intensification of an external driver and reflective of a change in state. Although such threshold responses are widely reported, a recent meta-analysis found that most such changes cannot be unequivocally confirmed as true threshold responses. This is because clear records of system stability in the face of a gradual increase in external driver intensity followed by rapid system change are lacking, as are records of post threshold stability in the new state following release of external driver pressure. That threshold responses were not confirmed often reflects insufficient time series of before or after data to establish driver variability and ecosystem stability. In this context, paleo studies provide a means to clearly identify non-linear, threshold responses in shallow lake ecosystems.\nThe challenge of detecting evidence of non-linear responses in shallow lake ecosystems is often seen as a chronological one. Highly resolved and accurate sediment chronologies coupled with historical records of external driver intensity do provide a means to detect non-linear, threshold responses, but such chronologies are rare in shallow lakes. Fortunately, the ‘tight chronology-historical record of external driver’ approach is not the only, or even the most direct, way to detect non-linear ecosystem responses in paleo records. An alternative, more direct approach is ecosystem response and external driver intensity to be preserved in the same sedimentary record. Theoretically, it is arguable whether any chronological control is needed at all to determine if a non-linear response has occurred, for the key is not how quickly an ecosystem response may occur or if it is linear with respect to time, it is whether it is linear with respect to driver intensity. Accordingly, it is proposed that researchers seeking to detect and understand non-linear ecosystem responses in paleorecords should focus on deriving sedimentary records of external driver intensity rather than expensive and likely futile efforts to derive high resolution chronologies.",

Past and present marine research across a broad spectrum of disciplines is shedding light on what sectors of the ecosystem and the human dimension will be most impacted. In a grassroots approach to extend existing research efforts, leveraging recently completed downscaled climate projections for the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands region, we convened a team of 30 researchers-- with expertise ranging from anthropology to zooplankton to marine mammals-- to assess climate projections in the context of their expertise. This Aleutian-Bering Climate Vulnerability Assessment (ABCVA) began with researchers working in five teams to evaluate the vulnerabilities of key species and ecosystem services relative to projected changes in climate. Each team identified initial vulnerabilities for their focal species or services, and made recommendations for further research and information needs that would help managers and communities better understand the implications of the changing climate in this region. Those draft recommendations were shared during two focused, public sessions held within two hub communities for the Bering and Aleutian region: Unalaska and St. Paul. Qualitative insights about local concerns and observations relative to climate change were collected during these sessions, to be compared to the recommendations being made by the ABCVA team of researchers. Finally, we used a Structured Decision Making process to prioritize the recommendations of participating scientists, and integrate the insights shared during our community sessions. This work brought together residents, stakeholders, scientists, and natural resource managers to collaboratively identify priorities for addressing current and expected future impacts of climate change. Recommendations from this project will be incorporated into future research efforts of the Aleutian and Bering Sea Islands Landscape Conservation Cooperative (ABSI LCC), the Alaska Ocean Observing System (AOOS), and the Alaska Climate Science Center.",

The NASA Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (SEDAC) operated by the Center for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) at Columbia University has had a long track record in developing reference data layers for human population and settlements and is expanding its efforts on topics such as intercity roads, reservoirs and dams, and energy infrastructure. SEDAC has set as a strategic priority the acquisition, development, and dissemination of data resources derived from remote sensing and socioeconomic data on urban land use change, including temporally and spatially disaggregated data on urban change and rates of change, the built infrastructure, and critical facilities.\nWe report here on a range of past and ongoing activities, including the Global Human Settlements Layer effort led by the European Commission’s Joint Research Centre (JRC), the Global Exposure Database for the Global Earthquake Model (GED4GEM) project, the Global Roads Open Access Data Working Group (gROADS) of the Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA), and recent work with ImageCat, Inc. to improve estimates of the exposure and fragility of buildings, road and rail infrastructure, and other facilities with respect to selected natural hazards. New efforts such as the proposed Global Human Settlement indicators initiative of the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) could help fill critical gaps and link potential reference data layers with user needs. We highlight key sectors and themes that require further attention, and the many significant challenges that remain in developing comprehensive, high quality, up-to-date, and well maintained reference data layers on population and built infrastructure. The need for improved indicators of sustainable development in the context of the post-2015 development framework provides an opportunity to link data efforts directly with international development needs and investments.",

            "abstract": "Chlorophyll fluorescence emission from ecosystem induced by sunlight (Sun-Induced Fluorescence: SIF) is now a key factor to accurately estimate the ecosystem-level photosynthesis activity as suggested by satellite studies, and has been recently detected by satellites [Frankenberg et al., 2011; Guanter et al., 2012; Joiner et al., 2013] and measured at field stations [Daumard et al., 2010; Porcar-Castell, 2011]. However, the few example of field-based assessment on the representation ability reduces its value for the availability to better understand the dynamics in CO2uptake by land ecosystem.\nTo elucidate the potential of SIF to estimate ecosystem GPP in typical Asian crop type, the canopy-top SIF was calculated from the spectrum data in Japanese rice paddy field in Mase in central Japan (36°03′N, 140°01′E, 11 m a.s.l.), and compared with eddy-tower measured GPP on half-hourly and daily bases during seven years from 2006 to 2012. The rice (Oriza sativa L.; cultivar Koshihikari) was transplanted in May and harvested in September normally. The SIF was estimated from the spectrums of downward Sun irradiance and upward canopy-reflected radiance measured at the height of 3m above ground by HemiSpherical Spectro-Radiometer (HSSR), consisting of the spectroradiometer (MS-700, Eko inc., Tokyo, Japan) with the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of 10 nm and wavelength interval of 3.3 nm. The SIF around 760nm (O2-A band: Fs760) was calculated according to the Fraunhofer Line Depth principle [Maier et al., 2003] with several additional arrangements.\nThe GPP increased almost linearly as both Fs760 and APAR (Absorbed Photosyntethically Active Radiation) increased based on monthly-averaged diurnal courses during the growing season in 2006. The slopes of their regression lines differed much among the months in APAR, but in Fs760. These nearly constant relationships among the months between GPP and Fs760 were kept for all the observation years. Daily averaged GPP and Fs760 indicated similar seasonality for multiple years although the conventional vegetation indices, NDVI and EVI, showed the smoothed temporal variations but with longer maximum period than GPP showed. Thus, those strong relationships of SIF to GPP confirmed that the SIF is a quite useful proxy of ecosystem-level photosynthesis in the rice paddy field.",

            "abstract": "A proposed methodology is based on estimated groundwater volumes from tritium river water measurements in the Ishikari River basin of Hokkaido Island, Japan. In our drought assessment, we characterize a groundwater storage that is available and can be used for the water supply during prolonged droughts. For the groundwater storage estimation, we utilized tritium river water measurements obtained during baseflows to estimate water mean transit times (MTTs). Tritium is ideally suited for characterization of the catchment’s responses in river water samples with MTTs times up to 200 years. Tritium is a component of meteoric water, decays with a half-life of 12.32 years, and is inert in the subsurface. In Hokkaido, river water samples were collected in June, July and October 2014 at selected river gauging stations operated by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT). These stations record hourly water levels, have catchment areas between 45 and 377 km2 and are located upstream of MLIT dams at altitudes between 36 m and 860 m MSL. The measured tritium ranged between 4.065 TU (±0.07) and 5.290 TU (±0.09) with both lowest and highest tritium values analysed in June river samples at Tougeshita and Okukatsura stations, respectively. For the MTT estimation, we selected exponential(80%)-piston(20%) Lumped Parameter Model (LPM) with constructed tritium in Hokkaido precipitation and obtained a non-unique fit of young (1-11 years) and old (16-98 years) groundwater MTTs. This result indicates that the bomb-peak tritium is still present in Japanese groundwater and may take several years to flush out. From the MTTs and baseflow discharges, the calculated groundwater volume ranges between 13 MCM and 12500 MCM and indicates potentially available groundwater storage during prolonged droughts in the Hokkaido headwater catchments. In the future studies, the accuracy of the estimated groundwater volume can be increased by conducting another tritium sampling at baseflows after 3 years from now. Having tritium series measurements with 3 year interval allows us to choose either young or old MTT value and to reduce ambiguity of LPM mixing parameters. In addition, tritium in precipitation will reach natural levels and one tritium river water sample will be sufficient to estimate a robust groundwater storage volume.",

            "abstract": "Groundwater has a predictable thermal signature that can be used to locate discrete zones of discharge to surface water. These inputs are important for numerous reasons, including habitat stability, refuge for thermally stressed-aquatic species, and focused contaminant or nutrient loading from aquifers. However, because detection and quantification at the appropriate scale can be difficult, many discrete areas of groundwater discharge are not identified. This study compares two increasingly common heat tracing methods that rely on either direct-contact measurements or remote sensing: fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing (FO-DTS) and thermal infrared (TIR). FO-DTS is used to make high spatial resolution thermal measurements through time within the water column using temperature-sensitive cables. These cables can range up to several kilometers long, and can be wrapped for higher spatial resolution (cm). The personnel requirements, and time to install and georeference the cables can be burdensome, and the control units need constant calibration. In contrast, TIR data collection, either from handheld, airborne, or satellite platforms, can quickly capture point-in-time evaluations of groundwater seepage zones across large scales. However the remote TIR measurements are adversely influenced by a number of environmental and physical factors, and the measurements are limited to the surface \"skin\" temperature of water features. We present case studies from a range of lentic to lotic aquatic systems to identify guidelines regarding the effectiveness of FO-DTS and TIR for evaluating groundwater discharge. FO-DTS performs well in all systems across seasons, but data collection was limited spatially by practical considerations. TIR is found to consistently locate groundwater seepage zones above and along the stream bank, but in summer submerged seepage zones are only well identified in <0.5 m depth systems with moderate flow.",

The project recognizes that the enactment of any deflection strategy would require significant international collaboration; thus, we recommend the formation of a Mitigation Action Group (MAG) in addition to the existing organizations IAWN and SMPAG.

            "abstract": "Recent work suggests that the topology of the coronal magnetic field plays a key role in the source and properties of the slow solar wind, through the collection of separatrix surfaces and quasi-separatrix layers (QSLs) that define the S-web (Antiochos et al. 2011; Linker et al. 2011; Titov et al. 2011). We have accumulated extensive experience with using the squashing factor Q to analyze the underlying structural skeleton of the coronal magnetic field, to identify magnetic null points, separator field lines, QSLs, and separatrix surfaces, and their relationship with the topology of coronal hole boundaries. This will be extended by implementing slip mapping (Titov et al. 2009) to detect open, closed, and disconnected flux systems that are formed due to magnetic reconnection in a coronal model driven by both the differential rotation and evolution of the photospheric magnetic field. This idea is based on using forward and backward differences in time between the field line mapping expected from ideal MHD motions and the actual mapping to diagnose magnetic reconnection. This technique can identify regions in the photosphere where closed magnetic field lines are about to open (e.g., via interchange reconnection), and conversely, where open field lines are about to close. We will use these concepts to develop tools that relate the changing magnetic topology to the properties of the solar wind, to plan and interpret Solar Probe Plus and Solar Orbiter observations.\nResearch supported by NASA's Living With a Star Program.",

            "abstract": "Forest structure and dynamics are changing rapidly around the world as a consequence of climate-change-related pests, droughts and wildfires, and changing anthropogenic forest usage. It is critical to understand these changes at the process level (e.g. demographic performance of trees) to accurately predict subsequent forest responses, including impacts on carbon and water cycles, surface-atmosphere energy dynamics, and ecological trajectories. Remote sensing may offer a critical tool to assess and understand these changes at large scales if it can connect observations of forest canopies to underlying biological processes such as demography. Furthermore, too be effective such an approach must be able to assess the full spectrum of forest demographic groups, including those that fall primarily in the shade of larger trees.\nHere we describe recent advances that address this problem by reconstructing high-resolution canopy structure in 3D from airborne LiDAR data and then associating LiDAR derived leaf area strata and leaf area light environments with the stem frequency, biomass and performance of trees in different demographic groups. Focusing on Amazonian forests, we demonstrate how forest structure (e.g., size distributions) may be retrieved by accounting for tree architecture over light environments. Furthermore, by linking LiDAR derived light environments with LiDAR derived (or ground measured) size classes, even a single LiDAR survey can help reveal forest dynamics, while multiple LiDAR surveys across years allow for direct assessment of the role of canopy light environments in demographic dynamics. New advances may unlock the full potential of this approach by including estimates of canopy function, and biophysical environments, and by integrating across scales utilizing measurements from tree plots to space-borne LiDAR. We conclude by illustrating the potential of this approach to inform ecosystem models that explicitly represent forest dynamics and vertical canopy structure, and thereby significantly advance our understanding of forest disturbance and its consequences in the Anthropocene.",

            "abstract": "During the last three years, the East Asian Multi-Satellite Integrated Precipitation (EMSIP) was developed at China Meteorological Administration (CMA) National Meteorological Information Center (NMIC), partially through cooperation with NOAA/CPC. IR TBB data from the FY-2 Geostationary satellite and PMW rain rate retrievals from FY-3B, TRMM, NOAA-18/19, METOP-A/B, and DMSP-F16/17/18 were integrated to produce high-resolution satellite precipitation estimates over East Asia. While the current version of the product relies on retrievals from TMI to inter-calibrate inputs from other platforms, work is underway to improve the quality of EMSIP using retrievals from the GMI.\n As an important step to infuse the GMI into our integration system, a comprehensive evaluation is performed for the precipitation retrievals from the GMI and the 8 other above mentioned PMW sensors with an emphasis on their performance on detecting and quantifying light rain and snowfall. PMW retrievals are compared against in situ measurements from a dense network of automatic rain gauges over China for a cold season month (January 2015). Impacts of infusing GMI precipitation retrievals into our integrated estimates are examined. Results showed improved capacity of the current version GMI retrievals in capturing light rain and snowfall than other sensors for the test period over China. The FAR score, however, is about the same as that for the TMI’s. Partially due to the limited test period, only minor improvements are observed in the EMSIP through infusing GMI. Compared with CMORPH, the correlation of EMSIP and the GMI infused EMSIP is still a little lower over whole china, but sometimes over Tibet Plateau the correlation of EMSIP+GMI is higher than EMSIP and CMORPH.",

Carbonate intensively formed during 150-200 ka, equivalent to Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6, the penultimate glacial time with sea level about 80-100 m lower than present. Most marine methane emanation generated at glacial period or the decline of global sea level, indicating that higher water pressures provide the best conditions for methane hydrate formation.

The ParFlow.CLM modelling platform is an integrated hydrologic model and was used here for simulating land surface and groundwater dynamics over the Baldry sub-catchment in Australia at hourly time intervals. Baldry is located in the central west of New South Wales, has an ephemeral creek and is located in a temperate climate class with hot summers. Here, a multi-criteria evaluation strategy was employed using a range of observed catchment responses, including surface energy fluxes and states of land surface temperature, soil moisture and groundwater level for the period from 2005-2010. Particularly, the use of remotely sensed soil moisture and land surface temperature products obtained from downscaled microwave observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) were explored to test the feasibility of these products for model evaluation at the catchment scale.\nResults suggest high agreement between the temporal dynamics of the model simulations and remotely sensed surface soil moisture and land surface temperature products, with correlation coefficient values of 0.79 and 0.92 respectively. Model comparisons with observed daily groundwater levels show satisfactory model performance (correlation coefficient > 0.5) considering the simple conceptual geological model developed for the study site. Our analyses indicate that the depth to the water table (DTWT) has an important role in controlling evaporation rates and top layer soil moisture distributions in the catchment. The relationship between evaporation rates and DTWT distribution for the six years of simulations shows increased sensitivity during dryer periods. Our results highlight that soil moisture distributions obtained from a physically based integrated hydrologic model have the potential to bridge the spatial scale gap inherent in satellite soil moisture products.",

            "abstract": "Stratification of the Earth's interior into spherically symmetric shells with boundaries that correspond to changes in composition or mineralogical phase is well established and represents a static view. The analysis of long wavelength features of recent 3-D mantle seismic velocity models suggests a somewhat different dynamic stratification, with rheological boundaries that do not always coincide with the known mineralogical transitions. This is reflected in different patterns of the power spectrum, radial correlation functions and overall distribution of degree 2 and 3 anomalies, which dominate the mantle below 300 km depth.\nThe outermost shell (Moho to ~250km depth), i.e. \"heterosphere\", contains surface tectonics, with cooling plates and cratons, and is characterized by strongest lateral heterogeneity. Its lower boundary is defined by a decrease in power by an order of magnitude.\nThe next shell ( 300 ~ 1000 km depth), i.e. \"extended transition zone\" (ETZ), includes the 400 and 660 km discontinuities. Many slabs stagnate above 660 km, but some flatten above 1000 km. While there is no sharp global seismic discontinuity at this depth, the long wavelength structure in the ETZ is strongly decorrelated from that in the rest of the lower mantle.\nStriking features in the bulk of the lower mantle below the ETZ are: 1) long wavelength structure dominated by harmonic degrees 2 and 3 whose expression is strongest at the base of the mantle (the so-called LLSVPs); 2) embedded within them, about 20 broad low velocity plumes, whose vertical orientation indicates the absence of mantle \"wind\". Notably, some of them are deflected horizontally around 1000 km depth or give rise to thinner conduits in the ETZ, suggesting contrasting rheology above and below that depth. The steep heterogeneity gradient in the last 500 km of the mantle indicates the presence of a boundary layer with possibly distinct chemical composition.\nThe “tomographic stratigraphy” presented here may be a useful framework for achieving progress in understanding whole mantle dynamics. In particular, the ~1000 km transition may be a key feature separating relatively vigorous flow in the ETZ from very sluggish motion below. The seismic tomography snapshot thus captures the history of subduction in the last 30 Ma in the ETZ, and below it, the integrated flow for at least 200 Ma.\n   ",

            "abstract": "We conduct a series of meter-scale direct shear experiments along a gabbro/marble fault interface at NIED in Japan. Unlike the transitional behavior from stick-slip to stable sliding along a marble/marble interface under 1.3 MPa normal stress and 0.01 mm/s loading rate, the gabbro/marble case shows persistent stick-slip behavior under the same loading conditions as well as under 2.6 MPa normal stress in subsequent tests. Visual observations of the damage pattern reveal quite different features between the marble/marble case and the gabbro/marble case. For the former, the generated damage typically shows a low aspect ratio between loading-parallel and loading-perpendicular directions, suggesting that some diffusional deformation is effective during slip. For the latter, intruded gabbro pieces with preferred growing direction parallel to loading are distributed on top of the marble side, showing that hard rocks like gabbro can be partially fractured off when sheared against soft rocks like marble. Strain array data show that the apparent friction before failure is high or even above 1 near locations where fractured-off gabbro pieces are later observed, confirming that intact rock strength of gabbro has to be overcome upon the onset of fracture. Although at this moment we do not fully understand the behind mechanism, we believe that the brittleness of gabbro dominates in making the difference. If true, this result will highlight the role of brittle asperities in generating stick-slip fault behavior in a surrounding ductile-like environment. An analogous natural example may be found by the role of seamount in generating earthquakes through or underneath sediments in subduction zones (Cloos, 1992). However, instead of shearing off long-wavelength feature as illustrated by Cloos (1992), our study suggests that the collective behavior of tiny pieces along a nominally flat surface may also generate unstable ruptures macroscopically.",

The PNA exhibits positive (negative) phases with positive (negative) anomalies in geopotential height in the vicinity of Hawaii and over the intermountain region of North America, and negative (positive) anomalies in geopotential height over south of the Aleutian Islands and the Gulf Coast region of the United States. This study examined the impacts of monthly variation of the PNA phase on wintertime surface-layer aerosol concentrations in the United States by analyzing observations during 1999-2013 from the Air Quality System of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA-AQS) and the model results for 1986-2006 from the global three-dimensional Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem). The composite analyses on the EPA-AQS observations over 1999-2003 showed that the average PM2.5 concentrations were higher in the PNA positive phases than in the PNA negative phases by 1.0 µg m-3 (8.6%), 2.1µg m-3 (24.1%), and 1.1 µg m-3 (10.6%) in the eastern, western, and whole of United States, respectively. Relative to the PNA negative phases, the number of exceedance days (days with the PM2.5 concentrations exceeding 35 µg m-3) in the PNA positive phases increased by 5-8 days month-1 in California and the contiguous Great Salt Lake and by 2-3 days month-1 in Iowa. The simulated geographical patterns of the differences in concentrations of PM2.5, nitrate, sulfate, ammonium, OC, and BC between the PNA positive and negative phases were similar to observations. The PNA influences surface-layer aerosol concentrations in the United States by changing meteorological variables such as temperature, precipitation, planetary boundary layer height, relative humidity, and wind speed. We found that that the PNA-induced variation in planetary boundary layer height was the most dominant meteorological factor that influenced the concentrations of PM2.5, sulfate, ammonium, OC, and BC, and the PNA-induced variation in temperature was the most important parameter that influenced nitrate aerosol. Our study has important implication for understanding and prediction of air quality in the United States.",

Reduced snow pack and earlier snow melt will result in a greater reliance on man-made reservoirs and subsurface catchment storage. To gain insight into the subsurface storage volume of high elevation catchments, we studied the residence time distribution of surface water leaving the Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory.\nSince October 2014, we have collected monthly samples of two residence time tracers with contrasting half-lives: sulfur-35 (87.5 days) and tritium (12.32 years). Upstream catchment area at the three nested sampling locations is 1 km2 (P301 sub-catchment), 4 km2 (Providence Creek) and ~50 km2 (Big Creek). Samples were analyzed at LLNL by low level liquid scintillation counting and noble gas mass spectrometry after helium accumulation.\nVariations in tracer concentrations in precipitation, both for tritium (11-24 pCi/L) and sulfur-35 (24-100 mBq/L), complicate straightforward interpretation of residence times. Sulfur-35 concentrations show that last year precipitation contributes 1% - 10% of total stream flow, even during peak snowmelt. Tritium concentrations in stream flow vary between 40% and 60% of the initial concentration in precipitation (15.5 pCi/L), indicating that water leaving the catchment has a residence time on the order of years to decades. Additional analyses of sodium-22 (2.6 year half-life) will aid in deconvoluting the residence time distribution. These low tracer concentrations can be attributed to current severe drought conditions, resulting in low discharge rates and longer residence times.\nThis work performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344.

Here, we chose three typical hydrogeological units in the NCP, which are Hutuo River alluvial fan (HR), the Tianjin Plain in the central alluvial fan (TJ), and the Yellow river aquifer system (YR). Relying on groundwater numerical models through MODFLOW, the water balances were calculated and analyzed accordingly, especially for quantifying individual recharge and discharge contributing terms. Specifically, (1) In the HR, both natural steady-state flow and transient flow models under human activities were implemented. Results indicated groundwater level decreased by around 40m with extensive exploitation, where the total recharge rate, discharge rate, and over-exploitation rate were calculated. (2) In the TJ, groundwater and land subsidence coupled model was established, where the maximum subsidence rate and decrease of groundwater level was estimated. (3) In the YR, the exploitation rate of the groundwater and recharge rate of the aquifer by the Yellow River were calculated.\nWe found that there are big differences among the components of groundwater recharge of the three typical hydrogeological units. Human activities have a clear effect on the recharge and discharge processes. Thus, rational development and protection policies should be issued. In the piedmont alluvial fan, the groundwater was severely over-exploited. Therefore, reduction of groundwater exploitation and groundwater artificial recharge are needed to get the recharge and discharge balanced. In the middle alluvial fan of the NCP, the confined aquifer has been over-exploited and has resulted in regional land subsidence. It suggests the withdrawal of confined aquifer should be strictly limited, especially at the place where alternative water resources are accessible. In the hydrogeological unit of the YR, the groundwater storage is potentially large for exploitation.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU Poster_Donghai Zhang.pdf\nThere has been hotly debating over the closure time of the eastern Paleo-Asian Ocean and the tectonic evolution of the eastern CAOB (Central Asian Orogenic Belt) for decades. To better puzzle out this controversy, we carried out a detailed paleomagnetic study on the Permo-Carboniferous volcanic-sedimentary strata in mid-eastern Inner Mongolia, northeast of China. More than 820 samples were collected from 81 sites and titanium-poor magnetite and hematite are proved as the principal magnetic carriers. (1)In Kingan Block, 9 sites of volcanic rocks from Dashizhai Formation (P1) were calculated to get a mean magnetic direction Dg/Ig = 285.5°/77.4°, kg = 68.2, α95 = 6.8° before and Ds/Is = 206.5°/48.2°, ks = 100.8, α95 = 5.5°, N = 9 after bedding correction, which suggests a paleolatitude of 34.5°±5°N. Both the positive fold test and reversal test suggest a pre-folding magnetization and thus may indicate a primary remanence. (2)Three volcanic sections of Baoligaomiao Formation (C3-P1) from Uliastai Passive Margin were sampled and a mean magnetic direction derived from 16 sites is Dg/Ig = 30.1°/31.8°, kg = 16.3, α95 = 9.8° before and Ds/Is = 65.6°/58.1°, ks = 39.8, α95 = 6.1°, N = 16 after bedding correction. The corresponding paleomagnetic pole Plat. /Plong = 43.1° N/186.7°E, A95=8° suggests a paleolatitude of 38.7°±6.3°N. A primary remanence is confirmed by positive fold test. (3) In the northern margin of NCB (North China Block), a ChRM is successfully isolated from 6 sites of basaltic rocks in Elitu Formation (P2) as Dg/Ig = 351.1°/67.2°, kg = 2.1, α95 = 71.8° before and Ds/Is = 351.1°/29.1°, ks = 32.7, α95 = 71.8°, N = 16 after bedding correction, and thus yielded a paleomagnetic pole as Plat. /Plong = 63.1° N/313.5°E, A95=9.5°, which suggests a paleolatitude of 17.2°±7.2°N. A positive fold test and reversal test indicate that the remanence should be primary. The paleomagetic pole of Kingan Block and Uliastai Passive Margin are located at a common small circle and thus indicates they may share a similar paleolatitude, the huge longitudinal difference should be ascribed to relative rotation afterwards . To the contrary, the paleolatitude of the northern margin of NCB and southern Mongolia is much lower than that of Kingan and Uliastai, which may suggest a remain-opening paleogeography of the Paleo-Asian Ocean by middle Permian.",

            "abstract": "Near the eastern coast of Izu peninsula is an active submarine volcanic region in Japan, where magma intrusions have been observed many times. The forecast of earthquake swarm activities and eruptions are serious concern particularly in nearby hot spring resort areas. It is well known that temporal durations of the swarm activities have been correlated with early volumetric strain changes at a certain observation station of about 20 km distance apart. Therefore the Earthquake Research Committee (2010) investigated some empirical statistical relations to predict sizes of the swarm activity. Here we looked at the background seismicity rate changes during these swarm periods using the non-stationary ETAS model (Kumazawa and Ogata, 2013, 2014), and have found the followings. The modified volumetric strain data, by removing the effect of earth tides, precipitation and coseismic jumps, have significantly higher cross-correlations to the estimated background rates of the ETAS model than to the swarm rate-changes. Specifically, the background seismicity rate synchronizes clearer to the strain change by the lags around a half day. These relations suggest an enhanced prediction of earthquakes in this region using volumetric strain measurements. Hence we propose an extended ETAS model where the background rate is modulated by the volumetric strain data. We have also found that the response function to the strain data can be well approximated by an exponential functions with the same decay rate, but that their intersects are inversely proportional to the distances between the volumetric strain-meter and the onset location of the swarm. Our numerical results by the same proposed model show consistent outcomes for the various major swarms in this region.",

            "abstract": "18O/16O and 17O/16O ratios of atmospheric and dissolved oceanic O2 are key biogeochemical tracers of total photosynthesis and respiration on global to local length scales and glacial/interglacial time scales (Luz et al., 1999). Critical to the use of these ratios as biogeochemical tracers is knowledge of how they are affected by production, consumption, and transport of O2. We present new measurements of O2 respiration by E. coli and N. oceanus, an ammonia oxidizing bacterium, to test three assumptions of isotopically enabled models of the O2 cycle: (i) laboratory-measured respiratory 18O/16O isotope effects (18α) of microorganisms are constant under all experimental and natural conditions (e.g., temperature and growth rate); (ii) the respiratory ‘mass law’ relationship between 18O/16O and 17O/16O [17α = (18α)β] is universal; and (iii) 18α and β for aerobic ammonia and organic carbon oxidation are identical.\nFor E. coli, we find that both 18α and β are variable. From 37°C to 15°C, 18α varies linearly with temperature from 17 to 14‰, and β varies linearly from 0.513 to 0.508. 18α and β do not appear to vary with growth rate (as tested using different carbon sources). Both 18α and β are lower than previous observations for bacteria: 18α = 17-20‰ (Kiddon et al., 1993) and β = 0.515 (Luz and Barkan, 2005). We were able to simulate the observed temperature dependence of 18α and β using a model of respiration with two isotopically discriminating steps: O2 binding to cytochrome bo oxidase (the respiratory enzyme) and reduction of O2 to H2O. Finally, initial results on N. oceanus suggest it has similar values for 18α and β as previously studied aerobic bacteria that consume organic carbon, providing the first support for assumption (iii).\nBased on these results, isotopically constrained biogeochemical models of O2 cycling may need to consider a temperature dependence for 18α and β for microbial respiration. For example, these results may explain why the cold, deep ocean has lower obeserved 18α values (~8‰) than that for warmer surface waters (~19‰; Levine et al., 2009).",

            "abstract": "A hazard assessment of submarine landslide generated tsunami for the east Australian continental slope is presented between Jervis Bay and Fraser Island. Submarine landslides are present in water depths of ~400 to 3500 m along the entire length of continental margin, but are increasingly prevalent northward of Coffs Harbour without clustering at any particular water depth. Two hundred and fifty individual submarine landslide scars greater than one kilometre in width are identified. Of these, thirty-six are calculated to produce a tsunami flow depth equal to or greater than 5 m at the coastline for an assumed landslide downslope velocity of 20 ms-1. Some landslides are both thick (>100 m) and wide (>5 km) and these have the greatest potential to generate the largest coastal flow depths (>10 m). Water depth of the landslides centre of mass strongly influences the onshore height of the tsunami’s surge with the larger events generated in shallower water depths between ~500 -1500 m. Maximum flow depth at the coastline is larger for thicker (50-250+ m) canyon landslides which occur on steeper slopes (>4°), compared to thinner (<50 m) plateau landslides which generally produce smaller tsunami. Maximum inundation distances and run-up heights of 1.6 km and 22 m respectively are calculated for landslide velocities of 20 ms-1. These values vary significantly depending on local coastal topography. There is no evidence for a submarine landslide large enough and young enough to have generated a Holocene megatsunami for the east coast of Australia.",

            "abstract": "A dramatic expansion of C4 plant distribution occurred in the South Asia during the late Miocene and in the East Asia during the Pliocene period, with broad spatial and temporal variations. Although the event is well documented, whether subsequent expansions were caused by a decreased atmospheric CO2 concentration or climate change is a contentious issue. In this study, we used an improved inverse vegetation modeling approach that accounts for the physiological responses of C3 and C4 plants to quantitatively reconstruct the paleoclimate in the Siwalik of South Asia and in the Loess Plateau of East Asia, based on pollen and carbon isotope data. We also studied the sensitivity of the C3 and C4 plants to changes in the climate and the atmospheric CO2 concentration. We suggest that the expansion of the C4 plant distribution since the late Miocene was unlikely caused by reduced CO2 levels alone. The expansion may have been primarily triggered by regional aridification, and seasonal analysis revealed that this climate shift mainly attributed to the summer rainfall decrease. Our findings suggest that this abrupt ecological shift mainly resulted from the weakening of the Asian summer monsoon, which may related to the decrease of SST in the tropic since the late Miocene.",

            "abstract": "Distant earthquake matters. Its long period, long lasted surface waves could bring transient stresses, later the local stress state, and trigger earthquakes and tremors at remote distances. There exists mounting evidences for the role of dynamic stress in slow/fast earthquakes triggering. Yet, little is understood about the similar/different processes for triggered earthquakes and tremors. What is the response of tremors and earthquakes to a remote earthquake? Are the triggered tremor and earthquakes co-located? Are the triggering controlled by the characteristics of distant earthquakeor local physical condition? With generation potential of non-volcanic tremors and frequent earthquake activity, Taiwan serves as a natural laboratory to explore the similarity and difference in triggering response of tremor and earthquakes. Using a collection of Mw ≥ 7.0 events from Sumatra constraint by similar azimuth, we seek to understand the general characteristics of tremors and earthquakes triggered by Sumatra events, furthermore, discuss the predominant factors of triggering in Taiwan.\nBy examining all recordings of the 24 Sumatra Mw ≥ 7.0 earthquakes from 2000 to 2014 , we identified four triggered tremors and 12 triggered earthquakes that occurred during the surface wave passage. The Sumatra earthquakes that triggered tremors are characterized by thrust-type focal mechanisms with right-lateral component and minimum dynamic stress of ~3 kPa. The minimum dynamic stress measured for triggered earthquakes, however, is ~0.4 kPa, smaller than that of triggered tremor. The different location and stress triggering threshold for triggered tremors and earthquakes indicates different triggering mechanisms. Triggered tremors are confined in southern Central Range characterized by high attenuation, high thermal anomaly, the boundary between high and low resistivity, and localized veins on the surfaces distributed, suggesting the involvement of fluids from metamorphic dehydration within the orogen. The good correlation between the location of triggered earthquakes and geothermal anomalies on the other hand, indicates that the regimes hosting geothermal activity are more susceptible to remote earthquake triggering.",

            "abstract": "Present-day and especially time-averaged geomagnetic field directions are highly consistent with the geocentric axial dipole (GAD) model, which also predicts an overall factor-of-two increase in equatorial-to-polar paleointensities (presently ~30 mT to ~60 µT). However, this latitudinal relationship has not been observed in compilations from paleointensity databases, even in the most studied interval of the past 5 Myr. We believe this failure is mostly due to inadequacies in dealing with non-single-domain behaviors that are prevalent in most paleomagnetic recorders. Notable exceptions are recent paleointensity results that focused on near-single-domain samples from rapidly-cooled lavas from Antarctica (78ºS) [Lawrence et al., 2009] and Iceland (~64ºN) [Cromwell et al., 2015]. These high latitude studies show mean polar paleointensities of only ~35 µT, about 50% of the present-day value. In support of these low values as representative of the time-averaged GAD field, a study of Pleistocene lavas from the equatorial Galapagos Islands (~1ºS) that used a correction for multidomain effects [Wang and Kent, 2013] obtained a mean paleointensity of ~20 µT [Wang et al., PNAS in revision]. In a pilot study to check this result, we utilized previously thermally demagnetized Plio-Pleistocene lavas from Mount Kenya (~0º) [Opdyke et al., 2010]. We chose 3 specimens from each of 30 lava sites with coherent directions and not exhibiting any indications of having been struck by lightning. We gave the specimens a total TRM at 580ºC in 15 µT lab-applied field, then thermally demagnetized them using the same steps as for NRM, which allowed us to apply the multidomain-correction. Because of the lack of in-experiment thermal alteration checks, such as partial TRM or total TRM checks, we applied a second total TRM at 580ºC, and then total TRMs at 600ºC, 625ºC and 650ºC and used the differences between the 625ºC TRM and the first 580ºC TRM as our alteration indicator. In total, 17 specimens from 12 sites passed our data qualification criteria, yielding a mean paleointensity of ~15 µT. Along with paleointensities from Antarctica, Iceland and Galapagos, our preliminary Kenya results support a GAD model of the time-averaged field in both direction and paleointensity but which is only ~50% of the present-day field strength.",

Individuals and groups from all facets of the geosciences can take action to support the implementation of the NGSS. That action will be most effective if it is guided by a thorough understanding of the needs of teachers and other stakeholders who have a role to play in NGSS implementation. This session will describe qualitative and quantitative needs assessment data that was gathered in advance of the Summit Meeting on the Implementation of the NGSS at the State Level, which was jointly organized in April 2015 by the American Geosciences Institute (AGI) and the National Association of Geoscience Teachers (NAGT). The data to be discussed are from interviews and quantitative survey data, as well as data based on responses by the 50+ Summit attendees who represented a variety of perspectives in geoscience education. Particular attention will be given to areas where responses suggested points of tension, such as the fact that many survey respondents feel that they understand dimensions of the NGSS that their colleagues do not understand as well, making for a potentially difficult context in which to work to implement the NGSS. Actions suggested by the Summit attendees that are related to the different need areas will also be described, with the intent being to open discussion among session participants about additional actions that they can take individually and/or collectively.

            "abstract": "Medium Scale Traveling Ionospheric Disturbances (MSTIDs) are wave-like perturbations of the F-region ionosphere with horizontal wavelengths on the order of several hundred kilometers, and periods between 15 – 60 min. In SuperDARN radar data, MSTID signatures are manifested as quasi-periodic enhancements of ground backscatter (i.e. skip focusing) which propagate through the radar field-of-view. At high latitudes, SuperDARN observations of MSTIDs have generally been attributed to atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) launched by auroral sources (e.g. Joule heating). However, recent studies with newer mid-latitude radars have shown MSTIDs are routinely observed in the subauroral ionosphere as well. To develop a more complete picture of MSTID activity, we have surveyed observations from four high latitude and six mid latitude SuperDARN radars located in the North American sector collected between 2011 and 2015 during the months of November to May. Consistent with previous SuperDARN MSTID studies, all radars observed MSTIDs with horizontal wavelengths between ~250 - 500 km and horizontal velocities between ~100 - 250 m/s. The majority of the MSTIDs were observed to propagate in a predominantly southward direction, with bearings ranging from ~135 ̊ - 250 ̊ geographic azimuth. This is highly suggestive of high latitude auroral sources; however, no apparent correlation with geomagnetic or space weather activity could be identified. Rather, comparison of the SuperDARN MSTID time-series data with northern hemisphere geopotential data from the European Center for Medium Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) operational model reveals a strong correlation of MSTID activity with dynamics in the polar vortex structure on two primary time scales. First, a seasonal effect manifests as enhanced MSTID activity from November through January, followed by a depressed period from February to May. This appears to correspond with the seasonal development and later decay of the polar vortex. A second, shorter time scale correlation occurs on a 1 to 3 week timescale with MSTID enhancements and depressions again corresponding with strong and weak polar vortex structuring. Collectively, these observations suggest the polar vortex is a more dominant source for MSTIDs observed by SuperDARN radars, rather than auroral sources.",

            "abstract": "The hydrological cycle is directly affected by climate and human intervention. Climate change is expected to affect hydrology and water resources. In Korean Peninsula, the rainfall pattern is seasonally concentrated, causing temporal and spatial variations in water availability. Many previous studies have investigated that the Korean Peninsula region is vulnerable to changes in water availability with changing climate, but a majority of the studies have focused on natural river discharge. However, the present-day hydrological cycle is not natural, but is affected by human activity, such as the water demands of agriculture, the industrial and domestic sector, and reservoir operations. In this study, water availability considering the impacts of human activity and climate change in the Korean Peninsula region is assessed in terms of water supply and demand. To assess present and future water availability, the integrated water resources model H08, which has six sub-modules to address land surfaces, river routing, crop growth, environmental flow requirements, and anthropogenic water withdrawal (Hanasaki et al., 2008), was applied to simulate historical and future hydrological processes based on climate scenarios. The model was calibrated and validated based on observed river discharge data. The simulation results show the temporal and spatial variations of water availability in the Korean Peninsula region. Results of this research could be used for spatial planning, taking into account the water availability.",

            "abstract": "The rapid expansion in groundwater abstraction in the past few decades in Pakistan is credited with the huge increases in crop production bringing about significant economic gains and ensuring food security for millions. Most of the groundwater usage in Pakistan takes place in Punjab province. This exponential increase in groundwater usage is however, also responsible for the significant groundwater table decline in many parts of the province. There is an urgent need for policy measures to better manage groundwater use. A better understanding of the underground water balance is necessary to make groundwater management policies. This study develops the first physically-based groundwater model for the entire Punjab province. Using the calibrated province-wide model, we perform various simulations to evaluate groundwater dynamics in the future under different scenarios. These scenarios comprise of groundwater conservation efforts, increasing efficiency of the canal irrigation system and changing volume of precipitation. We also make a preliminary attempt to characterize the impact of transboundary groundwater abstractions in Indian Punjab on groundwater levels in Pakistan. We investigate the impact of the future scenarios on major urban centers across Punjab. Our results show that seepage from the canal supply system into the aquifer forms the biggest component of the groundwater flux, while the effect of changing precipitation is negligible. Farmers in central and north-western Punjab are projected to have the highest pumping costs in the future. Areas in southern Punjab are shown to be most vulnerable to waterlogging in the future. The results of this study can help guide policy-makers in developing a thorough groundwater management plan for Punjab.",

            "abstract": "There are large inconsistencies among experimental studies of Highly Siderophile Element (HSE) partitioning relations between silicates and metal or sulfide phases, which has usually been attributed to “micronuggets”, a general term for sub-optical (approximately < 0.2 µm) particles or blobs of metal or sulfide in the silicate phase. But there have then been differences of opinion as to whether these micronuggets (and, sometimes, associated optical-sized metal or sulfide particles) should be viewed as contamination, or are produced by precipitation on quenching the experiment, which need to be included to recover true partitioning relations. Although quench precipitation is perhaps inevitable in experiments at extremely high temperatures and/or pressures, or with high loads of dissolved sulfide, it may be superimposed on the usual micronugget contamination. The problem is particularly acute in HSE sulfide-melt/silicate-melt partition coefficients, where results range over several orders of magnitude. Moreover, nearly all the reported results of directly determined sulfide-melt/silicate-melt partition coefficients are considerably lower than values calculated by combining metal/silicate-melt with metal/sulfide-melt partition coefficients. This discrepancy has been attributed to large effects of S dissolved as sulfide in the silicate melts on HSE solubilities. As such large effects are not expected from the thermodynamic modeling of sulfide solubilities in silicate melts, it has been proposed that HSEs dissolve in sulfide-containing silicate melts by forming HSE-S complexes. This idea has been tested by experiments that compare the solubilities of Ir, Re and Ru in a high-TiO2 silicate melt both with and without dissolved sulfide at 1400 to 1600ºC at atmospheric pressure. The high TiO2 suppresses micronuggets. Experiments were analysed by LA-ICP-MS, with detection limits approaching 2 ppb. For Ir, the results show that at fO2 low enough to enable measurable sulfide in the melt, the presence of the sulfide just raises the level of dissolved Ir above detection limits. These results suggest a fairly large influence of the sulfide, but are not quantitative. By contrast, the experiments on Ru and Re clearly show only a modest effect of dissolved sulfide.",

            "abstract": "The Humu’ula Groundwater Research Project (HGRP) drilled their first continuously-cored hole in the saddle region of the big island of Hawaii in March of 2013. Temperatures at the bottom of the hole were unexpectedly high and reached over 100C. The core traverses various lava flows, representing the shield-building phase of the island and the lithology is dominantly basalt with varying amounts of plagioclase and olivine phenocrysts. Logging of the core noted that discontinuous alteration became prevalent starting at ~ 1 km depth. In May of 2015 we collected 780 infrared spectra of the core from depths of 0.97 to 1.76 km using our portable field spectrometer with a contact probe and field of view of 10 mm. Many of the spectra are unaltered, showing mafic mineralogy (augite or augite with olivine). Minerals from aqueous alteration include clinochlore, micaceous minerals likely mixed with other common phyllic alteration products, and three groups of spectral types associated with zeolites. This suite of minerals suggests alteration was initiated from higher temperature and moderate pH fluids. Based on the field reconnaissance spectroscopy, 25 sections were cut that represent the alteration diversity for thin section and subsequent detailed petrologic analyses. Eight of these sections were examined using the Ultra-Compact Imaging Spectrometer (UCIS) prototype instrument at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. UCIS collects spectra at 80 μm / pixel and identifies the same alteration mineralogy as the bulk samples, but clearly shows that the alteration occurs in veins and vugs. Unaltered olivine and pyroxene phenocrysts occur in the groundmass adjacent to highly altered vugs, and are preserved throughout the section surveyed. Given the limited alteration and abundant preservation of olivine to depths of 1.5 km, the core may be representative of alteration in moderate pH environments on Mars, where unaltered basaltic materials occur in close proximity to alteration products. Similar alteration might occur at the surface with limited water exposure, or in the subsurface where materials are subsequently exhumed through impact processes.",

            "abstract": "In the United States (U.S.) flash flooding (FF hereafter) is one of the leading cause of weather-related deaths. Because FF events can be distinguished from riverine floods by their fast response to rainfall and resulting impacts signature, analyzing FF-specific impact datasets seems a good way to identify the juxtaposition of social and physical circumstances leading to those impacts. This communication focuses on conceptual and methodological developments allowing testing hypotheses on FF-specific vulnerability factors through the analysis of human impact datasets. We hypothesize that the intersection of the spatio-temporal context of the FF phenomena with the distribution of people and their characteristics across space and time reveals various paths of vulnerability through the expression of different accidents’ circumstances (i.e., vehicle-related, inside buildings, open-air, campsites). We argue that vulnerability and the resulting impacts vary dynamically throughout the day according to the location/situation under concern.\nIn order to test FF-specific contextual vulnerability factors at the scale of the continental US, 1075 fatalities reported between 1996 and 2014 in the Storm Data publication of the U.S. National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) are analyzed to statistically explore the timing, the duration and the location of the FF event, and the age and gender of the victims and the circumstance (i.e. location/activity) of their death. In this objective, a re-classification of the individual fatality circumstances and a discretization of the time in qualitative time-steps are performed to obtain possible trends and patterns in the occurrence of fatalities in certain circumstances and time (e.g., day vs night). The findings highlight the importance of situation-specific assessment of FF fatalities to guide the development of FF-specific vulnerability and impacts prediction modeling. Such analysis can provide valuable knowledge when the National Weather Service issues FF warning and emergencies. This is because targeted warnings can be communicated when we can relate the location of risky incidents in space (e.g., roads, campsites, mobile homes) with specific vulnerable groups (e.g., certain age groups, gender).",

New flows were directed into lower Puna, a district which had not experienced lava since 1845. The new flow was the longest seen in Hawaii in 500 years and in October—November 2015 it threatened buildings in Pāhoa town and critical lifelines (roading, electricity) to a larger population of some 10,500 people in lower Puna.\nThe behavior of long-lived slow-moving flows of this type is exceptionally difficult to predict over time and the lava advanced as narrow lobes, typically only a few inches high and feet-wide, guided by small changes in ground slope and local barriers, before widening and thickening over time scales of days. New lobes have then broken out either from the front or margins of the flows, often taking unpredictable paths, and allowing the flows to cover progressively larger areas. The uncertainty as to where the flow would appear next made the human response very challenging. At the same time slow advance gave lots of warning time and has led to both a globally unique set of ‘just-in-time’ measures to mitigation lava impacts and development of a resilient, strong, articulate community. The lava flow retreated back ‘up-slope’ in mid-2015 but remains a hidden threat that could return to threaten Pāhoa and neighboring subdivisions.",

However, there are few examples (but see the Long-term Ecological Research Network Data Portal) of these data being provided in such a manner that allows exploration within the context of the research process – what specific research questions do these data seek to answer? what data were used to answer these questions? what data would have been helpful to answer these questions but were not available? We propose an agile conceptual model and database design, as well as example results, that integrate data management with project management not only to maximize the value of research data products but to enhance collaboration during the project and the process of project management itself.\n In our project, which we call ‘Data Map,’ we used agile principles by adopting a user-focused approach and by designing our database to be simple, responsive, and expandable. We initially designed Data Map for the Idaho EPSCoR project “Managing Idaho’s Landscapes for Ecosystem Services (MILES)” (see https://www.idahoecosystems.org//) and will present example results for this work. We consulted with our primary users– project managers, data managers, and researchers to design the Data Map. Results will be useful to project managers and to funding agencies reviewing progress because they will readily provide answers to the questions “For which research projects/questions are data available and/or being generated by MILES researchers?” and “Which research projects/questions are associated with each of the 3 primary questions from the MILES proposal?” To be responsive to the needs of the project, we chose to streamline our design for the prototype database and build it in a way that is modular and can be changed or expanded to meet user needs. Our hope is that others, especially those managing large collaborative research grants, will be able to use our project model and database design to enhance the value of their project and data management both during and following the active research period.",

            "abstract": "North Central Texas, including Dallas-Ft. Worth, the 4th largest metropolitan area in the U.S., has been in a state of drought for most of this 21st Century. Seven million residents there depend almost exclusively on surface water resources, and net water storage declined precipitously until record rainfall in early 2015. Part of the decline in water availability can be attributed to reduced runoff, where despite slightly above normal precipitation, natural basin runoff has declined almost 20% since its peak in the mid-1990's. These changes have coincided with 0.85oC warming above the historical 20th Century mean. Prevalent Vertisol (cracking) soils in the region make runoff especially sensitive to climate variations, and make it difficult to apply traditional hydrologic models to investigate climate-runoff links. Non-parametric (empirical) runoff elasticity methods circumvent these limitations, and are applied here, focusing on the Upper Trinity River basin (UTB).\nDiagrammatic assessment of UTB temperature-precipitation (T-Pr) runoff elasticity indicates persistent warming greatly increases the risk of reduced runoff, based on historical experience. Evaluation of individual parameter elasticity indicates dry periods since 2000 have primarily been T-driven, in contrast to the Pr-driven 1951-6 drought of record. Observed decline in runoff during 2000-2010 is entirely attributable to increased T. Additional runoff declines from 2011-14 were driven by reduced Pr, augmenting the T-driven reductions. These T effects are most prominent to the west, and decline to minimal extent just east of the UTB. The observed warming can be related to anthropogenic CO2 increase with >95% certainty based on comparison of CMIP5 climate model results for the UTB with and without CO2 forcing. UTB runoff fraction of Pr decreased after 1980 with >97.5% certainty.\nThese results strongly indicate that 21st Century 20% decline in runoff from previous century norms is largely attributable to anthropogenic warming, despite above-average precipitation. Projections based on individual CMIP5 climate models indicate this temperature effect will continue to grow in the future, and will be the predominant contributor to persistent runoff reductions by 2040.",

            "abstract": "The GOSAT-2, which is scheduled for launch in early 2018, is the successor mission to the Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT). The FTS-2 onboard the GOSAT-2 is a Fourier transform spectrometer, which has three bands in the near to short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) region and two bands in the thermal infrared (TIR) region to observe infrared light reflected and emitted from the Earth's surface and atmosphere with high-resolution spectra. Column amounts and vertical profiles of major greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are retrieved from acquired radiance spectra. In addition, the FTS-2 has several improvements from the FTS onboard the GOSAT: 1) added spectral coverage in the SWIR region for carbon monoxide (CO) retrieval, 2) increased signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for all bands, 3) extended range of along-track pointing angles for sunglint observations, 4) intelligent pointing to avoid cloud contamination.\nSince 2012, we have been developing a software tool, which is called the GOSAT-2 FTS-2 simulator, to simulate spectral radiance data that will be acquired by the GOSAT-2 FTS-2. The objective of it is to analyze/optimize data with respect to the sensor specification, the parameters for Level 1 processing, and the improvement of Level 2 retrieval algorithms. It consists of six components: 1) overall control, 2) sensor carrying platform, 3) spectral radiance calculation, 4) Fourier transform module, 5) Level 1B (L1B) processing, and 6) L1B data output.\nMore realistic and faster simulations have been made possible by the improvement of details about sensor characteristics, the sophistication of data processing and algorithms, the addition of various observation modes, the use of surface and atmospheric ancillary data, and the speed-up and parallelization of radiative transfer code. This simulator is confirmed to be working properly from the reproduction of GOSAT FTS L1B data depends on the ancillary data.\nWe will summarize the performance verification of the GOSAT-2 FTS-2 simulator and describe the future prospects for Level 2 retrieval. Besides, we will present the various sensitivity analyses relating to the engineering parameters and the atmospheric conditions on Level 1 processing for greenhouse gases retrieval.",

            "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that changes in poleward energy transport under global warming can be understood as the down-gradient flux of near-surface moist static energy (MSE), modified by the spatial pattern of radiative feedbacks. The MSE flux is a constraint on the vertically integrated moisture flux, and thus on the pattern of precipitation minus evaporation (P-E). We explore the implications of this link for our understanding of changes to the Earth's hydrologic cycle under anthropogenic warming.\nBeginning with the Penman-Montieth equation, we derive a simple expression for the scaling of E with changes in temperature and net surface radiation. This equation suggests that, in the global mean, E (and thus P) should increase by about 2\\% per degree of surface warming, consistent with comprehensive global climate model (GCM) simulations. This scaling is relatively insensitive to the magnitude and pattern of temperature change.\nFurther, we show that this constraint on E, together with the down-gradient transport of near-surface MSE anomalies, requires changes in the hydrologic cycle that closely mirror those found in GCMs: E must increase everywhere; P must increase in the deep tropics, decrease in the subtropics, and increase in mid- and high-latitudes; fractional changes in P must increase towards high latitudes, and are sensitive to the degree of polar amplification. Reasonable variations in the spatial pattern of radiative feedbacks modify, rather than overturn, this basic picture. Finally, global conservation of MSE divergence requires both a poleward expansion of the subtropics and a poleward migration of the latitude of maximum P, implying energetic constraints on tropical and midlatitude circulation responses.\nThus, the principle that climate adjusts by down-gradient transport of MSE anomalies is a single and simple explanation for the basic structure of hydrologic cycle changes under global warming, which is borne out both qualitatively and quantitatively in comprehensive GCMs.",

            "abstract": "Since urban residents tend to spend a majority of time indoors throughout a day, it has been widely discussed in recent years, whether fixed-site monitoring PM2.5 ambient concentration is feasible as a surrogate of human PM2.5 exposure. Comprehensive understanding of residents’ daily time-activity patterns (TAP) and possible indoor behavior are urgently needed to perform a more accurate estimate of human PM2.5exposure, especially in China, where is experiencing rapid urbanization.\nField surveys of TAP were carried out in a Chinese city of Suzhou from 2014 to 2015 to evaluate PM2.5 exposure in various micro-environments (ME, e.g., residence, outdoors and in-transit). We gathered and analyzed urban residents’ seasonal time-activity data using 24h retrospective time-location diaries, as well as diversified exposure-related indoor information (e.g. ventilation, environment tobacco smoke and cooking). PM2.5exposure is calculated through the incorporation of ambient concentration data, modified indoor/outdoor empirical functions and TAP. The spatial distributions of TAP-based exposure and static-population based exposure are also compared.\nResidents in Suzhou urban area spend over 65% of time at home and 90% indoors. There are significant temporal (season, day type) and socioeconomic differences (gender, age, education, living alone, having children at home, employment status, etc.) of time-activity distributions, which makes the sum of PM2.5 ME exposure differs notably from static-population based ambient exposure. People prefer to spend more time at home both in winter (P<0.05) and on weekends (P<0.001), less time outdoors in winter but more on weekends (P<0.001). Gender, education and living alone are negative associated with time spent home, while age, children at home and employment status are positively related. On the other hand, due to lack of monitoring stations in unban Suzhou, the inverse distance squared weighting method is not ideally performed and may be less representative of the ambient PM2.5characteristics than satellite data.",

            "abstract": "It is a common misconception that the boreal forest is a uniform carpet of trees stretching around the top of the globe. In fact, the boreal forest is an extremely heterogeneous and dynamic landscape. This has become even clearer through the use of remote sensing, which finally gives us a high resolution view of the entire boreal forest on the continental scale. The complexity of the boreal forest biome, however, is still often over simplified and poorly parameterized in global climate models. Advances in remote sensing and data analysis technology now give us the ability to map the heterogeneity and spatial complexity of the entire North American boreal forest. This study presents such a map and some analysis and observations of patterns in the data. We found that the boreal forest was dominated by many small land cover patches with high diversity of forest cover types. This map has and will continue to provide its own insight into the spatial structure of the boreal forest but will also provide important spatial heterogeneity metrics to improve land-atmosphere interactions in climate models.",

Different relationship between inclusion water oxygen and hydrogen isotopic data reveals clearly various seasonal moisture sources between the Holocene and glacial time.

            "abstract": "Faults fail in a spectrum of slip behavior as demonstrated by slow slip events, slow and low-frequency earthquakes, episodic tremor and slip, and non-volcanic tremor. The underlying causes of this spectrum of behavior and the processes that control the failure mode of a particular fault are poorly understood, and constitute one of the most pressing conundrums of the field. Field observations provide documentation of slow-slip events at many different locations, but provide little insight into their mechanism. We present a systematic experimental study of slow slip and provide a mechanical explanation for the spectrum of fault slip modes from slow, aseismic slip to fast earthquake-like stick-slip.\nUtilizing a double-direct shear configuration in a bi-axial apparatus, we conducted constant loading velocity shearing tests. The effective system stiffness was altered by changing the effective normal stress and via the material used for the loading blocks. In experiments that exhibited stable sliding, we conducted velocity step tests to estimate the rate-and-state parameters of the material. From the rate-and-state parameters, we calculate the predicted critical stiffness value (kc) at which frictional failure should transition from stable to unstable sliding.\nWe find that slow slip occurs near the stability threshold, which is in turn controlled by the interplay of fault frictional properties, effective normal stress, and elastic stiffness of the surrounding rock. Moreover, both the peak slip velocity and the duration of slip vary systematically with distance from the stability threshold, expressed as a ratio of the system stiffness to the critical stiffness (k/kc). Our results suggest a general mechanism for slow earthquakes and the spectrum of fault slip behaviors. Such a mechanism is consistent with the broad range of geologic environments in which these phenomena are observed, from subduction zones to the low-angle normal faults at the base of fast moving ice streams. This has implications for our understanding of frictional stick-slip as a range of behavior that can be parameterized by the stiffness alone.",

Our data are from 80 of the temporary seismometers deployed as part of the IMAD (International Maule Aftershock Deployment) geophysical networks to capture the aftershocks of the Mw 8.8 megathrust event in 2010. We implemented the multichannel analysis method of Chevrot (2000) to measure the SI of 64 teleseismic SKS phases in addition to the fast orientations ϕ and splitting delays δt measured with the method of Silver & Chan (1991). To measure the SI of local aftershocks, we modified the method to allow for use of the upgoing S phase from local events in and above the Nazca slab after correcting for the initial event polarization. We compared our results with other measurement methods (Silver and Chan 1991, Wolfe and Silver 1998) that solve for splitting parameters to examine the robustness of the shear wave splitting intensity method, particularly for local datasets. The results we obtained using the splitting intensity method for the teleseismic data show an overall fast direction that is parallel to the absolute plate motion of the Nazca plate that is subducting beneath the South American plate. These results are consistent with the results we calculated using the Wolfe and Silver method. SI deriving from S waves that originate in the Nazca slab or deeper SA lithosphere are likely to reveal patterns of crustal fabric, and hence differ from the SI of the teleseismic shear waves.",

            "abstract": "Most aerosol particles take up water and grow as relative humidity increases, leading to increased optical extinction, reduced visibility, greater aerosol optical depths (AODs), and altered radiative forcing, even while dry particulate mass remains constant. Relative humidity varies greatly temporally, horizontally, and especially vertically. Thus hygroscopicity is a confounding factor when attempting to link satellite-based observations of AOD to surface measurements of particulate mass or to model predictions of aerosol mass concentrations.\nAirborne observations of aerosol optical, chemical, and microphysical properties were made in the southeastern United States in the daytime in summer 2013 during the NOAA SENEX and NASA SEAC4RS projects. Applying κ-Köhler theory for hygroscopic growth to these data, the inferred hygroscopicity parameter κ for the organic fraction of the aerosol was <0.11. This κ for organics is toward the lower end of values found from laboratory studies of the aerosol formed from oxidation of biogenic precursors and from several field studies in rural environments.\nThe gamma (γ) parameterization is commonly used to describe the change in aerosol extinction as a function of relative humidity. Because this formulation did not fit the airborne data well, a new parameterization was developed that better describes the observations. This new single-parameter κext formulation is physically based and relies upon the well-known approximately linear relationship between particle volume and optical extinction. The fitted parameter, κext, is nonlinearly related to the chemically derived κ parameter used in κ-Köhler theory. The values of κext determined from the airborne measurements are consistent with independent observations at a nearby ground site.",

            "abstract": "The Paleocene Carbon Isotope Maxima (PCIM; ~57.8Ma) represents a major transition in global δ13C during the late Paleocene, when the long-term positive trend in δ13C reversed from positive to negative. The peak-PCIM (~57.7Ma) has been tightly resolved in new high-resolution, astronomically-tuned benthic isotope records from IODP Sites 1209 (Pacific) and 1262 (Atlantic), which show the final phase of δ13C enrichment as abrupt (~1‰ in <100kyrs) and coinciding with a 0.5‰ decline in benthic δ18O indicative of 2-3ºC of bottom water warming, effectively marking the onset of a gradual 8Myr long warming trend [Littler et al., EPSL 2014]. Typically, during the Paleogene on orbital time scales, warming is observed during intervals of δ13C depletion, consistent with release of isotopically light carbon to the atmosphere. This event, which has the appearance of a bifurcation in the long-term coupling of climate system and the carbon cycle, poses an interesting paradox as any rapid carbon release to the atmosphere should, in theory, create a negative excursion because all of the major carbon sources are isotopically light, whether volcanic outgassing, weathering/oxidation of organic carbon, or methane release [Dunkley-Jones et al., Phil. Trans. R. Soc. A 2010]. If global, there are several testable mechanisms that may explain the shift including increase in burial flux of light carbon, a reduction in heavy carbon burial flux, or a large-scale circulation change perhaps associated with the transition of a major oceanic gateway. Using trace metal (B/Ca and Mg/Ca) and stable isotope (δ11B, δ18O, and δ13C) geochemistry, here we establish the nature of the peak-PCIM at sites from 3 different ocean basins (IODP Sites 690, 1209, and 1262) and begin to test several of the possible mechanisms for change. Mg/Ca in mixed-layer planktonic foraminifera show 2-3°C of sea surface warming coinciding with, and abrupt as, the benthic carbon isotope enrichment at all sites. Bottom water ∆[CO32-], as indicated by B/Ca in benthic foraminifera, abruptly increases by 30-40µmol/kgsw. While this may indicate a change in bottom water circulation, surface B-based proxies also respond with a positive shift during the peak-PCIM indicating a slight increase in surface pH and highlighting the global nature of the event.",

The high spatial and temporal variability in soil water storage over Australia plays an essential role in affecting the variability of land-surface coupling strength. While previous studies focused more on the spatial variations of land-atmosphere interaction and resulting hotspots, in this study, we attempt to explore temporal variations of the land-surface coupling strength in the semi-arid regions. Preliminary results show high temporal variability of the coupling strength across the seasons. The land-surface coupling strength usually increases with soil moisture in the semi-arid climate. However, during the flood events, the coupling strength decreases when the evaporation approaches to the potential evaporation. After recovering from the floods, the coupling strength increases again during the recessing phase of soil water. Such temporal variations of the land-surface coupling strength have important implications to land-atmosphere interactions and climate predictions, and warrant further investigations using observational datasets.",

            "abstract": "Use of ensemble forecasts as a means of characterising predictive uncertainty has become increasingly common in hydrological and meteorological forecasting. The needs to characterize ensemble forecast quality has encouraged the development of reliable verification tools. Most of the metrics used currently are related to the Brier score, first proposed in 1950. However, the Brier score and its alterations including the decomposition of the Brier score, as well as the Ranked Probability Score, have paid little attention to the difference in the characteristics of the forecasted and sampled probability distributions. This difference, or the error in the probability distribution, can lead to a bias in all existing metrics derived from the Brier score. Similar biases arise where the second moment is different to that observed, or when the observations are scarce and hence difficult to characterise. Therefore, this study suggests simple and reliable measures for the first and second moment bias of the forecasted ensemble and in addition, approaches to analytically estimate the sampling uncertainty of the proposed measures. The proposed approaches are tested through synthetically generated hydrologic forecasts and observations, as well as seasonal forecasts of the El Nino Southern Oscillation issued by the International research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI-ENSO). The results show that the estimated uncertainty range of the first and second moment bias can accurately represent the sampling error under most circumstances in a real forecasting system.",

            "abstract": "Central Mongolia sits deep in the Asian continental interior between the Siberian craton to the north, the edge of the India-Asia collision to the south, and far-field subduction of the Pacific plate to the east. It has a complex geologic history comprising Archean to Early Proterozoic crystalline rocks modified by accretionary events in the Paleozoic, and Cenozoic deformation and basalt volcanism that continues today.\nWithin central Mongolia, the broad domal Hangay upland is embedded in the greater Mongolian Plateau. Elevations within the dome average ~1.5 km above the regional trend and locally reach ~4000 m. This elevated landscape hosts a low-relief surface cut into crystalline basement, and a 30 Ma record of intermittent basalt magmatism. Here we integrate observations from geomorphology, geochronology, paleoaltimetry, biogeography, petrology, geochemistry, and seismology to document the timing, rate, and pattern of surface uplift in the Hangay and more broadly to understand the geodynamics of the Mongolian plateau.\nResults from mantle and crustal xenoliths, seismology, thermochronology, and basalt geochemistry are consistent with: a high geothermal gradient with temperatures reaching ~900°C at 60 km depth, intercepting the mantle adiabat at ~90 km depth; an uppermost mantle composed mostly of fertile peridotites; low-volume Cenozoic basaltic magmatism sourced below the lithosphere, with isotopic characteristics similar to much east-Asian Cenozoic mafic volcanism; a 42-57 km-thick crust of island-arc affinity formed during accretion of the Central Asia Orogenic Belt; elevations supported primarily by crustal isostasy; slow exhumation (30-100 m/My) over hundreds of millions of years; and long-term thermal stability of the upper crust and relief lowering since the Mesozoic. Results from geomorphology, paleoaltimetry, fish genetics, and basalt geochronology imply that drainage divides are stable since the mid-Miocene with modest surface uplift (up to 1 km) and topographic relief up to 800 m remaining largely unchanged since ~10 Ma. Surprisingly, this area of remarkable stability over significant time and space sits above a shallow convecting mantle and hosts some of the largest recorded intracontinental earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "Many geomorphic systems act as conveyor belts onto which material is loaded at a particular rate, and is transported in one direction toward another system that serves as a sink. In general the material will evolve as it travels: it ages, it changes in grain size, it absorbs and releases nutrients, it weathers and it accumulates cosmogenic radionuclides. Here I address the hillslope conveyor. As many geochemical and physical processes are depth-dependent, the depth history of a particle becomes important to know. I calculate soil particle trajectories in the horizontal-depth plane and address three steady state cases, one in which horizontal speeds decline exponentially with depth, a second in which they are uniform with depth, and a third in which horizontal speeds are also uniform but all profile values are vertically well-mixed. Vertical speeds are governed by conservation of mass, which requires that strain rates in the horizontal enact strains rates of opposite sign in the vertical, and by the boundary conditions of zero vertical particle speed at the soil surface and the particle release rate at the saprolite interface. Particle trajectories must become surface-parallel at the surface. Knowledge of soil particle trajectories allows calculation of residence times and concentration profiles of 10Be in the soil. In all steady cases, the particle age and 10Be structure are uniform with distance from the divide. When significant vertical gradients in horizontal speed occur, the vertical profiles of particle age and 10Be concentration are dominated by the depth scale of the transport process. In unmixed cases, the particle age and 10Be concentration in near-surface samples can greatly exceed the vertically averaged values, reflecting the slowing of vertical speeds as particles approach the surface. Where horizontal speeds vary significantly with depth, the vertically-averaged concentration of 10Be within the soil can significantly under-predict the mean 10Be concentration of sediment delivered to the channel; proper averaging requires weighting by particle speed.",

However, the extent to which biomass burning gases/aerosols are present on a global scale, especially in the marine atmosphere, is poorly understood. Here we measure levoglucosan, a superior molecular tracer of biomass burning aerosols because of its single source, in marine air from the Arctic Ocean through the North and South Pacific Ocean to coastal Antarctica during burning season. Levoglucosan was found to be present in all regions at ng/m3 levels. As a whole, levoglucosan concentrations in the Southern Hemisphere were comparable to those in the Northern Hemisphere. Marine air in the mid-latitudes (30°-60° N and S) has the highest levoglucosan loading due to the emission from adjacent lands. Air over the Arctic Ocean which affected by biomass burning in the east Siberia has intermediate loading. Equatorial latitudes is the main source of biomass burning emissions, however, levoglucosan is in relatively low level. Large amount of precipitation and high hydroxyl radical concentration in this region cause more deposition and degradation of levoglucosan during transport. Previous studies were debatable on the influence of biomass burning on the Antarctic because of uncertain source of BC. Here via levoglucosan, it is proved that although far away from emission sources, the Antarctic is still affected by biomass burning aerosols which may be derived from South America. Biomass burning has a significant impact on mercury (Hg) and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC) in marine aerosols from pole to pole, with more contribution to WSOC in the Northern Hemisphere than in the Southern Hemisphere.",

In addition to coal power, this new grid capacity can be used to transport renewable-generated electricity with resulting climate co-benefits. Here we use an integrated assessment to evaluate the air quality and climate benefits of twelve proposed transmission lines in China, and compare two energy-by-wire strategies that transmit 1) only coal power (Coal-by-wire, CbW) or 2) combined renewable plus coal power (Renewable and coal-by-wire, (RE+C)bW), with 3) the current practice of transporting coal by rail for conversion to electricity near eastern demand centers (Coal-by-rail, CbR). Based on a regional atmospheric chemistry model, WRF-Chem, electricity transmission through the proposed lines leads to 2-3 μg/m3 (2-7%) reduction in the annual mean concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the eastern provinces relative to 2010 levels, roughly ~1 μg/m3 greater than the reduction achieved in CbR where dirty coal units are locally replaced with efficient ones. Although the eastern air quality improvement is similar irrespective of the fuel source to power the lines, adding coal generation results in up to 3% increase in annual mean PM2.5 levels in some exporting provinces, whereas such increase is not observed when most added capacity is renewable-based. Counting both the economic value of reduced carbon emissions and the health-related air quality benefits can significantly improve the cost-effectiveness of transmitting both renewable and coal power. Comparing (RE+C)bW with the two coal-based options, we find not only 20% larger reduction in air-pollution-related deaths, but also three times greater reduction in CO2 emissions. Our study hence demonstrates the significance of coordinating renewable energy planning with transmission planning to simultaneously tackle air pollution and climate change in China and globally.",

            "abstract": "Two-dimensional (2D) maps and cross-sections, and 3D conceptual models, are fundamental tools for understanding, communicating and modeling geology. Yet geologists lack dedicated and intuitive tools that allow rapid creation of such figures and models. Standard drawing packages produce only 2D figures that are not suitable for quantitative analysis. Geologic modeling packages can produce 3D models and are widely used in the groundwater and petroleum communities, but are often slow and non-intuitive to use, requiring the creation of a grid early in the modeling workflow and the use of geostatistical methods to populate the grid blocks with geologic information.\nWe present an alternative approach to rapidly create figures and models using sketch-based interface and modelling (SBIM). We leverage methods widely adopted in other industries to prototype complex geometries and designs. The SBIM tool contains built-in geologic rules that constrain how sketched lines and surfaces interact. These rules are based on the logic of superposition and cross-cutting relationships that follow from rock-forming processes, including deposition, deformation, intrusion and modification by diagenesis or metamorphism.\nThe approach allows rapid creation of multiple, geologically realistic, figures and models in 2D and 3D using a simple, intuitive interface. The user can sketch in plan- or cross-section view. Geologic rules are used to extrapolate sketched lines in real time to create 3D surfaces. Quantitative analysis can be carried our directly on the models. Alternatively, they can be output as simple figures or imported directly into other modeling tools. The software runs on a tablet PC and can be used in a variety of settings including the office, classroom and field.\nThe speed and ease of use of SBIM enables multiple interpretations to be developed from limited data, uncertainty to be readily appraised, and figures and models to be rapidly updated to incorporate new data or concepts.",

            "abstract": "Sagebrush is a widespread and locally dominant shrub across much of western North America, occupying >66 million ha. Sagebrush steppe provides many important ecosystem services including carbon (C) storage, water storage, and providing critical habitat for several threatened and endangered animal species. At the Reynolds Creek Critical Zone Observatory (RC CZO) in southwestern Idaho, sagebrush is the dominant shrub species across most of the watershed. The research objectives of RC CZO are to quantify soil carbon storage and flux, and the environmental factors governing these from pedon to landscape scales. Sagebrush-steppe ecosystems have been identified as possible future C sinks, but C storage in these water-limited systems is tightly linked to hydroclimate, which is highly variable in space and time. Quantifying soil-plant water relations is essential to understanding C storage in these systems. Stem-heat-balance sap-flow sensors were installed in June 2015 at three sites in RC CZO that had existing meteorological stations and eddy covariance towers. These sites are situated along an elevation gradient from 1417 m to 2111 m. Artemisia tridentata ssp. wyomingenesis, A. arbuscula and A. tridentata ssp. vaseyana at dominate at the lower, middle, and upper sites, respectively. At all three sites, we installed sensors on 5-6 shrubs. Preliminary results indicate greater sap flow velocity in both wyomingenesis and tridentata species than arbuscula. The mean hourly sap flow rates were 2.05±0.12 g/h, 0.33±0.01 g/h and 3.02±0.14 g/h for wyomingenesis, arbuscula, and vaseyana, respectively, during June 26th to July 22nd, 2015. Daily sap flow averaged about 61.56±5.21 g/day, 7.60±0.88 g/day, and 74.60±5.44 g/day, respectively within same time period. Lower soil water content at the middle site seemed to be the cause of lower sap flow velocities in arbuscula. Diurnal patterns in sap flow were similar in all subspecies, with maximum flow velocities recorded between 11 AM to 4 PM. The data suggest that water use in tridentata dominated landscapes may be as much as 10 times greater compared to arbuscula dominated landscapes. Thus presumably, there is greater C storage capacity in tridentata dominated sites.",

            "abstract": "Podcasts, while only about a decade old in their modern incarnation, have exploded in popularity in recent years. There are tens-of-thousands of podcasts on every imaginable topic hosted by enthusiasts and well known figureheads of their respective fields. According to a recent Pew study, nearly one-third of Americans have listened to a podcast. Podcasts like NPR’s “Serial” have gained large followings and brought their stories to the attention of massive audiences. Podcasts are the ideal communication medium for STEAM fields because they can convey more information than simple tweets or brief media coverage and with more enthusiasm than written articles. They are also easy for anyone to listen to on their commute, during exercise, or any other activity. Subscription to a podcast allows the listener to automatically download new episodes to any electronic device, facilitating content consumption with greater ease than either web pages or print media.\nWe present two podcasts covering the topics of geoscience and spaceflight that are just finishing their first year on the air. The “Don’t Panic Geocast” hosted by John Leeman and Shannon Dulin, and “The Orbital Mechanics Podcast” hosted by David Fourman and Ben Etherington with research assistants Steve Pestana and Connor West. Recording the shows involves some technical setup, but once that is complete, they are easily distributed to subscribers’ mobile devices through internet syndication. Listeners can also listen in a web browser if they prefer.\nIn producing these shows, we receive feedback in the form of tweets, emails, and comments from the audience that shows they are engaged and interested. Many enjoy receiving news about the fields, learning technical details, or just being able to interact with other like-minded people that they otherwise may not have met. Some listeners get involved to the point of contributing their own research on past show topics. The serial nature of podcasts increases the collaborations between listeners and podcast creators, which may develop into productive research and teaching partnerships that are crucial to STEAM fields. We intend to share some of the behind-the-scenes production techniques, show structure, and workflows we use to try to bring in a broad audience and share our enjoyment of our fields.",

The current retrieval algorithm (V1.0) uses LBLRTM v12.1 with AER v3.1 line database to calculate optical depth. The purpose of this study is to compare several line parameter databases to assess their impact on CH4 retrieval: HITRAN2004 database, HITRAN2008 database, AER v3.2 database, and HITRAN2012 database (Rothman et al. 2005, 2009, and 2013. Clough et al., 2005). The CH4 line parameters of AER v3.1 and v3.2 databases are based on HITRAN2008 and it updates until May 2009 with line mixing parameters. The line strengths are almost the same between HITRAN2008 and HITRAN2012 in the CH4 ν4 band, although their line centers are shifted about 0.002 cm-1 (Brown et al., 2013). We used LBLRTM v12.2 to calculate optical depth of each layer with wavenumber resolution of 0.0034 cm-1 (Clough et al., 2005). Then we calculated forward radiance spectra and convoluted them with sinc function. At 1247.8 cm-1 where there exist three relatively strong CH4 absorption lines (1247.705 cm-1, 1247.823 cm-1, and 1247.842 cm-1), no H2O interference, and small N2O interference, the differences in calculated brightness temperatures between HITRAN2008 and HITRAN2004, between HITRAN2008 and AER v3.2, and between HITRAN2012 and HITRAN2008 were 0.002 K, 0.4 K, and 0.06 K, respectively. These differences may affect CH4 retrieval. In wavenumber range from 1210 cm-1 to 1360 cm-1, several H2O line parameters were updated from HITRAN2008 to HITRAN2012. These updates could also affect on CH4 retrieval through simultaneous retrieval with H2O at CH4 ν4 band.",

PKIIKP waveforms, modeled by a superposition of Gaussian beams in laterally varying models of the inner core, demonstrate that a near-zero shear modulus exists in the uppermost inner core in a 20-40 km thick patch benearth the eastern equatorial hemisphere. This bright spot of PKIIKP reflection correlates with a thin zone of low P velocity inferred from the complexity of PKIKP+PKiKP waveforms sampling this region. Estimates of grain sizes from seismic attenuation, the absence of backscattered PKiKP coda from this region, and a prediction for enhanced heat flow through this patch suggest that it is a region of solidification rather than melting.",

However, physical interpretation of ULVZs is challenging due to non-uniqueness of model parameters and lack of rigorous uncertainty estimates. Here, we present results from Bayesian waveform inversions of ScP waves (shear waves converted to, and reflected as compressional waves at the CMB) that sample a wide region beneath the Coral Sea off northeast Australia. The waveforms are obtained from short-period transportable arrays in southeast Australia and the Warramunga array in Northern Territory. The inversion does not require explicit noise and ULVZ parameterization (i.e. number of ULVZ layers and noise parameters treated as unknowns). Model uncertainties are quantified and distinguished from parameter variability as a function of depth and at various locations. The study reveals complex ULVZs, some well and some weakly constrained, with multiple layers as likely solutions. A common feature in all well-constrained results is that the S-wave velocity decreases as a function of depth with narrow uncertainties while P-wave velocity and density have wider uncertainties. Furthermore, ULVZ height varies as a function of location, at the CMB which implies lateral variability of these structures. S and P velocities are decreased by up to 50% and 30%, respectively, whereas density increases up to 30% with respect to the 1-D reference model. These strong perturbations indicate the presence of melt-rich iron material in the lowermost mantle beneath the Coral Sea. In contrast, weakly constrained ULVZs can be a result of: (a) an insufficient number of waveforms to reduce the incoherent noise and/or (b) incoherent pre-/post-cursors due to the 3D shape of ULVZs which cannot be accounted for by a 1-D forward model.",

This study examined the effect of snow cover in urban canopy on energy budget in urban areas of Sapporo, north Japan by 1km mesh WRF experiments. The modified urban canopy model permits snow cover in urban canopy by the modification of surface albedo, surface emissivity, and thermal conductivity for roof and road according to snow depth and snow water equivalent.\nThe experiments revealed that snow cover in urban canopy decreases urban air temperature more strongly for daily maximum temperature (0.4−0.6 K) than for daily minimum temperature (0.1−0.3 K). The high snow albedo reduces the net radiation at building roof, leading to decrease in sensible heat flux. Interestingly, the cooling effect of snow cover compensates the warming effect by anthropogenic heat release in Sapporo, suggesting the importance of snow cover treatment in urban canopy model as well as estimating accurate anthropogenic heat distributions. In addition, the effect of road snow clearance tends to increase nocturnal surface air temperature in urban areas.\nA possible role of snow cover on urban heat island intensity was evaluated by two experiments with snow cover (i.e., realistic condition) and without snow cover in entire numerical domain. The snow cover decreases surface air temperature more in rural areas than in urban areas, which was commonly seen throughout a day, with stronger magnitude during nighttime than daytime, resulting in intensifying urban heat island by 4.0 K for daily minimum temperature.",

            "abstract": "Intraseasonal wind bursts in the tropical Pacific are believed to affect the evolution and major characteristics of El Niño events. In particular, the occurrence of two strong westerly wind bursts (WWBs) in the early 2014 pushed the ocean-atmosphere system towards El Niño – potentially an strong event by the end of 2014 according to climate models. However, the event’s progression quickly stalled, and the warming remained very weak throughout the year. Here we argue that the occurrence of an unusually strong basin-wide easterly wind burst (EWB) in June was a key factor that impeded the El Niño development. It is shortly after this easterly burst that all Niño indices fell rapidly to near-normal values, unable to fully recover later in the year. This easterly burst and the weakness of subsequent WWBs resulted in the persistence of two separate warming centers in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, suppressing the positive Bjerknes feedback critical for El Niño. Eventually, only a weak warming developed stretching nearly uniformly along the equatorial Pacific. Experiments with a climate model with superimposed wind bursts support these conclusions, pointing to the importance of EWBs, which have received much less attention before than WWBs, for the development of El Niño events. Further, we discuss the role of these 2014 changes in the tropics for the development of El Niño in 2015.",

(2012), near-local coda is short in duration and not well modeled by the simple Aki-style (e.g., Aki 1969) exponential single-scattering formulation in a full-space. With only short durations and high-frequency waveforms at our disposal, our empirical full envelope template matching approach provides nearly an exact match to these complicated waveforms in the near-field. Moreover, as these templates capture the nuance of both the initial P-wave, S-wave and scattered counterparts, our method is very robust and provides roughly a factor of 3 times less yield measurement scatter than peak P-wave and integrated first P-wave estimates (e.g., Ford et al., 2014) and also utilizes a much larger amplitude signal. Time permitting, we will also consider near-regional recordings of surface explosions, Sayarim in Israel.",

            "abstract": "Surge-type glaciers exhibit several-fold to orders-of-magnitude speed-up during the short active phase, resulting in km-scale terminus advance. Although there are many surge-type glaciers near the border of Alaska and the Yukon, the generation mechanisms remain uncertain because of limited and few continuous observations. To better understand the surge dynamics and predict the next event, it is essential to examine the entire surge cycles. Here we use Landsat optical imageries to reveal the long-term evolutions, and report three surging episodes at Donjek Glacier in Yukon, Canada.\nUsing the Landsat images, we found three surging events in 1989, 2001, and 2013. In the 2001 event, the surface speed significantly increased by up to 4.5 m/d; during the quiescent phases it was ~0.5 m/d at the terminus. While the duration of active phase is about 4~5 and 2~3 year in the 2001 and 2013 events, the period in the 1989 event is unclear because of the lack of high temporal resolution data. Remarkably, the surging area is limited to the ~20-km section from the terminus instead of the entire glacier. Moreover, we examined the terminus area changes from 1975 to 2014. Although the area has been secularly decreasing probably due to the tread of global warming, it has also revealed four significant fluctuations during the nearly forty years. Comparing the speed and the area changes, the three speed-up events correspond to the terminus area fluctuations with a few time lags.\nIt turns out that the surge event has been quite regularly repeating every twelve years. Although the behavior is rather similar to that in Svalbard glaciers in terms of maximum speed and unclear initiation season, the recurrence interval is much shorter than other nearby surges. Considering that the surge events seem to have initiated around significantly narrower area than upstream, the strong valley constriction may control the regularity as well as the twelve-year recurrence time.",

            "abstract": "The tsunami of April 1, 1946, spread death and destruction throughout the Pacific from the Aleutians to Antarctica, and produced exceptional runup, 42 m, at Scotch Cap on Unimak Island in the near field. López & Okal (2006) showed that the triggering earthquake was at least MW = 8.6, large enough to explain the far-field tsunami but still requiring a landslide or other secondary source to achieve the local runup. No convincing landslide was found until von Huene, et al (2014) merged all available multibeam data and reprocessed a old multichannel line to show that a feature on the Aleutian Terrace they call Lone Knoll (LK) is the displaced block of a translational slide. From 210Pb dating of push cores taken near the summit of LK, we find that a disruption in sedimentation occurred in 1946 at one site, but sedimentation was not disrupted at another site nearby. We infer that the slide block moved coherently at a speed close to the threshold for erosion of the hemipelagic clays. From GLORIA sidescan, Fryer, et al (2004) had earlier tentatively identified LK as a landslide deposit, but if the tsunami crossed the shallow Aleutian Shelf at the long-wave speed, that landslide had to extend up to the shelf edge to satisfy the known 48-min travel time to Scotch Cap. The resulting landslide was enormous, and a multibeam survey later in 2004 showed that it could not exist. The slide imaged by von Huene, et al is far smaller, with a headwall 30 km downslope at a depth of 3 km. The greater distance demands that the tsunami travel much faster across the shelf. The huge runup, however, suggests that wave height was a significant fraction of the water depth (only 80 m), so the tsunami probably crossed the Aleutian Shelf as a bore. From modeling the landslide-generated tsunami with a shock-capturing dispersive code we infer that it did indeed cross the shelf as a bore traveling at roughly twice the long-wave speed. We are still exploring the dependence of the tsunami on slide parameters, but our combined earthquake-slide model broadly matches the near-field runup and the observed arrival time at Scotch Cap.",

The three dimensional (3D) characteristics can then cause errors in the passive microwave rainfall measurements with the current off-nadir viewing sensors’ specifications. This result is due to the fact that the same surface rainfall could be associated with different amounts of hydrometeors depending on the sensors’ viewing paths. In this study, we confirmed that the plane-parallel radiative treatment to the atmosphere leaves a notable deficiency in the microwave radiometric signatures, especially at the higher frequency channels for different viewing directions when largely inhomogeneous precipitating clouds are accompanied by significant ice particles. The impact of the 3-D effect on the passive microwave rainfall estimations is then examined by synthetic retrievals employing a Bayesian methodology. The results showed that the uncertainty in the rainfall estimations due to the 3D effect depended on the viewing directions considered in the a-priori information. It was also found that taking more viewing angles or the azimuth angles in the a-priori information into consideration tended to moderate the retrieval difference that resulted from the different viewing directions. In addition, the retrieval uncertainty related to the 3D effect appeared to be more significant for heavy rainfall cases with large amounts of ice particles, as expected. We additionally performed the retrieval experiments with the databases constructed with the one dimensional slant path (1D-SP) calculation. In general, the 3D model-based experiments slightly outperformed the 1D-SP model-based experiments. However, the 1D-SP model may be considered as an alternative model for the full 3D radiative transfer model with limited computing resources and a required level of the retrieval accuracy.",

            "abstract": "The boundary element method (BEM) is important for the studies, of seismology, fault zone dynamics, and magma chamber evolution. Self-gravitation is especially important for gravity gradient imaging of underground deformations, as it is the dominant signal in the gravity gradient compared with the surface deformation. In contrast, surface deformation dominates the gravity signal.\nTwo notoriously critical issues must be resolved before the BEM convolution can be performed. The first is to establish the boundary integral equation (BIE) by dealing with the singularities on the boundary; and the second concerns the extraction of the Cauchy principle value (CPV) surrounding the singular point within the boundary element that contains it. Engineers have striven to overcome those difficulties with non-gravitating Green functions throughout the age of the BEM.\nWe have succeeded previously in establishing the BIE by partitioning the complicated self-gravitating Green function into an analytical part with the singularity and a numerical part without singularity. Here we present the method and result of extracting the CPV. In view of the non-spherical and unbounded topology of the singularities associated with the self-gravitating Green functions, we developed a direct and systematic procedure to extract the CPV and present the resultant expressions in the form of non-singular integrals that are readily implemented numerically. The CPV integral on a smooth singular boundary element is decomposed into the basic building blocks — the CPV integrals on the horizontal source plane and on the orthogonal vertical planes. The existence of distinctive CPV integrals on the horizontal and vertical singular elements is a consequence of cylindrical symmetry, and thus, not found in engineering problems with spherical symmetry. The CPV on a non-smooth polygonal singular element may undergo up to three steps of decomposition: from triangularization, to projection, to the vertical and horizontal decomposition mentioned above. Our new method can easily be extended to general problems of cylindrical symmetry with or without self-gravitation. Numerical implementation of the new BEM in surface deformation and especially the gravity gradient induced by pressure variations of reservoirs and magma chambers will be presented.",

            "abstract": "Microbial carbonates (microbialites) occurred in the Holocene coral reefs at Paraoir and Currimao of western Luzon, the Philippines, as revealed in drill cores. These microbialites appeal grayish to buff in color with a laminated to thrombolitic structures, and encrust on corals directly or on a thin layer of calcareous red algae or encrusting foraminifers that covered the corals first. At both study sites, the microbial carbonates tend to occur in the lower (earlier) parts of the Holocene reef sequence where Heliopora coerulea dominated. No microbial carbonates were observed in the upper (younger) part of the Holocene reefs that is interpreted to grow in water depth shallower than 6 m on the basis of coral community. Selected samples of microbial carbonate and associated coral were dated by AMS 14C. The results show that the microbialites formed about 9 to 8 thousands years ago, coeval to or a few hundred years younger than the corals on which the microbialites encrusted. Some corals above or below the dated microbialites were 230Th dated in previous study. The AMS 14C ages of samples recovered at reef margins are consistent to 230Th ages, but those recovered in the back reef are much older that the 230Th ages and believed to be reworked. The current consensus is that microbial carbonates result from carbonate precipitation induced by bacteria (cyanobacteria or others) activity, or sedimentation trapped by microbial mat. Considering the ages and occurrences of the microbialites, it is proposed that the microbialites in coral reefs of western Luzon formed from 9 to 8 ky ago in dysphotic condition at greater water depth when the deglacial sea level was rising rapidly. Toward 7 ky ago when the sea-level rise slowed down and coral reef caught up, the condition became favorable to corals prospered in euphotic shallow water, and no longer suitable for microbial carbonate formation.",

The scientific community has both an ethical responsibility and substantial self-interest—as residents of this planet—to help the world community to better understand the complex, interlinked behavior of human and environmental systems and to elucidate pathways to achieve long-term sustainability. Critical to making progress towards the SDGs is the open availability of timely, reliable, usable, and well integrated data and indicators relevant to all SDGs and associated targets. Such data and indicators will not only be valuable in monitoring and evaluation of progress, but also in developing policies and making decisions on environmental and societal issues affecting sustainability from local to global scales. The open availability of such data and indicators can help motivate performance, promote accountability, and facilitate cooperation.\nA range of scientific, technical, organizational, political, and resource challenges need to be addressed in developing a coherent SDG monitoring and indicator framework. For example, assembling and integrating diverse data on consistent spatial and temporal scales across the relevant natural, social, health, and engineering sciences pose both scientific and technical difficulties, and may require new ways to interlink and organize existing cyberinfrastructure, reconcile different data policy regimes, and fund integration efforts. New information technologies promise more timely and efficient ways of collecting many types of data, but may also raise privacy, control, and equity issues. Scientific review processes to ensure data quality need to be coordinated with the types of quality control and review employed by national statistical agencies for trusted economic and social statistics. Although large investments are already being made in some observing systems such as satellite-based remote sensing, additional resources are needed to fill key gaps, make data useful for decision making, and build capacity in developing countries.

One piece of this puzzle is the early history of the Earth where large impacts, notably giant impacts, provided conditions where both volatile and refractory elements were mixed on atomic scale in extremely hot dense fluids. Carbides and nitrides that have recently been found in mantle rock are possible remnants of such large scale dynamic pressure-temperature conditions. In particular carbides and nitrides of lithophile refractory elements like Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta may remain in the mantle for extended time and contribute to the mantle geochemical budget of these elements as well as that of C and N.\nIn a first step towards testing such a hypothesis, we conducted a series of shock experiments. Deflagration of C-N-O-H compounds was triggered by shockwaves. The resulting reaction wave front propagated into aggregates of refractory minerals like zircon, baddeleyite, rutile. This fluid-solid mix was subjected to shock compression to shock pressures of 20-50 GPa and temperatures in the range of 0.5-1.104 K by means of reverberating shock. Recovered sample material was analyzed by synchrotron X-ray diffraction and by EPMA.",

The hydrologic implications of this rapid ice retreat and changing climate conditions have been the focus of numerous studies, but the consequent effects on the sediment cascade in valleys and tributaries has received considerably less attention.\nIn the present study, we investigated the role of glacial recession on sediment mobilization and deposition in a mountain valley catchment at Fox Glacier, New Zealand. In particular, we analyze the role of glacier recession on the formation of sediment fans in the main valley. Emphasis was put on the role of sediment, impounded by the glacier in side tributaries, becoming rapidly available for remobilization as the glacier retreats. The method is based on field observations, and measurements using high resolution GNSS (Trimble R8 survey grade differential GNSS) and photogrammetric methods using Structure from Motion based on ground-, helicopter- and UAV- photographs. Field observations were conducted in the period 2014 – 2015, and have been complimented with analogic modeling in the laboratory, in order to comprehend the processes driving rapid fan formation. The analogic model reproduced the retreat of the glacier and the response of a tributary, with simulations for both glaciated and de-glaciated conditions. For similar hydrologic and slope parameters, the fans created after glacial retreat have shown an acceleration in their formation of up to 12 times compared to fanes created without glacial influence. Field observations within the period 2013 – 2015 of Straight Creek Fan (Fox Valley, New Zealand) have confirmed laboratory simulations, with the fan growing to a radius superior to 200 m and a valley-long width superior to 450 m. As glaciers continue to retreat, it can be expected that sediment surges will occur in affected valleys, without the requirements of other forcing like earthquake or extreme weather events.",

            "abstract": "The stratigraphy of the Miyazaki-oki forearc basin along the Southwest Japan Arc comprises the early Miocene to early Pleistocene Miyazaki Group and the Hyuganada Group. These groups comprise sediments (up to 5000 m) deposited in deep marine to shallow marine environments. Based on characteristics of well data outside seismic exploration area and stratigraphy of land areas, the Miyazaki Group was divided into four seismic units and the Hyuganada Group was divided into two seismic units. In this area, bottom-simulating reflectors (BSRs) have been widely observed and considered as representing lower boundaries of methane-hydrate-bearing deposits. However, the gas hydrate accumulation mechanism for this area is not yet well understood. We show the relation between sandy sediment distribution identified from the 3D seismic geomorphological analysis and methane hydrate occurrence to identify the accumulation mechanism.\nA submarine fan system was subdivided into four seismic facies: Submarine canyon complexes; Leveed channel complexes; Submarine fan complexes; Mass transport complexes (MTD). Depositional systems of target layers are characterized by a transition from submarine fan deposits (Miyazaki Group) to channel–levee deposits and MTD (Hyuganada Group). This transition of depositional environments is strongly influenced by global tectonics since early Miocene in the Southwest Japan Arc.\nA part of channel-fill located around structural wing and middle fan deposits above the BSR is inferred as sediments intercalated with sandy layers. We consider that these deposits contain methane hydrate because the sandy sediment distribution approximately coincides with a high-velocity zone as an indicator of gas hydrate. The comparison of the areal extent of the seismic facies and the mapped structural configuration, suggest that the gas hydrate accumulation represent combination structural-stratigraphic trap.",

We investigated the detailed spatial distribution of stress by dividing the region into a zone containing the PF, as well as the areas east and west of the PF zone. Our results of stress tensor inversions show that orientations of -axis are nearly parallel to those of relative plate motions at the PF zone and eastern regions. On the other hand, at the western region, orientations of -axis are significantly different from those of the relative plate movements. In particular, the orientations of -axis in a southern part (Bohol region) are substantially different (> ~ 60°) from those of the relative plate motions. Also, the orientations of -axis in northern part (Mindoro region) are different (~ 30°) from those in the entire Philippines. The -axes and -axes in the Bohol and Mindoro regions are almost opposite, and they are parallel to the strike of the PF. This result strongly suggests that observed heterogeneous stress orientations west from the PF are caused by the left-lateral slip on a central part of the fault. This region approximately corresponds to the Masbate fault, a large slipping segment of the PF which is characterized by the occurrence of a large number of moderate-sized events and creeps. Numerical model calculations incorporating the slip on the Masbate fault successfully reproduced the observed features of stress orientations, and imply the possibility of a low coupling at the Philippines and Negros subduction zones.",

The clay mineral results show high contents of smectite (35-55%), moderate contents of illite (16-31%), kaolinite (11-29%), and chlorite (8-15%). Due to distinction of clay mineral assemblages from each sediment provenance, the Indonesian Archipelago is the majority of smectite source, whereas North Boneo mainly provides illite to the southern South China Sea. Therefore, the smectite/illite ratio is applied to determine the sediment provenance variations. Both the mineralogical ratio and median grain size show consistent sediment source and dynamic variations since the last glaciation, in which case the response of sediment provenance change due to the sea level rise is expected. Our study suggests a three-stage evolution of the sediment provenance variation on the Sunda slope in the southern South China Sea: (1) during the low sea level stand of the last glaciation, the high content of smectite implies that the Indonesian Archipelago provided the majority of sediments to this area through the Molengraaff paleo-river system; (2) during the sea level rise of the deglaciation, the decreasing of smectite content but the increasing of illite indicates that the Indonesian Archipelago reduced in sediments supply due to regression of coastline, whereas North Boneo increased sediment supply; (3) during the high sea level stand of Holocene, the smectite content increases again, implying that the Indonesian Archipelago provides sediments to this area again through the ocean circulation. Consequently, the sea level rise mainly results in sediment provenance change in the southern South China Sea since the last deglaciation.",

This process may pervade extensive areas of silicate planetary bodies, in geologic settings as diverse as cratered fracture zones and fault systems in ultramafic rocks, hydrothermal flow systems operating near crust/mantle interfaces, and deep subsurface groundwater flow systems. Serpentinization causes transformations in mineralogy, rock geochemistry, and co-occurring associated water chemistry that together control the feasibilities of prominent microbial metabolisms. Changing activities of aqueous H2, CH4, CO2, CO, organic acids, H+, and other redox-sensitive dissolved species shift the metabolic landscape in serpentinites in predictable ways, providing expected patterns in community metabolic strategies.

As the rapid expanding of mobile communications, the mobile communication infrastructure plays a very fundamental role in the disaster response and recovery activities. For this reason, its disruption will lead to loss of life and property, due to information delays and errors. Therefore, disaster preparedness and response of mobile communication infrastructure itself is quite important.\nIn many cases of experienced disasters, the disruption of mobile communication networks is usually caused by the network congestion and afterward long-term power outage. In order to reduce this disruption, the knowledge of communication demands during disasters is necessary. And big data analytics will provide a very promising way to predict the communication demands by analyzing the big amount of operational data of mobile users in a large-scale mobile network.\nUnder the US-Japan collaborative project on ‘Big Data and Disaster Research (BDD)’ supported by the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and National Science Foundation (NSF), we are going to investigate the application of big data techniques in the disaster preparedness and response of mobile communication infrastructure. Specifically, in this research, we have considered to exploit the big amount of operational information of mobile users for predicting the communications needs in different time and locations. By incorporating with other data such as shake distribution of an estimated major earthquake and the power outage map, we are able to provide the prediction information of stranded people who are difficult to confirm safety or ask for help due to network disruption. In addition, this result could further facilitate the network operators to assess the vulnerability of their infrastructure and make suitable decision for the disaster preparedness and response.\nIn this presentation, we are going to introduce the results we obtained based on the big data analytics of mobile user statistical information and discuss the implications of these results.",

            "abstract": "We investigated travel times of Pn waves, which are of great important for understanding the Moho structure in Taiwan region. Although several high quality tomographic studies had been carried out, observations of Pn waves are still the most comprehensive way to elucidate the Moho structure. Mapping the Moho structure of Taiwan had been a challenging due to the small spatial dimension of Taiwan island with two subduction systems. To decipher the tectonic structure and understanding of earthquake hazard, the island of Taiwan have been implemented by several high density seismic stations, including 71 short-period stations of Central Weather Bureau Seismic Network (CWBSN) and 42 broardband stations of Broadband Array in Taiwan for Seismology (BATS). High quality seismic records of these stations would be used to identify precise Pn-wave arrival times. After station-elevation correction, we measure the difference between the observed and theoretical Pn arrivals from the IASPI 91 model for each station. For correcting uncertainties of earthquake location and origin time, we estimate relative Pn anomaly, ΔtPn , between each station and a reference station. The pattern of ΔtPn reflects the depth anomaly of Moho beneath Taiwan. In general, Pn waves are commonly observed from shallow earthquake at epicentral distance larger than 120 km. We search the global catalog since 2005 and the criteria are M > 5.5, focal depth < 30 km and epicentral distance > 150 km. The 12 medium earthquakes from north Luzon are considered for analysis. We choose a station, TWKB, in the most southern point of Taiwan as the reference station due to that all events are from the south. The results indicate obvious different patterns of ΔtPn from different back-azimuths. The ΔtPn pattern of the events in the first group from the south south-east indicates that the Pn arrivals delay suddenly when the Pn waves pass through the Central Range, suggesting the Moho becomes deep rapidly. However, we cannot recognize the same pattern when the events from due south in the second group. The ΔtPn pattern in the second group has a clear slow gradient from the south to north through Taiwan island. It may be relative to a smooth dipping structure of the Moho. Both ΔtPn patterns reveal large delays in northern Taiwan which may be related to the north subduction structure.",

Since 2011, a broad-band seismometer array with 15 seismometers has been gradually deployed to date in the study area to collect continuous waveform data for host rock characterization study. In this study, we presented a series of study results, including location/relocation of regional earthquakes, seismic focal mechanisms, and inversion of three dimensional Vp and Vp/Vs models. A double-difference tomography algorithm was adopted in both earthquake relocation and three-dimensional velocity inversion to improve location accuracy and model reliability. Spatial distribution of earthquakes could be separated into two clusters. The eastern group was distributed nearly along the eastern boundary of granite outcrop in the surface; the other group was mainly located beneath the western part of imbricated high-magnetic-susceptibility zones, which were identified by three-dimensional inversion of aeromagnetic data. In-between there exists a clear zone with relatively quiet seismicity. Moreover, our Vp and Vp/Vs inversion results also revealed patterns compatible with previous-mentioned imbricate structures and shown good correlation with the high magnetic susceptibility zones as well. In addition, more than one hundred earthquake events with clear P-wave first motion in waveform were identified for demonstration. Their focal mechanisms were also determined and shown dramatic variation with respect to the depth of hypocenters. Mechanisms of earthquakes in shallow crust with depth less than 10 km are mostly normal faults. In contrast, most of deeper events are reverse faults. It implies that tectonic stress regime in shallow crust is extensional and becomes more compressional in deeper part.",

Droughts in this area were being intensified throughout all seasons. In particular, this intensifying trend was pronounced in the summer and autumn. In the summer, the PDSI showed an overall increase from the early 1990s to the late 1900s, and then, it rapidly decreased after the late 1990s. Therefore, this study focused on summer droughts and analyzed mean differences before the late 1990s (9098) and after the late 1990s (9905).\nRegarding differences in 850 hPa stream flows between the two periods, anomalous anticyclonic circulations were strengthened in northern China and Mongolia that showed strong negative anomalies in the PDSI. These anomalous anticyclones were formed as a positive North Atlantic Oscillation pattern formed in the European region spread eastward in the form of wave trains.\nThe anomalous antcyclones formed in northern China and Mongolia were led to reduced total cloud cover. As a result, this region exhibied high sensible heat net fluxes. Consequently, warm and dry anticyclones may have recently been strengthened in this region, thereby intensifying droughts.\nAs this shows, recently strengthened warm and dry anticyclones in northern China and Mongolia were associated with recently reduced snow depths in this region during the preceding spring. In recent years, the frequency of Asian dust has also increased due to warm and dry air conditions.\nAcknowledgements:\nThis research was carried out as a part of \"Development and application of technology for weather forecast\" supported by the 2015 National Institute of Meteorological Research (NIMR) in the Korea Meteorological Administration.",

            "abstract": "Recent models of planets formation have faced the possibility that (volatile-rich) carbonaceous chondrites are the possible carrier of water and complex carbon molecules. The Tagish Lake (TL) meteorite is a classified C2 ungroup chondrite whose bulk and organic chemistry compositions have received a considerable attention owing to the short-time exposure before being collected. TL is likely representative of D-type asteroids known to contain complex organic compounds, and was described including aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons considered to be building blocks of life (Gilmour 2001; Pizzarello et al. 2001). Recent studies on the spatial distribution and mineralogical association of organics in TL meteorites show a certain affinity of organic compounds for S-bearing phases such as Fe-Ni sulfide coexisting with abundant carbonate (Ca-Mg-Fe-Mn solid solution), magnetite and serpentine (Zega et al. 2010). In particular, carbonate is believed to form from the organic matter during hydrothermal alteration with implications for the carbon (C) isotopic signature. Therefore, the knowledge of how carbonaceous matter survived during the history of a meteorite at extreme pressures-temperatures is of fundamental importance to solve the mystery of the origin of life.\nIn order to investigate the behavior of carbonaceous matter and to constrain the stability and structural evolution of organics and in Tagish Lake meteorite during petrological processes (melting, solid state reaction etc.), we carried heating experiments at 5 GPa and temperature between 800-1400 °C using multi anvil apparatus at GRC, Ehime University. The recovered samples were polished for textural and chemical characterization of the mineral phases using FE-SEM and electron microprobe, respectively. Ultra-thin sections, 80–100 nm thick, were prepared from the recovered samples using focused ion beam. These sections were then transferred to TEM grids for in situ X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) analyses of carbon at the Advanced Light Source, Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (beamline BL5.3.2.2). Preliminary results show an increase in the aromatic component (A) with development of graphene structure (E) after high temperature and pressure experiment.",

            "abstract": "In the troposphere, the photochemical oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is primarily initiated by their reactions with the hydroxyl radical (OH) which yields peroxy radicals (HO2 and RO2). Concentrations of OH and the rates of VOC oxidation depend on the efficiency of peroxy radical recycling to OH. Radical recycling mainly occurs through reaction of HO2 with NO to produce NO2 and, ultimately, ozone (O3). Hence, the rate of VOC oxidation is dependent on NOx (=NO+NO2) concentration.\nThe Shale Oil and Natural Gas Nexus (SONGNEX) campaign was conducted from March 17 to April 29, 2015 with the main goal of identifying and quantifying industrial sources of pollutants throughout the United States, in particular those associated with the production of oil and natural gas. In this work, a case study of biogenic VOC oxidation within and outside a power plant plume in the Haynesville basin near the border of Texas and Louisiana is presented. Isoprene, monoterpenes and their oxides were measured by H3O+ chemical ionization mass spectrometry (H3O+ CIMS) in high time resolution (1 s). Further, an improved Whole Air Sampler (iWAS) was used to collect samples for post-flight analysis by gas chromatography mass spectrometric detection (GC-MS) and yielded speciated quantification of biogenic VOCs. The monoterpene oxide to monoterpene ratio follows the spatial extent of the plume as judged by another tracer (NOx), tracking the enhancement of oxidation rates by NOx. The observations are rationalized with the aid of box modeling using the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM).",

At some localities over a horizontal distance of 2.5 km, heat flow increased by as much as 50%, from typical values of 65 to 100 mW/m2 .Some vertical fractures were observed beneath topographic highs in previous studies.Based on the profile across borehole SH7,we designed four experiments:A,uniform distribution of heat flux with no vertical fractures；B,Uniform distribution of heat flux with vertical fractures beneath geographic highs;C,uneven distribution of heat flux with no vertical fractures;D,uneven distribution of heat flux with vertical fractures beneath geographic highs.According to previous studies,we restored Palaeobathymetry,abundance of organic matters, sandstone-madstone ratio ,porosity and permeability of each,and parameters of vertical fractures.The result of experiment D shows the similar distribution characteristic with the drilling result,so We believe that low heat flux and Vertical fractures are the most important factors .\nThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China(grant no. 41406080).",

Here we capitalize on collaborations established by the Great American Biotic Interchange - Research Experience for Teachers (GABI-RET) and the Panama Canal Project - Partnerships in International Research and Education (PCP-PIRE) to create a series of hands-on activities that investigate the dynamic response of various components of the Earth’s system to changes in ocean gateways through time. In particular, we focus on the rise of the Isthmus of Panama and subsequent closure of the Central American Seaway that provide an opportune platform for the interdisciplinary teaching of multiple secondary education topics. Relevant themes include, but are not limited to, geologic time, dating techniques, plate tectonics, ocean circulation, climate, and the speciation/diversification of life. We have taken a versatile approach to these activities by simulating deep sea sediment cores, complete with 3D printed microfossils and related data, that allow students to actively apply the scientific method to simplified geologic archives, graph and assess evidence, and debate their findings in a project based format. The exercises themselves are designed to meet Next Generation and Florida State Science Standards for 6th grade Earth Science and 12th grade Environmental Management/Science classes, though the nature of the activities can be adapted to intermediary skill levels with relative ease. The project kit is designed for use in classrooms without ready access to computers or microscopes and the associated lesson plans/materials will be made available through the GABI-RET and PaleoTEACH websites.",

            "abstract": "The formation of the solar system/extrasolar planets largely takes place in the gas-rich solar nebular/protoplanetary disks. Nebular magnetic fields are thought to play a dominant role in global disk evolution by driving angular momentum transport via the magneto-rotational instability and/or magnetized disk winds, with the magnetically-driven accretion rate proportional to the square of the field strength. Previous paleomagnetic analyses of the Semarkona meteorite found evidence for a ~5-50 µT solar nebular field at ~2-3 My after the formation of calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs), which consist of the first solids condensed from the cooling protoplanetary disk. These field strengths are consistent with stellar accretion rates of ~10-8 Msun/yr as typically observed for Sun-like stars. A key remaining question is the time when the nebular magnetic field and solar nebula itself dispersed. To address this, we analyzed the paleomagnetism of angrites, a class of exceptionally well-preserved igneous rocks that should retain magnetic records beginning just ~4 My after CAI formation. Here we present paleomagnetic, rock magnetic, and synchrotron-based transmission X-ray microscopic analyses of the quenched angrites D’Orbigny, Sahara 99555 and Asuka 881371. Our data show that the magnetic field at the angrite parent body region was < ~0.1 µT at ~4 My after CAI formation. This indicates that the nebular magnetic field had rapidly declined by at least a factor of ~50 by that time, such that the magnetically driven solar accretion rate was well below 10-11 Msun/yr. Because a strong nebular magnetic field was likely present throughout most of the gaseous disk lifetime, our results suggest that the solar nebula itself had probably already dispersed by ~4 My after CAI formation. This dispersal time agrees with typical protoplanetary disk lifetimes inferred from infrared excesses for Sun-like protostars. Our results suggest that the formation of the solar system giant planets, as well as the gas phase planetary migration, had largely completed by ~4 My after CAI formation. Furthermore, the formation of chondrules after this period would have not required substantial magnetic fields or nebular gas, thereby favoring planetesimal collision models over nebular shocks and magnetic reconnection.",

Recently, a few process-based models have been proposed to estimate DOC loading to water environments, which assume DOC source in topsoil and transport process to the river. However, the models require large number of input data and are not designed for short time scale calculation of intensive rainfall runoff with in Asian monsoon area. We proposed a new DOC runoff model with both soil and river runoff processes enforced by DOC Source Area (DSA) concept. The data were collected at middle stream (98ha) and downstream (1798ha) in the Mizugaki Experimental Watershed, Yamanashi, Japan from 2009 to 2012. Dry-wet cycle and long-term variation in soil were successfully simulated by advection-diffusion and dissolution formulations of the Soil Submodel. Runoff Submodel included hydrological calculation unit, TOPMODEL, to separately quantify base flow (Qb), subsurface flow (Qsf) and overland flow (Qof). Qsf and Qof were assumed to represent for DSA, and the DOC loading was calculated by Qsf, Qof and the estimated DOC concentration from the Soil Submodel. The results showed that the model performed well for 4 among 11 events at the middle stream while the simulated DOC loadings were overestimated for all 8 events downstream. The reason of the low performance of the model was attributed to the error of Qsf and Qof calculated by TOPMODEL.",

GNSS enables Earth science research in areas including tectonic plate interactions, crustal deformation in response to loading by tectonics, magmatism, water and ice, and the dynamics of water - and thereby energy transfer - in the atmosphere at regional scale. The many individual scientists and organizations that set up GNSS stations globally are often open to sharing data, but lack the resources or expertise to deploy systems and software to manage and curate data and metadata and provide user tools that would support data sharing.\nUNAVCO previously gained experience in facilitating data sharing through the NASA-supported development of the Geodesy Seamless Archive Centers (GSAC) open source software. GSAC provides web interfaces and simple web services for data and metadata discovery and access, supports federation of multiple data centers, and simplifies transfer of data and metadata to long-term archives. The NSF supported the dissemination of GSAC to multiple European data centers forming the European Plate Observing System. To expand upon GSAC to provide end-to-end, instrument-to-distribution capability, UNAVCO developed Dataworks for GNSS with NSF funding to the COCONet project, and deployed this software on systems that are now operating as Regional GNSS Data Centers as part of the NSF-funded TLALOCNet and COCONet projects.\nDataworks consists of software modules written in Python and Java for data acquisition, management and sharing. There are modules for GNSS receiver control and data download, a database schema for metadata, tools for metadata handling, ingest software to manage file metadata, data file management scripts, GSAC, scripts for mirroring station data and metadata from partner GSACs, and extensive software and operator documentation. UNAVCO plans to provide a cloud VM image of Dataworks that would allow standing up a Dataworks-enabled GNSS data center without requiring upfront investment in server hardware. By enabling data creators to organize their data and metadata for sharing, Dataworks helps scientists expand their data curation awareness and responsibility, and enhances data access for all.",

Atmospheric deposition of ammonium, NOy, and organic nitrogen simulated by the atmospheric chemistry model CHASER from the pre-industrial time to the present was used. Annual total nitrogen deposition was estimated to increase from 27 Tg N in 1901 to 77 Tg N in 2014. The total N2O emission was also estimated to increase in the period, but it was largely attributable to the increased emission from croplands.

The changes in soil environment due to the CO2 leakage might have an enormous effect on the plant growth. As a preliminary study, we conducted a research focusing on the germination process because it is known to be especially sensitive to the environmental change. The objective of this study is to investigate the impacts of high soil CO2 concentration on the germination of different species. A laboratory experiment was designed to investigate the effect of high soil CO2 concentration on germination rate and soil physicochemical/microbial parameters. Cabbage, corn, bean, and wheat were selected for this study. The concentrations of the injected CO2 treatments were 10%, 30%, 60% and 100%, and the actual soil CO2 concentration ranged from 3.6% to 53.2%. Two types of controls were employed: the one connected with ambient air tank and the other connected with nothing. The final germination rates of four crops were not different between the controls and 10% treatment, but the delay of germination was observed in cabbage, corn, and bean. At 30% treatment, the germination rates of cabbage, corn and bean were 38%, while that of wheat was 78%. No seed was germinated at 60% and 100% treatments. After the incubation, soil pH decreased from 6.0 in the controls to 5.6 in the 100% treatment. The contents of soil total C and total N were not different among treatments. Activities of microbial fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis were not different among treatments for all plants. Five kinds of soil extracellular enzyme activities were not affected by the CO2 treatments. Our results suggest that: 1) Soil CO2 concentration at 3-4% did not inhibit germination of four crops. 2) Wheat is most resistant to high soil CO2 concentration in this study. 3) Soil microbial parameters were more tolerant during the short term injection.",

            "abstract": "In recent years, there have been studies of the use of airborne electromagnetic methods to extract data on the areas likely to cause deep-seated catastrophic landslides or shallow landslides. In this data extraction, it is important to show the underground geological structures and hydrological conditions by using specific electrical resistance. However, there have been insufficient studies in this field. Therefore, in this study, we focused on areas in which deep-seated catastrophic landslides or shallow landslides had occurred in the past. We then used the distributions of specific electrical resistance to study the geological structure and hydrological conditions of areas likely to cause landslides.\nFirst, in each study area, we tried to understand the geological planar distributions and the characteristics of the specific electrical resistance. Next, we tried to use the specific electrical resistance to understand the characteristics of the landslides areas. Last, we used the results to determine the geological distribution and hydrological condition of areas likely to cause deep-seated catastrophic landslides or shallow landslides.\nWe obtained the following results. In areas in which deep-seated catastrophic landslides had occurred, we found two distribution patterns of specific electrical resistance. In the first pattern, the specific electrical resistance changed suddenly around the face of the collapse. In the second pattern, the specific resistance was low overall in areas of high groundwater. In areas in which shallow landslides had occurred, we found that the contour of the specific electrical resistance was vertical and that groundwater was able to flow easily from the geologic boundary.",

            "abstract": "Significant changes have occurred in permafrost and seasonally frozen ground conditions in the Tibetan Plateau over the last few decades. These changes could have large impacts on the land surface energy and water balance, with potential influences on regional climate, hydrological and ecosystem processes. In this study, we investigated recent changes in permafrost and seasonally frozen ground conditions in the plateau from recent climate warming using simulations based on the Geophysical Institute of Permafrost Laboratory (GIPL2) model. We calibrated and validated GIPL2 at selected CAMP/Tibet (2002-2004) sites, and performed sensitivity analysis at a multiscale soil moisture and temperature monitoring network in the central Tibet (Nagqu site, 2010-2012). Our initial sensitivity analysis indicated that better simulations of soil thermal regime were obtained through using in-situ surface ground temperature (T0cm) measurements than using surface air temperature. Our simulations from 1987 to 2014 showed a significant increase in the active layer thickness (~0.043 m yr-1, p<0.001) in discontinuous permafrost areas (Wudaoliang and Tuotuohe sites) and decrease in the maximum soil frozen depth (0.028~0.064 m yr-1, p<0.001) in seasonally frozen soils (Amdo, Nagqu and Damxung sites). Such distinct soil thawing is mainly caused by strong climate warming, as indicated from in-situ measurements of both in-situ air temperature and T0cm. The climate records suggest significant advance of spring thawing (-0.27~-0.65 day yr-1, p<0.1) and delay in autumn surface freezing (0.12~0.33 day yr-1, p<0.1 except for Nagqu site). In addition, the climate records show much stronger warming rate in the surface ground than overlying surface air, especially in the spring and fall, likely due to changes in the surface energy balance with potential large influence on the soil thermal regime and freeze/thaw processes. Our future research will include mapping the permafrost vulnerability to climate change over the whole plateau using regional simulations based on GIPL2.",

            "abstract": "To understand the acceleration of electrons during a substorm reconnection event we have applied a semi-global particle in cell (PIC) simulation box embedded within a global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of Earth’s magnetosphere for an event on February 15, 2008. The MHD results were used to populate the PIC simulation and to set the boundary conditions. In the magnetotail we found that a series of dipolarizations formed due to unsteady reconnection. We also found that the most energetic electrons were in the separatrices far from the x-point. We attributed the acceleration to a streaming instability in the separatrices. To further understand electron acceleration we have applied the large scale kinetic (LSK) technique in which tens- to hundreds- of thousands of electrons are followed within the electric and magnetic fields from the PIC simulations., Electrons are already included in the PIC simulation, but the LSK simulations will allow selected individual particles to be followed and analyzed. Initially we performed electron LSK calculations in a two dimensional version of the PIC simulation in which electrons were allowed to move in the ignorable cross tail direction. These LSK calculations showed that electrons gained energy primarily for two reasons: (1) acceleration by the average dawn to dusk electric field and (2) acceleration by intense but localized electric field structures. The overall electron transport was more dawnward than duskward due to the average electric field. At the same time electrons typically moved away from the reconnection region in both the earthward and tailward directions. Superimposed on this large-scale transport was motion in both the dusk and dawn directions across the tail because of the electric field structures, which were particularly intense in the separatrices. LSK calculations are now being carried out by using the full three-dimensional magnetic and electric fields from the PIC simulation and these results will be compared with the two-dimensional results for the same substorm event.",

The JPSS program is the follow-on for both space and ground systems to the Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellites (POES) managed by NOAA. The JPSS satellites will carry a suite of sensors designed to collect meteorological, oceanographic, climatological and geophysical observations of the Earth.\nThe ground processing system for JPSS is known as the JPSS Common Ground System (JPSS CGS). Developed and maintained by Raytheon Intelligence, Information and Services (IIS), the CGS is a globally distributed, multi-mission system serving NOAA, NASA and their national and international partners. The CGS has demonstrated its scalability and flexibility to incorporate multiple missions efficiently and with minimal cost, schedule and risk, while strengthening global partnerships in weather and environmental monitoring.\nIn a highly successful international partnership between NOAA and the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the CGS currently provides data routing from McMurdo Station in Antarctica to the EUMETSAT processing center in Darmstadt, Germany. Continuing and building upon that partnership, NOAA and EUMETSAT are collaborating on the development of a new path forward for the 2020’s. One approach being explored is a concept of operations where each organization shares satellite downlink resources with the other.

            "abstract": "Solar prominences consist of relatively cool and dense plasma embedded in the hotter solar corona above the solar limb. They form along magnetic polarity inversion lines, and are magnetically supported against gravity at heights of up to ~100 Mm above the chromosphere. Often, parts of prominences visually resemble Earth-based tornados, with inverted-cone-shaped structures and internal motions suggestive of rotation. These “prominence tornados” clearly possess complex magnetic structure, but it is still not certain whether they actually rotate around a ‘’rotation’’ axis, or instead just appear to do so because of composite internal material motions such as counter-streaming flows or lateral (i.e. transverse to the field) oscillations. Here we study the structure and dynamics of five randomly selected prominences, using extreme ultraviolet (EUV) 171 Å images obtained with high spatial and temporal resolution by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft. All of the prominences resided in non-active-region locations, and displayed what appeared to be tornado-like rotational motions. Our set includes examples oriented both broadside and end-on to our line-of-sight. We created time-distance plots of horizontal slices at several different heights of each prominence, to study the horizontal plasma motions. We observed patterns of oscillations at various heights in each prominence, and we measured parameters of these oscillations. We find the oscillation time periods to range over ~50 – 90 min, with average amplitudes of ~6,000 km, and with average velocities of ~7 kms-1. We found similar values for prominences viewed either broadside or end-on; this observed isotropy of the lateral oscillatory motion suggests that the apparent oscillations result from actual rotational plasma motions and/or lateral oscillations of the magnetic field, rather than to counter-streaming flows.

            "abstract": "STAR (Self-sustaining Treatment for Active Remediation) is an innovative remediation technology based on the principles of smoldering combustion where the contaminants are the fuel. The self-sustaining aspect means that a single, local ignition event can result in many days of contaminant destruction in situ. Presented research to date has focused on bench scale experiments, numerical modelling and process understanding. Presented here is the maturation of the in situ technology, including three field pilot tests and a full-scale implementation to treat coal tar-impacted soils. The first pilot determined a Radius of Influence (ROI) for a single ignition of approximately eight feet with an average propagation rate of the reaction of approximately one foot per day. TPH concentrations in soils were reduced from 10,000 milligrams per kilogram to a few hundred milligrams per kilogram. The second pilot was conducted in an area of significant void spaces created through the anthropogenic deposition of clay bricks and tiles. The void spaces led to pre-mature termination of the combustion reaction, limiting ROI and the effectiveness of the technology in this setting. The third case study involved the pilot testing, design, and full-scale implementation of STAR at a 37-acre former chemical manufacturing facility. Three phases of pilot testing were conducted within two hydrogeologic units at the site (i.e., surficial fill and deep alluvial sand units). Pilot testing within the fill demonstrated self-sustained coal tar destruction rates in excess of 800 kg/day supported through air injection at a single well. Deep sand unit testing (twenty-five feet below the water table) resulted in the treatment of a targeted six-foot layer of impacted fine sands to a radial distance of approximately twelve feet. These results (and additional parameters) were used to develop a full-scale STAR design consisting of approximately 1500 surficial fill ignition points and 500 deep sand ignition points and two treatment (air distribution and vapor collection / treatment) systems to remediate an approximately 14-acre footprint of contaminated soils within the project timelines (i.e., by mid-2016). Field activities began in 2014 and progress is currently on-schedule.",

            "abstract": "Convergent margins undergoing oblique subduction develop margin-parallel structural domains, which are responsible for the accommodation of long-term crustal deformation within the overriding plate. Although the Andes are no exception, evidence of transverse-to-the-orogen regional structures has been documented along its entire length. The relevance of these structures is widely recognized; however, whether and how they participate in the accommodation of crustal deformation is not yet fully understood. The Southern Volcanic Zone of the Andes (SVZ) is an excellent area to address this problem because it displays regional transverse-to-the-arc structures which play a strong structural control on the spatial distribution and genesis of volcanoes and geothermal springs, which proves the existence of a strong interplay between tectonics and magmatic/hydrothermal fluid flow.\nThis work aims to determine the nature and kinematics of selected case studies of transverse structures along the SVZ during the different phases of the subduction seismic cycle and their structural interaction with margin-parallel fault systems, particularly the strike-slip, intra-arc Liquiñe-Ofqui Fault System (LOFS). By the implementation of an elastic, regional-scale, numerical model of the subduction at the Chilean margin using the boundary elements method (BEM), fault slip rates and associated displacement, strain and stress fields in the surrounding continental lithosphere are calculated for the case study sites.\nPreliminary results show that the LOFS behaves as a dextral-reverse structure during the interseismic period of the subduction seismic cycle, with increasing fault slip rates towards its southern end, where the western block moves at a rate of 7 mm/yr to the north, suggesting that the LOFS accounts for strain partitioning. It is expected that transverse structures, particularly those misorientated with respect to the prevailing stress field, will display considerably lower slip rate and require fluid overpressure to activate. These conditions should be roughly the opposite during the coseismic phase, when misorientated structures become favorably oriented for reactivation and for the favoring of magma/fluid ascent.",

            "abstract": "Iconic Australian dry and wet periods were driven by anomalous conditions in the tropical oceans, such as the worst short-term drought in the southeast in 1982 associated with the strong El Niño and the widespread “Big Wet” in 1974 linked with a La Niña event. The association with oceanic conditions makes droughts predictable to some extent. However, prediction can be difficult when there is no clear external forcing such as El Niños. Can dry spells be triggered and maintained with no ocean memory? In this study, we investigate the potential role of internal multi-century atmospheric variability in controlling the frequency, duration and intensity of long-term dry and wet spells over Australia. Two multi-century-scale simulations were performed with the NCAR CESM: (1) a fully-coupled simulation (CPLD) and (2) an atmospheric simulation forced by a seasonal SST climatology derived from the coupled experiment (ACGM).\nResults reveal that droughts and wet spells can indeed be generated by internal variability of the atmosphere. Those internally generated events are less severe than those forced by oceanic variability, however the duration of dry and wet spells longer than 3 years is comparable with and without the ocean memory. Large-scale ocean modes of variability seem to play an important role in producing continental-scale rainfall impacts over Australia. While the Pacific Decadal Oscillation plays an important role in generating droughts in the fully coupled model, perturbations of monsoonal winds seem to be the main trigger of dry spells in the AGCM case. Droughts in the mid-latitude regions such as Tasmania can be driven by perturbations in the Southern Annular Mode, not necessarily linked to oceanic conditions even in the fully-coupled model. The mechanisms behind internally-driven mega-droughts and mega-wets will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "We evaluated the background noise level of seismic stations in order to collect the observation data of high quality and produce accurate seismic information. Determining of the background noise level was used PSD (Power Spectral Density) method by McNamara and Buland (2004) in this study. This method that used long-term data is influenced by not only innate electronic noise of sensor and a pulse wave resulting from stabilizing but also missing data and controlled by the specified frequency which is affected by the irregular signals without site characteristics. It is hard and inefficient to implement process that filters out the abnormal signal within the automated system. To solve these problems, we devised a method for extracting the data which normally distributed with 90 to 99% confidence intervals at each period. The availability of the method was verified using 62-seismic stations with broadband and short-period sensors operated by the KMA (Korea Meteorological Administration). Evaluation standards were NHNM (New High Noise Model) and NLNM (New Low Noise Model) published by the USGS (United States Geological Survey). It was designed based on the western United States. However, Korean Peninsula surrounded by the ocean on three sides has a complicated geological structure and a high population density. So, we re-designed an appropriate model in Korean peninsula by statistically combined result. The important feature is that secondary-microseism peak appeared at a higher frequency band.\nAcknowledgements:\nThis research was carried out as a part of \"Research for the Meteorological and Earthquake Observation Technology and Its Application\" supported by the 2015 National Institute of Meteorological Research (NIMR) in the Korea Meteorological Administration.",

We use output from the Clouds On Off Klimate Intercomparison Experiment (COOKIE) to test the hypothesis that local cloud radiative heating pulls convection equatorward (where sea surface temperatures are at a maximum). In aqua planet simulations with a fixed SST pattern, the cloud radiative effect leads to an equatorward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Additionally, cloud-radiation interactions strengthen the mean meridional circulation and consequently enhance the moisture convergence. Precipitation peaks at higher values in a narrower band when the cloud radiative effects are active, compared to when they are inactive, due to the enhancement in moisture convergence. We show that the cloud radiative heating in the upper troposphere increases the temperature, weakens CAPE, and inhibits the onset of convection until it is closer to the equator, where SSTs are higher. Cloud radiative heating reduces the total precipitation across the tropics while it enhances cloud water path (liquid plus ice), which suggests that the cloud radiative heating reduces precipitation efficiency in these models.",

            "abstract": "Tree cover delineation is a useful instrument in deriving Above Ground Biomass (AGB) density estimates from Very High Resolution (VHR) airborne imagery data. Numerous algorithms have been designed to address this problem, but most of them do not scale to these datasets which are of the order of terabytes. In this paper, we present a semi-automated probabilistic framework for the segmentation and classification of 1-m National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) for tree-cover delineation for the whole of Continental United States, using a High Performance Computing Architecture. Classification is performed using a multi-layer Feedforward Backpropagation Neural Network and segmentation is performed using a Statistical Region Merging algorithm. The results from the classification and segmentation algorithms are then consolidated into a structured prediction framework using a discriminative undirected probabilistic graphical model based on Conditional Random Field, which helps in capturing the higher order contextual dependencies between neighboring pixels. Once the final probability maps are generated, the framework is updated and re-trained by relabeling misclassified image patches. This leads to a significant improvement in the true positive rates and reduction in false positive rates. The tree cover maps were generated for the whole state of California, spanning a total of 11,095 NAIP tiles covering a total geographical area of 163,696 sq. miles. The framework produced true positive rates of around 88% for fragmented forests and 74% for urban tree cover areas, with false positive rates lower than 2% for both landscapes. Comparative studies with the National Land Cover Data (NLCD) algorithm and the LiDAR canopy height model (CHM) showed the effectiveness of our framework for generating accurate high-resolution tree-cover maps.",

            "abstract": "Validating large-scale estimates of geophysical variables by comparing them to in situ measurements neglects the fact that these in situ measurements are not generally representative of the larger area. That is, in situ measurements contain some `representativeness error’. They also have their own sensor errors. The naïve approach of characterizing the errors of a remote sensing or modeling dataset by comparison to in situ measurements thus leads to error estimates that are spuriously inflated by the representativeness and other errors in the in situ measurements. Nevertheless, this naïve approach is still very common in the literature. In this work, we introduce an alternative estimator of the large-scale dataset error that explicitly takes into account the fact that the in situ measurements have some unknown error. The performance of the two estimators is then compared in the context of soil moisture datasets under different conditions for the true soil moisture climatology and dataset biases. The new estimator is shown to lead to a more accurate characterization of the dataset errors under the most common conditions. If a third dataset is available, the principles of the triple collocation method can be used to determine the errors of both the large-scale estimates and in situ measurements. However, triple collocation requires that the errors in all datasets are uncorrelated with each other and with the truth. We show that even when the assumptions of triple collocation are violated, a triple collocation-based validation approach may still be more accurate than a naïve comparison to in situ measurements that neglects representativeness errors.",

While the identification of this microseismicity would invariably aid in the characterization and modeling of induced sequences, traditional earthquake detection techniques often provide incomplete catalogs, even when local networks are deployed. Because induced sequences often include scores of micro-earthquakes that prelude larger magnitude events, the identification of these small magnitude events would be crucial for the early identification of induced sequences. By taking advantage of the repeating, swarm-like nature of induced seismicity, a more robust catalog can be created using complementary correlation algorithms in near real-time without the reliance on traditional earthquake detection and association routines. Since traditional earthquake catalog methodologies using regional networks have a relatively high detection threshold (M 2+), we have sought to develop correlation routines that can detect smaller magnitude sequences. While short-term/long-term amplitude average detection algorithms requires significant signal-to-noise ratio at multiple stations for confident identification, a correlation detector is capable of identifying earthquakes with high confidence using just a single station. The result is an embarrassingly parallel task that can be employed for a network to be used as an early warning system for potentially induced seismicity while also better characterizing tectonic sequences beyond what traditional methods allow.",

In this study, we develop a numerical model incorporating rate-and-state friction properties to investigate fault slip initiated by various perturbations, including fluid injection and transient dynamic stress changes. In the framework of rate-and-state friction, external stress perturbations and their spatiotemporal variation can be coupled to fault frictional strength evolution in a single computational procedure. Hence it provides a quantitative understanding of the source processes (i.e., slip rate, rupture area, triggering threshold) of a spectrum of slip modes under the influence of anthropogenic and natural perturbations. Preliminary results show both the peak and cumulative Coulomb stress change values can affect the transition from aseismic to seismic slip and the amount of slip.\nWe plan to apply the physics-based slip model to induced earthquakes in western Canada sedimentary basins. In particular, we will focus on the Fox Creek sequences in north Alberta, where two earthquakes of ML4.4 (2015/01/23) and Mw4.6 (2015/06/13) were potentially induced by nearby hydraulic fracturing activity. The geometry of the seismogenic faults of the two events will be constrained by relocated seismicity as well as their focal mechanism solutions. Rate-and-state friction parameters and ambient stress conditions will be constrained by identifying dynamic triggering criteria using a matched-filter approach. A poroelastic model will be used to estimate the pore pressure history resolved onto the fault plane due to fluid injection. By comparing modeled earthquake source parameters to those estimated from seismic analysis, we aim to quantitatively discern the nucleation conditions of injection-induced versus dynamically triggered earthquakes, and aseismic versus seismic slip modes.",

The material parameters were determined, and the friction angle in extension was greater than the friction angle in compression, a sufficient condition for an intermediate stress effect. Multi-axial (plane strain) data were included and a twelve-sided failure surface with two different vertices was formed.

They are therefore natural vehicles for training undergraduates for the workforce. The NSF-funded Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance facility (IEDA), based at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, manages diverse geoscience data collections and is running a two-year pilot Data Internship Program with the City College of New York (CCNY). The program matches undergraduate students with senior researchers to compile, process, and analyze data for ingestion in IEDA repositories. The internship provides students with exposure to research areas beyond those currently available at CCNY, giving each student the opportunity to gain experiences and skills in the curation of authentic data. From the facility perspective, the work performed by the interns promotes IEDA data activities and increases awareness of the geoinformatics field amongst tomorrow’s potential geoscientists. In the first year, five interns participated in the program: two interns working on geochemistry projects throughout the academic year, and three working on geophysics projects over nine weeks in the summer. The geochemistry interns successfully engaged in the initial development of MoonDB, an archival database of lunar rock chemistry, and the geophysics interns undertook a compilation and analysis of multibeam swath bathymetry data from Japan’s JAMSTEC marine agency. Interns were involved with handling research-grade geochemical and geophysical data and maintained notes to allow reproducibility of their methods. They learned the basics of the data management software, how to dissect PhP data processing scripts, and how to track down data-related issues. By working at the Lamont campus, interns were exposed to a wide range of seminars given by in-house and visiting scientists. The IEDA interns completed regular assignments directly related to enhancing their understanding of the projects. At the end of the internship, all students reported an increased awareness and appreciation of how their projects fit into the wider field of geoscience and had gained valuable experience in the process of working within geoscience research.",

            "abstract": "Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis is an important mode of metabolism in deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Diffuse vent fluids often show a depletion in hydrogen with a corresponding increase in methane relative to pure-mixing of end member fluid and seawater, and genomic surveys show an enrichment in genetic sequences associated with known methanogens. However, because we cannot directly sample the subseafloor habitat where these organisms are living, constraining the size and activity of these populations remains a challenge and limits our ability to quantify the role they play in vent biogeochemistry. Reactive-transport modeling may provide a useful tool for approaching this problem. Here we present a reactive-transport model describing methane production along the flow-path of hydrothermal fluid from its high temperature end-member to diffuse venting at the seafloor. The model is set up to reflect conditions at several diffuse vents in the Axial Seamount. The model describes the growth of the two dominant thermophilic methanogens, Methanothermococcus and Methanocaldococcus, observed at Axial seamount. Monod and Arrhenius constants for Methanothermococcus thermolithotrophicus and Methanocaldococcus jannaschii were obtained for the model using chemostat and bottle experiments at varying temperatures. The model is used to investigate the influence of different mixing regimes on the subseafloor populations of these methanogens. By varying the model flow path length and subseafloor cell concentrations, and fitting to observed hydrogen and methane concentrations in the venting fluid, the subseafloor biomass, fluid residence time, and methane production rate can be constrained.",

Few direct long-term records, especially in the Pacific, limit our understanding of long-term natural variability necessary to predict future ITCZ changes. Here we present a tropical precipitation record from the Southern Hemisphere covering the past 282,000 years, inferred from of rare earth elements (REEs) to Ca ratios in the planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber shell calcite, of a marine sedimentary core MD05-2925 (9o20.60’S, 151o27.54’E; water depth 1661 m), collected off the eastern coast of Papua New Guinea. Unlike the precession paradigm expressed in its East Asian counterpart, our record shows that the western Pacific ITCZ migration was influenced by combined precession and obliquity changes. This obliquity forcing could be primarily delivered by a cross-hemispherical thermal/pressure contrast, resulting from the asymmetric continental configuration between Asia and Australia in a coupled East Asian-Australian circulation system, supported by model simulations. Our finding suggests that the obliquity forcing may play a more important role in global hydroclimate cycles than previously thought.",

            "abstract": "It has been known that numerous animals can use the Earth’s magnetic field for spatial orientation and long-distance navigation, nevertheless, how animals can respond to the magnetic field remain mostly ambiguous. The intensities of the global geomagnetic field varies between 23 and 66 μT, and the geomagnetic field intensity could drop to 10% during geomagnetic polarity reversals or geomagnetic excursions. Such dramatic changes of the geomagnetic field may pose a significant challenge for the evolution of magnetic compass in animals. For examples, it is vital whether the magnetic compass can still work in such very weak magnetic fields. Our previous experiment has demonstrated that a migratory bat (Nyctalus plancyi) uses a polarity compass for orientation during roosting when exposed to an artificial magnetic field (100 μT). Recently, we experimentally tested whether the N. plancyi can sense very weak magnetic fields that were even lower than those of the present-day geomagnetic field. Results showed: 1) the bats can sense the magnetic north in a field strength of present-day local geomagnetic field (51μT); 2) As the field intensity decreased to only 1/5th of the natural intensity (10 μT), the bats still responded by positioning themselves at the magnetic north. Notably, as the field polarity was artificially reversed, the bats still preferred the new magnetic north, even at the lowest field strength tested (10 μT). Hence, N. plancyi is able to detect the direction of a magnetic field with intensity range from twice to 1/5th of the present-day field strength. This allows them to orient themselves across the entire range of present-day global geomagnetic field strengths and sense very weak magnetic fields. We propose that this high sensitivity might have evolved in bats as the geomagnetic field strength varied and the polarity reversed tens of times over the past fifty million years since the origin of bats. The physiological mechanisms underlying magnetoreception in bats are key issues. We previously reported that there are soft magnetic particles (magnetites) in bat brains by rock magnetic measurements, implying a magnetite-based reception mechanism. Further c-fos histological studies on brain sections suggested hippocampal and thalamus neurons may involve in magnetoreception.",

            "abstract": "It has been reported that advection of air from land can be identified hundreds of kilometers off shore. With advection, moisture builds up downwind, and the evaporative flux decreases and isotopic flux ratios increase with distance. If a lake is small relative to the equilibration distance, the fluxes of all water isotopologues averaged over the lake are different from those calculated using models without advection. The magnitude of the discrepancy depends on the lake size; we refer to this as the “lake size effect”.\nIn Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, we observed significant horizontal gradients in concentration, δD, and δ18O of vapor up to 5 km along the wind direction. Over a 0.5 km long lake, the observed average gradients were 1380 ppm/km for vapor content, 21‰/km for δD, 2.4‰/km for δ18O, and 5‰/km for d-excess. These gradients decreased with distance from the upwind shore. Over a stretch of another, much larger lake 4-5 km from the upwind shore, we observed gradients of 354 ppm/km, 1.5‰/km, 0.22‰/km and 0.3‰/km, for vapor concentration, δD, δ18O, and d-excess, respectively. These observations were modeled successfully using a two-dimensional (2-D, horizontal and vertical) steady state advection diffusion model. This model also computes evaporative fluxes.\nUsing the model results, we assess the magnitude of the lake size effect and its impact on water balance calculations. Under the condition of our field observations and for lakes less than 500 m along the wind direction, the mean flux δ18O and δD were at least 2‰ lower than the corresponding values from a 1-D model (vertical only). If using biased isotopic flux values for water balance calculations, the lake size effect would lead to an underestimation of the lake I/E (input to evaporation) ratio. For example, if the lake effect is 1‰, the corresponding underestimation of the I/E ratio is about 10% if using δ18O, and less than 2% if using δD for the computation. This argues for advantageous use of δD over δ18O in water balance and paleoclimate studies when the lake size is small or changes significantly over time. Still greater accuracy in water balance assessment can be achieved by using the 2-D model to correct for the lake size effect under the environmental conditions at the location of interest.",

Do you have access to or the know-how to take advantage of advanced high performance computing (HPC) capability? Web based cyberinfrastructure takes work off your desk or laptop computer and onto infrastructure or \"cloud\" based data and processing servers. This talk will describe the HydroShare collaborative environment and web based services being developed to support the sharing and processing of hydrologic data and models. HydroShare supports the upload, storage, and sharing of a broad class of hydrologic data including time series, geographic features and raster datasets, multidimensional space-time data, and other structured collections of data. Web service tools and a Python client library provide researchers with access to HPC resources without requiring them to become HPC experts. This reduces the time and effort spent in finding and organizing the data required to prepare the inputs for hydrologic models and facilitates the management of online data and execution of models on HPC systems. This presentation will illustrate the use of web based data and computation services from both the browser and desktop client software. These web-based services implement the Terrain Analysis Using Digital Elevation Model (TauDEM) tools for watershed delineation, generation of hydrology-based terrain information, and preparation of hydrologic model inputs. They allow users to develop scripts on their desktop computer that call analytical functions that are executed completely in the cloud, on HPC resources using input datasets stored in the cloud, without installing specialized software, learning how to use HPC, or transferring large datasets back to the user's desktop. These cases serve as examples for how this approach can be extended to other models to enhance the use of web and data services in the geosciences.",

Differential body-wave relocation schemes offer limited improvements, particularly in the oceans where P waves are often poorly observed. Surface waves, with their slow horizontal propagation speeds and high signal strength even at teleseismic distances, contain information on earthquake location that can improve epicenter determinations. Earlier work by other authors has demonstrated the possibility of precise relative location by cross-correlation of Rayleigh waves for pairs of earthquakes with the same focal mechanism and depth, and Cleveland and Ammon (2013) have recently demonstrated success with this approach for multiple events with similar mechanisms and a double-difference relocation method. We extend earlier approaches to improve relative locations for earthquakes with arbitrary focal mechanisms. We correct inter-event cross-correlation functions of Love and Rayleigh surface-wave signals for differences in focal mechanisms and depths before calculating cross-correlation delay times and relative locations. Experiments on full synthetic seismograms indicate that the algorithm results in improved locations in the presence of realistic uncertainties in earthquake focal depths and mechanisms. We present results from the synthetic experiments and applications to real data, using earthquakes from the Global CMT catalog representing different tectonic environments.",

            "abstract": "The US West Coast coastal oceans feature energetic mesoscale eddies. The associated sea surface temperature (SST) and surface current modify the wind stress, leading to significant dynamic feedback on to the air-sea coupled system. Dynamics of the interaction and impacts on the regional coastal climate are however not well understood; this is an important research question for regional modeling studies for the coastal climate. A high-resolution (7km) SCOAR regional air-sea coupled climate model is used to investigate this question by implementing a novel model coupling technique that separates spatial scale of air-sea interaction. It allows the large-scale coupling effect to be preserved while suppressing the eddy-driven coupling via interactive spatial smoothing of SST and surface current. When the eddy-induced surface current is allowed to modify the wind stress, the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) is reduced by 42%, and this is primarily due to enhanced surface eddy drag. In contrast, the eddy-induced SST-wind coupling has little impact on the EKE. Eddies also modify the Ekman pumping; the resultant Ekman pumping velocity due to surface current attenuates the amplitude of eddies while the SST-induced Ekman pumping affects the propagation of eddies. Rectified change in time-mean SST is determined by the altered offshore temperature advection by the mean and eddy currents, but the magnitude of the mean SST change is greater with the eddy-induced current effect. The subsequent influence on the downstream winter rainfall variability on the US West Coast is stronger with the eddy-induced SST effect because of the proximity of SST anomalies to the coasts. The strong dynamical response in the coastal climate system to the eddy-driven air-sea interaction suggests that the fine-scale air-sea coupling should be better represented in the regional climate modeling studies for the coastal environments and the marine weather.",

            "abstract": "AirMOSS was selected by NASA in 2010 as one of the first 5 Earth-Venture-Suborbital missions, with the goal of reducing the uncertainty of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in north America through provision of high-resolution surface-to-depth profiles of soil moisture to land hydrology and ecosystem models. AirMOSS is accomplishing this goal by producing retrieved maps of so-called root zone soil moisture (RZSM) at approximately 100-m resolution for 9 biomes (10 sites) in north America, ranging from the boreal forests in Canada to the tropical rainforests in Costa Rica. RZSM has been hypothesized to account for 60% or more of the uncertainty in estimates of NEE. AirMOSS, currently in its final mission year, has acquired about 3 years of observations of RZSM at its study sites, with a total of 21 flight campaigns per year. Each flight campaign has included 2-3 flight dates. The RZSM maps have been retrieved from polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) instrument built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and flyign aboard a Gulfstream-3 airplane, operated by NASA Johnson Space Center. The estimation algorithms for deriving the RZSM maps have been matured throughout the mission, and have been shown to produce estimates of RZSM that are accurate to within 0.02-0.12 m3/m3 compared to in-situ validation data. The mission has also produced higher level RZSM products at hourly intervals, using land hydrology models, whose parameters are optimized using the AirMOSS snapshots. The ultimate product of the mission are the NEE estimates, generated not only for the mission study sites, but also upscaled to the entire scale of north America. These results are all under production, with the final mission products expected in May 2016. This presentation will give an overview of the mission, its products, and the main scientific findings. Several other papers in this session provide more details on each of the various aspects of the mission.",

Overall, we allow the joint inference of the state, equations, geometry, boundary conditions and initial conditions of dynamical models. Examples are provided for time-dependent fluid and ocean flows, including cavity, double-gyre and Strait flows with jets and eddies. The Bayesian model inference, based on limited observations, is illustrated first by the estimation of obstacle shapes and positions in fluid flows. Next, the Bayesian inference of biogeochemical reaction equations and of their states and parameters is presented, illustrating how PDE-based machine learning can rigorously guide the selection and discovery of complex ecosystem models. Finally, the inference of multiscale bottom gravity current dynamics is illustrated, motivated in part by classic overflows and dense water formation sites and their relevance to climate monitoring and dynamics.

            "abstract": "ePoster - Jaynes_Fall_AGU_2015_Source-seed_outlines.pdf\nStrong enhancements of outer Van Allen belt electrons have been shown to have a clear dependence on solar wind speed and on the duration of southward interplanetary magnetic field. However, individual case study analyses also have demonstrated that many geomagnetic storms produce little in the way of outer belt enhancements and, in fact, may produce substantial losses of relativistic electrons. In this study, focused upon a key period in August-September 2014, we use GOES geostationary orbit electron flux data and Van Allen Probes particle and fields data to study the process of radiation belt electron acceleration. One particular interval, 13-22 September, initiated by a short-lived geomagnetic storm and characterized by a long period of primarily northward IMF, showed strong depletion of relativistic electrons (including an unprecedented observation of long-lasting depletion at geostationary orbit) while an immediately preceding, and another immediately subsequent, storm showed strong radiation belt enhancement. We demonstrate with these data that two distinct electron populations resulting from magnetospheric substorm activity are crucial elements in the ultimate acceleration of highly relativistic electrons in the outer belt: the source population (tens of keV) that give rise to VLF wave growth; and the seed population (hundreds of keV) that are, in turn, accelerated through VLF wave interactions to much higher energies. ULF waves may also play a role by either inhibiting or enhancing this process through radial diffusion effects. If any components of the inner magnetospheric accelerator happen to be absent, the relativistic radiation belt enhancement fails to materialize. This comparative study of two distinct types of storms demonstrates the conditions under which a strong MeV outer radiation belt can be formed and maintained.",

The goal of OCO-2 is to use hyperspectral measurements of reflected near-infrared sunlight to retrieve carbon dioxide concentrations with high accuracy. This is currently only possible, however, for measurements of very clear scenes. To filter out scenes contaminated by clouds and aerosols, OCO-2 relies primarily on two fast cloud-screening algorithms, one using the O2-A band, and one using two near-infrared CO2 bands. In this study, we compare OCO-2 cloud-screening results to CALIPSO observations co-located in time and space. CALIPSO cloud and aerosol optical depths and their vertical profiles were used for validation. We find that for high optical depth CALIPSO measurements, the O2-A band cloud-screening algorithm correctly identifies most (~80%) scenes as cloudy. For low optical depth CALIPSO measurements, it correctly identifies most (~70%) scenes as clear. Additionally, we found that the O2-A band cloud-screening algorithm misidentifies up to ~80% of scenes containing low, thick clouds, while correctly identifying nearly all scenes containing high clouds. The majority of these unidentified low clouds, however, can be filtered out using information from the CO2 bands. These results confirm previous simulation-based work for the first time. Future studies include investigating the sensitivity of these results to cloud phase, the optical depth detection limits of OCO-2, and potential solar zenith angle biases.",

            "abstract": "For the future mitigation of tsunami hazard in coastal areas, assessments of ancient tsunami deposits are crucially important. In order to identify tsunami deposits, several indicators have been proposed to be useful including multiple proxies using sand units, grain size and/or microfossils such as diatoms. However, tsunamis do not always leave such visible evidence in their deposits. Therefore, to characterize the tsunami inundation area for the cases without such evidence, geochemical compositions have also been applied recently. In this study, C/N and isotopic (δ13C) analyses were used to determine sources of organic matter in 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami deposits collected from 19 coastal areas which range about 500km from north to south. We find that these parameters can be alternatively used to distinguish marine organic matter from freshwater and land plants; we confirm that a marine signature is found in most beach samples, while a signature of freshwater or land plant is recognized in soil samples obtained from unaffected inland areas. Marine signature is found in some of tsunami sand deposits close to the coastline, while the signature of freshwater or land plant is recognized in sand deposits far from the coastline. This finding suggests that marine-affected sediment was not transported to the proximity of the limit of the inundation. Marine signature is typically found in paddy field and marshy areas but not in forest or grassland, which would have supplied a large amount of land plant that affects the source of the organic matter in a tsunami deposit.",

Carbon sequestration capacity in China's forest ecosystems has been estimated using inventory and modeling methods in the past two decades. However, different methods result in varied magnitudes and large uncertainties exist especially in the soil carbon estimation. In this study, a model named China's forest carbon model (CFCM) has been developed based on over 7000 forest field plots data obtained during 2011-2014 to estimate China's forest ecosystem carbon sequestration capacity. The simulated forest biomass and soil carbon densities correspond well with field observations across China. Our calculation shown China's total forest biomass carbon sink decreased from 210 Tg C a-1 in 2002 to 175 Tg C a-1 in 2010, and total forest soil C sink fluctuated between -10-32Tg C a-1 during 2002-2010. Total forest soil C sink is closely correlated with interannual soil temperature change. Combine biomass and soil C sink, China's forest ecosystem C sink is in the range of 180-231 Tg C a-1, with the maximum value in 2005 and minimum in 2007 during 2001-2010.",

The lattice preferred orientation (LPO) of olivine and the slip systems of the dislocations in olivine are analyzed and compared to understand the relationship of the olivine fabrics and dislocation microstructures of olivine and their evolution during the orogenic event. To determine the LPO of olivine, an electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD) system was used. For the olivine crystals with the subgrain boundaries, EBSD mapping along the olivine subgrain boundaries were performed to determine the dominant slip system of dislocations in subgrain walls. In addition, the thickness-fringe method was applied to weak-beam dark-field (WBDF) images of TEM to identify the Burgers vector and the slip system of dislocations in olivine.\nThe Åheim chlorite dunites show porphyroclastic texture with subgrain boundaries. The sample with a large grain size showed A-type olivine LPO, which corresponds to the initial stage of deformation. On the other hand, the other sample with mostly recrystallized olivine grains showed the B-type of olivine LPO and it represents the secondary stage deformation in the water-rich condition during exhumation process. The EBSD mapping and TEM observation revealed that most olivine subgrain boundaries consist of the dislocations with (001)[100] slip systems. These subgrain boundaries might be resulted from the later stage deformation with a moderate water content in olivine or low strain deformation. TEM observation with the thickness-fringe method revealed that the free dislocations with (010)[100] slip system of olivine were dominant for both samples. Our data suggest that the subgrain boundaries and free dislocations in the olivines represent the later stage deformation associated with the exhumation process.",

We examined the phylogenetic distribution of leaf spectra across the American Oaks for 35 species under greenhouse conditions as well as genetic variation in leaf spectra across Central American populations of a single species grown in common gardens in Honduras. We found significant phylogenetic signal in the leaf spectra (Blomberg's K > 1.0), indicating similarity in spectra among close relatives. Across species, full range leaf spectra were used in a Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) that allowed species calibration (kappa statistic = 0.55). Validation of the model used to detect species (kappa statistic = 0.4) indicated reasonably good detection of individual species within the same the genus. Among four populations from Belize, Costa Rica, Honduras, and Mexico within a single species (Quercus oleoides), leaf spectra were also able to differentiate populations. Ordination of population-level data using dissimilarities of predicted foliar traits, including leaf mass per area (LMA), lignin content, fiber content, chlorophyll a+b, and C:N ratio in genotypes in either watered or unwatered conditions showed significant differentiation among populations and treatments. These results provide promise for remote detection and differentiation of plant functional traits among plant phylogenetic lineages and genotypes, even among closely related populations and species.",

The conduits responsible for the feeding of this intermediate/acid volcanism are preserved and well exposed in the São Marcos region (Lima et al. 2012; Geologia USP 12:49-64). Conduits are aligned along a NW-SE trend and have thicknesses up to 1 km. These structures are often characterized by mixing between dacitic and rhyodacitic magmas, with intercalation between two major zones: 1) reddish or grayish vitrophiricdacite/rhyodacite, sub-divided in massive or vesiculated; 2) reddish or grayish vitrophiric fragmented dacite/rhyodacite composed of bubble-rich angular to rounded blocks. Such fragments commonly deform coeval to the flow. A third zone dominated by filaments depicts a chaotic stretching-and-folding process from the mixture of the acid magmas. We used classical field measurements of flow structures and recognized main flow directions in these feeder-dikes. They follow two preferential directions: NW, ranging from N272° to N 355°, and NE, varying from N20° to N85°. These directions are indicative of a transtensive fissural system, which seems to be related to conjugated fractures.\nEvidence of an important fragmentation process in the conduits point towards the presence of related products in this region, thus rheomorphic deposits such as those observed elsewhere (e.g. Uruguay and Namibia) are expected to occur. Possible vestiges of these deposits could be represented by restricted outcrops of lens-shaped and banded hipohyaline, occasionally bubble-rich, dacites. The presence of continuous pseudotachylitic levels, tightly folded bands with horizontal axial planes together with local deformed bubble-rich pumice-like lens could be indicative of remelting and rheomorphism of previous vulcanoclastic material.\nCoulees and compound (lobed) dacitic lava flows, reaching up to 5-8 meters length, occur as the uppermost deposits and correspond to the effusive products that followed and predominate in this part of the province.\nFinancing: FAPESP",

More recent deployments have also included bio-optical and pH sensors. Gliders with oxygen sensors and bio-optics have been intermittently deployed near HOT Station ALOHA since 2008 and at BATS since 2014. While gliders maintain a restricted survey region near the time-series stations, profiling floats drifted widely across the subtropical gyres. Multiple floats and gliders enables a cotemporaneous comparison of biogeochemical processes across gyres. These platforms enable observations on spatial scales from submesoscale to basin scale and on temporal scales from diel to interannual. Here, I focus on the spatiotemporal variability of nitrate and oxygen mass balances in the North Pacific and North Atlantic subtropical gyres using a data-assimilating and float-tracking 1D upper ocean model.",

            "abstract": "As part of its ongoing policies to improve roadside air quality, in 2013 the Hong Kong government launched an incentive programme to replace catalytic converters and oxygen sensors in taxis and light buses mainly fueled by liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). The majority of replacements occurred from October 2013 to April 2014, with 75% of eligible vehicles participating in the programme, or 16,472 vehicles. Based on taxi exhaust measurements at a Hong Kong vehicle testing facility, the concentrations of n-butane, propane and i-butane (the primary components of LPG) decreased by 97% following the replacements. To determine the impact of the programme on roadside air quality, long-term measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were analyzed before, during and after the replacement programme, mainly at a busy roadside location in Mong Kok, Hong Kong. A clear decrease in the levels of major pollutants associated with LPG vehicle exhaust was observed at the roadside. For example, average (± 1 standard deviation) n-butane levels from October to April decreased from 13.0 ± 3.6 and 13.9 ± 2.6 ppbv in the two years preceding the programme, to 9.2 ± 2.9 ppbv during the programme, to 6.2 ± 1.7 ppbv the year after the programme. By contrast, compounds such as i-pentane that are not strongly associated with LPG or with LPG exhaust remained steady, averaging 0.90 ± 0.34, 1.01 ± 0.31, 0.93 ± 0.37, and 0.91 ± 0.42 ppbv from October to April of 2011/12, 2012/13, 2013/14 and 2014/15, respectively. Impacts of the programme on roadside levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ozone (O3) will also be discussed. Because many taxis are high mileage vehicles that travel several hundred kilometers daily, their catalytic converters need to be replaced approximately every 18 months. Therefore ongoing vehicle maintenance will be required in order to preserve the gains made from this initial subsidy programme.",

            "abstract": "The interaction between sand dune patterns and topographic obstacles is a primary signal of sand transport direction in the equatorial region of Saturn’s moon, Titan. The streamlined, tear drop appearance of the sand-dune patterns as they wrap around obstacles and a dune-free zone on the east side of many obstacles gives the impression that sand transport is from the west to east at equatorial latitudes. However, the physical mechanism behind the dune-obstacle interaction is not well explained, leaving a gap in our understanding of the equatorial sand transport and implied wind directions and magnitudes on Titan. In order to better understand this interaction and evaluate wind and sand transport direction, we use morphometric analysis of optical images on Earth and Cassini SAR images on Titan combined with analog wind tunnel experiments to study dune-topography interactions. Image analysis is performed in a GIS environment to map spatial variations in dune crestline orientations proximal to obstacles. We also use digital elevation models to and analyze the three-dimensional geometry – height, length, width and slope of the dune-topography relationships on Earth.\nPreliminary results show that dune patterns are deflected similarly around positive, neutral, or negative topography, where positive topography is greater than the surrounding dune height, neutral topography is at dune height and negative topography is lower than dune heights. In the latter case these are typically intra-dune field playas. The obstacle height, width, slope and wind variability appear to play a primary role in determining if a lee-dune, rather than a dune-free lee-zone, develops. In many cases a dune-free playa with evaporite and mud desiccation polygons forms lee-ward of the obstacle. To support and elaborate on the mapping and spatial characterization of dune-topography interactions, a series of experiments using a wind tunnel were conducted. Wind tunnel experiments examine the formation of linear, longitudinal ballistic ripples in the presence of obstacles of different shapes. We vary obstacle height, length, and width ratios to test how ripples will respond to topography. Initial experiments established a linear, longitudinal ripple pattern and well-simulated dune pattern-obstacle interactions.",

            "abstract": " Black carbon (BC) and mineral dust (MD), the most important composition of light absorbing particles (LAPs), significantly reduce the albedo of glaciers and thus accelerate their melting. In order to investigate the impacts of BC and MD on the glacier radiation balance and ablation, a total of 92 surface snow/ice samples were collected along different elevations from 4300 to 4950 m a.s.l. on Laohugou Glacier No.12 (LHG, 39°10′–35′ N, 96°10′–35′ E), located at Qilian Mts, northeastern margin of the Tibetan Plateau (TP), during summer of 2013 and 2014. A thermal-optical method was employed to detect the BC (EC-element carbon) concentrations in snow/ice samples. The results showed that BC and MD concentrations were much lower in snow than those in ice, and generally declined with the increasing elevation. The impacts of BC and MD on albedo reduction at different melting conditions were identified with the SNow ICe Aerosol Radiative (SNICAR) model initiated by in situ observation data. The sensitivity analysis showed that BC had a stronger effect on albedo reduction than MD in this work. The impact of BC represented less than 52 % of albedo reduction while the contribution of MD was 13 % when the glacier experienced strong surficial melting and its surface was almost superimposed ice. While BC and MD contributed 20 % and 12 %, respectively, when the surface was covered by snow during summer. On average, the radiative forcing (RF) caused by BC in the snow/ice, more than MD, was 43.0 ± 36.4 W m-2 in summer. Meanwhile, compared to glacier melting in summer of 2013 and 2014 calculated using the mass and energy balance model, i.e. 466 mm w.e. and 425 mm w.e., respectively, contribution of BC was less than 36 % of summer melting while MD and BC together contributed a maximum of 51 %. This study provided the baseline information on the concentrations and effects of BC and MD in glaciers of the northeastern boundary of the TP and their contributions in glacier melting.",

            "abstract": "Groundmass textures in juvenile mafic clasts from the 25.4 ka1 Oruanui supereruption (Taupo volcano, New Zealand, ~530 km3 magma2) show features indicative of rapid crystallisation due to chilling against the host rhyolite. There is marked textural diversity in these clasts, with contrasts between the two compositional groups (tholeiitic and calc-alkaline3) overshadowed by more significant variations within each group. The observation that textures vary more within than between the compositional groups suggests that bulk composition exerted only a second-order control on textural development, which was instead dominated by the cooling history of each clast. Clustering of groundmass mineral compositions in accordance with textural groupings implies a fundamental link between mineral compositions and textural development. This link is inferred to reflect a complex combination of factors including the degree of undercooling, water content, cooling rate, bulk composition and, possibly, intensive variables.\nMany macro-crystal compositions in the mafic clasts overlap with those of the corresponding crystals in the Oruanui high- and low-silica rhyolites4, indicating that they are ingested xenocrysts. However, residual glass compositions in the mafic clasts are distinct from those of Oruanui rhyolite glasses, and a mixing trend between them is not observed. The dominance of crystals derived from the low-silica rhyolite and a scarcity of ingested rhyolite melt suggests that interaction of the mafic and felsic magmas occurred predominantly within a transition zone between the crystal mush and the overlying crystal-poor high-silica rhyolite. It is envisaged that mafic dikes encountering a transition zone between the effectively rigid crystal mush and the melt-dominant body disaggregated into discrete blebs of various sizes that quenched against the rhyolite. Each bleb experienced its own unique cooling history, resulting in diversity in their groundmass textures and chemistries.\n1 Vandergoes MJ et al.

            "abstract": "The fluid dynamics of core merging after giant impacts in the late stages of accretion provides constraints on metal-silicate equilibration, core stratification, and early magnetic field generation. The energy released during giant impacts, such as those thought to have formed Earth's Moon and the crustal dichotomy on Mars, likely resulted in melting of the impactor and much or all of the protoplanet's mantle. Under these conditions, the liquid core of the impactor migrates through a fully-liquid magma ocean, and merges with the protoplanet's core.\nUnlike the laminar flow in numerical simulations, liquid impact experiments can produce turbulence, as expected during core formation. We present experiments on liquid blobs of variable density released into another liquid consisting of two immiscible layers, representing the magma ocean and protocore, respectively. The released liquid is denser than the upper layer, immiscible in the upper layer, and miscible in the lower layer. With a shallow upper layer, the relevant regime for giant impacts, a turbulent cloud of released and upper liquids penetrates into the lower layer, collapses and spreads along the interface between the upper and lower layers. This behavior contrasts with the laminar core merging observed in impact simulations or the classical iron rain scenario, and suggests that metal-silicate chemical equilibration extends inside the protocore. Experimental scalings for low-density releases predict that compositional stratification of the core is likely in the aftermath of planet formation, and the stratified layer detected by seismology at the top of Earth's core is compatible with a moon-forming impact. By implication, the early core dynamo had to overcome compositional stratification to initiate.",

We find that the lithosphere is thin (85-150 km) beneath the South China Fold system and thickens over the Yangtze Craton to maximum thicknesses of up to 280 km beneath the Sichuan Basin. In agreement with geochemical signatures from East China mantle xenoliths, our inversion predicts that the lithospheric mantle beneath the South China Fold system and Yangtze Craton is highly fertile (Mg# ~ 88-90). Such fertile compositions, together with the relatively thin lithospheric thickness in the area, point towards a widespread metasomatism/refertilization event. We suggest, as others have, that a flat-subduction episode and subsequent slab removal may have triggered both the delamination of the lowermost part of the subcontinental lithosphere and the generation of asthenospheric melts that metasomatized (refertilized) the remaining lithospheric mantle. Inconsistencies among geophysical observations and anomalously fertile compositions for the Sichuan Basin indicate that this region may be currently affected by small-scale convection or delamination processes. Alternatively, the anomalous observations may be associated with an eastward push of Tibetan lithosphere beneath the Yangtze Craton.",

We propose that effective climate change monitoring and education can be accomplished via student-led local and international community partnerships. By empowering students as community leaders in climate-environmental monitoring and education, as well as exploration of adaptation/mitigation needs, well-informed communities and young leadership are developed to support climate change science moving forward. Piloted 2013-2015, the SLICEIT1 program partnered with TAHMO2 to connect student leaders in North America, Europe and Africa. At the international level, schools in the U.S.A and Netherlands were partnered with schools in Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda for science and cultural exchange. Each school was equipped with a climate or other environmental sensing system, real-time data publication and curricula for both formal and informal science, technology, engineering and math education and skill development. African counterparts in TAHMO’s School-2-School program collect critically important data for enhanced on-the-ground monitoring of weather conditions in data-scarce regions of Africa. In Idaho, student designed, constructed and installed weather stations provide real time data for classroom and community use. Student-designed formal educational activities are disseminated to project partners, increasing hands-on technology education and peer-based learning. At the local level, schools are partnered with a local agency, research institute, nonprofit organization, industry and/or community partner that supplies a climate science expert mentor to SLICEIT program leaders and teachers. Mentor engagement is facilitated and secured by program components that directly benefit the mentor’s organization and local community via climate/environment monitoring, student workforce skill development, community education, and/or adaptation/mitigation activities. Students are motivated by advanced real-world skill development, leadership opportunity, internship, community service and opportunity for international peer communication.",

            "abstract": "Taking Xiamen city as the study area, this research retrieved surface net radiation using meteorological data and Landsat 5 TM images of the four seasons in the year 2009. Meanwhile the 65 different landscape metrics of each analysis unit were acquired using landscape analysis method. Then the most effective landscape metrics affecting surface net radiation were determined by correlation analysis, partial correlation analysis, stepwise regression method, etc. At both class and landscape levels, this paper comprehensively analyzed the temporal and spatial variations of the surface net radiation as well as the effects of land cover pattern on it in Xiamen from a multi-seasonal perspective. The results showed that: Xiamen’s surface net radiation is the maximum in summer, followed by spring, autumn. The surface net radiation in winter is the minimum. Net radiation flux is higher for water and forestland and is lower for built-up land and bare land, etc. The spatial composition of land cover pattern shows significant influence on surface net radiation. The proportion of bare land and the proportion of forest land are effective and important factors which affect the changes of surface net radiation all the year round. But the spatial allocation of land cover pattern has no significant influence on surface net radiation. Moreover, the proportion of forest land is more capable for explaining surface net radiation than the proportion of bare land. Its total annual explanatory ability is better than the latter. So the proportion of forest land is the most important and continuously effective factor which affects and explains the cross-seasonal differences of surface net radiation. This study is helpful in exploring the formation and evolution mechanism of urban heat island. It also gave theoretical hints and realistic guidance for urban planning and sustainable development.",

            "abstract": "The Salton Sea Geothermal field is located within the tectonic step-over between San Andreas Fault and Imperial Fault. Since the 1980s, geothermal energy exploration has resulted with step-like increase of microearthquake activities, which mirror the expansion of geothermal field. Distinguishing naturally occurred and induced seismicity, and their corresponding characteristics (e.g., energy release) is important for hazard assessment. Between 2008 and 2014, seismic data recorded by a local borehole array were provided public access from CalEnergy through SCEC data center; and the high quality local recording of over 7000 microearthquakes provides unique opportunity to sort out characteristics of induced versus natural activities.\nWe obtain high-resolution earthquake location using improved S-wave picks, waveform cross-correlation and a new 3D velocity model. We then develop method to identify spatial-temporally isolated earthquake clusters. These clusters are classified into aftershock-type, swarm-type, and mixed-type (aftershock-like, with low skew, low magnitude and shorter duration), based on the relative timing of largest earthquakes and moment-release. The mixed-type clusters are mostly located at 3 – 4 km depth near injection well; while aftershock-type clusters and swarm-type clusters also occur further from injection well. By counting number of aftershocks within 1day following mainshock in each cluster, we find that the mixed-type clusters have much higher aftershock productivity compared with other types and historic M4 earthquakes.\nWe analyze detailed spatial variation of ‘b-value’. We find that the mixed-type clusters are mostly located within high b-value patches, while large (M>3) earthquakes and other types of clusters are located within low b-value patches. We are currently processing P and S-wave spectra to analyze the spatial-temporal correlation of earthquake stress parameter and seismicity characteristics. Preliminary results suggest that the mixed-type clusters and high b-value patches are spatially correlated with low stress drop earthquakes, indicating high-productivity microearthquakes within low differential stress region, potentially due to deeper injection activities.",

Most of these available studies agreed that this huge deepest gorge on Earth is a stationary knickpoint. Although different hypotheses were proposed to explain its origin, little attempt focused on the critical condition to sustain its stability in a theoretical and quantitative way.\nHere we derived a universal formula to express the upstream migration velocity of knickpoints via stream incision model. This formula was suitable for many conditions, for example, it allowed spatially varied channel uplift rates , linear or non-linear correlation between erosion and channel gradient. According to the formula and two primary viewpoints, a stationary knickpoint occured where incision rates of gorge matched the upstream deposition rates (glacial dam) or the difference of basement uplift rates between the upstream and downstream reaches of the knickpoint (tectonic control).\nWe calculated the rock exhumation rates of the Yarlung Tsangpo Gorge via published thermochronological age and one-dimension steady-state thermal diffusion equation, the channel steepness from digital elevation model, and the erodibility by dividing exhumation rates by channel steepness. Combining these parameters, we obtained river incision rates of the gorge. We found the incision rates were much larger than the upstream deposition rates but showing good accordance with the difference of basement uplift rates between the upstream and downstream reaches of the knickpoint. Our results shown here supported the conclusion that the stationary knickpoint on the Yarlung Tsangpo Gorge was resulted from tectonic control rather than glacial dam. Therefore, we speculated that the Yarlung Tsangpo Gorge was controlled by tectonics more than climate. Our finding thus theoretically and quantitatively outlined how this stationary huge knickpoint was sustained along the Yarlung Tsangpo river, where tectonics and climate are interacted and modulate the landscape and dynamic evolution near eastern Himalayan.",

Some records suggest increased precipitation during the MCA, while the LIA has been identified as a period of aridity. Others records, however, show little evidence for coherent hydroclimate variability during these events. Refinement of current models of monsoonal dynamics during the MCA and LIA is needed in order to better constrain the relationship between temperature and hydroclimate variability, as well as to refine the global expression of the MCA and LIA. This need is underscored by recent changes in the ISM that may be related to anthropogenic warming trends. As part of this effort, we present new leaf wax hydrogen isotope from Badi Namco, a small alpine lake located in the monsoon dominated southern Tibetan Plateau. Combined with sedimentological and geochemical data, these new isotope results are used to evaluate the hypothesis that the MCA and LIA were minor hydroclimate events on the Tibetan plateau that were superimposed on lower frequency ISM variations forced largely by Indo-Pacific sea surface temperature changes during at least the last 3000 years.",

            "abstract": "The connections between vegetation and catchment hydrology are important for tree physiology, plant geography, stream flow, and transport of solutes within a watershed. While water isotopes from tree stems have been studied extensively to examine source-water differences at a small scale, there has been little emphasis on modeling of plant stem water isotopes at larger scales, due to the expensive and laborious extraction and analysis processes. We characterized the tree stem water for stable isotopes over a landscape (isoscape) at a first-order catchment in central Pennsylvania in order to address the following questions: 1) How does tree water isotopic composition relate to catchment topography and tree characteristics? 2) What are the underlying hydrologic processes that are revealed by tree water isotopes?\nWe used 267 observations of tree xylem water δ18O from 121 trees to build a statistical model with candidate variables related to topography and tree characteristics. We then applied the final model to predict the tree xylem water δ18O composition during the growing season of the remaining trees defined as > 18-cm diameter (at breast height; DBH) in the catchment. The final model included tree canopy height and slope magnitude as predictors, and explained about 56% of variance in tree water δ18O composition in the catchment. Tree canopy height and degree of slope were both negatively related to tree water δ18O suggesting the tallest trees and trees on the steepest slopes had tree water isotopic compositions most depleted in heavy isotopes. Each of these suggested the influence of cool-season isotopic inputs. On the valley floor, where tree canopy heights were tallest, the tree water δ18O composition was likely due to early growing season soil saturation from a shallow ground water table. Conversely, the steep hill slope δ18O composition may be a result of tree water use of tightly-bound soil water originating from cool season precipitation. The model highlighted the feedbacks between catchment topography and vegetation that may relate to contrasting hydrologic drivers. The independent variables included in the model were derived from widely available LiDAR data to support validation and applications to other ecosystems.",

Currently, one of the biggest problems related to combustion processes is connected to the combustion of fossil fuels, due to an increasingly growing of number of vehicles in big cities. The goal of this work is to evaluate the interaction between coastal areas and the Southeast continental shelf of Brazil focusing the exportation of combustion residues from land to ocean and its historical variability. Investigations on the exportation of contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and black carbon (BC) from the continent to the ocean; geochronology of the changes in the past through the different uses of combustions and accumulation of contaminants around Southeast of Brazil; advancement in the use of proxies of material transfer in a tropical coastal zone. Three sediment cores were collected, one in highly impacted Guanabara Bay (GB) and other two on the Southeast continental shelf (SB1 and SB2). The sedimentation rate (210Pb) for GB is 3.0 cm year-1 and for SB is 0.17 cm year-1 up to 5 cm and 0.4 cm year-1 up to 15 cm of the cores. Preliminaries results for GB are TOC (3.62±0.28%), BC (0.31±0.04%), TN (0.41±0.04%) and Total PAH (4,519±1,245 ng g-1). For SB1 are TOC (0.72±0.31%), CaCO3 (18.98±2.84%), TN (0.07±0.051%) and Total PAH (10.4±5.4 ng g-1). For SB2 are TOC (0.78±0.1%), CaCO3 (13.9±2.3%), TN (0.08±0.01%) and Total PAH (7.9±3.4 ng g-1). Further analysis such as aliphatic hydrocarbons to identify the source of the OM and 14C will be done to calculate the flux of the compounds through the years.",

Direct control over internal fluid distributions can be achieved by controlling contact angles that subsequently influence capillary pressures and drive motion of droplets across many millimeters. In this study, an Electro-Wetting on a Dielectric technique, EWOD, is used to: alter contact angles, merge and transport droplets on flat surfaces, and control the distribution of fluid phases.\nLiquid droplets were supported on flat glass substrates that had been evaporated with a 50 nm thick layer of silver (i.e., ground electrode) and then spin-coated with a ~5-10 µm thick layer of PDMS, a dielectric material. A platinum wire was inserted into 10 µL droplets of 1M KCl-H2O and connected to a 50 Hz AC voltage source. Measurements were made for a range of voltages (Vrms ~0-425V). CCD cameras were used to measure changes in areal extent, perimeter, and contact angles. For Vrms=0, the contact angle on PMDS was 118o. For the range of applied voltages, the contact angle of the droplets changed by over 60o. These experiments demonstrated that contact angle can be controlled over a wide range of values.\nUnsealed micro-models were used in experiments to merge and transport drops. In the merging experiments, three 50 nm thick electrodes were formed on the top plate separated by a gap of 0.69 mm, while the bottom plate contained a single large area silver electrode 50 nm thick. A 10 µL 1M KCl-H2O droplet was placed on the left electrode and another on the right electrode and merged when 424 V was applied to the middle electrode. The contact angle of the drops on the middle electrode decreased by 60 o relative to the portions of the drops on left and right electrodes. The resulting pressure difference translated and merged the two drops over a distance of ~1mm in ~13 seconds. These experiments demonstrate that EWOD techniques can be used to alter contact areas and interfacial area as well as merge and transport fluids without the need for an external pressure source. These results are of key importance to determine the effect of internal control of fluid saturations on externally measured pressures porous media.\nAcknowledgment: This research was supported by the National Science Foundation (1314663-EAR).",

Consequently there is a variety of opinions about paleogeographic locations of many Precambrian cratons and terranes and about their kinematics. Almost every new well-dated paleomagnetic pole, or re-dated old paleopole, or discovered LIP event causes significant reconsideration of existing paleogeographic models. Many new exiting results have been reported in last few years from Baltica, Siberia, North China, Australia, Congo-São Francisco and other parts of Nuna and Rodinia. Recent testings of some popular paleogeographic reconstructions (e.g. SAMBA) and re-interpretation of orogenic histories (e.g. Grenville and Sveconorwegian) also require some revisiting of Mesoproterozoic – Tonian paleogeography. This study summarises these new data and new ideas. Proposed updated positions of some continents are now better justified. Most changes are associated with North China and Congo-São Francisco cratons. Kinematics of the transitional period between the breakup of Nuna and the assembly of Rodinia is now better understood and better constrained, but some aspects are still enigmatic and controversial.",

Solar wind and micrometeoroids are likely the dominant agents of space weathering, but their relative contributions are not yet well understood. Based on Clementine reflectance mosaics and LOLA reflectance data, we report a systematic latitudinal variation in the near-infrared spectral properties of the lunar maria and show that the characteristics of this latitudinal trend match those observed at 'lunar swirls', where magnetic fields alter local solar wind flux without affecting the flux of micrometeoroids. We show that the observed latitudinal color variations are not artifacts of phase angle effects and cannot be accounted for by compositional variation alone. We propose that reduced solar wind flux, which should occur both at swirls and toward higher latitudes, is the common mechanism behind these color variations. This model helps us quantify the distinct effects of solar wind and micrometeoroid weathering and could aid in interpreting the spectra of airless bodies throughout the solar system.",

They are present in all seasons in many regions of the world, account for about 30% of the global cloud coverage, and are linked to cloud electrification and aircraft icing. The mix of ice particles, liquid droplets, and water vapor is unstable, and such clouds are thought to have a short lifetime. A characteristic parameter is the phase composition of mixed-phase clouds. It affects the cloud life cycle and the rate of precipitation. This parameter is important for cloud parameters retrievals by radar, lidar, and satellite and is relevant for climate modeling. The phase transformation includes the remarkable Wegener-Bergeron–Findeisen (WBF) process. The direction and the rate of the phase transformations depend on the local thermodynamic and microphysical properties. Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nuclei (IN) particles determine to a large extent cloud microstructure and the dynamic response of clouds to aerosols. The complexity of dynamics and microphysics involved in mixed-phase clouds requires a set of observational and modeling tools that continue to be refined. Among these techniques, the remote sensing methods provide an increasing number of parameters, covering large regions of the world. Thus, a series of studies were dedicated to stratiform mixed-phase clouds revealing longer lifetime than previously thought. Satellite data and aircraft in situ measurements in deep convective clouds suggest that highly supercooled water often occurs in vigorous continental convective storms. In this study, we use cases of convective clouds to discuss the feasibility of mixed-phase clouds characterization and potential advantages of remote sensing.",

            "abstract": " Neither surface-related multiple elimination(SRME) nor predictive de-convolution method is effective to suppress the multiple of marine seismic data from the shallow water area. The former method needs the accurate reflection of seafloor, which is mixed with the direct wave in the near offset range. The other one could probably lose the primary wave when applied to the shallow water seismic data. We introduced the new method: deterministic water-layer de-multiple method (DWD)，which is capable for the poor extrapolate result of near-offset traces. Firstly, the data shifts as downward continuation in tau-p domain with a water-layer period and the multiple model will be obtained. Then, the original seismic subtracts adaptively with the multiple model. Finally, we would get the de-multiple data after inverse tau-p transform. Marine seismic real data is from southern part of East China Sea Shelf Basin. This area has become the potential target for marine hydrocarbon exploration, it is located in the junction of the Eurasian plate，pacific plate and Indian plate. Because the average water depth is less than 100 meters, seismic data contains abundant of multiple, especially the surface-related multiple. As a result，it is difficult to distinguish the strata structure clearly. We used DWD approach to remove the water-layer multiple, cut off the seafloor reflection events and then suppressed the residual surface-related multiple by the traditional SRME. At last , the radon transform was applied to eliminate the multiple with long period . With these steps, we suppressed the multiple of marine seismic data from this area effectively. After multiple is removed , we acquired more accurate velocity to build the velocity model of migration. With the pre-stack migration technique, reflections from each geological period are shown clearly in the seismic section.\nThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China(grant no. 41476053).",

They provide necessary input data for sediment routing models, but the functions that describe storage are hard to define with field data. Using a meandering river model, a 36ka simulation is analyzed in 20 year time steps. Channel length, and eroded, deposited, and stored sediment volumes stabilize in under 2ka while the region explored by the river expands as time0.3. The simulated channel was 70m (3 pixels) wide and freely migrated within a 30 by 40km reach simulated with constant erodibility, and mean migration rate ±0.06 channel widths per year. No incision or aggradation was permitted. Sediment storage was partitioned by elevation. Point bar deposits are emplaced immediately as the channel moves away and comprise the lower 40% of a vertical section, while the upper 60% of the floodplain consists of vertically accreted ‘overbank’ deposits that accumulate with decreasing rates as elevation and distance from the channel increase. Point bar deposits have the highest probability of erosion at 80 years, and contribute 2/3 of eroded material despite representing only 40% of the floodplain volume. When eroded, vertical accretion deposits are 1.25 times older than point bar deposits. Apart from these differences, the storage distributions for both deposits are very similar, though there is much more scatter in the point bar distributions. Eroded sediment 2ka in age is well fit with a power law distribution. On average, 10% of eroded material is <80 years old, 30% from 80 – 500 years, 38% from 500 – 2000 years, 15% from 2ka to 10ka and 7% of eroded material is >10ka in age. However, the fraction older than 10ka is widely variable (0% to 30%, σ = 6.8%) in any 20 year interval. The patchiness and variability in the age of eroded sediment observed in these model results may be similar to natural settings and would be difficult to quantify or address with field measurements.",

This Late Precambrian orogenic belt stretches along the Yenisei River and is built of terranes of different nature (Vernikovsky et al., 2003). The largest structure of the Yenisei Ridge is the Central Angara terrane enclosing 886-857 Ma Yeruda granites. Origin and age of Yeruda granites along with paleogeographic position of the Central Angara terrane at the time of their formation were investigated using combined petrological, geochemical, geochronological and paleomagnetic approach. Yeruda granites were emplaced 886-857 Ma and are characterized by fractionated compositions, transitional between I- and S-types. The final stage of 859-857 Ma marks the formation of leucocratic granites, including high-K adakites or continental type (C-type), which could be formed during post-orogenic phase following extreme crustal thickening as described in (Xiao, Clemens, 2007). The calculated apparent movement of polar wonder (APWP) for Yeruda granites is significantly different from the trajectory of Siberia during Early Neoproterozoic, corresponding to paleolatitude difference of more than 8.6°. This clearly indicates that the Central Angara terrane was thousands of kilometers away from Siberia at the time of Yeruda granites emplacement.\n ",

            "abstract": "Tibetan plateau and eastern Asia subduction zone are tectonic active regions. Understanding the evolution and dynamics process of the two regions is important for us to understand mantle dynamics. A lot of work has been done on the velocity structures beneath the two regions, and several tectonic models are proposed to explain their dynamic process. But due to the absence of the detailed upper mantle anisotropy structures, those models are still under debate. Fine upper mantle velocity and anisotropy structures can help us understand the dynamic process of the two regions. Waveform modeling of upper mantle triplication phases can provide a good vertical resolution of upper mantle velocity structures, but present methods for calculating synthetic seismograms cannot process anisotropic media. We develop a method based on the generalized reflection and transmission method (GRTM) to calculate synthetic seismograms for wave propagating in stratified VTI media, so we can waveform model upper mantle triplications propagating in anisotropic media. In this study, we waveform model the tangential and radial seismic triplication data recorded in Chinese digital seismic stations at a epicentral distance of 10-30 degree for one event occurring in middle Tibet and one event occurring in Japan, to constrain fine upper mantle velocity and anisotropy structures beneath eastern Tibet and northeast Asia. The result shows that beneath eastern Tibet, horizontal S wave velocity is larger than vertical S wave velocity in the upper mantle; beneath northeast Asia, horizontal S wave velocity is larger than vertical S wave velocity above the depth of 190 km, and is smaller than vertical S wave velocity below the depth of 190 km. We also build a mineral physics modeling method, which can calculate upper mantle anisotropy structures based on mantle temperatures, compositions and directions of mantle flow, and use this method to explore compositional and dynamic models that would explain the inferred seismic structures. The results suggest that beneath eastern Tibet, the water content is lower than 0.4 wt%, and there is vertical mantle flow beneath the lithospheric lid; beneath northeast Asia, the upper mantle is dominated by horizontal mantle flow.",

In this study, a 30 m-high tower was erected for mounting flux instruments in the Changwu Tableland of the Loess Plateau. Two sets of eddy covariance system on the tower representing for ecosystems with different spatial scales, one is the cropland ecosystem (2m height, the underlying is winter wheat mono-cropping cropland) and the other is agro-fruit ecosystem (30m height, including both cropland and apple orchard). Seasonal and interannual variations in evapotranspiration (ET), net ecosystem exchange (NEE) and ecosystem water use efficiency (WUE) for the two ecosystems were continuously measured from September 2004 to June 2010. Mean while, the relationship between actual ET and potential evapotranspiration (ET0) was discussed. The results showed that, 1) Seasonally, ET of the cropland ecosystem was bimodal, peaked in May (Jointing and heading stage of winter wheat) and August (summer fallow period), respectively. The trend of NEE was consistent with the growth period of winter wheat, and the minimum occurred between April and May, the maximum WUE value also appeared that time. Seasonal ET of the agro-fruit ecosystem showed unimodal trend, which peaked in July. The lowest NEE occurred in July. The seasonal variation of WUE was smaller than that of the cropland ecosystem, and it got the highest in May. 2) Both of the annual ET in the cropland and the agro-fruit ecosystem fluctuated in these years, and the annual average ET were 437.12 and 417.41 mm, respectively. Because of the underestimated of latent heat flux caused by the energy imclosure, the observed ET was less than the results of the water balance calculation. The trend in NEE was similar, and the annual average NEE were -325.88 and -440.74 gC/m2/y, respectively. The annual average WUE of both ecosystems were 0.74 and 1.06 gC/Kg H2O respectively. 3) On a daily scale, the seasonal trend of ET in the agro-fruit ecosystem was in accordance with ET0, with a proportional relationship. However, on the annual scale, the trend of actual ET and ET0 showed complementary relationship, to some extend.",

            "abstract": "Wetlands comprise 14% of the Amazon basin, and are a major component of the hydrological and biogeochemical cycles. Most of these areas correspond to floodplain ecosystems along the Amazon River and its major tributaries, hosting unique vegetation types that are strongly controlled by annual hydrological fluctuations. The combination of strong environmental filtering and active fluvial dynamics results in a highly heterogeneous landscape, and in physiological linkages between climate variability and ecosystem processes. We will show several years of results obtained within the framework of the LBA program, discussing the interplay between hydroclimatic variability, landscape dynamics, ecosystem functioning and carbon biogeochemistry in the Amazon floodplains. Using optical and microwave remote sensing, we assessed the distribution of major vegetation types and flooding regimes at several locations across the floodplain. Strong variability in vegetation distribution can be observed, with high and low várzea forests ranging from 30% and 34%, respectively, at the upper Solimões River, to 6% and 25% at the lower Solimões, while non-forested habitats and lakes increase from a percent cover of 8% and 10% to 28% and 27%, respectively. Strong variability in local flood regimes was also determined for each vegetation type, revealing a gradient of habitats within each floodplain. As tree growth, diversity and phenology are affected by flood duration, we expect local conditions to strongly impact carbon stocks and cycling at the landscape scale. Fluvial processes also disturb forest patches, ensuring a mixture of age distributions in the landscape, with varying species composition, carbon stocks, and carbon uptake rates. Herbaceous vegetation growth responds very rapidly to changes in hydrological conditions, and modeling based on microwave imagery and in situ observations showed expected changes of up to 50% in annual net primary production between regular and extreme hydrological years. Overall, our results suggest that the combined effect of projected climatic changes and increasing anthropogenic pressures could lead to significant changes in ecosystem dynamics in the floodplain, and landscape heterogeneity needs to be fully accounted for to better forecast impacts on ecosystem processes in the region.",

However, the joint occurrence of two or more concurrent extremes has the potential to negatively impact these areas of life in ways far greater than any single event could. California, USA, home to nearly 40 million people and the largest agricultural producer in the United States, is currently experiencing an extreme drought, which has persisted for several years. While drought is commonly thought of in terms of only precipitation deficits, above average temperatures co-occurring with precipitation deficits greatly exacerbate drought conditions. The 2014 calendar year in California was characterized both by extremely low precipitation and extremely high temperatures, which has significantly deepened the already extreme drought conditions leading to severe water shortages and wildfires. While many studies have shown the statistics of 2014 temperature and precipitation anomalies as outliers, none have demonstrated a connection with large-scale, long-term climate trends, which would provide useful relationships for predicting the future trajectory of California climate and water resources. We focus on understanding non-stationarity in the joint distribution of California temperature and precipitation anomalies in terms of large-scale, low-frequency trends in climate such as global mean temperature rise and oscillatory indices such as ENSO and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation among others. We consider temperature and precipitation data from the seven distinct climate divisions in California and employ a novel, high-fidelity kernel density estimation method to directly infer the multivariate distribution of temperature and precipitation anomalies conditioned on the large-scale state of the climate. We show that the joint distributions and associated statistics of temperature and precipitation are non-stationary and vary regionally in California. Further, we show that recurrence intervals of extreme concurrent events vary as a function of time and of teleconnections. This research has implications for predicting and forecasting future temperature and precipitation anomalies, which is critically important for city, water, and agricultural planning in California.",

            "abstract": "Soil moisture (SM) is a critical factor governing the water and energy fluxes at the land surface that are important for near-term climate forecasting, drought monitoring, crop yield estimation, and better water resources management. Remotely sensed observations at microwave frequencies are the most sensitive to changes of water in the soil. Particularly, frequencies at L-band (1-2 GHz) have been widely used for SM studies under the vegetated land covers because of their minimal atmospheric interference and attenuation by vegetation, allowing observations from the soil surface. In addition to current satellite based microwave sensors, such as the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions, the Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry technique is capable of observing the GNSS signal reflected from the terrain that contains combined information of soil and vegetation characteristics. The technique has recently attracted attention for global SM monitoring because its receiver is small in size and light weight and can be on board the low orbit, small satellites with low power consumption and low cost. Therefore the GNSS-R remote sensing may lead to affordable multi-satellite constellations that enable improved temporal resolution for highly dynamic hydrologic conditions. The current UK Technology Demonstration Satellite (TDS-1) has been providing global GNSS-R observations since September 2014 for experimental purposes and the receiver is accessed and operated for 2 days during every 8-day cycle. In the near future, the NASA Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) mission, scheduled to be launched in 2016, will consist of 8 satellites observing GPS L1 signal at a frequency of 1.5754 GHz with a spatial resolution of 10-25 km and a temporal resolution of < 12 hours.\nThe goal of this study is to understand the impacts of SM and characteristics of agricultural vegetation on the forward scattering mechanisms of satellite-based GNSS-R observations. The GNSS-R observations from TDS-1 will be used to investigate the correlation of the GNSS-R signals to SMAP, ALOS-2 PALSAR-2, vegetation indices from MODIS, and the in-situ SM observations in an agricultural region in the Midwestern US. This study will provide insights into SM estimation in the agricultural region using satellite-based GNSS-R observations.",

Two types of typical weather conditions associated with poor air quality over PRD. The first is the warm period before a cold front (WPBCF) and the second is the subsidence period controlled by a tropical cyclone (SPCTC). In both cases, quiet small wind and stabilize weather，obvious wind shear and multi-layer inversion appear. There will be a phenomenon \"the gray in near ground layer, but blue sky in upper layer\" some time, the reason is that the Mountain of Nanling and the heat island effect of urban area of PRD has weakened effect to the low-level cold air，the upper-level cold air has reached, but the low-level cold air has not reach or is not strength enough to remove pollutants. Within the boundary layer, especially near ground， small wind speed, ground inversion or multi-layer inversion, stable stratification, lower mixing layer height, insufficient horizontal transportation and vertical diffusion ability, combination with the negative impact of sea-land breeze，urban heat island circulation, would be the main reasons of the most time poor air quality of PRD.",

Observations were taken by the LORRI clear filter narrow angle camera [1] during the NH Pluto close flyby on 14 July 2014. Both high phase angle (forward scattering) look back and low phase angle (back scattering) sunlit hemisphere observations were obtained. The haze is clearly detected in the forward scattered images, but systematics due to scattered light contributions from Pluto’s surface must be accounted for in order to accurately determine any azimuthal or latitudinal dependence. The haze extends at least 150 km above the surface of Pluto, and could contain layer structures as well. In the backscattered images, the haze is dominated by backscattered light from Pluto’s surface in the lossy images currently on the ground. In this paper we report on the latest LORRI haze spatial distribution analysis results and their implications.\n1Cheng, A.F. et al. 2008, Space Science Reviews, Volume 140, Issue 1-4, pp. 189-215\nFigure 1: LORRI lookback image of Pluto taken on 16 Jul 2015 03:40 UT.

            "abstract": "The increasing occurrence of extreme precipitation events as well as severe droughts, coupled with greater and greater human occupation of flood plains, makes increased monitoring of flows in rivers an important component of assessing the potential for water-related natural disasters as well as responding to them when they do occur. Unfortunately, this increasing need comes at a time when funding for monitoring activities is generally decreasing. In the United States, for example, gauging stations with daily flow records going back several decades or even a hundred years have been abandoned, and new stations in critical areas have not even been established. A methodology based on periodic UAV-based imaging of an entire river offers the prospect of obtaining inexpensive, real-time, high-resolution data for the determination of the river flows. The method makes use of fact that as the flow in a river rises or falls, the areal extent covered by the river changes accordingly. Furthermore, barring anthropogenic changes, the area inundated by a flow of a particular magnitude is invariant in time. For a given stretch of a river, a sequence of images spanning the full range of flow conditions provides the basic template for determining river flows. The actual flow in the river can be calibrated using previously measured flow data corresponding the dates of old aerial or satellite imagery, or calculated from new imagery by using standard flow equations and the topography of the banks of the river, determined by field surveying or Lidar. Once the basic template has been established, determination of “the state-of-the-river” at any point in time can be obtained by comparing newly-acquired UAV images with those in the database. And because a given image encompasses many topographic features that are inundated to differing extents, the resolution of the flow determination is limited only by the completeness of the imagery in the basic template. Repeat flights at weekly intervals can be used to monitor the river under normal flow conditions while daily or even hourly flights can be used to track the rise and fall of a particular flood event.",

            "abstract": "We measured the major ions, stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopes, 3H-3He and CFCs concentration in groundwater to identify the characteristics of nitrate contamination and to understand the groundwater recharge patterns. In this study, 17 groundwater samples were collected for 5days (from March 3rd to 7th, 2015) in Eumseong, Korea. In the study area, NO3- concentrations in some groundwater samples (16 of 17) ranged from 5.7 to 103.7 mg/L (avg. 43.3 mg/L), which were substantially higher than the drinking water quality standard (10 mg/L). These excess NO3- inputs in groundwater seem to be originated from the agricultural use of chemical fertilizers because major ions associated with fertilizers were significantly correlated with NO3-. It seems that major groundwater recharge event during monsoon season is highly probable from the analysis of δ18O and δD. The apparent groundwater age using 3H-3He and CFCs varies from 5 to 40 yrs although the study area is small (1 km2). For the samples showed large deficiency of 3He, the sensitivity analysis was performed using NOBLE 90 in an effort to quantify the degassed amount. Since nitrate sources are quite evenly distributed through the field site, groundwater ages from shallow aquifer is inversely correlated with the nitrate concentrations. Our result implies that the 3H-3He ratio can be a useful indicator of tracing the recharge pattern of groundwater but also the nitrate loading characteristic in a small scale agricultural area.\nAcknowlegments: Financial support was provided by the \"R&D Project on Environmental Management of Geologic CO2 Storage\" from the KEITI (Project Number: 2014001810003) and the research project of \"Advanced Technology for Groundwater Development and Application in Riversides (Geowater+)\" in \"Water Resources Management Program (code 11 Technology Innovation C05)\" of the MOLIT and the KAIA in Korea.",

This presentation describes the development and validation of the SMAP radiometer-only soil moisture product (L2_SM_P). The SMAP L2_SM_P product uses the Level 1 brightness temperature observations on an Earth-fixed grid at a 36 km resolution. A variety of static ancillary data (e.g. water fraction, soil texture, land cover classification, vegetation index climatology) and dynamic ancillary data (e.g. near real-time soil temperature, freeze/thaw state, rainfall intensity) are also ingested in the retrieval process.\nSeveral algorithms are being considered for the SMAP radiometer-only soil moisture retrieval: (a) Single Channel Algorithm (SCAH): based on a zero-order approximation to the radiative transfer equation and uses the H-polarization observations to estimate soil moisture. Brightness temperature is corrected for the effects of temperature, vegetation, and roughness (static ancillary data sets). (b) Single Channel Algorithm (SCAV): based on the radiative transfer equation and uses the V-polarization observations to estimate soil moisture. (c) Dual Channel Algorithm: uses the horizontal and vertical polarization observations to iteratively solve for soil moisture and vegetation opacity. (d) Microwave Polarization Ratio Algorithm (MPRA): an alternative two-parameter retrieval model (soil moisture and vegetation opacity) that uses the microwave polarization difference index at 1.4 GHz and emissivity to parameterize vegetation opacity and estimate soil moisture.\nThe accuracy of the preliminary product will be evaluated using in situ data, sparse networks, and other satellite data products. Initial results indicate that the SMAP L2_SM_P algorithms are making progress towards meeting the target accuracy requirement. This paper will focus on the implementation of the different SMAP L2_SM_P algorithms using the current version (beta release) of the SMAP radiometer data. Further analysis of these algorithms is ongoing. This work will help in the selection and development of the operational algorithm for the validated SMAP passive soil moisture product.",

            "abstract": "Salmonids are threatened with extinction across the world from the fragmentation of riverine ecosystems from dams and diversions. In California, efforts to expand the range of spawnable habitat for native salmon by transporting fish around reservoirs is a potentially species saving idea. But, strong scientific evidence of the amount of high quality habitat is required to make these difficult management decisions. Remote sensing has long been used in fluvial settings to identify physical parameters that drive the quality of aquatic habitat; however, the true strength of remote sensing to cover large spatial extents has not been applied with the resolution that is relevant to salmonids. This project utilizes hyperspectral data of over 250 km of the Tuolumne and Merced Rivers to extract depth and bed slope from the wetted channel and NIR LiDAR for the surrounding topography. The Optimal Band Ratio Analysis (OBRA) has proven as an effective tool to create bathymetric maps of river channels in ideal settings with clear water, high amounts of bottom reflectance, and less than 3 meters deep over short distances. Results from this study show that OBRA can be applied over larger riverscapes at high resolutions (0.5 m). The depth and bed slope estimations are used to classify habitat units that are crucial to quantifying the quality and amount of habitat in these river that once produced large populations of native salmonids. As more managers look to expand habitat for these threatened species the tools developed here will be cost effective over the large extents that salmon migrate to spawn.",

            "abstract": "Deformed sedimentary rocks of the western Hoh Xil Basin lie within the northern Tibetan Plateau at elevations of ~5000 m. Attainment of high elevations in this region by middle Miocene lithospheric removal has been linked to the termination of shortening and initiation of volcanism and hypothesized to explain observations of low topographic relief and high surface heat flows. We provide new constraints on the timing of crustal shortening and duration of volcanism in the western Hoh Xil Basin from detrital zircon U-Pb minimum depositional age (MDA) analysis of a deformed red bed sequence and 40Ar/39Ar dates of undeformed lava flows that cap the red beds. Our work limits the timing of deformation on the >280 km-long, south-directed Dogai Coring thrust fault. At the western mapped end of the Dogai Coring Fault, 28 Ma lava flows overlie tilted red beds near an associated back thrust. Satellite imagery demonstrates that these lava flows form an extensive mesa that can be little deformed since eruption. Along fault strike, 180 km to the east, tilted red beds contain detrital zircons with U-Pb dates as young as 30 Ma, suggesting that they are no older than Oligocene. Undeformed lava flows in this area are dated from 9 to 7.5 Ma and overlie both deformed red beds and the Dogai Coring fault. These age constraints suggest that the fault was active by at least 30 Ma and terminated by 28 Ma, while volcanism was been persistent in this region since 28 Ma. The onset of volcanism at 28 Ma is coeval with the oldest known undeformed volcanic sequences from the eastern Hoh Xil Basin, which limit deformation there to older than 27 Ma. This temporal correspondence suggests that an Oligocene cessation of faulting was largely synchronous across at least 500 km of the Hoh Xil basin. The termination of shortening and initiation of volcanism is thus more compatible with regional lithospheric removal in Oligocene time, rather than in middle Miocene time, as has been previously proposed.",

            "abstract": "A solar eruption is a tremendous explosion on the Sun that happens when energy stored in \ntwisted (or distorted) magnetic fields is suddenly released. When this field is viewed along \nthe axis of the twist in projection at the limb, e.g. in EUV or white-light coronal images, the \nouter portions of the pre-eruption magnetic structure sometimes appears as a region of \nweaker emission, called a “coronal cavity,” surrounded by a brighter envelope. Often a \nchromospheric filament resides near the base of the cavity and parallel to the cavity’s central \naxis. Typically, both the cavity and filament move outward from the Sun at the start of an \neruption of the magnetic field in which the cavity and filament reside. Studying properties \nthe cavities and filaments just prior to and during eruption can help constrain models that \nattempt to explain why and how the eruptions occur. In this study, we examined six different \nat-limb solar eruptions using images from the Extreme Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (EIT) \naboard the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). For four of these eruptions we \nobserved both cavities and filaments, while for the remaining two eruptions, one had only \na cavity and the other only a filament visible in EIT images. All six eruptions were in \ncomparatively-quiet solar regions, with one in the neighborhood of the polar crown. We measured \nthe height and velocities of the cavities and filaments just prior to and during the start of their \nfast-eruption onsets. Our results support that the filament and cavity are integral parts of a single \nlarge-scale erupting magnetic-field system.

Meanwhile, significant variation exists in the geographical distribution of human utilization of the biosphere. Land use intensity is a useful indicator to quantify and localize the impact of human activities on natural ecosystem. However, current land use studies in China mainly focused on land use / land cover change and its impacts on ecosystem process with little consideration of spatial explicit representation of land use intensity. In this study, the land use intensity classification system in China was firstly proposed according to the different impacts of human activities on natural ecosystem, based on the land use datasets from Chinese Academy of Sciences and freely available indicators reflecting human activities. Using decision tree method, we mapped the land use intensity in China in 2000 and analyzed its spatial patterns. The results from this study showed that remarkable variation and provincial pattern existed in the spatial distribution of land use intensity in China, which is important to understand the interactions between human activities and natural ecosystem.",

            "abstract": "Quantitative research on landscape evolution has focused on tectonically active landscapes, leaving the pace and primary drivers of topographic change in tectonically quiescent environments, which make up the majority of Earth’s surface, poorly understood. We use topographic analysis and a characteristic metric of river basin geometry, χ, to test the hypothesis that river basin dynamics, including divide migration and stream capture, can cause transient pulses of incision and large gradients in erosion rate, which in turn influence the morphology of cratonic landscapes. In testing this hypothesis, we describe and interpret the disequilibrium observed in river networks draining a typical low-elevation cratonic landscape, the Ozark dome, USA and propose alternative mechanisms to climate and tectonics that generate and sustain large-scale landscape disequilibrium. The Ozark dome was uplifted in the fore-bulge of the Ouachita orogeny and lies south of the extent of glaciation and primarily north of eustatic sea-level changes. The Ozarks have not experienced significant tectonic activity since the late Paleozoic. Landscape response times predicted by stream-power river incision models would suggest that landscapes subjected to consistent, low rates of isostatic uplift should be close to steady state. Yet, rivers draining the Ozark dome appear to be in disequilibrium. Anomalous stream network topology, variable relief across the dome, cross-divide topographic asymmetry that corresponds with large cross-divide gradients in χ, and the prevalence of multiple flights of strath terraces suggest transient and non-uniform bedrock incision rates. Our results suggest that erosional competition between river basins drive much of the observed topographic asymmetry and the in-situ formation of high-elevation, low-relief surfaces on the Ozark dome. This implies that basin dynamics, rather than tectonics, lithology, or climate, may set the large-scale morphology of some cratonic landscapes.",

The purpose of this work is to obtain an improved estimation of hydrological states for watershed hydrological process prediction and water resource management by integrating multisource datum, hydrological model and data assimilation technology. SWATGPDAS is a software that integrates the use of remote sensing, such as MODIS LAI, Snow cover Fraction, Snow water equivalent, soil moisture and ground based observational data (e.g., watershed discharge, ground sensor networks), along with advanced hydrological model SWATGP and parallel data assimilation framework (PDAF) to accurately characterize watershed hydrological states and fluxes. SWATGPDAS employs high performance computing technologies to deal with the computational challenges of high resolution and/or large area hydrological modeling. Observational System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) are designed to analysis and discuss the ability of hydrological simulation in SWATGPDAS. Both the temporal and spatial correspondences in trend/pattern and magnitudes between simulated and “true” states (soil moisture, snow water equivalent and discharge) were satisfactory with assimilation integration, suggesting the reliability of using SWATGPDAS for regional water balance studies.",

            "abstract": "Bedrock knickpoints (waterfalls) often act as erosional front in bedrock rivers, whose geomorphological processes are various. In waterfalls with vertical cliffs, both fluvial erosion and mass movement are feasible to form the landscape. Although morphological changes of such steep cliffs are sometimes visually observed, quantitative and precise measurements of their spatiotemporal distribution have been limited due to poor accessibility to such cliffs. For the clarification of geomorphological processes in such cliffs, multi-temporal mapping of the cliff face at a high resolution can be advantaged by short-range remote sensing approaches. Here we carry out multi-temporal terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), as well as structure-from-motion multi-view stereo (SfM-MVS) photogrammetry based on unmanned aerial system (UAS) for accurate topographic mapping of cliffs around a waterfall. The study site is Kegon Falls in central Japan, having a vertical drop of surface water from top of its overhanging cliff and groundwater outflows from its lower portions. The bedrock consists of alternate layers of jointed andesite lava and conglomerates. The latest major rockfall in 1986 caused approximately 8-m recession of the waterfall lip. Three-dimensional changes of the rock surface were detected by multi-temporal measurements by TLS over years, showing the portions of small rockfalls and surface lowering in the bedrock. Erosion was frequently observed in relatively weak the conglomerates layer, whereas small rockfalls were often found in the andesite layers. Wider areas of the waterfall and cliff were also measured by UAS-based SfM-MVS photogrammetry, improving the mapping quality of the cliff morphology. Point clouds are also projected on a vertical plane to generate a digital elevation model (DEM), and cross-sectional profiles extracted from the DEM indicate the presence of a distinct, 5–10-m deep depression in the cliff face. This appears to have been formed by freeze–thaw and/or wet–dry weathering following the recession in 1986. The long-term development of the waterfall cliff face is then discussed comprising various processes of rockfalls, water pressure and weathering.",

In this study, we present ARTEMIS observations of the mid-tail magnetosphere (X ~ –60 RE) during a prolonged northward IMF period (> 48 hr, starting from ~22 UT on Feb 12 2014). The two ARTEMIS probes (separated by ~3 RE) were on the duskside plasma sheet (|B| < ~6 nT for most of the time) moving from Y ~22 to 2 RE. ARTEMIS observed the low latitude boundary layer (LLBL) extending from the flank inward to Y ~5 RE with hot (a few keV) plasma sheet ions mixed with cold (several hundreds of eV) tailward-moving plasma. The appearance of the cold plasma is more quasi-periodic (a few minutes) near the flank, suggesting a likely association between the LLBL formation and Kelvin-Helmholtz/surface waves. The magnetic field strength fluctuates substantially and can go down to as small as < 1 nT, suggesting fluctuations in the current sheet thickness that might result from current sheet flapping motion. To evaluate these likely physical processes, we are currently determining the temporal changes of the plasma and magnetic field spatial structures using the two probe measurements and comparing these observations with results from different global MHD simulation runs conducted at NASA Community Coordinated Modeling Center, including LFM, Open GGCM, and BATS-R-US.",

            "abstract": "Slow slip events (SSEs) occur in various tectonic settings but are the most abundant around the depth of upper-plate Moho in warm-slab subduction zones such as Cascadia and Nankai, accompanied with non-valcanic tremor. The paucity or absence of these near-Moho SSEs in many other subduction zones and the relationship of these SSEs with the megathrust seismogenic zone are intriguing questions of fundamental importance. We address these questions by examining Frictional-Viscous Transitions (FVTs) along subduction faults. Our key hypothesis is that there is a sharp decrease in the frictional stength of subduction faults across its intersection with the continental Moho for two reasons: (1) Enrichment of weak hydrous minerals such as talc due to the hydration of the base of the mantle wedge, and (2) elevated pore fluid pressure in the fault zone because of serpentine (antigorite) saturation of the mantle wedge corner which retards further fluid consumption and decreases permeability. Through thermal modelling using heat flow data as constraints, we found that for Cascadia, Nankai, and Hikurangi, there are two FVTs, with the first one being shallower than the Moho. At the Moho, the fault returns to the friction mode, but with slip behaviour affected by the presence of hydrous minerals and high fluid pressure. We propose this is where near-Moho SSEs occur. Farther downdip, the second FVT occurs and serves to limit the depth extent of the SSEs. Coseismic slip is limited to be shallower than the first FVT, such that frictional slip around the Moho occurs interseismically as SSEs. This mechanism also explains the occurrence of tremor, believed to represent very small SSEs, along the San Andreas fault around the Moho depth. In a way, this mechanism is akin to the “jelly-sandwich” rheology model of the continental lithosphere, but the onset of the lower slice of bread is due to a decrease in frictional strength as opposed to an increase in viscous strength. For the other subduction zones that we modeled, the shallower FVT is absent, such that frictional behaviour extends to deeper than the Moho. In these places, the motion of what would be the SSEs zone at Cascadia and Nakai is more readily accommodated by seismic slip in earthquakes or aseismic slip before and after large earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_poster_noguchi_reduced.pdf\nRootless cones (RC) have not been paid much attention so far because of their limited locations and their small size. They are formed by repeated phreatovolcanic explosions by lava-waterlogged sediments interactions. While the distribution is limited on the Earth, they have been pervasively recognized on Mars (e.g., Greeley and Fagents, 2001) and considered as a key marker in identifying lava flow. Although in-depth morphological comparisons are necessary, the terrestrial standard is not sufficient. Recent studies have clarified detailed characteristics of the distribution in the context of lava flow dynamics in Laki, Iceland (Hamilton et al., 2010a,b). However, we are still lacking of sufficient data of the morphology. To construct the terrestrial reference, we performed survey in Myvatn, Iceland.\nAbout 2300 years ago, lava flowed into old-Lake Myvatn, then formed RCs (Thorarinsson, 1953). There exists 3 morphological types; Single Cone (SC), a conical edifice with a summit crater, Double Cone (DC), composed of an inner cone with a summit crater within the summit crater of an outer cone, and multiple cone, similar to DC but with several inner cones. Through aerial photo survey, 1154 RCs (1056 are SC, 78 are DC and 20 are multiple one) are identified in this area. To know high-resolution topography of them, we apply kinematic GPS. Constituent materials of RCs are analyzed focusing on their bulk density, vesicularity, and grain size distribution.\nGeomorphological features of RCs are strongly correlated with its location and constituent materials. The crater diameter/bottom diameter ratio of cone, which is considered as an indicator of the explosivity, is larger around the lake and smaller far way from the lava source. This suggests an importance of available thermal energy as well as the water supply. The edifice morphology is grouped into 5 types; I: constant slopes that reach the repose angle; II: constant slopes lower than the repose angle; III: variable slopes with a step; IV: variable slopes that get steeper with higher altitude; and V: variable and small slope angles. We found these types correspond to their constituent materials and volumes. In this presentation, we show the relationship between RC morphology and other parameters, which can be useful as well as the planetary volcanology.",

            "abstract": "Two cycles of postglacial transgressions of Baltic Sea could be recognized in the sediments of Lake Ladoga and vicinity: an Eemian (MIS 5e, ca 124-119 kya) and a Holocene with several subsequent stages: Ancylus Lake, Mastogloia Sea and Littorina Sea, starting at ca 9.5 kya BP and existing up to 4 kya BP. New data obtained from deep coring in Lake Ladoga (Andreev et al., 2014) has allowed us to re-visit an old question about the age and nature of sediments at the bottom of Lake Ladoga. The lake is east of the Baltic and provides important information about the marginal stage of Baltic Sea levels, and in particular about differences between the Eemian and Holocene transgressions.\nPreviously Eemian marine sediments have never been found at the bottom of Lake Ladoga although they have been identified along river terraces, in small lakes and as detached lenses. The new coring reached a depth of 22 m, and found marine diatoms that might correspond to the Eemian transgression. As part of the effort to understand these fossils, we have compiled a comprehensive picture of the distribution of Eemian sediments around Lake Ladoga. There is very little published data about these deposits (Miettinen et al., 2014) so we have assembled known, but never published or published only in Russian, data.\nThe number of unpublished marine Eemian sequences exceeds 70. They occur more frequently here than on other Baltic coasts, because of the low position of the eastern Baltic territories above the sea level. This meant that they were not destroyed by isostatic uplift, which resulted in the deposition of thicker layers of sediment than in mountainous Fennoscandia. Typical Eemian sediments comprise a black clay layer with Yoldia arctica, have a monotonous appearance and are easily distinguished from other interglacial sediments. The modern elevation of these sections implies that the elevation of the Eemian Sea could not have exceeded +17 m and probably was very uniform.The Holocene sediments are found extensively around the Lake and on its bottom, and have been well-studied, which makes it possible to reconstruct in detail the transgressions of the Baltic Sea at the beginning of the Holocene. We hypothesize that a similar scenario was associated with the Eemian transgression and this allows us to provide a better interpretation of our data.",

Continued monitoring and research is therefore needed. In this study we use 13 years of time lapse camera data and climate data from high-Arctic Northeast Greenland to assess the seasonal response of a dwarf shrub heath, grassland, and fens to snow cover, soil moisture, and atmospheric and soil temperatures. Based on the camera data, we computed a greenness index which was subsequently used to analyze transition dates in vegetation seasonality. We show that snow cover and subsequent water from the melting snow pack is highly important for the seasonality. We found a significant advancement in start of growing season of 12 days but not a significant increase in growing season length. Both the timing and greenness index value of peak of growing season was significantly correlated to the available water in the pre-melt snow pack, mostly pronounced in vegetation with limited soil water. The end of growing season was likewise significantly correlated to the water equivalents in the pre-melt snowpack. Moreover, the vegetation greenness was highly correlated to GPP, and shifts in seasonality as tracked by the greenness index are thus expected to have direct influence on ecosystem productivity.",

It has also been known that subsurface waters that upwell onto the shelf are heavily affected by the South China Sea (SCS) Tropical Water and the SCS Intermediate Water which contain more nutrients than the tropical (Smax) and intermediate (Smin) waters from the West Philippine Sea (WPS). A front has been found to separate the tropical and intermediate waters from the SCS and WPS. The reported front in the Okinawa Trough, however, was identified based only on one-time data from a single cross-section in the central Okinawa Trough. Here historical hydrographic data between Mar. 1950 and Dec. 2011 in the Okinawa Trough and its neighborhood are analyzed. A vertical front tilted toward the west is found in all seasons in all years across the World Ocean Circulation Repeated Lines PR 18 and 19 as well as at the PN cross-section in the central Okinawa Trough. The front at the Smax level (sigma theta=24.6-24.9) shows large seasonal and interannual variations. In winter during normal and La Niña periods the presence of the SCS Tropical Water is the most prominent. It is the weakest in autumn during normal periods and in spring during La Nina periods. Yet during El Niño periods the SCS Tropical Water is the most prominent in spring and it becomes the weakest in winter. As for intermediate waters (Smin at sigma theta= 26.7-26.9) the WPS Intermediate Water and SCS Intermediate Water show much weaker seasonality compared with tropical waters although during normal periods in winter the WPS Intermediate Water contribution is slightly larger than during other times. During El Niño periods the WPS Intermediate Water contribution is the smallest but in spring it is much strengthened. On the other hand, the WPS Intermediate Water contribution is the smallest in spring, and the largest in winter during La Niña periods.",

Southern Andean Quaternary climates are represented by multi-proxy results from Lake Titicaca (Peru-Bolivia) spanning the last 400 ka and by pending results from the Lago Junin Drilling Project (Peru). Although Northern Andean sediment records spanning the last few million years have been retrieved from the Bogota and Fúquene Basins in the Eastern Cordillera of the Colombian Andes, climatic reconstructions based on these cores have thus far been limited to pollen-based investigations. When viewed together with the Southern Hemisphere results, these records suggest an anti-phased hemispheric climatic response during glacial cycles. In order to better assess orbital-scale climate responses, however, independent temperature and hydroclimate proxies from the Northern Hemisphere are needed in addition to vegetation histories. As part of this objective, an effort is underway to develop a paleoclimate record from Lago de Tota (3030 m asl), the largest lake in Colombia and the third largest lake in the Andes. One of 17 highland tectonic basins in Eastern Cordillera, Lago de Tota formed during Tertiary uplift that deformed pre-foreland megasequences, synrift and back-arc megasequences. The precise age and thickness of sediments in the Lago de Tota basin has not previously been established. Here, we present results from a recent single-channel seismic reflection survey collected with a small (5 cubic inch) air gun and high-resolution CHIRP sub-bottom data. With these data, we examine the depositional history and sequence stratigraphy of Lago de Tota and assess its potential as a deep drilling target.",

We selected 46 definite flow reversal events from them in order to study the physics of X-lines, removing events where stationary plasma and/or tail lobe components are observed at the timing of flow reversals.\nWe found that flow reversal events can be classified into two types according to electron heating/acceleration and low frequency wave activity. About 2/3 of the flow reversal events look “active.” In these events, strong electron heating/acceleration and existence of ion-electron decoupling region are commonly observed. The intense wave active in the lower-hybrid frequency range is also observed even in high β region around the neutral sheet. These features are consistent with the collisionless reconnection model demonstrated by recent full kinetic numerical simulations. In contrast, other 1/3 of flow reversal events do not present any of them. No visible ion-electron decoupling is found in these \"non-active\" flow reversal events. This new finding indicates that the strong wave activity in the electric field would be related to the ion-electron decoupling process and that wave activity is a possible indicator for liveliness of reconnection (= evidence of fast electron flow).\nThe fact that the non-active flow reversals tend to be distributed at the outer fringes of the active flow reversal regions implies that they are related to the three-dimensional structure of magnetic reconnection. In this presentation, we will discuss physical meaning of the difference between active and non-active flow reversal events. It is hard to discuss further collectively the nature of the non-active flow reversals only with single spacecraft measurements. This would be a good topic to be explored using multi-spacecraft data.",

Based on observed and reanalysis data, we investigate this link through a correlation analysis using the indices of Nino3, Nino3.4, and El Nino Modoki Index (EMI). The simultaneous correlation maps of the wind-stress curl indicate that the signal associated with EMI in the eastern North Pacific is stronger than the counterparts with Nino3 and Nino3.4. Responding to these signals in wind-stress curl, sea surface height (SSH) anomalies develop following EMI, but almost no SSH responses are found to Nino3 and Nino3.4. As El Nino Modoki lasts for a longer period than canonical El Nino, the stronger wind-stress curl signal to EMI drives the ocean more persistently, and induces substantial SSH signals. The induced SSH signals propagate westward to the western boundary region around 35N, affecting variability in the Kuroshio Extension, which might further exert feedback on the atmosphere aloft. The teleconnection from EMI to the North Pacific, however, was not found before the 1990s, indicating its clear decadal modulation.",

            "abstract": "As part of a larger project aimed at understanding the magma plumbing systems and magmatic processes responsible for crust formation at divergent plate margins, we have begun a study of the Galapagos Spreading Center (GSC), an intermediate spreading ridge off the west coast of South America and connected to the East Pacific Rise. This ridge is of interest because it passes close to the Galapagos Islands, allowing the effects of a mantle plume on sub-ridge processes and magma plumbing systems to be examined. In addition, the effects of ridge-ridge intersection, ridge propagation, and ridge offsets by transform faults on magma evolution can be examined. Published compositional data for glasses collected along the ridge were used to calculate pressures of partial crystallization and to examine variations in magma chemistry along the ridge. To aid interpretation of the results, the ridge was divided into 12 segments based on sample distribution and the occurrence of ridge offsets. Calculated pressures for most segments range from 100 and 300 MPa, and indicate depths of partial crystallization of ~3-9 km. This suggests that accretion occurs mostly near the base of the crust. However, the range of pressures for some segments is relatively large with maximum calculated values of 500-750 MPa. For example, near the major transform fault at ~85OW, the calculated maximum pressure is 741 MPa and the average pressure is ~ 300 MPa. We consider it unlikely that the calculated high pressures represent the true pressure of partial crystallization, and suggest that the compositions of some magmas result from processes other than simple crystallization. Correlations between Pressure and MgO, between Na2O and MgO, P2O5 and K2O, and between Na8 and longitude suggest that the processes operating beneath this ridge are complex. Near the transform fault for example, MgO vs Pressure shows a negative correlation with an R2 value of 0.546. Such trends are inconsistent with magma evolution via crystallization alone and it is suggested that crystallization was accompanied by interaction with pre-existing crust. We hypothesize that modification of magma compositions through assimilation of oceanic crust accounts for the wide range of pressures calculated for samples from some ridge segments. Additional research is underway to test this hypothesis.",

In a pilot study, students on an upper-level volcanology field trip were given iPads, with an open-source geology note-taking application (GeoFieldBook) and volunteered to record notes at two sites (i.e., Tongariro Volcanic Complex and Orakei Korako) in New Zealand. A group of students (n=9) were interviewed several weeks after fieldwork to reflect on using this technology. We aimed to characterise their experiences, strategies and examine the perceived benefits and challenges of hardcopy and digital note-taking. Students reported having a diverse range of strategies when taking notes but the most common strategies mentioned were: a) looking for/describing the differences, b) supporting note-taking with sketches, c) writing everything down, and d) focusing first on structure, texture and then composition of an outcrop. Additionally, students said they that the strategies they used were context-dependent (i.e., bedrock mapping versus detailed outcrop descriptions). When using the iPad, students reported that they specifically used different strategies: varying the length of text (from more to less), increasing the number of sites described (i.e., preferring to describe sites in more spatial detail rather than summarising several features in close proximity), and taking advantage of the ‘editability’ of iPad notes (abandoning rigid, systematic approaches). Overall, the reported advantages to iPad note-taking included allowing the user to be more efficient, organised and using the GPS mapping function to help them make observations and interpretations in real-time. Students also reported a range of disadvantages, but focused predominantly on the inability to annotate/draw sketches with the iPad in the same manner as pen and paper methods. These differences likely encourage different overall approaches to note-taking and cognition in the field environment, and we suggest to instructors that using pen and paper note-taking first, and then introducing new technology may encourage both systematic and efficient evaluation of field areas.",

However, our understanding of earthquakes' spatial-temporal occurrence and tectonic deformation at convergent margin is limited. Traditional view for subduction earthquake cycle contain three stages: Interseismic - superposition of steady elastic strain accumulation and occasional short-duration aseismic strain release, Coseismic – rapid opposite-direction release of accumulated elastic strain, and Postseismic – superposition of afterslips and viscoelastic flow in mantle wedge and lower crust. However, the way strain accumulated interseismically which is related to the generation of long-term deformation and uplift in the forearc region is still a matter of debate. Moreover, when integrated over time, coseismic uplift poorly matches the longer-term vertical deformation. To better understand these relationships, we investigate numerically how coseismic slip and long-term deformation (vertical uplift) accumulate and interact at subduction zones by using a robust, adaptive, multi-dimensional, finite element method solver, Dynearthsol3D, on a 2D continuum viscoelastoplastic model. We set the conditions in this model to a realistic convergent margin setting that resembles Sumatra region. By introducing bathymetric features, this research also explore mechanisms that could explain how strain accumulation in space and time is modified by the presence of large asperities at the subduction interface.

The area and capillary forces exerting on colloids can be different by adjusting the liquid-liquid surface tension. In the present work, we adjust only surface tension to change the configuration of AWI and AWSs. Experiments were performed in a Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) micro-model. Fluorescent carboxylate-modified polystyrene microspheres, with diameter of 300nm were used as model colloids. Water and fluorinert-FC43 were used as the two immiscible liquids. Given the fact that PDMS is a hydrophobic material, fluorinert was the wetting phase and water was the non-wetting phase in this micro-model. Surface tension was changed by adding fluorinert soluble surfactant into fluorinert-FC43. We visualized colloids interacting with the moving fluid-fluid interfaces by confocal microscopy. We also obtained colloid concentration breakthrough curves by measuring the fluorescent intensities in the outlet of the micro-model.\nThe breakthrough curves showed that under steady-state unsaturated flow, less colloid were retained in the system under low surface tension. The visualization results showed that, under low surface tension, the fluid-fluid interfaces are almost flat, thus less area and short contact line available for colloids to attach to. During transient flow, more colloids were remobilized by the moving fluorinert-water interfaces (FWIs) and fluorinert-water-solid contact lines (FWSCs) under high surface tension. Confocal results and measured breakthrough curves confirmed that lowing surface tension decreased capillary force and liquid-liquid area, resulting less retention and remobilization of colloids.",

To aid in the understanding of mountain building and plateau growth, we developed a 3D finite element model of the Tibetan Plateau following Flesch and Bendick (2012). Our model is based on the vast collection of published geophysical data and employs COMSOL Multiphysics (\nwww.comsol.com\n). We assume model material properties from the wide variety of published seismic and MT studies, incorporated with an updated, vertically averaged, effective viscosity distribution from Flesch et al. (2001). We test potential relationships between conductance/seismic velocity and strength (viscosity) by modeling strength difference contacts at imaged interfaces. We quantify fitness of candidate 3D viscosity functions by comparing solved model surface velocities to observed surface velocities inferred from GPS and Quaternary fault slip rates. The model geometry incorporates Earth curvature and extends eastward from 65° to 110°E, northward from 15° to 45°N, and vertically down to 100 km below sea level. The physics of deformation is governed by the Stokes equations describing incompressible Newtonian fluid flow. Boundary conditions consist of free slip across the bottom surface (representing the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary) and moving edge walls constrained by a GPS-derived, continuous velocity field. Model results indicate a tradeoff between crust and mantle dominant strength. Best-fit models are achieved by a combination of strong crust/upper mantle with additional strain accommodation in localized weak zones.",

One of the generation mechanisms of EMIC waves has long been known to be due to magnetospheric compression due to impact by enhanced solar wind dynamic pressure Pdyn. With the Van Allen Probes observations, we have identified 4 EMIC wave events that are triggered by Pdyn enhancements under northward IMF, prolonged quiet time conditions. We find the following features of the EMIC events. (1) They are triggered immediately at the Pdyn impact and remain active during the same period as the enhanced Pdyn duration. (2) They occur in either H band or He band or both. (3) Two events occur inside the plasmasphere and the other two outside the plasmasphere. (4) The wave polarization, either R or L, are highly elliptical, being close to be linear. (5) The wave normal angles are quite large, well away from being field-aligned. (6) About 10 – 50 keV proton fluxes indicate enhanced flux state with ~90 deg-peaked anisotropy in velocity distribution after the Pdyn impact. (7) From low altitude NOAA POES satellite observations of particles we find no obvious evidence for relativistic electron precipitation due to these Pdyn-triggered EMIC events. We will discuss implications of these observations on wave generation mechanism and interaction with radiation belt electrons.",

A coexistence of modified and preserved crust was revealed in eastern-central China, which was generally in Airy-type isostatic equilibrium. Crust is obviously thicker to the west of the North-South Gravity Lineament but exhibits complex variations in Poisson's ratio with an overall felsic to intermediate bulk crustal composition. Moho depth and Poisson's ratio show striking differences as compared to the surrounding areas in the rifts and tectonic boundary zones, where earthquakes usually occur. Similarities and differences in the Moho depth and average Poisson's ratio were observed among the Northeast China, North China Craton, South China, and the Qinling-Dabie Orogen as well as different areas within these blocks, which may result from their different evolutionary histories and strong tectonic-magma events since the Mesozoic. In addition, we observed an alteration of Moho depth by ~6 km and of Poisson's ratio by ~0.03 as well as striking E-W difference beneath and across the Xuefeng Mountains, suggesting that the Xuefeng Mountains may be a deep tectonic boundary between the eastern Yangtze Craton and western Cathaysia Block.",

The cross-correlation method produces a pixel displacement field, and finally a velocity field. Feature tracking is performed using pairs of the recently launched Landsat 8 as well as WorldView 2 (WV2) commercial imagery in monthly and yearly combinations.

            "abstract": "Surface-wave phase velocity data is often used to invert locally for shear wave-speed velocities as a function of depth. The standard approach involves assuming an initial velocity structure, calculating sensitivity kernels, determining linear velocity perturbations that best fit the data, and iterating this process until a final velocity structure is obtained that satisfies the phase velocity data. A common problem with this approach, however, is that poor initial guesses require iterating a large number of times so that the process can be inefficient or even non-convergent or impractically slow for a large number of such inversions. Building on a new type of 'Dix-like' surface-wave inversion method that we recently proposed, we show that a generalized 'Dix-like' approach is an iterative procedure with improved convergence rates compared to classical inversion. In particular, we find that the new approach converges quadratically whereas the classical approach only converges linearly, thus potentially speeding up inversions. This result can be understood as being related to the fact that the surface wave dispersion relation is linear in elastic modulus (density multiplied by velocity squared) rather than velocity. The new approach also clarifies the role and significance of depth sensitivity kernels and offers a new approach to computing them.",

The existence and activity of deep subseafloor microbial populations have profound implications on global biogeochemical cycles and our understanding of the limits of life. However, little is known about the impact of the deep biosphere on sedimentary P cycling and P diagenetic processes. Our previous work has shown that sedimentary P at North Pond is mainly present in mineral phases, and that refractory organic P is detectable throughout the sediment column. The latter could constitute a P source to the deep biosphere. Alternatively, microorganisms could have mechanisms to harvest P from recalcitrant mineral phases. The aim of this study is to determine the presence and maximum potential activity of enzymes involved in microbial P uptake in deep-sea sediments. These include phosphomonoesterases, such as alkaline phosphatase, phosphodiesterases, pyrophosphatase and phosphonatases. The sediment samples used for this study were collected at North Pond, a sediment pond located on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, during IODP Expedition 336. This work will provide key insights into the microbial P uptake mechanisms at play in open ocean sediments, and their effects on sedimentary P cycling. These results, in conjunction with our previous work investigating P geochemistry at North Pond, will yield valuable information regarding the impact of the deep biosphere on P cycling in open ocean sediments.",

At a time when all politics are partisan and the media measures value in clicks, complicated stories can become black-and-white. This loss of nuance is acute in tales told of climate change impacts in the developing world, particularly in the low-lying island states of the Pacific. Atoll countries like Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Maldives are certainly existentially threatened by climate change and sea-level rise. Yet the islands and their residents are also more resilient than the dramatic headlines about sinking islands would have you think. Casting the people as helpless victims, however well-intentioned, can actually hurt their ability to respond to climate change.\nThis presentation examines the risks and benefits of providing such nuance on a climate issue that the public and policy-makers generally view as black-and-white. Drawing on efforts a decade of research in Kiribati and other small island developing states in the Pacific, I describe how a mix of cultural differences, geopolitics, and the legacy of colonialism has made the Pacific Islands a narrative device in a western discussion about climate change. I then describe in detail the challenging process of writing a popular magazine story which questions that narrative - but not the long-term threat of sea-level rise - and the personal and political aftermath of its publication. Building upon this humbling experience and findings from psychology, communications and science and technology studies, I outline the key benefits and risks of engaging publicly with the nuances of a climate change issue, and provide a template for effectively communicating nuance in a politically charged atmosphere.",

            "abstract": "Isotope-based hydroclimate records and grain size records from the mid-continental United States that span the late Holocene with sub-decadal resolution are rare, making the relationship between temperature and hydroclimate for this region not well constrained. Pollen-based temperature reconstructions from North America suggest that the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; 650 to 1050 CE) was warmer than the Little Ice Age (LIA; 1550 to 1850 CE). It has further been suggested that much of the mid-continental US experienced drought during the MCA and pluvial conditions during the LIA. This is supported by modern correlations between seasonal temperatures and precipitation, which are anti-correlated for much of the Midwest; however, for portions of the continental core the opposite relationship exists between temperature and precipitation (i.e., warmer is wetter and colder is drier). Within this context and previous paleoclimate work in the Midwest we present geochronology, sedimentology oxygen isotopes and grain size results from a 12 m composite core from Pretty Lake, a 25 m deep kettle lake in LaGrange County, northeastern Indiana. Here we focus on the last 2,000 years of the 16,000-year record in order to explore hydroclimate variability in response to temperature anomalies during the MCA and LIA. Pretty Lake is well suited for this type of investigation because the closed surface hydrology of the lake basin renders it sensitive to evaporation. This is reflected in oxygen isotope (δ18O) measurements of surface waters from the lake, which show that it is approximately 4‰ higher than meteoric precipitation. High-resolution down core δ18O measurements hold tremendous potential for reconstructing regional hydroclimate during the last 2,000 years, particularly when combined with both the grain size record and the present surface water oxygen isotope measurements. Integrated, the three records from Pretty Lake reveal synoptic hydroclimate responses at unique spatial and temporal resolutions; the sediment oxygen isotopes represent the greater continental scale and overall climate during the past 7,500 years; the grain size represents the watershed scale during the last 2,000 years; and the surface water oxygen isotopes represent the smallest spatial scale of insitu lake processes during present conditions.",

Taibai in the Qinling Mountains, a critical geographic demarcation for climate and vegetation distribution in China. Combined with biomass equations and the annual diameter at breast height calculated from tree-ring widths and investigation data of sampling plots, annual biomass and net primary productivity (NPP) of L. chinensis in northern and southern slopes were estimated. Correlation and response analyses were used to illustrate the relationship between the climate and NPP. The results show that from 1949 to 2014, the biomass of L. chinensis in the pure forests increases from 54.03 to 94.43 t/ha in the northern slope and 28.32 to 55.80 t/ha in the southern slope. The NPP of L. chinensis in northern and southern slopes has varied concordantly over the past 65 years, with an average value of 0.62 and 0.42 t/(ha·a) respectively. The difference in NPPs between the northern and southern slope is decreasing for the slight decrease trend of NPP in northern slope. Temperature plays an important role in the growth of L. chinensis. Low temperature before the growing seasons (from pervious November to April) and warm conditions in the growing seasons (mainly from June to July) can increase the growth of L. chinensis. However, the relationships between NPP and temperature are different in the northern and southern slope. The NPP in southern slope is more positively correlated with the temperature in the growing seasons and there is no significant correlation relationship between the NPP and the temperature in previous winter (from pervious November to January), while the NPP in northern slope is more negatively correlated with the temperature before the growing seasons. These results will provide useful information for the future research of forest carbon cycling.",

            "abstract": "The 2011 M 9.0 Tohoku-oki, Japan, earthquake is the best recorded event and this gives us a unique opportunity to detailedly investigate the processes of the initiation and propagation of faulting. It was observed that the mainshock of the Tohoku-oki earthquake was triggered by the M7.3 largest foreshock with time delay of two days associated with clear migration of seismicity approaching the mainshock hypocenter; this suggests the existence of underlying post-seismic slip or afterslip (Ando and Imanishi, 2010, EPS). To test this hypothesis, we first concern the kinematically inverted slip profiles of M7.3 foreshock, its afterslip and the mainshock. For the foreshock sequence, the coseismic- and after-slip profiles were geodetically inverted by Ohta et al 2012, GRL, which considered the records from the ocean bottom pressure sensors installed just above the focal area. For the mainshock, Uchide 2013, GRL, conducted the multi-scale slip inversion enabling to resolve the first few ten seconds of the mainshock. Given these slip profiles, we then applied the 3-D BIEM (Ando and Okuyama, 2010, GRL) to calculate the stress drop distribution on the fault plane. The obtained shear traction changes exhibit the increase due to the foreshock and afterslip around the foreshock focal area, and considerable dynamic stress drop due to the mainshock rupture near the foreshock area. Next, we conduct the quasi-static and dynamic rupture simulations (or the forward modeling) to investigate the mechanical compatibility of the kinematic inversion results. The quasi-static simulation is used for the foreshock-afterslip sequence, and the dynamic simulation is used for the mainshock. We assume the mechanical fault model that concerns the rheological heterogeneity on a fault, consisting of the velocity strengthening (ductile) background and otherwise the velocity weakening (brittle) patches on the fault (Ando et al., 2012, JGR). We obtained the preliminary results showing a certain class of simple models can reproduce the observationally constrained traction change associated with the foreshock-afterslip-mainshock sequence. The delayed triggering due to the propagating afterslip is also reproduced, attributed to the velocity strengthening rheology of the considered fault model.",

            "abstract": "In the southeastern Oman Mountains the mantle section of the Samail ophiolite is unconformably capped by large units of Maastrichtian to Miocene, shallow marine limestones. Oceanic crust and upper mantle were thrust onto the Arabian continental margin from ca 96 to 80 Ma. Subaerial erosion locally removed the crustal section and exposed peridotite to weathering. A Maastrichtian transgression led to deposition of Late Cretaceous to Miocene, shallow marine limestones and shales above the unconformity.\nNear the town of Fins, a deep canyon exposes the unconformity and underlying, altered mantle peridotite. A striking series of clastic dikes of grey, micritic limestone extends across the unconformity, up to 10 meters down into the peridotite. Tips of these dikes are choked with angular peridotite blocks. Deeper, the peridotite is cut by a spectacular grid of carbonate-serpentine veins with abundant vugs. The peridotite matrix has high concentrations of calcium and small enrichments of silica compared to the Oman protolith, resulting from reaction with a hydrous fluid derived from seawater equilibrated with the overlying sediments. δ13C from -1.3-0.61 per mil (VPDB) and δ18O between 22.2 to 28 per mil (SMOW) are similar to values in the overlying sediments (Schluter et al., Facies 2008).\nClumped isotope thermometry on calcite crystals in veins cutting the peridotite outcrops indicate crystallization at 25-60 °C. Sediment thickness reconstructions place the pressure of alteration between 300-600 bars. 87Sr/86Sr values of 0.7078 and 0.7079 correspond to seawater Sr isotope ratios at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, which is present in the overlying limestones about 50 meters above the unconformity. This suggests that the veins in the peridotite formed at about 60 Ma, or that their parental fluid was in Sr isotope exchange equilibrium with 60 Ma sediments.\nReaction path modeling of carbonated saturated seawater and peridotite reproduces the observed vein mineral assemblage composed of carbonate and serpentine at high water/rock ratios, with carbon and silica added to the rock by the reacting fluid.",

            "abstract": "Isotopic composition of the ocean island basalts (OIB) are commonly explained by mixing of mantle reservoirs, such as depleted MORB mantle (DMM), HIMU (high-u: u = 238U/204Pb) EM1 (Enriched Mantle 1) and EM2. In addition, reservoirs whose isotopic compositions are common and intermediate has been pointed out, such as, FOZO (Focal Zone) and PREMA (Prevalent Mantle). Although these intermediate reservoirs have been used to describe the isotopic distribution of OIB, geochemical relationship between the intermediate and conventional reservoirs are still ambiguous. To elucidate the relationship, geochemical modeling has been conducted that focuses on origin of HIMU, FOZO, and PREMA. Our model includes magma differentiation process at mid-ocean ridges and variable dehydration conditions at subduction zones. The effect of magma differentiation process at a mid-ocean ridge was estimated by comparing the chemical composition of common and differentiated MORBs, which are determined based on the magnesium number of MORB. The variation in dehydration conditions are examined with different amount of water of dehydration with partition coefficients of aqueous and supercritical fluids reported by Kessel et al. (2005). The results suggest that the common MORBs without subduction modification could evolve to have isotopic signatures of PREMA after ca. 1-2 Ga since they are recycled back into the mantle, suggesting the importance of recycling of “dry” MORBs. In contrast, intensively dehydrated common MORBs can produce the FOZO isotopic signatures. Thus, variation in amount of dehydration water could be responsible for the FOZO-PREMA isotopic array. For the production of HIMU isotopic signature, additional conditions may be required, i.e., prolonged dehydration from sub-arc to sub-backarc. Difference in dehydration pressure could induce chemical fractionation between Pb, Th and U. We also found that only the strongly dehydrated differentiated MORBs can produce extreme HIMU isotopic signature. Magma differentiation at a mid-ocean ridge and a variable amount of water of dehydration at different pressure during subduction can explain the geochemical connection between HIMU, FOZO, and PREMA.",

Our results indicate that land cover change alone could lead to a decrease in summertime surface ozone by up to 4 ppbv in East Asia, driven mostly by enhanced dry deposition resulting from climate- and CO2-induced increase in vegetation density, which more than offsets the effect of reduced isoprene emission arising from cropland expansion. Climate change alone could lead to an increase in summertime ozone by 2-10 ppbv in most regions of East Asia, mostly attributable to warming. The combined impacts show that while the effect of climate change on ozone is more pronounced, land cover change could offset part of the climate effect. As results of climate and land cover and land use change, concentrations of sulfate, nitrate, ammonoium, organic carbon and black carbon are simulated to change by -6 to +4 μg m-3, and PM2.5 levels are estimated to change by -12 to +8 μg m-3 in East Asia. The impact of land cover and land use alone on PM air quality is relatively minor (-1 to +1 μg m-3), while the sensitivity of secondary organic aerosol concentation to land cover change are quite significant (-0.5 to +1.5 μg m-3) in comparison with the impact of climate change alone. The changes in anthropogenic emissions remain the largest contributor to deteriorating ozone and PM air quality in East Asia during the study period, but the climate change and land cover changes could lead to a substantial modification of ozone and PM levels.",

            "abstract": "We introduce the \"double-difference\" method, hugely popular in source inversion, in adjoint tomography. Differences between seismic observations and simulations may be explained in terms of many factors besides structural heterogeneity, e.g., errors in the source-time function, inaccurate timing, and systematic uncertainties. To alleviate nonuniqueness in the inverse problem, we make a differential measurement between stations, which largely cancels out the source signature and systematic errors. We seek to minimize the difference between differential measurements of observations and simulations at distinct stations. We show how to implement the double-difference concept in adjoint tomography, both theoretically and in practice. In contrast to conventional inversions aiming to maximize absolute agreement between observations and simulations, by differencing pairs of measurements at distinct locations, we obtain gradients of the new differential misfit function with respect to structural perturbations which are relatively insensitive to an incorrect source signature or timing errors. Furthermore, we analyze sensitivities of absolute and differential measurements. The former provide absolute information on structure along the ray paths between stations and sources, whereas the latter explain relative (and thus high-resolution) structural variations in areas close to the stations. In conventional tomography, one earthquake provides very limited structural resolution, as reflected in a misfit gradient consisting of \"streaks\" between the stations and the source. In double-difference tomography, one earthquake can actually resolve significant details of the structure, i.e., the double-differences provide a hugely powerful constraint on structural variations. Algorithmically, we incorporate the double-difference concept into the conventional adjoint tomography workflow by simply pairing up all regular measurements. Thus, the computational cost of the related adjoint simulations is basically unaffected, i.e., assimilating double-difference measurements does not add to the computational burden; it just modifies the construction of the adjoint sources for data assimilation.",

Data from mature passive margin sedimentary rocks of the Tethyan Himalayan Series have revealed this hitherto unreported zircon population in samples from both east of Xigaze and south of Zedong in southern Tibet. Such zircons might not have been detected before simply because most detrital zircon studies involving Himalayan rocks examined strata in which grains of this age would not have been present. Alternatively, it may be that this population is restricted to eastern outcrops of the Tethyan Himalayan Series.\nSeveral models have been proposed in order to explain this zircon population with the most recent work favouring a rift-fill interpretation with the zircons being sourced from the Lhasa terrane. However, the various models proposed are not fully supported by other geological constraints and/or involve paleogeographies that present intractable source to sink gradient issues.\nOur investigations of sedimentary rocks in Nagaland including Eocene sediments of both the Disang and Phokphur formations reveal the presence of a similar Late Permian to Early Triassic detrital zircon population. Notably, unlike the Lhasa terrane detrital sediments of nearby Eurasian margin units in this region similarly aged sedimentary rocks in the Indo-Burman range do not contain this population. Other zircon populations in the Nagaland samples are consistent with pre-Gondwana break-up (i.e. pre Cretaceous) paleogeography and suggest derivation from western Australia. Age-correlative zircon populations have been reported recently from detrital zircon investigations of sediments on the North West Shelf of Western Australia and a similar source is inferred for the Nagaland zircons.",

            "abstract": "The radioactive 134Cs and 137Cs isotopes deposited over Fukushima Prefecture by the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster are the predominant radiological concern for the years following the accident. This is because the energetic gamma radiation they emit on decay constitutes the majority of the elevated air dose rates that now afflict the region. Therefore, we developed a tool for calculating air dose rates from arbitrary radiocesium spatial distributions across the land surface and depth profiles within the ground. As cesium is strongly absorbed by clay soils, its primary redistribution mechanism within Fukushima Prefecture is by soil erosion and water-borne sediment transport. Each year between 0.1~1% of the total radiocesium inventory in the river basins neighboring Fukushima Daiichi is eroded from the land surface and enters into water courses, predominantly during typhoon storms. Although this is a small amount in relative terms, in absolute terms it corresponds to terabecquerels of 134Cs and 137Cs redistribution each year and this can affect the air dose rate at locations of high erosion and sediment deposition. This study inputs the results of sediment redistribution simulations into the dose rate evaluation tool to calculate the locations and magnitude of air dose rate changes due to radiocesium redistribution. The dose rate calculations are supported by handheld survey instrument results taken within the Prefecture.",

            "abstract": "Understanding of surface uplift complements existing thermochronology efforts to gain a better understanding of the tectonics and regional structure of Alaska. In southern Alaska, several lines of evidence suggest increased rates of exhumation and rock uplift during the late Miocene and early Pliocene, but whether this was accompanied by surface uplift remains uncertain. Here, we measured the hydrogen isotope composition of clay minerals that weathered rapidly from volcanic ash deposited in the interior of Alaska during the time period from the late Miocene to Holocene. This stable isotope record documents an increase of >60‰ in δD since the late Miocene. This is of opposite sign to the expected depletion signal associated with surface uplift. While not consistent with surface uplift, the enrichment presented here could be consistent with changes in seasonality, moisture source and/or vapor recycling through evapotranspiration. We use climate model output as an evaluative tool to understood the controls that may have influenced this isotopic signal, including feedbacks between surface uplift, climate, the hydrologic cycle and the environment.",

            "abstract": "Following an earthquake, complex fault arrays and distributed damage may be mapped at the surface and at depth from aftershocks, particularly in steps between faults. For example, a releasing step between two faults involved in the 1992 Landers, CA earthquake hosts a complex array of surface faulting and numerous aftershocks at depth, many of which cluster along distinct surfaces. Paleoseismology and observations from the 1979 Homestead Valley earthquake sequence located within this step suggest structural development in prior earthquakes as well. We ask: how important are these structures in allowing slip to continue through a releasing step and how do they develop over geologic time? We analyze slip structures within releasing steps from several earthquakes and use these data to constrain 2D, slip-weakening models of linear, 20 km faults separated by releasing steps with widths of 0.5 to 5 km. We assess if and when slip continues across these steps, both without and with the development of slip structures within the step. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the development of new structures within a step promotes slip through the step. However, both the potential for the continuation of slip and the extent of the structural development there depend on different aspects of the step geometry. Prior to the development of additional slip structures, all sets of faults with step distances of <1 km show continuous slip through the step, but only overlapping fault sets with step distances of ≥1 km do so. This threshold distance also depends on stress drop along model faults. When slip structures are allowed to develop, they do so preferentially within steps between overlapping faults and the continuation of slip becomes more dependent on fault overlap than step distance. This suite of models reveals that both fault step geometry and secondary slip structures are key characteristics of releasing steps and that accounting for these features is critical to assessing the seismic hazard of segmented fault systems.",

            "abstract": "Natural and anthropogenic fragmented landscapes are pervasive and this complexity significantly affects the structure of the atmospheric boundary layer, causing classic similarity theories to break down. This is especially true in areas affected by wake turbulence. Steep topography and canopy patches can lead to separation of the boundary layer and delay in the adjustment of turbulence to an adjacent underlying surface. Canopy wakes have been shown, in controlled wind tunnel experiments, to significantly affect the mean and turbulence profiles compared to classic rough to smooth transitions (Markfort et al. 2014, Env. Fluid Mech.). The added turbulence due to wakes delay the development of a new boundary layer and turbulent flux measurements and models that rely on similarity theory to determine surface fluxes exhibit significant errors. Here we compare lab-scale experimental measurements using PIV to field-scale measurements using scanning Doppler wind LiDARs. The measurements provide information on how the wake evolves in space and varies over time. Results from the lab and field show a time-varying recirculation zone downwind of the canopy, enhanced turbulence extending far downwind of the transition and reduced surface fluxes in the wake region. The field measurements show that the open trunk space near the base of the canopy results in a surface jet that can be detected just downwind of the canopy and farther downwind dissipates as it mixes with the wake flow above. The implications of canopy wakes for measurements and modeling of surface fluxes will be discussed.",

Little is known about how woody growth within the cerrado is affected by soil properties such as texture and/or nutrient availability. Thus, in this study we assessed the relationship between woody growth and soil properties in the Cuiaba Basin and Pantanal of Mato Grosso, Brazil. We sampled 4-5 vegetation stands in each site that varied in hydrology, soil type, and vegetation composition and structure, and measured diameter at breast height, wood density, and soil nutrient concentration and physical properties every 5-10 m along a 100 m long transect. We hypothesized that as tree diameter at breast height increases, annual tree growth rate will decrease and that woody carbon (C) storage will increase as a function of soil nutrient availability. Our preliminary data support our hypotheses. Tree growth rates declined with tree size in both the Cuiaba Basin and the Pantanal. Rates of woody C storage, both on a per tree basis (kgC tree-1 year-1) and on a per unit ground area basis (kgC m-2 year-1) were significantly positively correlated with soil extractable phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), and clay content, while only woody C storage on a per tree basis was positively correlated with potassium (K), magnesium (Mg), and cation exchange capacity (CEC). These data suggest that rates of woody C storage in cerrado are nutrient limited, while correspondence between C storage and soil physical properties could indicate both nutrient and water limitations to C storage.",

In the North American and European sectors, communications between amateur radio operators are a persistent and abundant source source of HF transmissions. We present the results of HF radio wave propagation experiments using amateur radio transmissions as an HF source for e-POP RRI. We detail how a distributed and autonomously operated amateur radio network can be leveraged to study HF radio wave propagation as well as the structuring and dynamics of the ionosphere over a large geographic region. In one case, the sudden disappearance of nearly two-dozen amateur radio HF sources located in the midwestern United States was used to detect a enhancement in foF2 in that same region. We compare our results to those from other more conventional radio instruments and models of the ionosphere to demonstrate the scientific merit of incorporating amateur radio networks for radio science at HF.",

The contribution of surface mass balance changes (due to variable precipitation) is compared with GRACE-derived mass loss acceleration by assessing the estimated contribution of snow mass from meteorological reanalysis data. We find that over much of the continent, the acceleration can be explained by precipitation anomalies. However, on the Antarctic Peninsula and other parts of West Antarctica mass changes are not explained by precipitation and are likely associated with ice discharge rate increases. The total apparent GRACE acceleration over all of the AIS between 2003 and 2013 is -13.6±7.2 GTon/yr2. Of this total, we find that the surface mass balance component is -8.2±2.0 GTon/yr2. However, the GRACE estimate appears to contain errors arising from the atmospheric pressure fields used to remove air mass effects. The estimated acceleration error from this effect is about 9.8±5.8 GTon/yr2. Correcting for this yields an ice discharge acceleration of -15.1±6.5 GTon/yr2.",

            "abstract": "Nitrous oxide (N2O) is recognized as one of the important anthropogenic greenhouse gases and also stratospheric ozone-depleting substances. Natural soil and fertilizer in croplands are large sources of N2O to the atmosphere, and so their global estimation is of great importance for prediction and mitigation. Two major processes of N2O production, i.e. nitrification and denitrification, were identified and parameterized using the leaky-pipe scheme. However, their biogeochemical mechanisms are very complicated and it is difficult to fully include them into process-based models, leading to substantial estimation uncertainty. In croplands, estimation is even more difficult because it depends on the amount, composition, and timing of nitrogenous fertilizer input. In this study, we focused on N2O emission from nitrification, which can play a dominant role in aerobic soils. In the present terrestrial nitrogen cycle models, fractionation of nitrogen in gross nitrification is parameterized in very simplified manner. First, we conducted a meta-analysis of the fraction of N2O emission from gross nitrification in relation to temperature, moisture (water-filled pore space), and pH, for a wide variety of soils including arable lands. We obtained typical values of N2O emission ratio from gross nitrification for different soil textures. Second, we assessed sensitivity of N2O emission to the assumption of nitrification fractionation, using a process-based model VISIT. We changed the value of N2O fraction in gross nitrification in different manners: default constant ratio, meta-analysis-based ratio, and parameterizations used in other models (DNDC and DLEM). We investigate how much the assumption of nitrification N2O emission affects global estimation of N2O budget and other parts of nitrogen cycle.",

Diagnostic analysis using the OFES suggests that interior baroclinic Rossby waves and coastal topographic waves play essential roles in modulating the AMOC interannual variability. The proposed mechanisms are evaluated in the context of the two-layer model. High-latitude anomalies are communicated to lower latitudes by topographic waves and account for about 50% of the AMOC interannual variability in the subtropics. The topographic waves and the large scale Rossby waves excited by wind forcing set up coherent AMOC interannual variability patterns across the tropics and subtropics. The comparison between the simple model and OGCM results suggest that a large fraction of the AMOC interannual variability in the OGCM can be explained by wind-driven dynamics.",

            "abstract": "Meander cutoff and oxbow lake formation are essential components of alluvial architecture and riverine habitat of meandering river floodplains. Yet, despite their ubiquitous presence within active floodplains, the detailed processes involved in the initiation of cutoffs and oxbow lakes remain incompletely understood, primarily due to the intermittent nature of such events. Furthermore, conceptual models of meander cutoff and oxbow lake formation have been primarily developed for chute cutoffs and relatively simple planform configurations. Less attention has been given to neck cutoff dynamics occurring on highly sinuous meandering rivers with complex planform morphology. During the formation of a neck cutoff on a compound elongate loop, the upstream and downstream limbs can become oriented roughly subparallel with flow in opposite directions separated by a narrow meander neck. Immediately following cutoff of this thin neck, flow from the upstream limb is sharply redirected into the downstream limb over a short distance. These conditions of tight bend flow should become more pronounced as the ratio of radius of curvature to channel width become smaller, leading to complex patterns of three-dimensional velocities that have implications for the evolution of the cutoff channel and the transformation of the abandoned bend into an oxbow lake. This paper investigates the process dynamics of neck cutoff and oxbow lake formation using detailed field measurements of three-dimensional flow velocities, channel bed topography and geotechnical analysis of the banks and floodplains from three neck cutoffs along the White River, Arkansas (USA), each representing a different stage in the morphologic evolution from cutoff to oxbow lake. Results from this study suggests that the planform geometry of neck cutoff on an elongate meander loop can influence the spatial pattern of sediment deposition within the abandoned loop leading to increased hydrologic connectivity to the main channel and the overall morphodynamics of highly sinuous meandering rivers.",

A high spatial and temporal resolution climatology of fire weather is vital for examining relationships, determining wildfire risks and basing fire management decisions upon. A homogeneous 41-year (1972–2012) hourly 4-km gridded climate dataset for the fire-prone state of Victoria, Australia has been generated using a combination of mesoscale modelling, global reanalysis data, surface observations, and historic observed rainfall analyses. Outputs include surface weather variables such as hourly temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and wind direction. In addition, daily drought indices have been calculated and these have been used to calculate a commonly used fire danger index.\nThis new dataset allows for an almost limitless opportunity for hitherto unavailable analyses – such as fields of percentiles of fire danger indices values, analysis of periods exceeding thresholds at any location, inter-annual and regional variations of fire season characteristics, analysis of prescribed burning windows, and identifying trends over the 41-year period. Furthermore, the hourly mesoscale wind fields provide a homogeneous long-period data set with which to drive fire spread models. The opportunities to advance wildfire research for this region and thereby provide information to improve risk analysis and fire management are immense.\nThis presentation describes the generation of the dataset, evaluation of the outputs and highlights its use and relevance for fire management. In particular, frequency of exceedance of both extreme values (for resource allocation planning), and also frequencies whereby multiple parameters mutually fall within the prescribed burning guidelines, and its interannual variation, will be discussed.",

            "abstract": "In an actively orogeny the landscape are transient state of disequilibrium in response to climatic and tectonic inputs. At the catchment scale, sensitivity of river systems plays an important role in landscape evolution. Hoping drainage basin is located at the tectonic transition zone in the north-eastern Taiwan, where the behavior of Philippine Sea plate switches from overriding above the east-dipping Eurasian Continental plate to northward subducting under the Ryukyu arc. However, extensive deep-seated landslides, debris flow, and numerous large alluvial terraces can be observed, suggesting strong surface processes in this watershed. This effect on regional climate fundamentally changed the landscape by reconfiguring drainage patterns and creating a vast influx of sediments into the basin. In this study we review the morphological evidence from multi-temporal timescale, including in-situ cosmogenic nuclides denudation rate and suspension load data, coupled with the analysis of the longitudinal profiles. The main goal of this study is to compare Holocene erosion rates with thermochronology and radiometric dating of river terraces to investigate the erosion history of Hoping area. The result shows that short-term erosion rate is around twice as large as the long-term denudation rate, which might due to the climate-driven erosion events such as typhoon-induced landslide. We’ve also mapped detail morphological features by using the high-resolution LiDAR image, which help us to identify not only the landslide but also tectonic features such as lineation, fault scarps, and fracture zones. The tectonic surface features and field investigation results show that the drainage basin is highly fractured, suggesting that even though the vertical tectonic activity rate is small, the horizontal shortening influenced by both southward opening of the back-arc Okinawa trough and the north-western collision in this area is significant. This might cause the reducing in rock strength and increase the hillslope erosion during heavy rainfall. By studying the erosion rate of Hoping River watershed we can understand more about surface processes in dynamic landscape, and more over, to establish a comprehensive understanding about the evolution of the ongoing Taiwan arc-continental collision process.",

The global discrete Laplacian operator matrix constructed by assembling the local discrete Laplacian operator matrix is used to make the Helmholtz-type global filter matrix. By preparing the inverted filter matrix in advance, only forward operation which is the multiplication of the inverted filter matrix and the global grid vector is required to carry out the filtering process. Also, the magnitude of inverted filter matrix components vary in significantly large range from (O-40) to (O -1) so that negligible matrix components less than a certain threshold value such as 10-15 or 10-10 can be removed reduce the operation count. It is found that the number of the matrix components after removal process is maintained with the help of diffusion coefficient and model time step size even though the horizontal resolution increases. This feature has advantages in parallelization of filtering process. Parallel scalability of filtering process only is nearly perfect to 512 CPUs. Scalability of the fully-equipped model is now under test and will be presented.\nForward operating high-order filter is implemented in the spectral element hydrostatic dynamical core. Performance of forward operating high-order filter is evaluated using the dynamical core model intercomparison project (DCMIP) test cases and compared to explicit hyper-viscosity. Test case 2-0-0 which is steady-state atmosphere at rest in the presence of bottom topography is chosen, and we changed its moderately-steep orography to non-smoothed observed one to generate small-scale noise sufficiently. During 6 days of time integration, spurious flow was generated by the pressure gradient error. For a large time step size the model with explicit diffusion was found unstable, finally blowing-up at day 1. However, the model with second-order implicit filter was stable until the end of time integration. With a small time step size, the maximum wind speed for the implicit filter is lower and varies smoothly with time compare to explicit one. With a fourth-order implicit filter, trend of kinetic energy spectrum at day 6 is similar to spherical harmonics dynamical core with a fourth-order filter.",

            "abstract": "The contemporary power sector in the United States is heavily reliant on water resources to provide cooling water for thermoelectric generation. Efficient thermoelectric plant operations require large volumes of water at sufficiently cool temperatures for their cooling process. The total amount of water that is withdrawn or consumed for cooling and any potential declines in efficiencies are determined by the sector’s fuel mix and cooling technologies. As such, the impact of climate change, and the extent of impact, on the power sector is shaped by the choice of electricity generation technologies that will be built over the coming decades. In this study, we model potential changes in river discharge and temperature in the contiguous US under a set of climate scenarios to year 2050 using the Water Balance Model-Thermoelectric Power and Thermal Pollution Model (WBM-TP2M). Together, these models quantify, in high-resolution (3-min), river temperatures, discharge and power plant efficiency losses associated with changes in available cooling water that incorporates climate, hydrology, river network dynamics and multi-plant impacts, on both single power plant and regional scales. Results are used to assess the aptness and vulnerability of contemporary and alternative electricity generation pathways to changes in climate and water availability for cooling purposes, and the concomitant impacts on power plant operating efficiencies. We assess the potential impacts by comparing six regions (Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Great Plains, Southwest, Northwest as in the National Climate Assessment (2014)) across the US. These experiments allow us to assess tradeoffs among electricity–water–climate to provide useful insight for decision-makers managing regional power production and aquatic environments.",

Oxygen, in the form of water, is also dynamically significant in Jupiter's atmosphere: as a tracer of circulation and as a carrier of latent heat.\nWe have developed a technique to measure the depth of opaque cloud tops in Jupiter's atmosphere (Bjoraker et al. 2015; this meeting; also Astrophysical Journal in press). We measure resolved CH3D line shapes in the 5-µm window of Jupiter's spectrum to distinguish between cloud-top pressure levels of about 3 to 10 bars.\nWe will use the retrieved cloud top pressure levels to place lower limits on the O/H ratio in Jupiter, based on Keck/NIRSPEC spectra acquired in January 2013. Since our spectra do not directly give the temperature/pressure profile in the cloud layer, constraining the O/H ratio requires independent atmospheric structure data. We will review observational and theoretical constraints on Jupiter's thermal structure, which lead to uncertainty bounds on the O/H ratio we derive. Preliminary work to date suggests that our technique may be able to determine whether or not the Galileo Probe Mass Spectrometer O/H measurement can be representative of the planet's bulk abundance, and whether O is supersolar in Jupiter like the other volatile elements C, N, and S. If we can distinguish between O/H lower limits of 10x and 3x solar, we will be able to test the hypothesis that Jupiter's volatiles must have been delivered via water ice clathrates.\n[This conference abstract is supported by NASA grant NNX11AM55G issued through the Outer Planets Research Program, and by grants NNX11AJ47G, NNX14AJ43G, and NNX1AJ41G through the Planetary Astronomy and Solar System Observations Programs.]",

Molecular nitrogen emission in the UV Lyman-Birge-Hopfield bands can be used to determine energy flux and electron mean energy (Sotirelis, et al, 2013) and thereby Hall and Pederson integrated conductances (Gjerloev, et al., 2014). UV imagery provided by the 4 SSUSI instruments on the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) F16-F19 spacecraft provide two dimensional maps of this emission at different local times. Often there are near simultaneous observations of both poles by some combination of the satellites. (see figure 1) The SSUSI auroral data products are well suited to this study, as they have the following features.:\n- dayglow has been subtracted on dayside aurora\n- electron energy flux and mean energy are pre-calculated\n- individual arcs have been identified through image processing.\nIn order to intercompare data from multiple satellites, we must first ensure that the instrument calibrations are consistent. In this work we show that the instruments are consistently calibrated, and that results generated from the SSUSI data products can be trusted.

Despite the high spatial variability of the aerosol optical depth (AOD; which at 500 nm ranged from 0.75 to 1.37 depending on the site), the temporal variation of the daily AOD demonstrated a consistent pattern among the observed sites, suggesting the presence of widespread smoke haze over the region. Smoke particles were characterized as small (Ångström exponent at 440−870 nm of 1.72 and fine mode fraction of 0.96), strongly absorbing (single-scattering albedo at 440 nm of 0.88), mixture of black and brown carbon particles (absorption Ångström exponent at 440−870 nm of 1.5) suspended within the planetary boundary layer (PBL). Smoke plumes driven by the PBL dynamics in the mountainous region reached as high as 5 km above sea level; these plumes subsequently spread out by westerly winds over northern Vietnam, southern China, and the neighboring South China Sea. Moreover, the analysis of diurnal variability of aerosol loading and optical properties as well as vertical profile in relation to PBL development, fire intensity, and aerosol mixing showed that various sites exhibited different variability based on meteorological conditions, fuel type, site elevation, and proximity to biomass-burning sources. These local factors influence the aerosol characteristics in the region and distinguish northern Indochina smoke from other biomass-burning regions in the world.",

Understanding how these events vary in space and time is a key goal in climatology research. The recently developed CHRS CONNECT (Center for Hydrometeorology & Remote Sensing CONNected precipitation objECT) system is a global extreme precipitation event database derived from CHRS’s satellite precipitation data products, including PERSIANN (Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks) and PERSIANN-CDR (Climate Data Record). Precipitation data from PERSIANN is hourly, 0.25ox0.25o grid, 60oS – 60oN, from 2000 to 2015, and data from PERSIANN-CDR is daily, 0.25ox0.25o grid, 60oS – 60oN, from 1983 to 2015. We used an advanced method in computer science which represents a data point on a three dimensional grid (longitude, latitude and time) called volumetric pixel or voxel. An object segmentation algorithm was developed to derive precipitation events as objects. In each object, voxels are connected to each other through the 26 connectivity faces (a voxel is connected to a neighboring voxel if they share a common face). The object-oriented algorithm was designed to provide a unique means in which extreme precipitation events and their attributes can be stored in a searchable database. This database is accessible through a user-friendly interface (connect.eng.uci.edu), allowing the user to retrieve events that fit specific criteria of interest such as spatiotemporal domain, maximum intensity, minimum duration and climatology indices. The interface includes several modes for visualization such as total precipitation, event tracking, and event evolution animation. The CHRS CONNECT tool is designed to be used for climatology research related to extreme precipitation events as well as for water resources management applications.",

The strain drop is a common parameter to both types of events that is fundamental to describe the amount of fault slip, surface displacements and also helps predict rupture size in a seismogenic zone. Strain drop seems to be relatively uniform over a wide range of earthquake magnitudes. However, its variation among different types of events, seismic and aseismic is poorly understood. Here, we build a comprehensive catalogue of earthquakes and SSEs to show that strain drop decides the style of rupture. On average, SSEs have strain drops 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than earthquakes, indiscriminate of tectonic context. Strain drop seems to decrease with depth, with tsunami earthquakes having the largest strain drop. Shallow, continental, earthquake have larger strain drop than typical subduction zone earthquakes, implying rupture mechanism varying with depth. Strain drop between events that occur in different regions show no trends with their moment magnitude. However, for SSEs that rupture the same area, the strain drop varies directly with moment magnitude. By combing all the above observations we see that many physical parameters, shows strong depth dependence, indicating depth-dependent segmentation of the seismogenic zone in megathrusts. This, along with a geometry of an existing seismic gap can help predict the hazard associated when that region relieves strain.",

            "abstract": "We investigate the sensitivity of tropical response to the latitudinal position of zonally asymmetric thermal forcing. A series of aqua-planet experiments is used where ocean heat flux, either heating or cooling, with finite longitudinal width is prescribed at different latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. The forcing located poleward of 30deg produces homogenized tropical precipitation response, whereas the forcing equatorward of 30deg leads to a localized tropical response. This implies that zonally asymmetric forcing can produce homogenized tropical response when its effect is effectively advected by midlatitude jet.\nThe magnitude of tropical precipitation response is proportional to the cross-equatorial atmospheric energy fluxes, which is determined by the competition between the negative feedback from clear-sky fluxes and the positive feedback from cloud effects. Both the negative and positive feedbacks respond stronger to prescribed cooling than to heating. However, the positive feedback is strengthened more than the negative feedback, so that the tropical precipitation responds more effectively to cooling. The result suggests that remote tropical impacts of aerosols emitted in the mid-latitudes will depend on the sign of aerosol radiative forcing.",

We have now extended these simulations to a larger range of L (2 < L < 20) and to much longer simulation times, T ~ 1000 hours ~ 20 circulation time scales. At times greater than a few circulation time scales the simulations reveal a new type of behavior in the outer region, with many narrow fingers coalescing to form fewer but broader outflow fingers. The Fourier spectrum of the azimuthal convection structure, initially dominated by azimuthal wavenumbers m ~ 20 – 40, becomes dominated instead by wavenumbers m ~ 1. Work is in progress to understand this behavior at an analytical level, and to investigate its possible role in producing spin-periodic phenomena in Saturn’s otherwise symmetric magnetosphere.",

            "abstract": "It has long been recognized that rupture complexity, typically in the form of heterogeneous slip distribution pattern, has a significant effect on tsunami wave field. However, the effect of heterogeneous slip distributions is not commonly considered in probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment (PTHA) primarily due to its computational expense. To investigate the effect of heterogeneous slip distribution on PTHAs, we incorporate a stochastic source model into a Monte Carlo-type method for PTHA. Using a hybrid kinematic k-squared source model, we generate a broad range of slip distribution patterns for large numbers of synthetic earthquake events and assess tsunami hazard, as an example, for the South China Sea (SCS). Our result suggests, for a relatively small and confined region like the SCS, the commonly used approach based on the uniform slip distribution fault models could significantly underestimate tsunami hazard, especially on a longer time period. For 500-year return periods, the expected wave height along the coast of west Luzon, Taiwan, southeast China, east Vietnam is generally underestimated by 20-50 %. Notably, the underestimation is more pronounced (some locations reach >50%) for the expected tsunami wave height with a 1000-year return period. Also of note the probability of experiencing 1m tsunami wave in the next 100 years is underestimated by more than 40% in many coastal sites in southeast China and east Vietnam. As the results of PTHA commonly serve as the foundation for further risk assessments, this case study emphasizes how crucial it is to take the effect of rupture complexity into account.",

Due to the low frequency of repeat measurements it is unclear when these variations occurred and how do them evolve. We point out anomalous magnetic filed using some circles with radius of 50km usually in June of each year, and then we would check whether quake will locat in our circles during one year after that time (June to next June). Now we caught 10 earthquakes of 15 main shocks having magnitude > 5, most of them located at less than10km away from our circles and some of them were in our circles.\nMost results show that the variations of lithosphere magnetic filed at the epicenter are different with surrending backgroud usually. When we figure out horizontal variations (vector) of lithosphere magnetic field and epicenter during one year after each June, we found half of them show that the earthquakes will locat at “the inlands in a flowing river”, that means earthquakes may occur at “quiet”regions while the backgroud show character as“flow” as liquid.\nWhen we compared with GPS results, it appears that these variations of lithospere magnetic field may also correlate with displacement of earth’s surface. However we do not compared with GPS results for each earthquake, we are not clear whether these anomalous variations of lithospere magnetic field may also correlate with anomalous displacement of earth’s surface.\nFuture work will include developing an automated method for identifying this type of anomalous field behavior and trying to short repeat measurement period to 6 month to try to find when these variations occur.",

            "abstract": "It is widely known that Titan is the only body in the Solar System, other than Earth, that has an abundant liquid phase on its surface. Its liquid composition has been derived from thermodynamic models that assume equilibrium between liquid and the atmosphere. Efforts to obtain composition data of Titan’s lakes have been made, in particular using bathymetry and microwave absorption analysis of Cassini fly-by data, the initial semi-quantitative findings of which include the dominant fraction of methane in liquids of northern lakes (Mastrogiuseppe et al., GRL 2013, 41, 1432). These efforts can constrain the composition of each component in the liquids of both northern lakes and Ontario Lacus in the southern hemisphere.\nA molecular-based thermodynamic model for cryogenic chemical systems, referred to as CRYOCHEM, was shown to reproduce the vertical composition profile of Titan’s atmospheric methane measured by the Huygens probe (Tan et al., Icarus 2013, 222, 53). It was also used to calculate the liquid composition in equilibrium with the atmosphere. The results revealed exotic behavior of liquid density with respect to changes of temperature and pressure (Tan et al., Icarus 2015, 250, 64). Within a temperature range of 3.7 K between equatorial and Polar regions, the liquid composition changes from ethane-rich in the equator to methane-rich at polar latitudes, thus consistent with the bathymetry and microwave absorption analysis. This consistency will have to be tested quantitatively when the analysis is completed and gives us tighter compositional constraints.\nCRYOCHEM is currently enhanced by including HCN, the only nitrile that has an amount comparable to the heavy hydrocarbons already accounted for in the model. The reason for initially omitting HCN was the inability of the old version of CRYOCHEM to deal with electrically polar molecules such as HCN, which has a strong dipole moment. Its present inclusion brings the model fluids closer to the actual condition on Titan and enhances the versatility of CRYOCHEM to simulate Titan geochemistry.\nWe will discuss the effects of the inclusion of HCN on the calculated composition of Titan’s surface liquids and the calculation accuracy to anticipate the crucial comparison with the compositional constraints resulting from bathymetry and microwave absorption analysis.",

Using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar, or InSAR, we measure the magnitude of land subsidence to be as much as 20 cm/year for the period from 2007-2011. By comparing the observed subsidence with current and historic groundwater levels, we estimate that 90% of the observed subsidence is inelastic, or not recoverable. Due to delayed drainage in thick aquitards, we find that the majority (>95%) of compaction is caused by thin clay lenses within the upper and lower aquifers, which agrees with previous studies in the area. We use representative skeletal storage coefficients from previous studies in conjunction with observed subsidence and groundwater levels in a 1-dimensional vertical diffusion model to estimate the effective vertical hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer, and determine it is on the order of 1×10−6 cm/second.",

            "abstract": "The Prairie Pothole region encompasses 715,000 km2 of the north central US and south central Canada and contains millions of small wetlands and lakes. It sustains large populations of shore birds and migratory waterfowl. PPR ecology is influenced by wetland geochemistry, which can range dramatically over short distances (≤ 200m) from dilute Ca2+-HCO3- to saline Na+-Mg2+-SO42- compositions. These compositional differences result, in part, from long-term critical zone processes in upland areas coupled to groundwater inflow, but they are also influenced by climate. Climate impacts on the geochemistry of 167 wetlands/lakes from a 9700 km2 area of North Dakota (USA) were studied. The chemical composition of these wetlands was determined in the early 1970’s during slightly dry climatic conditions and again in 2012-2013, a period of exceptional precipitation. Dilution dominated wetland geochemical trends. Concentrations of Cl-, Na+, K+, and Mg2+ generally decreased in 2012-2013 compared to earlier data. In contrast Ca2+ increased, and SO42- change was variable. The processes driving these modifications were evaluated using inverse (mass balance based) geochemical modeling. The decrease in the largely inert ion, Na+ by rainwater addition was used to approximate the net dilution factor of the wetlands which ranged to >9. This volume increase was associated with large expansions of wetland area determined from time-series Landsat data. Introducing dissolution of authigenic CaCO3, a known constituent of wetland sediments, matched the observed Ca2+ increase. Addition of SO42--enriched groundwater (composition determined from well analyses) was required to model wetlands with increased SO42-. Those wetlands with increased SO42- had more negative δ34SSO4 values, a result consistent with a previously established isotopically light marine pyrite source for groundwater SO42-. Understanding the evolution of wetland chemistry may aid in assessing future climatic impacts to the PPR.",

            "abstract": "Earthquakes triggered by remote, transient stresses may indicate critical ambient stress conditions on host faults, independent of their proximity to plate boundaries. Here, we investigate dynamic triggering of three sedimentary basins in Canada where seismic station coverage has been increased to monitor anticipated increases in fluid injection activity: northeast British Columbia and western Alberta, the Norman Wells area of the Northwest Territories, and northeast New Brunswick. We select triggering mainshock candidates satisfying the following criteria: Ms > 6, and local peak ground velocity exceeding 0.01 cm/s. We find 31 mainshocks in northeast British Columbia/western Alberta, 9 in Norman Wells, and 4 in New Brunswick during increased station operation. We will investigate seismicity rates in 10-day windows before and after each mainshock using local earthquake catalog data and uncataloged events detected using a multi-station matched-filter approach on continuous waveform data. The multi-station matched-filter method detects earthquakes by cross-correlating known earthquakes with continuous data and declaring events when correlation values of combined stations exceed a pre-set threshold.\nAfter determining seismicity rates in the 20-day windows surrounding each mainshock, we will use aβ-statistic and p-value to quantify if statistically significant triggering has occurred. Where triggering occurs, calculations of triggered earthquake focal mechanisms may help explain how receiver pre-existing faults become critically stressed, and what physical factors are directly correlated with dynamic triggering. Cases of observed triggering may imply that the seismic response to injection activity could be more intense than in regions without remote dynamic triggering. Alternatively, if triggering occurs but the seismic response to injection activity is limited, it could imply that hydraulic communication with basement faults is key for inducing earthquakes.",

            "abstract": "The North Atlantic basin displays clear regional anomalies in depth and other features centered near Iceland. A current paradigm holds that these anomalies are due to a mantle plume and that the Reykjanes Ridge, located over this plume, is a sensitive recorder of its activity in the crust it accretes. Thus, many seafloor spreading features of the Reykjanes Ridge including axial reconfigurations from orthogonal to oblique spreading, elimination of segment offsets and transform faults, and formation of V-shaped ridges and troughs flanking the axis have been attributed to mantle plume thermal effects radiating outward from beneath Iceland. Based on new geophysical data from a R/V Marcus G Langseth cruise to the southern Reykjanes Ridge we propose an alternate hypothesis: that plate boundary processes superimposed on the larger regional anomalies can account for these seafloor spreading features.\nA key plate boundary process is sub-axial buoyant mantle upwelling because it can increase melt production and crustal thickness relative to passive mantle advection without changes in mantle temperature. We hypothesize that on a long and linear slow spreading ridge underlain by a regional gradient in mantle temperature and water content, buoyant mantle upwelling can propagate along axis and create many of the seafloor spreading effects currently attributed to radiating mantle plume thermal pulses. However, propagating buoyant mantle upwelling is fundamentally a wave-like phenomenon wherein only the form of upwelling propagates along axis, not actual mantle material. This has profoundly different implications for the formation of crustal structures than in mantle plume models, which require actual rapid radial mantle flow. This property of the sub-axial propagating buoyant mantle upwelling model, if correct, invalidates interpretation of prominent Reykjanes Ridge seafloor spreading features as indicators of regional mantle plume flow and requires reevaluation of geodynamic models based on this assumption.",

            "abstract": "In the summer of 2015 two controlled chemical explosions were carried out near Dugway, Utah. The 2 June 2015 explosion consisted of 30,000 lbs of ammonium nitrate fuel oil (ANFO) and the 22 July 2015 explosion consisted of 60,000 lbs of ANFO. The explosion centroids were 1–2 m above the Earth's surface and both created significant craters in the soft desert alluvium. To better understand the seismic source associated with surface explosions, we deployed an array of wireless, three-component, short-period (5 Hz corner frequency) seismometers for several days around each shot. For the first explosion, 46 receivers were deployed in a \"lollipop\" geometry that had a sparse ring at a radius of 1 km, and a dense stem with 100 m spacing for distances of 0.5-4.5 km. For the second explosion, 48 receivers were deployed similarly, but with a dense ring spaced in azimuthal increments of 10 degrees at a distance of 1 km, and a sparse stem (~500 m spacing) that extended to a distance of nearly 6 km. A rich variety of phases were recorded including direct P waves, refracted and reflected P waves, nearly monochromatic air-coupled Rayleigh waves, normally dispersed fundamental mode Rayleigh waves (Rg), primary airblast arrivals, some secondary airblast arrivals, and possibly tertiary airblast arrivals. There is also evidence of converted S waves on the radial components and possibly direct S energy on the radial and transverse components, although the transverse energy does not always possess a simple, coherent move-out with distance, implying that it might have a scattering origin. To aid in the phase identification, especially of the apparent SH and Love energy, we are currently performing tau-p, f-k, and particle motion analysis.",

            "abstract": "Earlier multi-anvil experiments suggested a large amount of Fe3+ (60-70%) in bridgmanite (Bm) through charge disproportionation of Fe2+ to Fe3+ and metallic iron at the pressure-temperature (P-T) conditions of the topmost lower mantle (<25 GPa). Similar amount of Fe3+ has been recently documented at higher pressures but without redox control. If metallic iron can be stabilized, the lower mantle will have very low oxygen fugacity. However, the inclusions in lower-mantle diamonds suggest large variations in oxygen fugacity to much more oxidizing conditions. We mixed (Mg0.75Fe0.2Al0.05)(Al0.05Si0.95)O3 starting materials with 2-5 wt% metallic iron, in order to ensure reducing conditions during the synthesis of Bm in the laser-heated diamond-anvil cell. X-ray diffraction and Mossbauer spectroscopy were performed at APS. The recovered samples were analyzed using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) at ASU. We found that 60-70% of iron is Fe3+ in Bm at P<40 GPa and P>70 GPa, consistent with previous studies. However, Bm synthesized at 40-70 GPa contains very little Fe3+ (~10%), indicating that charge disproportionation does not occur at depths between 1000 and 1700 km in the lower mantle. The low metallic iron layer (LMIL) can be oxidized in early Earth, because of unbalanced Fe3+ and metallic iron in lower-mantle flow by core formation. The oxidizing nature of the layer may impact the siderophile element partitioning between metal and silicates if magma ocean was sufficiently deep. The layer can be further oxidized through solid mantle convection because of injection of oxidizing surface materials. The elevated oxygen fugacity will potentially make LMIL a distinct geochemical reservoir. Due to oxidizing conditions, carbon will form diamond instead of FeC in the layer. Strong partitioning of Fe2+ into ferropericlase (Fp) and the low content of Fe3+ in Bm will enrich Fp with iron (Fe2+) in LMIL. Because the Fe3+ content changes gradually, the upper and lower boundaries of the layer would not produce seismically detectable discontinuities. The layer may have low thermal conductivity due to the low Fe3+ content in Bm, possibly affecting dynamics of the mid mantle.",

The earthquake early warning system (EEWS) in the KMA is based on the Earthquake Alarm Systems version 2 (ElarmS-2), developed at the University of California Berkeley. This method estimates the earthquake location using a simple grid search algorithm that finds the location with the minimum variance of the origin time on successively finer grids. A robust maximum likelihood earthquake location (MAXEL) method for early warning, based on the equal differential times of P arrivals, was recently developed. The MAXEL has been demonstrated to be successful in determining the event location, even when an outlier is included in the small number of P arrivals. This presentation details the application of the MAXEL to the EEWS of the KMA, its performance evaluation over seismic networks in South Korea with synthetic data, and comparison of statistics of earthquake locations based on the ElarmS-2 and the MAXEL.",

The vision of ZGIP is to promote space education and research in microgravity. This paper will deliberate on the strategy used to implement the ZGIP to introduce school children to authentic scientific data and inquiry. The paper highlights how the students learned to collect scientific data in a laboratory environment, analyzed the data with specialized software, obtained results, interpreted and presented the results of their study in a standard format to the scientific community. About 100 school children, aged between 7 and 21 years, from ten public and private schools located in Osun State, Nigeria participated in the pilot phase of the ZGIP which commenced with a 1-day workshop in March 2014. During the inauguration workshop, the participants were introduced to the environment of outer space, with special emphasis on the concept of microgravity. They were also taught the basic principle of operation of the Clinostat, a Zero-Gravity Instrument donated to ARCSSTE-E by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UN-OOSA), Vienna, under the Human Space Technology Initiative (UN-HSTI). At the end of the workshop, each school designed a project, and had a period of 1 week, on a planned time-table, to work in the laboratory of ARCSSTE-E where they utilized the clinostat to examine the germination of indigenous plant seeds in simulated microgravity conditions. The paper also documents the post-laboratory investigation activities, which included presentation of the results in a poster competition and an evaluation of the project. The enthusiasm displayed by the students, coupled with the favorable responses recorded during an oral interview conducted to assess the impact of the project on the participants indicated that this method of informal education and ‘Catch them Young’ approach can be used to cultivate scientific research skills among school children and motivate them to develop interest in careers in space science and technology.",

These events were unrelated to volcanic eruption. We conducted case studies using airborne electromagnetic surveys to investigate the slopes likely to cause landslides on such volcanoes. The surveys were conducted by using a helicopter carrying survey instruments; this method of non-contact investigation acquires specific electrical resistance data by electromagnetic induction. Airborne electromagnetic surveys were conducted of 15 active volcanoes where volcanic events could have serious social implications. These case studies extracted data showing only roughly the areas that were at risk of collapse, but this was the first time that such data on slopes likely to cause landslides and on estimated collapse depths were obtained. It remains necessary to find a method of extracting precise data on the slopes likely to induce landslides on each volcano.\nFirst, we collected the results of the volcano surveys and categorized the properties of the collapsed slopes as cap rock type, extended collapse type, or landslide type on the basis of the topography, geological information, and specific electrical resistivity structure. Second, we investigated whether the properties of each volcano were the same as these typified ones. We also defined a collapse range based mainly on the topography and geological properties and also on the collapse depth, which was based on the specific electrical resistivity structure. We revealed that we could use the defined collapse range and depth to estimate the sediment volume of the slopes that were likely to induce landslides.\nSeveral cases, including Mt. Hokkaido Komagatake, Mt. Azuma, Mt. Asama, and Mt. Ontake, will be introduced in this presentation.",

Giant clams (T.gigas), associated with a flight of uplifted coral reef terraces on the Huon Peninsula, Papua New Guinea (PNG) along the Vitiaz Strait in the heart of the WPWP, are used in this study as highly resolved archives to investigate the intensity and frequency of ENSO events during modern, mid-Holocene and the Last Interglacial. Time-series analyses of stable oxygen and carbon isotopes at subweekly resolution, coupled with monthly resolution of AMS Δ14C determinations, has allowed documentation of hydrological changes occurring during ENSO events. Time series from modern T. gigas that overlap with instrumental rainfall and ENSO records, indicate that an El Niño event exhibits an increase of 5‰ above average in Δ14C accompanied by positive δ18O and δ13C excursions while during a La Niña event Δ14C falls 3‰ below average accompanied by negative δ18O and δ13C excursions. We show numerically that phase transitions in the three isotope proxies within the ENSO frequency band are compatible with excess seawater evaporation during severe El-Niño droughts and intensive freshwater discharge draining the Late Pleistocene coral terraces into the coastal reef environment during La-Niña wet events. The combined study of stable isotopes and Δ14C demonstrates that giant clams show high potential to serve as robust archives of seasonal and interannual hydrologic variability accompanying ENSO events. We applied modern δ18O threshold limits to fossil giant clams from the mid-Holocene (5.4 ka) and Last Interglacial (134 ka). The mid-Holocene time-series show a lower amplitude and an increased frequency of ENSO events (45 events/century) compared to the modern (38 events/century). In contrast, the Last Interglacial ENSO events were of higher intensity and frequency relative to present (45 events/century).",

            "abstract": "Bornean tropical rain forests are among the moistest biomes of the world with abundant rainfall throughout the year, and considered to be vulnerable to a change in the rainfall regime; e.g., high tree mortality was reported in such forests induced by a severe drought associated with the ENSO event in 1997-1998. In order to assess the effect (risk) of future climate change on eco-hydrology in such tropical rain forests, it is important to understand the water use of trees individually, because the vulnerability or mortality of trees against climate change can depend on the size of trees. Therefore, we refined the Spatially Explicit Individual-Based Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (SEIB-DGVM) so that the transpiration and its control by stomata are calculated for each individual tree. By using this model, we simulated the transpiration of each tree and its DBH-size dependency, and successfully reproduced the measured data of sap flow of trees and eddy covariance flux data obtained in a Bornean lowland tropical rain forest in Lambir Hills National Park, Sarawak, Malaysia.",

            "abstract": "Rapid estimation of the slip distribution for large earthquakes can assist greatly during the early phases of emergency response. These estimates can be used for rapid impact assessment and tsunami early warning. While model parameter uncertainties can be crucial for meaningful interpretation of such slip models, they are often ignored. Since the finite fault problem can be posed as a linear inverse problem (via the multiple time window method), an analytic expression for the posterior covariance matrix can be obtained, in principle. However, positivity constraints are often employed in practice, which breaks the assumption of a Gaussian posterior probability density function (PDF). To our knowledge, two solutions to this issue exist in the literature: 1) Not using positivity constraints (may lead to exotic slip patterns) or 2) to use positivity constraints but apply Bayesian sampling for the posterior. The latter is computationally expensive and currently unsuitable for rapid inversion. In this work, we explore an alternative approach in which we realize positivity by imposing a prior such that the log of each subfault scalar moment are smoothly distributed on the fault surface. This results in each scalar moment to be intrinsically non-negative while the posterior PDF can still be approximated as Gaussian. While the inversion is not linear anymore, we show that the most probable solution can be found by iterative methods which are less computationally expensive than numerical sampling of the posterior. In addition, the posterior covariance matrix (which provides uncertainties) can be estimated from the most probable solution, using an analytic expression for the Hessian of the cost function. We study this approach for both synthetic and observed W-phase data and the results suggest that a first order estimation of the uncertainty in the slip model can be obtained, therefore aiding in the interpretation of the slip distribution estimate.",

            "abstract": "A nocturnal maximum in rainfall and thunderstorm activity over the central Great Plains is widely documented, but the mechanisms for understanding the development of thunderstorms over the region at night are still not well understood. Elevated convection, defined by Colman (1990) as storms formed through ascent above frontal surfaces, is one explanation, but our study shows that many thunderstorms can initiate at night without the presence of an elevated frontal inversion or nearby surface boundary. We address the following questions: Of all the events documented, what percentage fall under this definition of elevated convection, and what percentage fall outside of that definition? How do characteristics differ among the events that fall under that definition and the events that fall outside that definition?\nThis study documents convection initiation (CI) events occurring at night over the central Great Plains from 1996 through 2014 during the months of April through July. Storm characteristics such as storm type (defined as linear, areal, or single cell), storm motion, initiation time and location, and others were documented. Once all of the cases were documented, surface data were examined to locate any nearby surface boundaries. The event’s location relative to these boundaries (if they existed) was documented. Three main modes of CI were identified: formation on a surface boundary, formation on the cold side of a surface boundary, and formation without the presence of a surface boundary. A climatology of these events will be presented. There are many differences among the different modes of CI at night. One result is that there appears to be two main peaks of CI time at night: one early at night and one later at night. The later peak is likely due to the events that form in the absence of a nearby surface boundary.",

Part of this challenge includes understanding how climate affects not only NPP, but also C allocation in different plant tissues (leaves, stem and roots) which determines the C residence time. For instance, C could be sequestered over longer time periods if changes in climate increase allocation to long-lived plant tissue (e.g. woody components) with respect to short-lived tissues (e.g. leaves).\nNetworks of eddy covariance towers like AmeriFlux provide the infrastructure necessary to study relationships between ecosystem processes and climate forcing. We ran the Community Land Model (CLM) for six temperate forests in North America (AmeriFlux sites) using different model structures for the C allocation module: i) standard carbon allocation module in CLM, which allocates C to the stem and leaves as a dynamic function of NPP and with fixed coefficients for the rest of parameters; ii) alternative C allocation module, which allocates C to the root and stem as a dynamic function of NPP and with fixed coefficients for the rest of parameters; and iii) alternative C allocation module with fixed coefficients for all the parameters. We compare C allocation patterns and climate sensitivities betwen the different model structures and available observations for the sites. We suggest some future approaches to reduce model uncertainty in the current scheme for C allocation in CLM and its climate sensitivity.",

Kokchetav metamorphic diamonds occur in dolomite marbles, gneisses, and garnet-clinopyroxene rock, and show various features of morphology and occurrence. Among these diamond-bearing rocks, dolomite marble contains the highest concentrations of microdiamond (10-20 μm across, 2700 carat/t; Yoshioka et al. 2001). The largest \"microdiamonds\" (> 100 μm across) occur in garnet-clinopyroxene (Schertl et al. 2004). Recently, the same rock type but diamond-free one was studied; this diamond-free garnet-clinopyroxene rock contains exsolved coesite-bearing titanite suggesting precursor supersilicic compositions at UHP conditions (Sakamaki & Ogasawara 2014). Garnet and clinopyroxene in both diamond-bearing and diamond-free garnet-clinopyroxene rocks contain significant amounts of water (3000 ppm wt. H2O at average) as structural OH and submicron-sized H2O-fluid inclusions. The host garnet and clinopyroxene of diamond were grown under H2O-rich environments (AGU Fall Meeting 2014 abstract, #V13B-4775).\nCubic diamond grains (approximately 100 μm across) chemically separated from diamond-bearing garnet-clinopyroxene rock was used in this study. Micro-FTIR analyses were conducted using a KBr pellet as an IR transparent window in N2 gas atmosphere. The IR spectra shows CO32- bands at 1455 cm-1 (weak), broad H2O bands at 3428 cm-1 (strong), and sharp OH bands at 3555 cm-1 (strong) were identified. These bands are assigned to H2O-fluid inclusions, aragonite, and a hydrous silicate mineral (probably phengite), respectively. These bands are similar to those in De Corte et al. (1998). Strong IR absorption bands by C-N bonds at 1282 cm-1 (A center, very strong), 1180 cm-1 (B center, very weak), and 1133 cm-1 (C center, weak) are also detected.\nH2O-fluid inclusions of the diamond examined in this study indicate that the diamond was crystallized in H2O-rich environments while its host minerals were formed.",

We design a type of hidden Markov models (HMMs) to investigate this phenomenon, where each state represents a distinct segment of tremor sources. We systematically analyze the tremor data from the Tokai region in southwest Japan using this model and find that tremors in this region concentrate around several distinct centers. We find: (1) The system is classified into three classes, background (quiescent), quasi-quiescent, and active states; (2) The region can be separated into two subsystems, the southwest and northeast parts, with most of the active transitions being among the states in each subsystem and the other transitions mainly to the quiescent/quasi-quiescent states; and (3) Tremor activity lasts longer in the northeastern part than in the southwest part. The success of this analysis indicates the power of HMMs in revealing the underlying physical process that drives non-volcanic tremors.\nFigure： The migration pattern for the HMM with 8 states.

            "abstract": "Friction coefficients along faults control the brittle strength of the earth's upper crust, although it is difficult to estimate them especially of ancient geological faults. Several previous studies tried to determine the friction coefficient of meso-scale faults from their orientation distribution as follows. Fault-slip analysis through stress tensor inversion techniques gives principal stress axes and a stress ratio, which allows us to draw a normalized Mohr’s circle. Assuming that a faulting occurs when the ratio of shear stress to normal stress on it, i.e., the slip tendency, exceeds the friction coefficient, one can find a linear boundary of distribution of points corresponding to faults on Mohr diagram. The slope of the boundary (friction envelope) provides the friction coefficient. This method has a difficulty in graphically and manually recognizing the linear boundary of distribution on the Mohr diagram. This study automated the determination of friction coefficient by considering the fluctuations of fluid pressure and differential stress. These unknown factors are expected to make difference in density of points representing faults on the Mohr diagram. Since the density is controlled by the friction coefficient, we can optimize the friction coefficient so as to explain the density distribution.\nThe method was applied to two examples of natural meso-scale faults. The first example is from the Pleistocene Kazusa Group, central Japan, which filled a forearc basin of the Sagami Trough. Stress inversion analysis showed WNW-ENE trending tensional stress with a low stress ratio. The friction coefficient was determined to be around 0.66, which is typical value for sandstone. The Second example is from an underplated tectonic mélange in the Cretaceous to Paleogene Shimanto accretionary complex in southwest Japan along the Nankai Trough. The stress condition was determined to be an axial compression perpendicular to the foliation of shale matrix. The friction coefficient was about 0.23, which is extremely low indicating a weak plate boundary under the accretionary wedge.",

            "abstract": "Powerful numerical codes that are capable of modeling complex coupled processes of physics and chemistry have been developed for predicting the fate of CO2 in reservoirs as well as its potential impacts on groundwater and subsurface environments. However, they are often computationally demanding for solving highly non-linear models in sufficient spatial and temporal resolutions. Geological heterogeneity and uncertainties further increase the challenges in modeling works. Two-phase flow simulations in heterogeneous media usually require much longer computational time than that in homogeneous media. Uncertainties in reservoir properties may necessitate stochastic simulations with multiple realizations. Recently, massively parallel supercomputers with more than thousands of processors become available in scientific and engineering communities. Such supercomputers may attract attentions from geoscientist and reservoir engineers for solving the large and non-linear models in higher resolutions within a reasonable time. However, for making it a useful tool, it is essential to tackle several practical obstacles to utilize large number of processors effectively for general-purpose reservoir simulators. We have implemented massively-parallel versions of two TOUGH2 family codes (a multi-phase flow simulator TOUGH2 and a chemically reactive transport simulator TOUGHREACT) on two different types (vector- and scalar-type) of supercomputers with a thousand to tens of thousands of processors. After completing implementation and extensive tune-up on the supercomputers, the computational performance was measured for three simulations with multi-million grid models, including a simulation of the dissolution-diffusion-convection process that requires high spatial and temporal resolutions to simulate the growth of small convective fingers of CO2-dissolved water to larger ones in a reservoir scale. The performance measurement confirmed that the both simulators exhibit excellent scalabilities showing almost linear speedup against number of processors up to over ten thousand cores. Generally this allows us to perform coupled multi-physics (THC) simulations on high resolution geologic models with multi-million grid in a practical time (e.g., less than a second per time step).",

The challenge in quantifying aerosol direct radiative forcing and aerosol-cloud interactions arises from large spatial and temporal heterogeneity of aerosol concentrations, compositions, sizes, shape and optical properties (IPCC, 2007). Lidar offers some remarkable advantages for determining the vertical structure of atmospheric aerosols and their related optical properties.\nTo investigate the characterization of atmospheric aerosols (especially bioaerosols) with high spatial and temporal resolution, we developed a Raman/fluorescence/polarization lidar system employed a multi-channel spectrometer, with capabilities of providing measurements of Raman scattering and laser-induced fluorescence excitation at 355 nm from atmospheric aerosols. Meanwhile, the lidar system operated polarization measurements both at 355nm and 532nm wavelengths, aiming to obtain more information of aerosols. It employs a high power pulsed laser and a received telescope with 350mm diameter. The receiver could simultaneously detect a wide fluorescent spectrum about 178 nm with spectral resolution 5.7 nm, mainly including an F/3.7 Crossed Czerny-Turner spectrograph, a grating (1200 gr/mm) and a PMT array with 32 photocathode elements.\nVertical structure of fluorescent aerosols in the atmosphere was observed by the developed lidar system at four sites across northwest China, during 2014 spring field observation that conducted by Lanzhou University. It has been proved that the developed lidar could detect the fluorescent aerosols with high temporal and spatial resolutions. And preliminarily results showed that strong fluorescence signals were observed from air pollutants and dust particles. Detailed analysis, combined lidar observation and in-situ measurements, will be introduced at the meeting.",

Questions surrounding a unique 10 mg/L sulfate standard for wild rice (Zizania sp.) waters in Minnesota are driving research to clarify conditions controlling the geochemistry of shallow sediment porewater in stream- and lake-beds. This issue raises the need and opportunity to carry out in-depth, process-based analysis into how water fluxes and coupled C, S, and Fe redox cycles interact to impact aquatic plants. Our study builds on a recent state-wide field campaign that showed that accumulation of porewater sulfide from sulfate reduction impairs wild rice, an annual grass that grows in shallow lakes and streams in the Great Lakes region of North America. Negative porewater sulfide correlations with organic C and Fe quantities also indicated that lower redox rates and greater mineral precipitation attenuate sulfide. Here, we focus on a stream in northern Minnesota that receives high sulfate loading from iron mining activity yet maintains wild rice stands. In addition to organic C and Fe effects, we evaluate the degree to which streambed hydrology, and in particular groundwater contributions, accounts for the active biogeochemistry. We collect field measurements, spanning the surrounding groundwater system to the stream, to constrain a reactive-transport model. Observations from seepage meters, temperature probes, and monitoring wells delineate upward flow that may lessen surface water impacts below the stream. Geochemical analyses of groundwater, porewater, and surface water samples and of sediment extractions reveal distinctions among the different domains and stream banks, which appear to jointly control conditions in the streambed. A model based on field conditions can be used to evaluate the relative the importance and the spatiotemporal scales of diverse flux and geochemical factors affecting aquatic root zones.",

            "abstract": "Plants adapt or acclimate to changing environments in part by allocating biomass to roots and leaves to strike a balance between water and nutrient uptake requirements on the one hand and growth and hydraulic safety on the other hand. In a recent study examining experimental drought with the TREES model, which couples plant ecophysiology with rhizosphere-and-xylem hydraulics, we hypothesized that the asynchronous nature of soil water availability and xylem repair supported root-to-leaf area (RLA) proportionality that favored long-term survival over short-term carbon gain or water use. To investigate this as a possible general principal of plant adjustment to changing environmental conditions, TREES was modified to allocate carbon to fine and coarse roots organized in ten orders differing in biomass allocated per unit absorbing root area, root lifespan, and total absorbing root area in each of several soil-root zones with depth. The expanded model allowed for adjustment of absorbing root area and rhizosphere volume based on available carbohydrate production and nitrogen (N) availability, resulting in dynamic expansion and contraction of the supply-side of the rhizosphere-plant hydraulics and N uptake capacity in response to changing environmental conditions and plant-environment asynchrony. The study was conducted partly in a controlled experimental setting with six genotypes of a widely grown crop species, Brassica rapa. The implications for forests were investigated in controlled experiments and at Fluxnet sites representing temperate mixed forests, semi-arid evergreen needle-leaf, and Mediterranean biomes. The results showed that the effects of N deficiency on total plant growth was modulated by a relative increase in fine root biomass representing a larger absorbing root volume per unit biomass invested. We found that the total absorbing root area per unit leaf area was consistently lower than that needed to maximize short-term water uptake and carbohydrate gain. Moreover, the acclimated RLA fell within a small range for both crops and trees despite changing environmental conditions, demonstrating an adaptation that was consistent with empiricism on fine roots and thus pointing to a fundamental connection between ecological and hydrological processes.",

Some recent studies have pointed out that coronal streamers may be important on the generation of type II bursts and the morphology of radio dynamic spectra. In our previous study, it was found that closed field of the streamer can play the role of an electron trap via which electrons would receive multiple reflection and acceleration. We further developed a numerical model consisting of a spherical coronal shock moving through a large-scale streamer-like coronal magnetic field. The complex local shock geometry should affect both the efficiency of electron acceleration and properties of accelerated electrons. By examining the injection and escape locations of energetic electrons, it is found that shock electron acceleration is most efficient mainly in two different regions, one is at the shock flank (foreshock regions) when the shock is at lower altitude, the other is at the shock nose (apexes of closed loops) at higher altitude. The effects of large-scale coronal field, pitch-angle scattering and shock compression ratio on the distribution of energetic electrons and electron energy spectrum are also investigated.",

            "abstract": "Atmospheric oxidation capacity mainly maintained by OH determines the fates of the most of reactive gases. The high reactivity of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs; VOCs from vegetation) had us expect depleted OH in the pristine forested environments with minimal OH recycling due to low NO. However, field observations have consistently reported unaccountably high OH levels in high BVOC (particularly isoprene) and low NO environments. At the same time, large unaccounted OH reactivity (s-1, a reciprocal of OH lifetime) also has been reported in the similar environments. These two findings are seemingly irreconcilable since unknown/unmeasured reactive VOCs in the unpolluted forest region would deplete OH unless there are OH recycling processes without the NO mediation. Therefore, the discussion on unknown/unclear OH recycling processes mediated by VOC oxidation processes and unaccounted reactive VOCs in the forest environments should be integrated to postulate sounds explanations that can address observed discrepancies in the both fronts. In this context, we will present our recently conducted OH reactivity and OH observations during the SOAS (Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study) and evaluate the outstanding hypotheses by comparing with box-model calculated OH and OH reactivity based on each hypothesis with the observed results. In addition, we will discuss uncertainties in calculated OH reactivity estimations from any systematic bias among the analytical techniques.",

As new technology changes the ways in which we scientifically examine the Earth, and as workforce development demands evolve, there is growing interest in introducing these new technologies into field education courses. In collaboration with field education instructors, UNAVCO, the National Science Foundation’s geodetic facility, has developed a module of teaching resources to integrate terrestrial lidar scanning into field courses. An NSF facility is well positioned to develop scalable resources that can then be distributed or adapted for broader implementation. The modules can also be accomplished using Structure from Motion methods in place of lidar scanning. Modules goals are for students to be able to: (A) design and conduct a complex TLS survey to address a geologic research question and (B) articulate the societal impetus for answering these research questions and identify why TLS is the appropriate method in some circumstances. The module is comprised of five units: (1) Introduction to survey design, (2) Stratigraphic section analysis, (3) Fault scarp analysis, (4) Geomorphic change detection, (5) Student-led survey design summative assessment. The modules, apart from the Introduction, are independent, thus select modules can be employed in a given field setting. Prototype module materials were developed from the last five years of UNAVCO support of undergraduate field courses. The current versions of the modules were tested in summer 2015 at the Indiana University and University of Michigan field camps. Results show that the majority of students are able to achieve the intended learning goals. Module materials are available on the UNAVCO Education and Community Engagement website.",

Secondly, a large value of LWA directly implies an instantaneous local deceleration of zonal wind in the conservative limit.\nWe will present the climatology of LWA computed from the QGPV on the tropopause level (240hPa) obtained from ERA-Interim reanalysis data. With additional criteria in temporal- and spatial- coherences, we define a blocking index based on LWA and compare our results with the statistics obtained from existing blocking indices (e.g. Tyrlis and Hoskins (2008), Barnes et al (2012)).

In the United States, about 30 billion dollars losses is caused by drought in 2012, resulting in widespread economic impacts for societies, industries, agriculture, and recreation. And in California, the drought cost statewide economic losses about 2.2 billion, with a total loss of 17,100 seasonal and part-time jobs. Driven by a variety of factors including climate change, population growth, increased water demands, alteration to land cover, drought occurs widely all over the world.\nDrought economic consequence assessment tool are greatly needed to allow decision makers and stakeholders to anticipate and manage effectively. In this study, current drought economic impact modeling methods were reviewed. Most of these models only deal with the impact in the agricultural sector with a focus on a single basin; few of these models analyze long term impact. However, drought impacts are rarely restricted to basin boundaries, and cascading economic impacts are likely to be significant. A holistic approach to multi-basin, multi-sector drought economic impact assessment is needed.\nIn this work, we developed a new model for drought economic impact assessment, Drought Economic Impact Model in Python (PyDEM). This model classified all business establishments into thirteen categories based on NAICS, and using a continuous dynamic social accounting matrix approach, coupled with calculation of the indirect consequences for the local and regional economies and the various resilience. In addition, Environmental Policy Integrated Climate model was combined for analyzing drought caused soil erosion together with agriculture production, and then the long term impacts of drought were achieved. A visible output of this model was presented in GIS. In this presentation, Choctawhatchee-Pea-Yellow River Basins, Alabama was chosen as study area, and further application of PyDEM was discussed.",

            "abstract": "Southeast Asia is rich in tropical forest and biodiversity. Previous inversion studies show large inter-annual variability in the biosphere-atmosphere carbon exchange attributable to climate anomalies. However, the magnitudes of estimated fluxes are significantly different among the inversions. On the other hand, land-use change has been accelerating the anthropogenic emissions. For the sustainable development in Southeast Asia under the on-going climate change, it is important to understand the biosphere-atmosphere carbon exchange and access the regional emissions. One of the reasons for the large uncertainty in flux estimate is a limited coverage of atmospheric observation against the large variety of ecosystems and the geographical complexity. Recently, the number of measurements has been increasing, including ground-based and satellite-based measurements. We estimated the regional CO2fluxes using a Eulerian-Lagrangian inverse modeling system and examined the characteristics of observational constraints and their impacts on the flux estimate in Southeast Asia.\nThe results show that the temporal variations and source/sink strength of estimated regional fluxes are sensitive to the observational constraints. As a control run, we used the Observational Package (ObsPack) data product since 2001 as a global dataset of atmospheric CO2 measurement. In the addition to Bukit, Sumatra Island (BKT) in ObsPack, we included a stationary CO2 data at Danum Valley in Borneo Island (DMV) since late 2009. Compared to BKT, DMV shows a clear seasonal cycle. The inversion including DMV tends to increase the regional carbon sink in the second half of year. Remotely the aircraft measurements over Rarotonga (RTA) in the tropical Pacific Ocean see the signals from Southeast Asia through an atmospheric convection. The sensitivity test shows RTA impacts on the inter-annual variations of estimated flux, which might be associated with ENSO events. Since June 2009, Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) has been providing the global column-averaged CO2 fraction (XCO2) data. Though GOSAT observations available over Southeast Asia are sparse due to the cloudy weather conditions, the large-scale spatial gradients of GOSAT XCO2 are influential to the source/sink strengths in the region.",

            "abstract": "For administrative district, the Chiu-Fen landslide is situated at northern Taiwan and comes within the jurisdiction of Ruei-Fang district, New Taipei City Government. Chiu-Fen village is a famous spot for sightseeing and tourism in Southeast Asia. In the last decade, for economic purpose, a vast area of slope land in Chiu-Fen area was reclaimed into business and commercial districts. However, due to the complicated geological and hydrological conditions, improper reclamation, and lack of appropriate soil and water conservation facilities, large scale landslides are frequently triggered by typhoon rainfall and causes damages to the transportation and residential building in the community. As a consequence, the government initiated a comprehensive field investigations and remediation plans to stabilize the landslide from 1997 and the remediation works were concentrated on subsurface drainages, namely the application of drainage well (a vertical shaft with multi-level horizontal drainage boreholes). To investigate the efficiency of drainage wells on the landslide, the A1-profile in the landslide which covers the drainage wells W2 and W4 was selected for a series of rainfall seepage and slope stability analyses. In addition, a 48-hrs design rainfall with return period of 25, 50 and 100 years based on the local meteorological data bank was adopted for the analyses. The numerical results indicate the factor safety FS of the three potential sliding surfaces within A1-profile are constantly keeping greater than one (FS > 1.0) and without decreasing with the elapsed time during rainfall. This implies that the subsurface drainage works can drain off the infiltrated rainwater from a high intensity and long duration rainfall and preserve the slope stability of landslides from deterioration. Finally, the efficiency of the drainage wells can be evaluated quantitatively in terms of the time-dependent factor of safety and the pore water pressure distribution on several potential sliding surfaces.",

This second framework promotes long-term permanence of the reef, favoring the establishment of macro-reef builders, including corals.

Although prokaryotes are not proper calcifiers, carbonate precipitation can be induced by their metabolic activity and EPS production. Coral reefs are rapidly declining due to several variables associated to environmental change. Specifically in the Caribbean, stony coral Acropora palmata have suffered damage due to diseases, bleaching and storms. Some reports show that in highly disturbed areas wide ridges of reef rubbles are formed by biological and physical lithification. In this study we explore microbial diversity associated to lithified rubbles left after the great decline of reef-building A. palmata.",

This phenomena is called Medium Scale Traveling Ionosphiric Disturbance; MSTID. MSTID has been observed by GPS receiving network, and its characteristic were studied. In the past, MSTID was thought to be generated by the Perkins instability, but its growth ratio was too small to be effective so far smaller than the real. Recently coupling process between ionospheric E and F regions are studied by using two radars and by computer simulations. Through these studies, we now have hypothesis that MSTID is generated by the combination of E-F region coupling and Perkins instability.\nThe S-520-27 sounding rocket experiment on E-layer and F-layer was planned in order to verify this hypothesis. S-520-27 sounding rocket was launched at 23:57 JST on 20th July, 2013 from JAXA Uchinoura Space Center. S-520-27 sounding rocket reached 316km height. The S-520-27 payload was equipped with Electric Field Detector (EFD) with a two set of orthogonal double probes to measure DC electric field in the spin plane of the payload. The electrodes of two double probe antennas were used to gather the potentials which were detected with high impedance pre-amplifier using the floating (unbiased) double probe technique. As a results of measurements of DC electric fields by the EFD, the natural electric field was about +/-5mV/m, and varied the direction from southeast to east. Then the electric field was mapped to the horizontal plane at 280km height along the geomagnetic field line.\nIn this presentation, we show the detail result of DC electric field measurement by S-520-27 sounding rocket and then we discuss about the correlation between the natural electric field and TEC variation by using the GPS-TEC.",

            "abstract": "The Van Allen Probes are contributing significantly to the understanding of processes effecting Earth’s radiation belts. It has been noted that the earthward extent of the outer zone highly-relativistic electrons encounters a nearly impenetrable barrier at a radial distance (L) near 2.8 RE inside of which they are not observed. Modeling suggests that this is the result of a balance between slow inward diffusion and hiss-induced precipitation.\nThe large storm of 17 March 2015 afforded an excellent opportunity to investigate the impenetrable barrier using the full complement of sensors carried by the Van Allen Probes. The storm was marked by the rapid reappearance of strong fluxes of MeV electrons directly outside the barrier with the formation of very steep MeV flux gradients. In spite of the strong rapid recovery of MeV electron fluxes immediately outside the barrier, the sharpness and constancy of the gradient at the barrier is strongly suggestive of a previously unrecognized fast-acting and spatially localized mechanism responsible for the formation of such a well-defined feature during these dramatic circumstances.\nThe Van Allen Probes regularly observe a magnetically confined bubble of VLF emissions of terrestrial origin filling the inner magnetosphere. Strongest signals are from US Navy VLF transmitters used for one-way communication to submarines. These signals largely are confined to the region of L space where their frequency is < ½ fce. The strong signal from station NAA at 24 kHz is confined to L < 2.8 where it encounters the ½ fce limit. During the event, the flux of MeV electrons decreased by 1000x across 0.5 RE outside L = 2.8 simultaneous with a 6 order of magnitude increase in the VLF wave intensity as the Probes entered the VLF bubble.\nThe VLF transmitter frequencies are amplified at the point where they overlap natural chorus band near ½ fce suggestive of transmitter-induced triggered emissions. MeV radiation belt electrons encounter this greatly increased 25 kHz wave power of anthropogenic origin nearly continuously at the location of impenetrable barrier. We suggest that interactions of these amplified transmitter signals with the MeV electrons accelerate their scattering into the drift loss cone such that an impenetrable barrier to further inward penetration is created.",

Since tides are mainly excited in the lower atmosphere, it is necessary to understand the tidal characteristics in these altitude regions. Of all tidal components, this study focuses on the non-Sun-synchronous components, i.e., nonmigrating tides.\nSakazaki et al. (2015, J.G.R.) extracted nonmigrating tides using a composite as a function of universal time in physical space, without performing a zonal wave-number decomposition. With this method, it was demonstrated that tropical nonmigrating tides from the troposphere to the lower mesosphere were regarded as gravity waves excited by diabatic heating enhanced over two major continents, specifically Africa and South America.\nThe present study discovered that as well the above mentioned gravity-wave patterns, zonally uniform tidal signals are clearly seen in the tropical middle atmosphere particularly during the Northern Hemisphere summer, by using data from climate chemistry models (CCMs), reanalyses, and satellite measurements (SABER and GPS-RO). Antisymmetric components with respect to the equator are dominant and are characterized by a vertical wavelength of ~15 km and a diurnal frequency. The observed latitudinal and vertical structures can be explained by the second, propagating, antisymmetric Hough mode.",

In this study, we examine the relationships between convection and the circulation fields for different scales. We use cloud resolving model simulations of tropical convective systems from the ARM TWP-ICE field experiment to create domain averages representing different spatial scales. We find that some convective parameterization closures fare better than others in representing the relationships between convection and the circulation fields.

In this study, atmospheric precipitable water (PW) from the NCEP/NCAR, NCEP/DOE, MERRA, JRA-55, JRA-25, ERA-Interim, ERA-40, CFSR and 20CR reanalyses is evaluated against homogenized radiosonde observations over China during 1979-2012 (1979-2001 for ERA-40). Results suggest that the PW biases in the reanalyses are within ∼20% for most of northern and eastern China, but the reanalyses underestimate the observed PW by 20%–40% over western China, and by ∼60% over the southwestern Tibetan Plateau. The newer-generation reanalyses (e.g., JRA25, JRA55, CFSR and ERA-Interim) have smaller root-mean-square error (RMSE) than the older-generation ones (NCEP/NCAR, NCEP/DOE and ERA-40). Most of the reanalyses reproduce well the observed PW climatology and interannual variations over China. However, few reanalyses capture the observed long-term PW changes, primarily because they show spurious wet biases before about 2002. This deficiency results mainly from the discontinuities contained in reanalysis RH fields in the mid-lower troposphere due to the wet bias in older radiosonde records that are assimilated into the reanalyses. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis revealed two leading modes that represent the long-term PW changes and ENSO-related interannual variations with robust spatial patterns. The reanalysis products, especially the MERRA and JRA-25, roughly capture these EOF modes, which account for over 50% of the total variance. The results show that even during the post-1979 satellite era, discontinuities in radiosonde data can still induce large spurious long-term changes in reanalysis PW and other related fields. Thus, more efforts are needed to remove spurious changes in input data for future long-term reanlayses.",

Waste cement is a good source for aqueous carbonation because it is rich in calcium. Therefore, this study was performed to develop the aqueous carbonation method for waste cement powder. Cement paste was made with water/cement ratio of 6:4 and cured for 28 days in water bath. The cement paste was pulverized into a fine powder sizing less than 0.15 mm. To study effect of additives and pH on the formation of carbonate minerals, aqueous carbonation experiments were conducted. The mineral compositions and morphology of carbonate mineral were identified by XRD and SEM/EDS analysis.\n1.0 M NaCl and 0.25 M MgCl2 were applied as additives. Aqueous carbonation experiment was conducted with injecting pure CO2 gas (99.9%) to a reactor containing 200 ㎖ of reacting solution. The pH of reacting solution was controled to determine formational condition of carbonate minerals. In 0.25 M MgCl2 solution, calcite was dominant mineral at high pH. More aragonite, however, formed as decreasing pH of solution with injection of CO2. The presence of Mg2+ in solution makes aragonite more dominant than calcite. Aragonite was mainly formed at the high pH of solution with 1.0 M NaCl additive, whereas calcite was more preponderant mineral than aragonite as falling pH. It show that unstable aragonite transformed to calcite as decreasing pH. In no additive solution, vaterite was dominantly formed at the initial stage of experiement, but unstable vaterite transformed to well crystallized calcite with further carbonation.",

            "abstract": "The 2013 Mw 7.2 Bohol earthquake is considered, historically, the strongest to hit the island of Bohol. It is also very significant because it is associated with a previously unmapped fault and because there is a rarity in documented ground rupture associated with earthquakes generated by reverse faulting mechanism in the Philippines. The tentatively 6 km-long ground rupture, now known as the North Bohol Fault (NBF), is situated on the northern sector of the island. The NBF, which trends N40°-60°E and dips approximately 45°SE, is a reverse fault which is is aligned to the ENE-trending foothills in the municipalities of Inabanga and Buenavista, Bohol. The geometry and kinematics of the NBF was examined through documentation of fault trace patterns, analysis of along-strike variations in scarp morphologies and heights, and through observations of fault characteristics from natural exposures. Paleoseismic trenching in Inabanga reveals that at least three large-magnitude earthquakes occurred in the past ~12,000 years. The long return period seems to be consistent with the subtleness of the pre-existing morphotectonic features that are associated with the 2013 ground rupture. Transects constructed from onshore structural readings and analysis of offshore seismic reflection profiles reveal the structural setting of the island and the possible relation of pre-existing offshore fault-fold structures in the western portion of Bohol Island to the still-unmapped SW extent of the NBF. The long return period for earthquakes can be explained by accommodation of slip in the Visayan Sea Basin partially along NE-SW trending folds in Bohol. Several other possibilities are also discussed to explain why the earthquake return period could be even shorter than estimated. Lastly, this study emphasizes the importance of using a wide-array of methods in mapping of tectonic structures to the effective evaluation of seismic hazards in the region.",

            "abstract": "In California and other regions with Mediterranean climates, losing rivers are common and can introduce dynamic feedbacks affecting total transport of infiltration and nutrients, as well as unsaturated zone formation. Permeability decline from hyporheic zone bioclogging is one such feedback mechanism that is thought to highly depend on the initial grain size distribution during each seasonal cycle. Variability from the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) can influence the initial grain size distribution demonstrating a large scale climate-control on biogeochemical fluxes. To address these questions, we simulated biological growth and carbon dynamics using 1D and 2D MIN3P numerical models, allowing a range of initial grains size distributions to represent ENSO control of riverbed scour. We quantified microbial growth and total carbon and infiltration fluxes. Our results showed that infiltration declines due to bioclogging were greatest in higher permeability sediments (typical of El Niño with greater probability of bankfull discharge). However, in these higher permeability sediments, cumulative carbon fluxes and infiltration volumes were lower than more drought-like, La Niña conditions (less probability of riverbed scour). Additionally, we found the initial sediment grain size distribution exerted strong control on the location of the bioclogging hotspot when an unsaturated zone developed. Our results demonstrate a flow and nutrient transport feedback mechanism where bioclogging and carbon cycling become limited from ENSO controlled initial conditions. These results provide a new understanding of nutrient cycling and hotspot bioclogging in losing rivers worldwide.",

In this presentation, we demonstrate that despite markedly variable space-time structure of precipitation processes, there are a few elementary microwave spectral atoms that can be learned and exploited for compact and sparse retrieval of rainfall profiles from their spectral signatures in microwave bands between 10-183 GHz. For different land surface radiation regimes, these atoms are encoded via supervised learning of two discriminative dictionaries from a large set of wet and dry spectral signatures obtained from coincident measurements of precipitation radar and radiometer on board the Global Precipitation Measuring (GPM) satellite. A new Bayesian rainfall retrieval algorithm is presented to detect and reconstruct the precipitation profiles using linear combinations of sparse groups of the microwave spectral dictionary atoms.",

A recent fully kinetic study found the average reconnection rate to decrease steeply with system-size, but no explanation was given and it remained unclear whether such results can be reproduced in two-fluid models such as Hall-MHD. Here we show that Hall-MHD is unable to reproduce the equivalent fully kinetic results, and that ion kinetic physics is necessary to describe the peak and average rates, pile-up field, outflow velocity, and global evolution of the system. This work suggests the importance of approximating such kinetic ion physics in global simulation models, in order to properly model reconnection events.",

            "abstract": "The existence of a mid-lithospheric discontinuity (MLD) within the stable continental mantle lithosphere of North America has been well established, but its interpretation remains difficult. Recent work with Ps receiver functions has found evidence for anisotropic structure at MLD depths within the western portion of the Granite-Rhyolite Province, suggesting that the MLD is the result of deformation associated with the formation of the continent. The last significant deformation to occur within the province was approximately 1.3-0.9 Ga and impacted the lithosphere east of the Grenville Front. In this study we analyzed six stations east of the front using Ps receiver functions in order to characterize anisotropy associated with the MLD in the region.\nTransverse and radial component Ps receiver functions were calculated for six stations (ACSO, BINY, ERPA, MCWV, SSPA, TZTN) using a multi-taper correlation technique and binned as a function of back azimuth and of epicentral distance. All six stations analyzed displayed significant positive phase energy on the radial component at ~6 seconds, which was interpreted as the Moho. At four of the six stations (ACSO, MCWV, SSPA, TZTN) the Moho showed moderate to significant complexity. At stations MCWV, SSPA, TZTN, all located along the Appalachian margin, there was significant transverse component energy at crustal depths with both two- and four-lobed anisotropy patterns observed. While ACSO, BINY, and ERPA displayed evidence of isotropic and/ or anisotropic crustal structure, a coherent pattern in back azimuth could not be established.\nThe radial component receiver functions also exhibited negative phase energy, interpreted as the MLD, between 7.5 and 12.5 seconds (or ~80 to 120 km), at five of the six stations, with the exception of BINY, where no negative phase was observed. The transverse component receiver functions at stations ACSO, ERPA, SSPA and TZTN, also displayed a two-lobed pattern in back azimuth at MLD depths, as did BINY, despite the dearth of negative phase energy on the radial component. In general, the transverse component results are considerably different from the earlier work done west of the Grenville Front, suggesting that anisotropic structure varies laterally within the mantle lithosphere and may have been modified by the Grenville deformation event.",

            "abstract": "Geothermal energy technologies use the constant heat flux from the subsurface in order to produce heat or electricity for societal use. As such, a geothermal energy system is not inherently variable, like systems based on wind and solar resources, and an operator can conceivably control the rate at which heat is extracted and used directly, or converted into a commodity that is used. Although geothermal heat is a renewable resource, this heat can be depleted over time if the rate of heat extraction exceeds the natural rate of renewal (Rybach, 2003). For heat extraction used for commodities that are sold on the market, sustainability entails balancing the rate at which the reservoir renews with the rate at which heat is extracted and converted into profit, on a net present value basis.\nWe present a model that couples natural resource economic approaches for managing renewable resources with simulations of geothermal reservoir performance in order to develop an optimal heat mining strategy that balances economic gain with the performance and renewability of the reservoir. Similar optimal control approaches have been extensively studied for renewable natural resource management of fisheries and forests (Bonfil, 2005; Gordon, 1954; Weitzman, 2003). Those models determine an optimal path of extraction of fish or timber, by balancing the regeneration of stocks of fish or timber that are not harvested with the profit from the sale of the fish or timber that is harvested. Our model balances the regeneration of reservoir temperature with the net proceeds from extracting heat and converting it to electricity that is sold to consumers. We used the Non-isothermal Unconfined-confined Flow and Transport (NUFT) model (Hao, Sun, & Nitao, 2011) to simulate the performance of a sedimentary geothermal reservoir under a variety of geologic and operational situations. The results of NUFT are incorporated into the natural resource economics model to determine production strategies that maximize net present value given the performance of the geothermal resource.",

Here, we applied a temperature-index distributed mass-balance model coupled with a volume-area scaling method to Xiao Dongkemadi Glacier (XDG) in the central TP, to assess its response to climate change. The result shows the simulated mass balance is in a good agreement with observations (R2=0.75, p<0.001) during the period of 1989-2012. The simulated mean annual mass balance (-213 mm w.e.) is close to the observation (-233 mm w.e.), indicating the model can be used to estimate the glacier variation in the future. Then the model was forced by the output of RegCM4 under the climate scenarios RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 from 2013 to 2050. The simulated terminus elevation of the glacier will rise from 5454m a.s.l. in 2013 to 5533m a.s.l. (RCP4.5) and 5543m a.s.l (RCP8.5) in 2050. XDG will lose its volume with an increasing rate of 600-700m3 a-1 during the period of 1989-2050, indicating the melting water will enhance the river runoff. But for the long term, the contribution to the river runoff will decrease for shrinkage of glacier scale.",

As ground elevations of these atolls rarely exceed a few meters above mean sea level, atoll communities must rely precariously on finite resources, including fresh water and land. When demand for water exceeds precipitation rates, fresh groundwater may provide an additional, albeit also limited resource. The shape and size of this freshwater lens is controlled by precipitation, infiltration, discharge, and groundwater pumping, as well as hydrogeologic characteristics of the aquifer, and climate.\nSmall atoll islands like Roi Namur on Kwajalein perhaps best illustrate the strong interdependence of the islet’s depositional history and geochemical transformations that occur within the shallow aquifer and its host rock. This study utilized electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) to define the position of the freshwater lens above underlying seawater and to examine scales of freshwater /saltwater mixing. Time series Rn-222 measurements were used to evaluate groundwater discharge rates to the coastal waters, and a suite of groundwater geochemical tracers, including select nutrients, trace elements, and water isotopes, were used to develop a better understanding of how the fresh water lens will likely to respond to external perturbations, such as managed recharge, and the inevitability of future marine over wash events that will be become more frequent and severe under expected sea level rise.",

We simulate flow and reactive transport in a recently characterized sample of Massillon sandstone to provide Eulerian test data for comparison with the new Lagrangian lamella-based solution. In our numerical experiments particle tracking is used to approximate the lamellar positions and deformations at any given time, and reactions are calculated on each lamella in proportion to the local scalar dissipation rate. The simulated data show the effect of small scale heterogeneity including strong shearing and local collapse or coalescence (Figure 1, right panel) of the reaction front on the global reaction rate.

            "abstract": "The rupture characteristics of subduction and collision zone earthquakes are known to be controlled by the chemical and thermal boundaries of the plate interface, and structural features such as subducting seamount and fracture zones. In this picture, the role of fault morphology in controlling rupture dimensions remains poorly understood. Here, we present a striking example of how morphological structure regulated the blind 2015 Mw 7.8 Gorkha earthquake sequence in Nepal.\nTo unravel where exactly the slip occurred, we reconstructed the plate interface of the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT). The MHT is composed of the steep Main Front Thrust (MFT), followed by two shallow decollements separated by a ramp, and ends with another steep fault reaching ~30 km depth.\nBased on our newly reconstructed fault geometry, we invert the slip of the earthquake sequence through a combination of multi-track InSAR and GPS data. We find that the slip was distributed on the second shallow decollement, had an elongated shape, and was clearly confined by the ramp. Our along-strike slip extent matches that of the Kathmandu klippe, indicating that fault morphology segments the slip along both strike and dip. This confinement of the rupture area limited the size of the earthquake. Our results indicate that fault morphology can control the size of megathrust ruptures, and thus can provide important information for seismic hazard analyses.",

Remote sensing offers a feasible tool for monitoring spatio-temporal patterns of crop phenology in region and continental scales. Various methods have developed to determine the timing of crop phenological stages using spectral vegetation indices (i.e. NDVI and EVI) derived from satellite data. In our study, it was compared four alternative detection methods to identify crop phenological stages (i.e. the emergence and harvesting date) using high quality NDVI time series data derived from MODIS. In threshold method assumes the emergence and harvesting date when NDVI values exceed and decreases down to a given threshold, respectively. Two kind of threshold values were applied for NDVI and it increment for eight days. The other two methods use a logistic fitting model and inflection points on fitted curve, respectively. It was compared the four methods for corn and soybean, respectively. For validation, three kinds of datasets were utilized: AmeriFlux biological data of planting and harvest dates, and emergence date estimated from growing degree days (AGDDs) at flux tower sites, and state-level USDA Crop Progress Report (CPR). All methods showed substantial uncertainty but the threshold method showed relatively better agreement against with both site- and state-level data for soybean phenology. For better NDVI-based regional estimation of crop phenology, factors of uncertainty were examined and discussed in this study.",

            "abstract": "IODP Exp.345 drilled three main holes (Holes U1415 I, J & P) from the lowermost plutonic crust exposed at the Hess Deep Rift, East Pacific Rise and primitive layered gabbroic rocks were newly discovered from these holes (Gillis et al., 2014). One of the mysteries about the layered gabbros is the fact that Opx, which is considered to appear in the late stage of crystallization on the basis of crystallization experiments of MORB, occurs as a dominant phase in many of the layered gabbros. In this presentation, we report the occurrence of Opx from the Hole U1415P and consider the significance of Opx in the origin of the layered gabbros.\nHole U1415P (about 100m in thickness) is divided into two units, the upper Multi-textured Layered Gabbro Series (MLGS) and lower Troctolite Series (TS). Gabbroic rocks from the MLGS contain Opx (< 4 vol%) and are macroscopically classified into Opx-bearing olivine gabbro. However, these rocks are mesoscopically (on cm scale) inhomogeneous and have a great variation of mode, grain size and texture. On the other hand, TS consists of homogeneous troctolites and Opx rarely occurs in the series.\nThe occurrences of Opx from the MLGS are as follows: (i) coarse-grained Opx+Cpx+Pl vein parallel to the layered structure of the surrounding troctolite (ii) undeformed Opx+Pl veinlets in kinked Ol (iii) Opx in the concave of anhedral Ol (iv) Opx rimming Cr-spl crystals in contact with Ol. The occurrence of Opx like (ii) and (iii) resembles the texture which is considered to be formed by the reaction between mantle peridotite and a SiO2-saturated melt (e.g, Piccardo et al., 2007). The facts that Opx is often found in association with Cr-spl and Cr-spl lamellae occur in pyroxenes of the Opx+Cpx+Pl vein suggest that the SiO2-saturated melt which reacted with Ol was rich in chromium. In addition, Cr-spl crystals rimmed by Opx contain multiphase-solid inclusions. The inclusions should be key in understanding the chemical composition of the reacted melt.",

            "abstract": "The April 2015 Gorkha, Nepal (Mw 7.8) earthquake ruptured the front of Himalaya thrust belt, causing more than 9,000 fatalities. 17 days after the main event, a large aftershock (Mw 7.2) ruptured to down-dip and east of the main rupture area. To investigate the kinematic rupture process of this earthquake sequence, we explored linear and non-linear inversion techniques using a variety of datasets including teleseismic, high rate and conventional GPS, InSAR interferograms and pixel-offsets. InSAR interferograms from ALOS-2, RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1a satellites are used in the joint inversion. The main event is characterized by unilateral rupture extending along strike approximately 70 km to the southeast and 40 km along dip direction. The rupture velocity is well resolved to be lie between 2.8 and 3.0 km/s, which is consistent with back-projection results. An emergent initial phase is observed in teleseismic body wave records, which is consistent with a narrow area of rupture initiation near the hypocenter. The rupture mode of the main event is pulse like. The aftershock ruptured down-dip to the northeast of the main event rupture area. The aftershock rupture area is compact and contained within 40 km of its hypocenter. In contrast to the main event, teleseismic body wave records of the aftershock suggest an abrupt initial phase, which is consistent with a crack like rupture mode. The locations of most of the aftershocks (small and large) surround the rupture area of the main shock with little, if any, spatial overlap.",

The controls of the outside conditions, such as the solar wind conditions, the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions, and the Earth's dipole tilt angles, to these properties are particularly focused in this study. In addition, the correspondence of magnetic reconnection rate on the magnetopause to the solar wind conditions are studied statistically. Magnetic reconnection rate RMR is usually used to describe how fast magnetic reconnection proceeds or the reconnection efficiency. In the literatures, one of good agencies for reconnection rate is the plasma velocity in the reconnection inflow region VIN, or to be more accurate, the convective electric field parallel to X line in the inflow region E=VINBIN. On the magnetopause of the Earth, RMR can certainly represent the input efficiency of the IMF into the Earth's magnetosphere, if through reconnection. RMR on the magnetopause, however, is modified by the local conditions such as the magnetic fields and plasma densities on both sides of magnetopause, and thus RMR may vary on the magnetopause and the integral of RMR on the whole magnetopause is required to estimate the global efficiency of the input of IMF flux into the magnetosphere. The global input efficiency of IMF flux into the magnetosphere is estimated and its responses to the solar wind and IMF conditions are also investigated in this paper.",

            "abstract": "On Sept. 27, 2014, a phreatic eruption occurred at Ontake volcano (3067 m a.s.l.), central Japan. The eruption caused an unprecedented volcanic disaster in the last 70 years in Japan. Search and rescue operations started soon after the eruption until they were suspended due to snowfall in late October. Considering the potential hazards of further explosive events and the severe winter condition, an approach to the summit area after late October was very difficult. To reveal the condition of the volcanic activity and foresee the trend, we considered it important to carry out volcanic gas surveys for the dense plumes in the vicinity of the vents using an unmanned aircraft system (UAS).\nFor the surveys at Ontake volcano, the UAS was expected to fly about 8 km roundtrip distance at an altitude of over 3000 m. A multicopter with 8 rotors was adopted and we targeted four types of plume monitoring using the UAS; in-plume monitoring of multiple gas concentrations, SO2 flux measurement with UV spectroscopy, thermography of the vents, and in-plume particle sampling. In order to meet the 1 kg payload of the multicopter, some of the instruments were slimmed down.\nThe UAS campaigns at Ontake volcano were carried out on Nov. 20-21, 2014 and on Jun. 2, 2015 from the safety distance of 3-3.5 km away from the crater. With the UAS surveys, we revealed that the SO2/H2S ratios of volcanic gas were closer to the hydrothermal origin instead of direct magma degassing. The second survey also pointed out that the SO2 emission decreased down below 10 ton/day by June 2015, by taking an advantage of flying the vicinity of the vents before the plume was diluted. Our surveys showed decreasing activity of the volcano, together with the advantages of using UAS in volcano monitoring for inaccessible conditions.",

The observation was conducted at the T3 site in Manacapuru, Amazonas Brazil. It had been accepted almost as an axiom that very low OH is expected in low NO environments such as a pristine rain forest. However, recent studies in the pristine rain forest environments consistently reported significantly higher than expected OH levels. This sparked extensive and intensive studies to explore any possibility of OH regeneration from isoprene photo-oxidation processes in the low NO condition. Four OH regeneration processes related with isoprene photochemistry have been proposed since 2008. However, the levels of the expected OH enhancement vary greatly among the proposed OH regeneration processes mediated by the isoprene oxidation processes. As all enhanced OH observations from the pristine areas with high isoprene conditions have used the laser induced fluorescence (LIF) technique, the possibilities of potential positive artifacts have also been explored. In this context, the first tropical forest CIMS OH dataset will be discussed in the context of 1) comparisons with previously reported OH using the LIF technique, 2) comparisons with box model calculated OH with different isoprene oxidation scenarios to reconcile measured and calculated OH, and 3) comparisons with regional model calculated OH. The CIMS observational dataset along with a comprehensive trace gas dataset provides a constraint to assess current uncertainty in oxidation capacity of the pristine forested region, which has tremendous implications towards global fates of short lived climate forcers.",

The Afar Rift is situated at the triple junction of three rifts, namely the southern Red Sea Rift, Gulf of Aden Rift and Main Ethiopian Rift (MER). The ongoing continental rifting at Afar transitions to seafloor spreading toward the southern Red Sea. The tectonic evolution of Afar is thought to be influenced by a mantle plume, but how the plume affects and interacts with the Afar lithosphere remains elusive. In this study, we use array seismic data to produce high-resolution migration images of the Afar lithosphere from scattered teleseismic wavefields to shed light on the lithospheric structure and associated tectonic processes. Our preliminary results indicate the presence of lithospheric seismic discontinuities with depth variation across the Afar region. Beneath the MER axis, we detect a pronounced discontinuity at 55 km depth, characterized by downward fast-to-slow velocity contrast, which appears to abruptly deepen to 75 km depth to the northern flank of MER. This discontinuity may be interpreted as the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary. Beneath the Ethiopian Plateau, on the other hand, a dipping structure with velocity increase is identified at 70-90 km depth. Further synthesis of observations from seismic tomography, receiver functions, and seismic anisotropy in the Afar region will offer better understanding of tectonic significance of the lithospheric discontinuities.",

Their orbits were in opposite phase. RBSPICE data are available from both spacecraft during the rapid recovery of the storm. We analyze energy spectra of both species to identify whether the ring current is symmetric or not, and determine the dominant loss process.\nDuring the March 17 storm (Dstmin = -223 nT), Van Allen Probes traveled in the pre-midnight sector during the outbound paths and around midnight during the inbound path. The orbits of the two spacecraft were in opposite phase. The Dst index during the storm showed a two-step decrease with the first minimum at 9 UT and the second at 22 UT. Enhancements of ring current ions began at RBSPICE-B at ~7 UT, and RBSPICE-A entered the ring current region at ~9 UT. The RBSPICE data show penetration of energetic protons (μ~0.1 keV/nT) down to L~4 during the first storm development. Protons penetrated more deeply (as low as L~3) during the second enhancement. The protons, which we confirmed made a dominant contribution to energy density at L = 3–4, are more enhanced in flux around the storm maximum. The flux of 200–400 keV oxygen ions was enhanced and localized around midnight near the end of the first storm development. Oxygen ion enhancements during the second development were seen in a wide range of MLT (pre-midnight to midnight). We examine the evolution of ion energy spectra to identify whether each phase of the multi-step storm development was due to deep penetration of transport/injections, density enhancements, or/and non-adiabatic acceleration of protons and oxygen ions.",

            "abstract": "Global biodiversity is one of the most crucial and least-observed dimensions of the earth system and increasingly important for anticipating changes to both the climate system and ecosystem services. Parallel developments in biodiversity science and remote sensing show that new satellite observations could directly provide global monitoring of one key dimension of global biodiversity, plant functional trait diversity. Remote sensing has already proven a pivotal aid to address the biodiversity data gap. Data on plant productivity, phenology, land-cover and other environmental parameters from MODIS and Landsat satellites currently serve as highly effective covariates for spatiotemporal biodiversity models. The growing functional trait paradigm in ecology, supported by the development of a global plant trait database that includes information for more than one-third of the global flora, highlights the importance of detecting functional diversity globally. Functional traits such as nutrient concentrations, characteristic growth forms and wood density drive both, how organisms respond to environmental change and the effects of organisms on ecosystems. Additionally, the ever more complete tree of life for plants, which presents a link to the shared evolutionary history of plant traits within lineages, coupled with advances in macroevolutionary models and data gap filling techniques, allows predictions of traits that cannot be directly observed. Using experimental manipulations of plant functional and phylogenetic diversity, our team is testing the extent to which we can link above and belowground measurements of biodiversity to remotely sensed optical diversity using hyperspectral data. These efforts will provide the means to fruitfully harness functional diversity data from space from the envisioned Global Biodiversity Observatory (GBO) mission. In turn, remotely sensed hyperspectral data from GBO will allow fundamental breakthroughs and resolve one of the most challenging aspects of Earth System science - the need to better quantify and detect change in the dynamics of functional diversity across the globe.",

Our optimized model shows that the rupture has a unilateral propagation pattern. The dominant mechanism is pure thrust with maximum slip of 5.7 m, the rupture scale extends ~60 km along dip and ~150 km along strike, and the associated static stress drop is ~4.2 MPa. The total seismic moment is 7.87×1020 Nm, equivalent to Mw7.9. Most seismic moment was released within 120 s. The strong aftershock magnitude is about Mw7.3, and peak slip is about 5.8 m. Moreover, the slips of the mainshock and the aftershocks are in good complementary, suggesting a triggering relationship between them. This Nepal earthquake ruptured only about 50% of the seismic gap along, thus still poses high earthquake risk, especially in the west of the mainshock.",

The continuous observations of soil radon for earthquake studies at the Tapingti station (TPT) have been recorded and are compared with the data from gamma rays observations at the Taiwan Volcano Observation station(YMSG), located north to the TPT station. Some anomalous high radon concentrations and gamma-ray counts at certain times can be identified. It is noted that the significant increase of soil radon concentrations were observed and followed by the increase in gamma-ray counts several days before the earthquakes, which occurred in eastern Taiwan. Many of these earthquakes are located within the subducting PHS beneath the EU to the north along the Ryukyu trench in northern Taiwan (e.g., ML=6.3 April 20, 2015). It is suggested that the pre-earthquake activities may be associated with slow geodynamic processes at the subduction interface, leading to the PHS movement to trigger radon enhancements at TPT station. Furthermore, the further movement of PHS may be locked by EU and accumulate elastic stress resulting in the increase of gamma rays due to an increase in the porosity and fractures below the YMSG station. The continuous monitoring on the multiple parameters can improve our understanding of the relationship between the observed radon and gamma-ray variations and the regional crustal stress/strain in the area.",

Data were collected using a Kongsberg EM2040 multibeam sonar on the R/V Celtic Voyager, in August and September 2014, and were post-processed with CARIS HIPS and SIPS 8.1 and 9.0 software to create 2D and 3D bathymetric surfaces. From the computer generated images, some of the lithologic formations were relatively aged and observed. The studied regions range in depth from 20 to 118 m, with shallower areas to the northeast. Several large rock outcrops occur, the larger of which shows a vertical rise of nearly 20 m. These outcrops are oriented in a northeast-southwest direction, and exhibit significant bed folding, regional folding, tilted beds, and cross joints. The folds studied are plunging chevron folds. These folds have a northeast-southwest fold axis orthogonal to the cross joints and are older relative to the jointing systems. The NE-SW joints are older than the NW-SE joints due to their correlation with drainage and erosion patterns. Regional folding is the youngest feature due to its superposition on the chevron folding and jointing systems. The interaction of cross jointing and folding is consistent with the geologic history of the area, and creates a unique bathymetry worthy of further study.",

Sharing and referencing of samples in scientific literature and across the Web requires the use of globally unique identifiers essential for disambiguation. This practice is very common in other fields, e.g. ISBN in publishing, doi in scientific literature, etc. In Earth sciences however, this is still often done in an ad-hoc manner without the use of unique identifiers. The International Geo Sample Number (IGSN) system provides a persistent, globally unique label for identifying environmental samples. As an IGSN allocating agency, CSIRO implements the IGSN registration service at the organisational scale with contributions from multiple research groups. Capricorn Distal Footprints project is one of the first pioneers and early adopters of the technology in Australia. For this project, IGSN provides a mechanism for identification of new and legacy samples, as well as derived sub-samples. It will ensure transparency and reproducibility in various geochemical sampling campaigns that will involve a diversity of sampling methods. Hence, diverse geochemical and isotopic results can be linked back to the parent sample, particularly where multiple children of that sample have also been analysed. The IGSN integration for this project is still in early stages and requires further consultations on the governance mechanisms that we need to put in place to allow efficient collaboration within CSIRO and collaborating partners on the project including naming conventions, service interfaces, etc. In this work, we present the results of the initial implementation of IGSN in the context of the Capricorn Distal Footprints project. This study has so far demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach, while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to various media types, which is critical in the context of a multi-disciplinary project.",

            "abstract": "Woody plant encroachment (mainly Juniperus virginiana, a\nconiferous\n evergreen\n tree) in the native grassland has been rapidly increasing in the U.S. Southern Great Plains, largely triggered by overgrazing domestic livestock, fire suppression, and changing rainfall regimes. Increasing dense woody plants have significant implications for local grassland ecosystem dynamics, such as carbon storage, soil nutrient availability, herbaceous forage production, livestock, watershed hydrology and wildlife habitats. However, very limited data are available about the spatio-temporal dynamics of woody plant encroachment to the native grassland at regional scale. Data from remotes sensing could potentially provide relevant information and improve the conversion of native grassland to woody plant encroachment. Previous studies on woody detection in grassland mainly conducted at rangeland scale using airborne or high resolution images, which is sufficient to monitor the dynamics of woody plant encroachment in local grassland. This study examined the potential of medium resolution images to detect the woody encroachment in tallgrass prairie. We selected Cleveland county, Oklahoma, US. as case study area, where eastern area has higher woody coverage than does the western area. A 25-m Phased Array Type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR, N36W98) image was used to map the trees distributed in the grassland. Then, maximum enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) in the winter calculated from time-series Landsat images was used to identify the invaded woody species (Juniperus virginiana) through phenology-based algorithm. The resulting woody plant encroachment map was compared with the results extracted from the high resolution images provided by the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP). Field photos were also used to validate the accuracy. These results showed that integrating PALSAR and Landsat had good performance to identify the woody encroachment in the study area. This study demonstrates the potential to monitor the dynamics of dense woody plant encroachment at the region scale using PALSAR and Landsat images and improves our understanding about the spatio-temporal dynamics of woody plant encroachment to native grasslands.",

The service relies on a statistical model which ingests observations of M and X class solar flares at or shortly after the time of the flare to predict the occurrence and severity of terrestrial impacts with a lead time of 1 to 4 days. This model has been operational since 2012 and caters to the needs of critical infrastructure groups in the Australian region. This paper reports on improvements to the forecast model by including SOHO LASCO coronagraph observations of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). The coronagraphs are analysed to determine the Earthward direction parameter and the integrated intensity as a measure of the CME mass. Both of these parameters can help to predict whether a CME will be geo-effective. This work aims to increase the accuracy of the model predictions and lower the rate of false positives, as well as providing an estimate of the expected level of geomagnetic storm intensity.",

            "abstract": "Recent work indicates that subducting slabs may exhibit buckling instabilities and consequent folding behavior in the mantle transition zone for various dynamical parameters, accompanied by temporal variations in dip angle, plate velocity, and trench retreat. Governing parameters include both viscous (rheological) and buoyancy (thermo-petrological) forces. 2D numerical experiments show that many parameter sets lead to slab deflection at the base of the transition zone, typically accompanied by quasi-periodic oscillations in largely anticorrelated plate and rollback velocities, resulting in undulating stagnant slabs as buckle folds accumulate subhorizontally atop the lower mantle. Slab petrology, of mantle phase transitions and hydrated crust, is a dominant factor in this process (Čížková and Bina, 2013).\nFor terrestrial parameter sets, trench retreat is found to be nearly ubiquitous and trench advance quite rare, largely due to rheological and ridge-push effects. Recently updated analyses of global plate motions indicate that significant trench advance is also rare on Earth, being largely restricted to the Izu-Bonin arc (Matthews et al., 2013). Thus, we explore conditions necessary for terrestrial trench advance through dynamical models involving the unusual geometry of the Philippine Sea region. Our 2D modeling of such geometries, in which distal subduction of the overriding plate overprints an opposed slab-pull force on the usual ridge-push at the trench, yields persistent trench advance interrupted by episodes of back-arc extension, demonstrating that trench advance can occur for terrestrial rheologies in such special geometries (Čížková and Bina, 2015).",

These models fail to capture the observed hydraulic plasticity that allows plants to regulate root hydraulic conductivity and zones of active uptake based on local gradients. Recent developments in root water uptake modeling have sought to increase its mechanistic representation by bridging the gap between physically based microscopic models and computationally feasible macroscopic approaches. It remains to be demonstrated whether bulk parameterization of microscale characteristics (e.g., root system morphology and root conductivity) can improve process representation at the ecosystem scale. We employ the Couvreur method of microscopic uptake to yield macroscopic representation in a coupled soil-root model. Using a modified version of the PFLOTRAN model, which represents the 3-D physics of variably saturated soil, we model a one-hectare temperate forest stand under natural and synthetic climatic forcing. Our results show that as shallow soil layers dry, uptake at the tree and stand level shift to deeper soil layers, allowing the transpiration stream demanded by the atmosphere. We assess the potential capacity of the model to capture compensatory root water uptake. Further, the hydraulic plasticity of the root system is demonstrated by the quick response of uptake to rainfall pulses. These initial results indicate a promising direction for land surface models in which significant three-dimensional information from large root systems can be feasibly integrated into the forest scale simulations of root water uptake.",

The representative geology including geothermal waters are Mesozoic granite and Age-unknown metamorphic rock in Korea. This study investigated geochemical characteristics of the 4 thermal water (Suanbo, Yuseong, Deoksan, Seokmodo) according to the geology which are located in the middle and the south part in Korea. The Suanbo, Yuseong, and Deoksan thermal waters show Na-HCO3 type and the Seokmodo thermal water on the coast Na-Ca-Cl type implying the sea-water intrusion. The LMWL (Local Meteoric Water Line) of the surface water in the sites shows δD = 5.86δ18O - 8.31 (R2 = 0.99) relation, and also thermal water and groundwater plots are distributed on the LMWL. This implies that the precipitation rarely undergoes isotope fractionation during the circulation in the aquifer. The average δ13C value of the Suanbo, Deoksan and Seokmodo thermal waters have -11.93±0.31 ‰, -17.40±0.26 ‰, and -15.73±0.68 ‰, respectively, and these values maintained constantly during the research period. But the surface waters show seasonal variations which could be resulted from activities of microbe and hydrophyte. The estimated age using δ14CDIC value of the Suanbo, Yuseong, and Deoksan thermal waters suggested 5580±30, 1980±30, 3240±30 BP (Before Present), respectively. The 14CDIC age dating represent that the deeper well depth, the older thermal water. This suggests that the period of the groundwater circulation between surface water and thermal water has been achieved very slowly during 2000 and 5600 years. This data indicates that the present thermal waters were originated from meteoric water, and recharged in the past at least 2000 years ago.",

            "abstract": "The Tien Shan is an outstanding example of intracontinental mountain belt, which was built rapidly and formed far away from plate boundaries. It exhibits 300~500 km in width and extends ~2000 km EW, located in central Asia. The Tien Shan is a key area for solution of the problems relating to intracontinental geodynamics. During last decades, despite a large amount of results based on various geological, geophysical and geodetic data about the Tien Shan, however, deformation mechanism remains controversial and other several principal problems related to its structure and evolution also have not been completely resolved. As for patterns of continental deformation, they are always controlled by both the forces applied to the lithosphere and by lithospheric resistance to the forces. The latter is often measured by the mechanical strength of lithosphere. The lateral variation of strength of lithosphere has been recognized to be an important factor controlling the spatial construction and temporal evolution of continent. In this study, we investigate the mechanical strength (Te) of lithosphere in the Tien Shan using wavelet coherency between Bouguer anomaly and topography. The patterns of Te variations are closely related to major tectonic boundaries and blocks. Mechanical strength exhibits a weak zone (Te~5-20km) beneath the Tien Shan while its surrounding blocks including Tarim Basin, Junggar Basin and Kazakh platform are characterized by a strong lithosphere (Te>40km). The lateral variations in mechanical strength and velocity field of horizontal movement with GPS demonstrate that strain localization appears at the margins of Tarim Basin, which is also the strong lithospheric domain. It is suggested that the weak lithosphere allows the crustal stress accumulation and the strong lithosphere helps to stress transfer. There is also a good agreement between mechanical strength and shear wave velocity structure in upper mantle. It indicates a strong domain located in the lower crust and lithospheric mantle. Combined with results of analog models, the location and style of deformation are preliminary determined and thus the related topography evolution in the Tien Shan is mainly controlled by the lateral and depth variation in lithospheric mechanical strength of surrounding areas.",

The pressure and temperature behavior implied the interval should be high permeability.\nWe analyzed the interval to characterize the properties before gas-production test; i.e. the original properties of the interval. We checked the data of the logging-while-drilling data of AT1-MC, which was one of the monitoring wells at the gas-production test. The specific interval was described as 1290-1298m, where was boundary between upper sand and mud alteration layer and middle clayey zone. The first, we noticed that there were several layers that showed broad T2 distributions of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). On the basis of the T2 distributions and the resistivity data of the interval, there were large pores that showed the T2 distribution around 100ms, even though some amount of methane hydrate were contained. This result could be explained the interval showed high permeability below the 1294m. After checking their ultra-sonic caliper data in detail, we found interesting difference in the interval. The specific interval of 1294-1295m had different borehole-enlargement direction from other intervals of the methane-hydrate bearing zone, even though diameter of borehole was slightly enlarged. Other layers in the methane hydrate reservoir showed NW-SE directions of enlargement, however, the specific interval had NE-SW direction of enlargement. Hence, H-max stress and H-min stress of this specific interval could be very close values. Thus, near the 1294m, the lithology of the layer was permeable and weak. It might be useful to understand many phenomena occured during the gas-production test.

The ~18Ma to ~9Ma deposits of our study area, Descanso–Yauri basin in southern Peru show 11 to 16ºC warmer than modern mean annual air temperature, low elevation vegetation pollen assemblage (dominated by Podocarpus), and an average precipitation δ18Omw (VSMOW) value of -8.3±2.0‰ (2σ). The ~5 to 4 Ma deposits in the Descanso-Yauri basin are characterized by herb and shrub vegetation and an average δ18O mw (VSMOW) value of -14.6±3.0‰ (2σ), indicative of an elevation and/or climate similar to modern conditions. Based on the multiproxy paleoclimate record, we interpret that there was a 2±1 km surface uplift between 9 and 5 Ma in the northernmost Altiplano plateau. Deformation history analysis through map scale structural investigation combined with provenance analysis from conglomerate clast composition and paleocurrents show that the thrusts bounding the NE side of the Descanso-Yauri basin were active until ∼9Ma. Deformation waned afterwards, and switched to an extensional deformation regime, coincident with decrease in subsidence rate from ∼0.2mm/year to ∼0.03mm/year. Depositional history reconstructed by facies analysis and stratigraphic correlation reveal that deposition in the basin began with transverse braided river systems that formed along the thrust front and gave way to a larger fluvial-lacustrine system until ∼4 Ma. The basin deposits show an overall fining upward trend from coarse clastic dominated, in the lower most parts of the basin fill to fluvial overbank and lacustrine mudstone and diatomite deposits in the middle-upper parts. The thickest deposits formed in the central part of the basin. Based on these depositional and deformational patterns, we infer that the Descanso-Yauri basin formed in response to a growing eclogite and mantle root in the lower lithosphere. Removal of this root, possibly combined with lower crustal flow, led to the rapid 9-5 Ma surface uplift of the northernmost part of the Central Andean Plateau.",

The xGEOID15 model is the second in a series of annual experimental geoid models that incorporates NGS GRAV-D airborne data. This series provides a useful benchmark for assessing and improving current techniques, to ultimately compute a geoid model that can support a national physical height system by 2022. Here, we focus on the combination of the latest GOCE/GRACE models with the terrestrial gravimetry (land/airborne) that was applied for xGeoid15. Comparisons against existing combination gravitational solutions, such as EGM2008 and EIGEN6C4, as well as recent geoid models, such as xGeoid14 and CGG2013, are interesting for what they reveal about the respective use of the GOCE/GRACE satgrav information.",

            "abstract": "Recent inversions of long-period magnetotelluric (MT) datasets (Kelbert et al., 2012; Meqbel et al., 2014) have suggested that the mantle lithosphere directly beneath the modern Yellowstone caldera is electrically resistive. This observation implies that the uppermost mantle does not contain significant quantities of melt and therefore seems to contradict seismic tomography studies that find a major low-velocity plume-like feature directly beneath Yellowstone. Our ongoing investigation of the long-period Earthscope MT data suggests that these data are relatively insensitive to the conductivity structure in the upper mantle due to screening of deeper features by the modern electrically conductive magma chamber(s). Hence, at present we cannot conclude that the uppermost mantle directly beneath Yellowstone is electrically resistive. However, we do resolve a major electrically conductive anomaly that dips generally to the west at approximately 30 degrees from the vicinity of the seismically imaged magma reservoir(s) beneath the Yellowstone. The MT data therefore may indicate that the flow of melt is at least partially influenced by structures to the west of the modern caldera, specifically ancient (Paleoproterozoic) structures at the edge of the Wyoming Craton. While the geochemistry of Yellowstone eruptive products remains ambiguous with regards to source, radiogenic isotope model ages could be interpreted as supporting this possibility.",

            "abstract": "Release of large amounts of methane from marine gas hydrate reservoirs has been considered as a possible trigger of climate change, which can be recorded by the variation of carbon isotopes (δ13C) of the benthic foraminifera. In modern analogs, previous studies have suggested that δ13C becomes more negative when influenced by methane seeps. However, values of δ13C of benthic foraminifera might vary with different species and sedimentary settings in different regions.\nSeismic profiles in offshore southwestern Taiwan show the existence of Bottom Simulating Reflector (BSR) in the region, indicative of gas hydrate reservoirs. Various methane seepages have been found, and they are suspected to be related to the gas hydrates buried underneath. A better understanding of the δ13C signals of benthic foraminifera near the methane seepages can further clarify the origin of the methane and to evaluate it as a proxy of methane release for the geologic past.\nWe have analyzed δ13C of benthic foraminifera Uvigerina proboscidea (150-250 mm) in the topmost 15 cm sediments in five marine cores (OR1-1092-WFWC-1, OR1-1092-WFWC-4, OR1-1092-WFWC-6, OR3-1806-C5-2 and OR3-1806-C10) collected from the Four-Way Closure Ridge in offshore southwestern Taiwan (water depth from 1330 to 1580 m). Our results show that δ13C values of U. proboscidea range from -0.98‰ to -6.21‰ (VPDB) for core OR3-1806-C5-2, which is considered as a seeps-influenced site. On the other hand, δ13C values of U. proboscidea from the background sites range from -0.40‰ to -1.00‰. The difference between the methane seep-affected and the background sites is in the range of 0.00‰ to 5.01‰, comparable to those documented in previous studies in other areas. The significant negative excursion in carbon isotopes in the seep site foraminifera is likely caused by incorporation of light inorganic carbon generated by methanotrophy in the system.",

SIF is used to infer photosynthetic capacity of plant canopy [2]. However, it is not well understoond how the leaf-level SIF emission contributes to the top of canopy directional SIF because SIFs observed by the satellites use the near infrared spectral domain where the multiple scatterings among leaves are not negligible. It is necessary to quantify the fraction of emission for each satellite observation angle. Absorbed photosynthetically active radiation of sunlit leaves are 100 times higher than that of shaded leaves. Thus, contribution of sunlit and shaded leaves to canopy scale directional SIF emission should also be quantified. Here, we show the results of global simulation of SIF using a 3 dimensional radiative transfer simulation with MODIS atmospheric (aerosol optical thickness) and land (land cover and leaf area index) products and a forest landscape data sets prepared for each land cover category. The results are compared with satellite-based SIF (e.g. GOME-2) and the gross primary production empirically estimated by FLUXNET and remote sensing data.",

In order to understand how Pi2 pulsations are generated in the magnetotail and how they propagate into the ionosphere, we have modeled a substorm on August 25, 2013 using both the UCLA and the Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) 3D global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models. By mapping from virtual ground stations into the plasma sheet we are able to determine what the specific magnetospheric drivers in the simulation are for Pi2 period fluctuations observed at different locations in the ionosphere.\nThe results from both simulations show that Pi2 period pulsations develop in the plasma sheet in the magnetic field, velocity, and pressure, concurrently with the arrival of fast earthward flows and their associated dipolarization fronts. When we map in the UCLA model from the ionosphere to locations in the plasma sheet where the flow channels are present, perturbations are not evident in the ionosphere, but there are Pi2 period perturbations at the inner edge of the MHD region of the simulation (~3 RE) in the magnetic field components, thermal pressure and density. The LFM ionosphere is much more dynamic than the UCLA ionosphere for this event. Field lines from locations in the ionosphere where PI2 are observed that map to flow channels in the plasma sheet show Pi2 period perturbations in the parallel currents in the ionosphere which match very well with the velocity and magnetic field perturbations in the plasma sheet.",

            "abstract": "Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) phase signal contains not only surface deformations but also propagation delays due to Earth’s atmosphere, which is the principal limiting factor for InSAR application of small deformation with amplitude of a few centimeters or less. Bevis et al. (1992) showed that the tropospheric delay consists of the hydrostatic delay due to dry gases and the wet delay due to water vapor. Previous studies proposed correction methods which used GNSS delay data or numerical weather model outputs. However, it is still insignificant for detecting small surface deformation.\nJolivet et al. (2014) showed that reanalysis data like ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) data is useful to mitigate topography-correlated tropospheric delay from InSAR data. However, previous studies used only one of the model data as a case study and didn’t apply the correction to other areas.\nIn this study we examined an effect of the tropospheric delay correction with Japanese 55-year reanalysis (JRA-55) data (Kobayashi et al., 2015). The horizontal resolution of JRA-55 is TL319 (approximately 60 km) and has 60 vertical layers. In addition, we estimated the tropospheric delay with ERA-Interim data for comparison. SAR data used were derived from ALOS/PALSAR around Nagoya prefecture (Path-Frame: 411-690). To avoid the spatial decorrelation, interferometric pairs with the perpendicular baseline of less 3000 m were generated. As a result, 309 interferograms were generated from 28 SAR single-look complex images.\nIn consequence of the tropospheric delay correction with JRA-55 and ERA-Interim data, the averaged standard deviation of all interferograms slightly reduced from 1.26716 cm to 1.25231 cm by JRA-55 and slightly increased to 1.26797 cm by ERA-Interim. We further examined the correction effect when dividing the estimated delay into the hydrostatic component and the wet component. These results showed that JRA-55 corrected these delays rather than ERA-Interim, indicating that one of the factors of correction failure by ERA-Interim would be due to the low reproducibility of the actual wet delay.\nIn the presentation, we will report correction effects of JRA-55 and ERA-Interim, and discuss the difference of these effects.",

            "abstract": "The Geysers geothermal region in northern California is a valuable resource for the production of geothermal electric power. Injection of water into the reservoir is necessary to maintain pressure and causes an increase in the number of earthquakes per day, but their source mechanisms are not well understood (Johnson, 2015).\nPrevious studies of source mechanisms for events in the Geysers have identified a large number of events with significant isotropic and compensated linear vector dipole components. These source complexities most likely arise from the presence of pressurized liquids and gases, as well as temperature changes, at depth. The existence of non-double couple components in volcanic and geothermal environments has been extensively documented by previous studies, but it has also been shown that spurious components might occur due to a range of factors such as an inadequate knowledge of Earth structure and earthquake location, or noisy waveform data. Therefore, it is not entirely surprising that non-double-couple components from different source studies, each following a different experimental method and using different data types, do not agree well (e.g. Guilhem et al., 2014). The assessment of the solution robustness is critical for the physical interpretation of source mechanisms.\nHere, we apply a hierarchical Bayesian approach (Mustac and Tkalcic, 2015) to waveform data from M>4.5 events in the Geysers in order to produce moment tensor \u0007solutions\b and simultaneously estimate their robustness. By using a Bayesian inversion, we quantify the uncertainties from an ensemble of probable solutions instead of a single optimized solution and sample solutions at a range of centroid locations. Moreover, the hierarchical approach allows noise in the data to be sampled as a free parameter in the inversion. A rigorous approach in accounting for the data correlated noise covariance matrix prevents “over-interpretation” of noise, thus avoiding erroneous solutions. We interpret our results in the context of accumulated knowledge on the Geysers geothermal region.",

RFEs are defined by monthly maximum / minimum river flows and threshold-based (e.g. 95th and 5th percentiles) extreme flows. The uncertainties arising from the forcing data and models based on the hydrological simulations are quantified with and without human impact (water withdrawal) which is made available by the ISI-MIP2 project. The entropy theory is incorporated to measure the uncertainties transferred from forcings to the hydrological models. Firstly, monthly discharge and RFEs simulations with human impact are validated against observed station data in the major basins of China for all GHMs and forcings. Annual means of monthly maximum / minimum flows and frequency of threshold-based RFEs are computed, and their trends are estimated over the historical period. GHMs variance of RFEs are computed across all GHM simulations for each forcing individually and then averaged for all forcings, which is further used to characterize GHMs uncertainty in RFEs simulation. The separation of GHMs for different forcings is helpful to assess uncertainty sources in regional hydrological simulation. Then uncertainties are calculated in the term of entropy for simulations with and without human activities to see whether the inclusion of human impact simulation in GHMs reduces or increases the uncertainty. This research would be in favor of understanding of the uncertainty in assessment of hydrological extremes at regional scale in China and potential improvement of GHMs in future.",

Despite the extensive pioneering studies on carbon-bearing silicate glasses, spectroscopic and scattering studies at high pressure above ~4 GPa is limited due to the lack of suitable experimental probes. Here, we report the pressure-induced structural changes around C, Si and Al in albite and Na-trisilicate (Na2O:SiO2=1:3, NS3) glasses with varying pressure up to 8 GPa, using 27Al, 29Si and 13C solid-state high-resolution NMR. 27Al 3QMAS NMR spectra for carbon-bearing albite glasses quenched from melts at high pressure up to 6 GPa show only [4]Al environments. The FWHM of [4]Al in albite glasses increases with increasing pressure, indicating that the overall densification of albite glasses at high pressure is accompanied by an increase in the topological disorder around Al. 29Si MAS NMR spectra for NS3 glasses at high pressure up to 8 GPa show the presence of highly coordinated Si, [5,6]Si, which contributes to an increases in the total configurational disorder in the NS3 glasses with pressure. 13C MAS NMR spectra for carbon-bearing albite glasses show the presence of dominant fraction of CO2, and minor amounts of CO32-, and CO. At least three distinct carbonate species, such as [4]Si(CO3)[4]Si, [4]Si(CO3)[4]Al, and CO32- were observed. Among those species, the increase in the fraction of [4]Si(CO3)[4]Al species is most prevalent. 13C MAS NMR spectra for NS3 glasses show the presence of carbonate species. The peaks position of the carbonate species shifts to lower frequency upon compression, suggesting the pressure-induced structural distortion of CO32- in the glasses above 6 GPa. Spin-lattice (T1) relaxation time for molecular CO2 in carbon-bearing albite glasses increases with increasing pressure. T1 relaxation time for CO2 species at 6 GPa is 3.5 times longer than that at 1.5 GPa. The corrected solubility of carbon in albite glasses with T1 relaxation increases linearly with increasing pressure. The current experimental results can shed light on experimental opportunity to provide the structural details of carbon in the Earth’s interior.",

            "abstract": "Two possible goals for public science communication are: a) improving the public’s in-depth understanding of the scientific subject; and b) fostering the public’s belief that scientific efforts make a better world. Although (a) is often a natural target when scientists try to communicate their subject, the importance of (b) is underscored by the NSF, who investigated the “cultural authority of science” to understand science’s role in policymaking. Surveys consistently find that there is a huge divergence between “knowledge” and “admiration” of science in society because science literacy has very little to do with public perception of science.\nHowever, even if both goals could be achieved, it doesn’t necessarily mean that the general public will act on scientific advice. Different parts of society have different criteria for reaching judgments about how to act in their best interests. This makes the study of science communication important when controversies arise requiring public engagement. Climate change, sustainability, and water crises are only a few examples of such controversial subjects. Science communication can be designed carefully to sponsor dialogue and participation, to overcome perceptual obstacles, and to engage with stakeholders and the wider public.\nThis study reviews work in social science that tries to answer: When is science communication necessary? What is involved in science communication? What is the role of media in effective science communication? It also reviews common recommendations for improved public engagement by scientists and science organizations.\nAs part of this effort, I will present some portions of my science films. I will conclude with suggestions on what scientific institutions can focus on to build trust, relationships, and participation across segments of the public.\nKeywords: informal learning, popular science, climate change, water crisis, science communication, science films, science policy.",

            "abstract": "The 25 April 2015 earthquake (Mw7.9) struck Nepal near the middle segment of Himalaya. Large earthquakes occurred around this region frequently in history. The rupture process could help us to investigate the characters of the disaster earthquakes. For this event many kinds of observation data could be used to constrain the rupture process. Data of some 1Hz GPS stations of the China Crustal Movement Observation Network were processed by the software GAMIT and we obtained the waveforms of this earthquake. The waveforms of several 5Hz GPS stations near the epicenter were provided by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) (http://aria-share.jpl.nasa.gov/events/20150425-Nepal_EQ/GPS/). The ALOS-2 satellite, operated by the Japanese Space Agency, collected a useful of L-band InSAR data and Lindsey et al. determined the coseismic displacement of the line-of-sight (http://topex.ucsd.edu/nepal/). We resampled the coseismic displacement of Lindsey et al. to constrain the rupture process. In addition teleseismic broadband body waves, long period surface waves, waveforms of one regional broadband station and one local strong motion station were combined in the joint inversion. The epicenter of United States Geological Survey (USGS) and the mechanism of Global Centroid Moment Tensor (GCMT) were applied. The Mw 7.9 earthquake ruptured a thrust fault orienting 293o and dipping 7o to the NE, locating near the middle segment of Himalaya. This earthquake was a unilateral event and the rupture of asperity mainly propagates to the southeast, spanning a depth range from 8 km to 18 km. The inverted slip distribution is dominated by a rectangle shape slip patch with the length of ~120km. The weighted rupture velocity is about 2.1 km/s and the total seismic moment is about 8.6x1020 Nm. The imaged fault slip correlates well with the aftershock distribution.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the process of sediment transport and deposition under a tsunami inundation is essential to provide the credible information about potential tsunamis from tsunami deposits. Detections of tsunami deposit has contributed to reveal centuries-old record of tsunami incursions. However, our knowledge is still not enough for evaluating the scale of past tsunamis using deposits.\nIn this study, a laboratory experiment was conducted to investigate the relationship between the hydraulic condition and sedimentological features of tsunami deposit. The large wave flume in CRIEPI, one of the largest wave flume in the world, which has 205 m length, 3.4 m width and 6 m depth was used. The sandy beach with uniform slope (1/50) were made in the flume. Sand dune of 0.2 high was placed near the shoreline. The tsunami was made by the wave generator which has 2.2 m stroke. The wave at the shore line has 0.6 m depth and the horizontal velocity reached up to 3.5 m/s. The incursion of the wave and its return flow completely washed out the dune and resulted in the deposition especially near the dune. The thickness of deposit shows landward thinning and fining, which has been widely confirmed by field observations.\nIn addition, sedimentary structures of the deposit was investigated using the method similar to that used in geological survey such as core sampling and relief peel sampling. The obtained samples were investigated using a X-ray computed tomography. The obtained CT-images shows that most part of deposition consists two or more subsections divided by horizontal lamination although the deposition near the dune has drastic and complex change thickness and grain size. The subsections shows upward-fining and upward-coarsening which are been reported as common sedimentary structures of tsunami deposit from field surveys.\nConsidering the similarity of sedimentary structures in the deposit reconstructed in this experiment and actual tsunami deposits, this experiment succeeded in reproducing tsunami deposit and would show typical pattern of topography change and deposition caused by the tsunami incursion. The experimental method used in this study and the obtained deposition patterns will help understanding the relationship between hydraulic condition and resulting tsunami deposition.",

            "abstract": "Rainfall from tropical cyclones (TCs) can cause extreme flooding. Predicting and understanding TC rainfall is thus important but has received relatively less attention, compared to the wind and surge. Here we present a simple, physically-based rainfall model, where the rain rate is obtained from estimated vertical velocity and specific humidity in the lower troposphere. The involved rainfall mechanisms include: 1) vertical motion at the top of the boundary layer owing to frictional effects; 2) vertical motion in the middle troposphere resulted from the time evolution of the gradient wind; 3) vertical motion forced by topographic interaction as well as 4) baroclinic effect. The model has been applied to Texas and shown to generate rainfall statistics comparable to observations (Zhu et al, 2013). Here we further evaluate this model on an event basis; case studies include Hurricane Irene (2011) and Isabel (2003). Without any calibration, hourly rainfall estimated from this model compares well with those from full numerical weather prediction model (WRF) as well as rainfall climatology models (R-CLIPPER and PHRaM). This comparison demonstrates the model’s ability to capture main TC rainfall mechanisms, and it can be used as an effective tool to study the relative contribution of each rainfall mechanism. Ongoing work includes possibly improving the rainfall model by coupling it with a more accurate boundary layer model. Given its high computational efficiency, this rainfall model can be applied to large numbers of ensemble or synthetic simulations. This study fits into our long-term goal to quantify the risk of inland flooding associated with landfalling TCs.",

            "abstract": "Our current understanding of the structure and stability of the Ross Ice Shelf is based on satellite studies of the ice surface and the 1970’s RIGGS program. The study of the flowlines evident in the MODIS imagery combined with surface geophysics has revealed a complex history with ice streams Mercer, Whillans and Kamb changing velocity over the past 1000 years. Here, we present preliminary IcePod and IceBridge radar data acquired in December 2014 and November 2013 across the Ross Ice Shelf that show clearly, for the first time, the structure of the ice shelf and provide insights into ice-ocean interaction. The three major layers of the ice shelf are (1) the continental meteoric ice layer), ice formed on the grounded ice sheet that entered the ice shelf where ice streams and outlet glaciers crossed the grounding line (2) the locally accumulating meteoric ice layer, ice and snow that forms from snowfall on the floating ice shelf and (3) a basal marine ice layer. The locally accumulating meteoric ice layer contains well-defined internal layers that are generally parallel to the ice surface and thickens away from the grounding line and reaches a maximum thickness of 220m along the line crossing Roosevelt Island. The continental meteoric layer is located below a broad irregular internal reflector, and is characterized by irregular internal layers. These internal layers are often folded, likely a result of deformation as the ice flowed across the grounding line. The basal marine ice layer, up to 50m thick, is best resolved in locations where basal crevasses are present, and appears to thicken along the flow at rates of decimeters per year. Each individual flowband of the ice shelf contains layers that are distinct in their structure. For example, the thickness of the locally accumulated layer is a function of both the time since crossing the grounding line and the thickness of the incoming ice. Features in the meteoric ice, such as distinct folds, can be traced between the two IceBridge lines located 47 km apart. The ROSETTA-ICE program will begin a systematic mapping of the Ross Ice Shelf and sub-ice topography using the IcePod system beginning in 2015. Together the new gravity-derived bathymetry and the mapping of the ice shelf structure will provide key insights into the stability of the ice shelf.",

In particular, it is observed that in late 2010 summer, one of the outlet glaciers at Upernavik Isstrøm, northwest Greenland, showed abrupt change in speed. It accelerated from 4.5 km/yr to 6 km/yr. In this study, we attempt to explain this sudden speed up by investigating the factors that would affect short-term variation of speed in tidewater glaciers through numerical modeling. We have adopted the Community Ice Sheet Model (CISM) with high spatial (100 m) and high temporal resolutions (5 days) to simulate these effects on glacial speed. We find that the potential reasons could include enhanced surface melting induced by an atmospheric warming trend; changes in ice-ocean boundary condition; and change in terminus stability from grounding line migration. Ice loss through calving and submarine melting taking place along terminus and grounding position strongly alters the inside stress balance. Changes in surface melting affects melt water supply to the base and hence account for basal hydrological responses. These factors therefore in turn have impact on glacial speed, which we are quantitatively assessing using the CISM. Our study emphasizes on obtaining insights on the factors controlling transient speed variation in tidewater glaciers, which would be helpful in further understanding their seasonal and inter-annual variability and reducing the uncertainties in projections of future sea level rise.",

            "abstract": "We report on a prototype earthquake early warning system for the Western U.S. based on GNSS (GPS+GLONASS) observations, and where available collocated GNSS and accelerometer data (seismogeodesy). We estimate with latency of 2-3 seconds GNSS displacement waveforms from more than 120 stations, focusing on the southern segment of the San Andreas fault, the Hayward and Rodgers Creek faults and Cascadia. The displacements are estimated using precise point positioning with ambiguity resolution (PPP-AR), which provides for efficient processing of hundreds of “clients” within the region of interest with respect to a reference frame well outside the expected zone of deformation. The GNSS displacements are useful for alleviating magnitude saturation concerns, rapid earthquake magnitude estimation using peak ground displacements, CMT solutions and finite fault slip models. However, GNSS alone is insufficient for strict earthquake early warning (i.e., P wave detection). Therefore, we employ a self-contained seismogeodetic technique, where collocations of GNSS and accelerometer instruments are available, to estimate real-time displacement and velocity waveforms using PPP-AR with accelerometers (PPP-ARA). Using the velocity waveforms we can detect the P wave arrival for earthquakes of interest (>M 5.5), estimate a hypocenter, S wave propagation, and earthquake magnitude using Pd scaling relationships within seconds. Currently we are gearing up to receive observatory-grade accelerometer data from the CISN. We have deployed 25 inexpensive MEMS accelerometers at existing GNSS stations. The SIO Geodetic Modules that control the flow of the GNSS and accelerometer data are being upgraded with in situ PPP-ARA and P wave picking. In situ processing allows us to use the data at the highest sampling rate of the GNSS receiver (10 Hz or higher), in combination with the 100 Hz accelerometer data. Adding the GLONASS data allows for increased precision in the vertical, an important factor in P wave detection, and by reducing outliers, increasing the number of visible satellites and significantly reducing the time required for reinitialization of phase ambiguities. We plan to make our displacement and velocity waveforms available to the USGS ShakeAlert system and others in Earthworm format.",

These data present a rare opportunity to image the evolution of the crust and mantle of an entire plate from the ridge through the subduction zone. The Cascadia subduction zone is capable of up to a M9 megathrust earthquake; seismic imaging provides a major constraint on the thermal structure and hydration state of the plate, which in turn constrain models of seismogenesis. We utilize a multi-channel cross-correlation analysis to estimate the phase-velocity of Rayleigh waves traversing the CI from teleseismic earthquakes recorded over the first three years of the deployment, to image the structure of the Juan de Fuca plate and the Cascadia arc and forearc. Our initial results are dominated by the transition from high-velocity oceanic to low-velocity continental lithosphere across the margin, high velocities in the region of the subducting slab, and low velocities beneath the arc. All of these areas produce reasonable standard deviation in the velocity estimates. These images confirm the robustness of our methodology, despite the different noise characteristics of the onshore sites and the ocean bottom seismometers (OBS). Among the OBS sites there are additional differences between those deployed in deep water on oceanic crust and those in shallow water on the continental shelf. Compliance and tilt corrections have a significant effect at some stations and are taken into account accordingly. These results will be combined with recent results from offshore receiver functions and estimates of short-period Rayleigh wave dispersion from ambient noise to constrain the crust and mantle structure in a joint inversion.",

Cross-correlations of long-duration ambient noise records can be used to give stable impulse response functions without the need for repeated seismic events.\nTemporal velocity changes were detected in the four months following the September 2010 Mw 7.1 Darfield event in South Island, New Zealand, using temporary seismic networks originally deployed to record aftershocks in the region. The arrays consisted of stations lying on and surrounding the fault, with a maximum inter-station distance of 156km. The 2010-2011 Canterbury earthquake sequence occurred largely on previously unknown and buried faults. The Darfield earthquake was the first and largest in a sequence of events that hit the region, rupturing the Greendale Fault. A surface rupture of nearly 30km was observed. The sequence also included the Mw 6.3 February 2011 Christchurch event, which caused widespread damage throughout the city and resulted in almost 200 deaths.\nNine-component, day-long Green's functions were computed for frequencies between 0.1 – 1.0 Hz for full waveform seismic data from immediately after the 4th September 2010 earthquake until mid-January 2011. Using the moving window cross-spectral method, stacks of daily functions covering the study period (reference functions), were compared to consecutive 10 day stacks of cross-correlations to measure time delays between them. These were then inverted for seismic velocity changes with respect to the reference functions. Over the study period an increase in seismic velocity of 0.25% ± 0.02% was determined proximal to the Greendale fault. These results are similar to studies in other regions, and we attribute the changes to post-seismic relaxation through crack-healing of the Greendale Fault and throughout the region.",

They are seen in the matrix of carbonaceous chondrites as well as in planetary materials. Tagish Lake is one of the most primitive carbonaceous meteorites in which TEM and XRD analyses found evidence for poorly crystalline phyllosilicate-like species; Raman spectra revealed amorphous silicates with variable degree of polymerization and low crystallinity. On Mars, CheMin discovered amorphous phases in all analyzed samples, and poorly crystalline smectite in mudstone samples. These discoveries pose questions on the crystallinity of phyllosilicates found by remote sensing on Mars, which is directly relevant to aqueous alteration during geologic history of Mars.\nOur goal is to use spectroscopy to better characterize amorphous silicates. We use three approaches: (1) using silicate glasses synthesized with controlled chemistry to study the effects of silicate polymerization and (2) using phyllosilicates synthesized with controlled hydrothermal treatment to study the effect of crystallinity on vibrational spectroscopy, finally (3) to use the developed correlations in above two steps to study amorphous phases in meteorites, and those found in future missions to Mars.\nIn the 1st step, silicate glasses were synthesized from pure oxides in a range of NBO/T ratios (from 0 to 4). Depending on the targeted NBO/T and composition of mixed oxides, temperatures for each experiment fell in a range from 1260 to 1520 °C, run for ~ 4 hrs. The melt was quenched in liquid N2 or water. Homogeneity of glass was checked under optical microscopy. Raman spectra were taken over 100 spots on small chips free of bubbles and crystals. We have observed that accompanying an increase of NBO/T, there is a strengthening and a position shift of the Raman peak near 1000 cm-1 (Si-Onon-bridging stretching mode), and the weakening of broad Raman peaks near 500 cm-1 (ring breathing mode) and 700cm-1 (Si-Obridging-Si mode). We are building the correlation between peak area ratio, A(500+700)/A1000, and NBO/T.\nIn the 2nd step, we are synthesizing Mg-saponite using a sol-gel method. The crystallinity of sol-gel starting materials will be increased by a controlled hydrothermal treatment. The products will be characterized using XRD/TEM/Raman/NIR. The results will be reported at the conference.",

To prepare for the seismic disaster we have started a series of integrated Tokyo Metropolitan projects for disaster mitigation since 2002.The current Tokyo Metropolitan Project (Phase III) has started in 2012 with a new project name as “Special Project for Reducing Vulnerability for Urban Mega-earthquake Disasters” to use MeSO-net data for constructing 3-D velocity and Q structure beneath the greater Tokyo. We aim to collect data for regional characterization to access seismic hazard produced by subduction of Philippine Sea and Pacific plates.\nThe data from MeSO-net are continuously collected at the data management center in the Earthquake Research Institute (ERI), the University of Tokyo, with a sampling rate of 200 Hz. The data are 3-componnent accelerogram with a full scale of +/- 1,500 gal for horizontal and +/-500 gal for vertical component and the effective dynamic range is 135dB at 40Hz. Available frequency range is from 0.05 to 85 Hz, which is good for travel time analysis of body waves to ambient noise analysis for surface waves.\nWe have successfully operated MeSO-net for about 7 years without serious malfunction. We collect more than 150 TB continuous ground motion data with more than 100K earthquakes including the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake and all its aftershocks. The data are used many studies (e.g., Nakagawa et al., 2010,2015; Ishibe et al., 2015; Denolle et al., 2014) and currently prepared for disclosing both in continues and event-by-event format.\nWe are developing a fully automatic earthquake detection/location system for local earthquakes beneath MeSO-net. A numerical system to estimate ground motions at an arbitrary location without MeSO-net station is under developing (Kano et al., 2015).We also install a sensor system in a building for monitoring motion and damages by a large earthquake (Nakashima et al., 2015). Those studies are eventually integrated to develop an advanced earthquake early warning system, which enables us to predict strong motions in an upper floor of a high-rise building.",

Among remote sensing technologies, airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) may be best suited for quantifying tropical forest carbon stocks. Our objective was to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) using airborne LiDAR and field plot data in Brazilian tropical rain forest. Forest attributes such as tree density, diameter at breast height, and heights were measured at a combination of square plots and linear transects (n=82) distributed across six different geographic zones in the Amazon. Using previously published allometric equations, tree AGB was computed and then summed to calculate total AGB at each sample plot. LiDAR-derived canopy structure metrics were also computed at each sample plot, and random forest regression modelling was applied to predict AGB from selected LiDAR metrics. The LiDAR-derived AGB model was assessed using the random forest explained variation, adjusted coefficient of determination (Adj. R²), root mean square error (RMSE, both absolute and relative) and BIAS (both absolute and relative). Our findings showed that the 99th percentile of height and height skewness were the best LiDAR metrics for AGB prediction. The AGB model using these two best predictors explained 59.59% of AGB variation, with an Adj. R² of 0.92, RMSE of 33.37 Mg/ha (20.28%), and bias of -0.69 (-0.42%). This study showed that LiDAR canopy structure metrics can be used to predict AGC stocks in Tropical Forest with acceptable precision and accuracy. Therefore, we conclude that there is good potential to monitor carbon sequestration in Brazilian Tropical Rain Forest using airborne LiDAR data, large field plots, and the random forest algorithm.",

            "abstract": "The NOAA/AVHRR (Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer) series of polar-orbiting earth-imagers have been flying since 1978 to the present and provide an opportunity to derive a long-term consistent set of well calibrated visible channel radiances for cloud, aerosol, and land use retrievals. This will allow climate modelers to investigate climate natural variability, intra-seasonal oscillations such as the ENSO, and feedback mechanisms over a 36-year record. Large climate perturbations, such as the 1982 and 1998 El Ninos as well as the 1982 El Chichon and 1992 Mt Pinatubo volcanic eruptions, have not been observed since 2000. The vicarious calibration method relies on temporally well characterized multiple pseudo-invariant calibration sites (PICS) referenced to the Aqua-MODIS calibration. The PICS are characterized by NOAA-16 TOA reflectances, over the full range of observed solar zenith angles of a NOAA degrading orbit culminating in a terminator orbit. The NOAA-16 reflectances are first calibrated against Aqua-MODIS using the simultaneous nadir overpass (SNO) method. Site characterization with NOAA-16 has the advantage of reducing the uncertainties associated with spectral band adjustments, since the AVHRR sensor spectral responses are similar. Consistent calibration between the individual desert, polar ice and deep convective cloud PICS approaches validates the methodology. The individual calibration gains are combined to provide the final merged calibration by weighting them by the inverse of their temporal variance. By combining by site stability ensures that site anomalous reflectance drifts do not adversely impact the calibration. Also the merged gain has a lower temporal variability than any individual PICS. In this study we describe the methodology used to derive a new set of calibration coefficients for Channel-1 0.65 (um) and Channel-2 (0.86 um) of the NOAA/AVHRR series of Polar-Orbiting imagers beginning in 1978. We will demonstrate the consistency of the individual PICS calibrations referenced to the merged gain. During the MODIS time frame, we will validate the contemporary AVHRR sensor calibration coefficients against Aqua-MODIS radiances using the simultaneous nadir overpass (SNO) method. We also discuss some of the key AVHRR calibration challenges and how they were overcome.",

In particular, anomalous accumulation of 2009 and 2011 in Dronning Maud Land in East Antarctica has been linked to atmospheric rivers. Were these years out of the ordinary? Did atmospheric rivers ever reach Antarctic prior to 2009? Should we expect more atmospheric river events to reach Antarctic coast in the future? To answer these questions we take a two-fold approach.\nFirst, we use the newly defined thresholds adjusted to cold Antarctic environment to assess the climatology of atmospheric rivers as seen by ERA Interim Reanalysis. We evaluate the occurrence of atmospheric rivers reaching the coast of Antarctica and consider the role of large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns, such as the Southern Annular mode (SAM), El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Zonal Wave 3 (ZW3). In addition, we compare our results with recent evaluation of poleward moisture transport reaching the coast of Antarctica.\nSecond, we perform a detailed investigation of May 2009 atmospheric river event using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model simulations. We investigate the synoptic scale development of a storm that led to an anomalous precipitation pattern in East Antarctic. We investigate the role of upper level vs lower level forcing in the formation of the storm. We also perform sensitivity studies to figure out the role of sea ice in the development of this system.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing is an engineering tool to create fractures in order to better recover oil and gas from low permeability reservoirs. Because microseismic events are generally associated with fracturing development, microseismic monitoring has been used to evaluate the fracking process. Microseismic monitoring generally relies on locating microseismic events to understand the spatial distribution of fractures. For the multi-stage fracturing treatment, fractures created in former stages are strong scatterers in the medium and can induce strong scattering waves on the waveforms for microseismic events induced during later stages. In this study, we propose to take advantage of microseismic scattering waves to image fracking zones by using seismic reverse time migration method.\nFor downhole microseismic monitoring that involves installing a string of seismic sensors in a borehole near the injection well, the observation geometry is actually similar to the VSP (vertical seismic profile) system. For this reason, we adapt the VSP migration method for the common shot gather to the common event gather. Microseismic reverse-time migration method involves solving wave equation both forward and backward in time for each microseismic event. At current stage, the microseismic RTM is based on 2D acoustic wave equation (Zhang and Sun, 2008), solved by the finite-difference method with PML absorbing boundary condition applied to suppress the reflections of artificial boundaries. Additionally, we use local wavefield decomposition instead of cross-correlation imaging condition to suppress the imaging noise.\nFor testing the method, we create a synthetic dataset for a downhole microseismic monitoring system with multiple fracking stages. It shows that microseismic migration using individual event is able to clearly reveal the fracture zone. The shorter distance between fractures and the microseismic event the clearer the migration image is. By summing migration images for many events, it can better reveal the fracture development during the hydraulic fracturing treatment. The synthetic test shows that microseismic migration is able to characterize the fracturing zone along with microseismic events. We will extend the method from 2D to 3D as well as from acoustic to elastic and apply it to real microseismic data.",

Both of these expeditions were focused around subduction zones and, therefore, had priorities to determine time frames for the initiation of subduction. There are two main objectives for this study, the first being to age-date Pleistocene to Miocene sediments from the western offshore continental margin of Costa Rica (IODP Expedition 334) via calcareous nannofossils. The second objective is to age-date the Miocene sediments from the fore-arc of the Izu-Bonin-Mariana system, east of Japan (IODP Expedition 352), using calcareous nannofossils. Shore-based analysis allows for high-resolution study to determine exact biostratigraphic zonations. These zonations reflect specific time frames based on the occurrence or non-occurrence of certain nannofossil species. Once these zonations are determined, scientists can use the data to identify the initiation of seismic processes that often occur in these regions.\nCalcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy has now provided zonations for the samples taken from IODP Expedition 334 cores. Samples from core 6R are assigned to the Pleistocene nannofossil Zone NN19 due to the presence ofPseudoemiliania lacunosa and the absence of Emiliania huxleyi. Using the zonal scheme by de Kaenel (1999), this can further be broken down into Event 18 due to the presence of Gephyrocapsa oceanica larger than 4 µm but less than 5 µm, the presence of Calcidiscus macintyrei smaller than 11 µm, and the absence ofGephyrocapsa caribbeanica larger than 4 µm. De Kaenel (1999) has assigned this event datum an age of 1.718 Ma using orbital time scales and oxygen isotope data. Below these samples, an extensive hiatus ranges from the Pleistocene to the early Miocene. Samples from cores 7R through 10R are assigned to nannofossil zone NN5; however, it is impossible to constrain the top of this zone due to the hiatus. The presence of Sphenolithus heteromorphus and other restrictive species, and the absence of Helicosphaera ampliaperta and Sphenolithus belemnos help constrain these samples to Zone NN5 (13.2Ma to 14.66Ma).\nFurther work as above will be conducted to analyze Miocene samples from IODP Expedition 352.",

            "abstract": "Water and energy are two vital resources for human and are intrinsically linked. China is a country with acute water problems caused by increasing demand, uneven spatial-temporal distribution of water resources, and water quality deterioration. These issues are exacerbating the country’s water scarcity. Meanwhile, demands for both traditional and non-traditional water resources continue to rise, driven by the country’s rapid economic expansion and industrialization. To meet growing water demands, more and more energy is used for water extraction, transportation and treatment. While projects such as deep groundwater pumping, long distance water transfer and seawater desalination are adding crucial supplies of fresh water, they are consuming an ever greater amount of energy. Thus, a better understanding of water-energy linkages is important for integrated water and energy policy analysis and planning.\nIn this study, data from multiple sources are compiled and used to calculate energy consumption for different processes of water utilization in China, including water abstraction, treatment, and distribution, as well as wastewater treatment and re-use. Sankey diagrams are used to display the magnitude and direction of water and energy flows in China at the national level. Spatial distributions of energy use by different components of the water supply were further mapped at the provincial level to discern regional differences. The results of this study show that, for the main processes considered, water utilization consumes 193.5 TWh of electricity, or about 4% of the total national electricity usage. The highest percentage of energy consumption for water is attributed to water provision process. The outcome of this study has important implications for policy reforms involving water conservation strategies, water supply structure changes and technical solutions, which, in turn, will contribute to achieving the goal of low-energy water utilization in the future.",

We recently developed techniques to synthesize translucent~transparent polycrystalline garnets at high very high pressure and temperature using Kawai-type multianvil apparatus. However, the grain sizes of these garnets remained significantly larger than 1 mm, which are not small enough for the measurements with GHz ultrasonic interferometry because of significant acoustic scattering by grain boundaries.\nWe further developed the synthesis techniques and have succeeded to make well-sintered bodies of grossular and pyrope garnets made of nano-crystals (< 100 nm) at limited temperature ranges at a pressure of 15 GPa. Thus synthesized nano-polycrystalline garnets (NPG) are as transparent as the single crystals, having Real In-line Transmissions (RITs) close to those predicted by the refractive indices for the wide wave-length range in the visible light region.\nThe present ultra-high pressure synthesis technique provides a new way to make transparent nano-polycrystalline minerals, which should be important not only for the mineral physics measurements but also for some industrial/scientific applications, such as novel photonic materials.",

Specifically, UCSD will be supplying 5-minute forecasts to predict ramp events for the UESS, which will then discharge/charge the system as appropriate for the event. Four different metrics will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the UCSD advective forecast with the UESS: (1) The root mean square error, root mean bias, and root mean absolute error will be calculated for the 5-minute forecast using measured irradiance from the UCSD DEMROES stations and compared to a persistence forecast (2) A “matching” error analysis will be performed to compare the 5-minute forecasted cloud cover of the PV system to the actual cloud cover at the forecasted time (3) The matching error of the advective forecast will be compared to the matching error of a persistence forecast to determine if, operationally, advective or persistence forecast performs best (4) Timing of predicted ramp events using the advective forecast will be compared to actual ramp events experienced by the UESS.\nThe above metrics will also be used to analyze the effectiveness of cross-correlational and optical flow advective schemes in an operational setting. The cross-correlational method analyzes images from two different times to find an average velocity vector for cloud cover. Optical flow uses images from two time steps to find a velocity vector for each pixel of an image, allowing different sections of clouds to move at different speeds and directions. Hence, it is hypothesized the optical flow advective scheme will perform better then the cross-correlation method in operational settings.",

The glacial chronology of Big Cottonwood Canyon, Wasatch Range, Utah is poorly understood, and has not been assessed since the early 1900’s. We used a variety of modern techniques to establish new understanding of Late Pleistocene glaciation in Big Cottonwood and other Wasatch Range canyons. An absolute chronology was established through the use of cosmogenic nuclide (beryllium-10) exposure age dating; we processed seventeen samples from moraine boulders, erratics, and striated bedrock throughout Big Cottonwood Canyon. Remote mapping of glacial landforms was completed using 2-meter LiDAR digital elevation models, and all identified landforms later verified and mapped in the field. We then used a coupled energy-mass-balance and ice-flow model to 1. infer ice extents in Big Cottonwood Canyon, incorporating neighboring canyons with well constrained maxima; and 2. explore paleoclimate conditions during the Late Pleistocene necessary to reproduce these ice extents. Results reveal new information regarding the influence of Pleistocene Lake Bonneville on climate and landscape evolution in the Wasatch Range during and following the Last Glacial Maximum.",

The inverse spectral method for Te calculation, whether continental or oceanic, is often used the relationship between observed gravity (free air gravity anomaly or Bouguer gravity anomaly) and topography data in the spatial frequency (wavenumber) domain, namely the admittance and coherence. Especially in recent years, many authors more and more tend to use the Bouguer gravity anomaly inverting Te by calculating Bouguer admittance and Bouguer coherence. Since the thickness of oceanic sediments is very small compared with the thickness of crust or lithosphere which is several tens of kilometers, few people focus on the influence of the sediment on the Te calculation in oceanic basin. In some studies which areas comprise thick sedimentary basins, we found that the Te is overestimated using the wavelets and Bouguer gravity data in the areas which have thick sediment layers. While the spatial distribution of Te is great changed by using the gravity data after sediment correction under the same method and parameters, such as the overestimates decrease or deviation. So we suggest that the influence of gravity anomalies in sediment layers is very important to the Te calculation in oceanic basins, and it is perhaps better that using the gravity data after sediment correction instead of Bouguer data in inverting Te calculation.",

            "abstract": "An improved understanding of sustainability is increasingly a subject in educational settings. Marine science classes are perfect settings of establishing sustainability awareness owing to declining populations of organisms and perceived collapse in fisheries worldwide. Students in oceanography classes often request more direct exposure to actual ocean situations or field trips. During regular session (13 week) or shorter term (4 week) summer classes such long trips are logistically difficult owing to large numbers of students involved or timing. This new approach to such a course supplement addresses the requests by utilizing local resources and short field trips for a limited number of students (20) to locations in which Ocean experiences are available, and are often supported through education and outreach components. The vision of the class was a mixture of classroom time, readings, along with paper and laboratories. In addition, short day-long trips to locations where the ocean was “captured” were also used to supplement the experience as well as speakers involved with aquaculture. Central Virginia is a fortunate location for such a class, with close access for travel to the Chesapeake Bay and numerous field stations, museums with ocean-based exhibits (the Smithsonian and National Zoo) that address both extant and extinct Earth history, as well as national/state aquaria in Baltimore and Virginia Beach. Furthermore, visits to local seafood markets at local grocery stores, or larger city markets in Washington, Baltimore and Virginia Beach, enhance the exposure to productivity in the ocean, and viability of the fisheries sustainability. The course could then address not only the particulars of the marine science, but also aspects of sustainability with discussions on ethics, including keeping animals in captivity or overfishing of particular species and the special difficulties that arise from captive or culturing ocean populations. In addition, the class was encouraged to post web-based journals of experiences in order to share opinions of observations in each of the settings, including the evaluation of the foods they were consuming during the class",

The optimized code designing the hazard on a topological structure mashes the metric of the phenomena. The deviations in the metric of different phenomena push and/or pull the fold of the other suitable phenomena. For example if the metric of a specific phenomenon A fits to the metric of another specific phenomenon B after variation processes generated with the deviation of the metric of previous phenomenon A.\nDefining manifold processes covering the metric characteristics of each of every phenomenon is possible for all the physical events; i.e., natural hazards. There are suitable folds in those manifold groups so that each subfold fits to the metric characteristics of one of the natural hazard category at least. Some variation algorithms on those metric structures prepare a gauge effect bringing the long time stability of Earth for largely scaled periods. The realization of that stability depends on some specific conditions. These specific conditions are called optimized codes. The analytical basics of processes in topological structures are developed in [1]. The codes are generated according to the structures in [2].\nSome optimized codes are derived related to the seismicity of NAF beginning from the quakes of the year 1999.\n",

The greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission of the energy sector in South Korea is very huge, about 600 MtCO2e in 2011. Also the carbon footprint due to the energy consumption contributes to the ecological footprint is also large, more than 60%. Based on the official plans (the national greenhouse gases emission reduction target for 2030 (GHG target for 2030) and the 2nd Energy Master Plan (2nd EMP)), several scenarios were proposed and the sensitivity of the GHG emission amount and ‘overshoot ratio’ which is the ratio of ecological footprint to biocapacity were estimated. It was found that to meet the GHG target for 2030 the ratio of non-emission energy for power generation should be over 71% which would be very difficult. We also found that the overshoot ratio would increase from 5.9 in 2009 to 7.6 in 2035. Thus, additional efforts are required to reduce the environmental burdens in addition to optimize the power mix configuration. One example is the conversion efficiency in power generation. If the conversion efficiency in power generation rises up 50% from the current level, 40%, the energy demand and resultant carbon dioxide emissions would decrease about 10%. Also the influence on the environment through changes in consumption behavior, for example, the diet choice is expected to be meaningful.",

            "abstract": "The Lower Jurassic Talkeetna Formation (Jtk), a >1,000-km-long belt of vol­canic facies within the accreted intra-oceanic Talkeetna Arc has been characterized within the Talkeetna Mountains, but on the Alaska Peninsula Jtk facies have not previously been described in detail. Here we describe facies of the Jtk stretching from the Iniskin Peninsula to Tuxedni Bay.\nOn the Iniskin Peninsula, a high concentration and great thickness of mafic to intermediate lavas, associated autobreccias and hyaloclastites, fluidal-clast breccias and possible pillows are suggestive of one or more submarine effusive eruption centers. Also volumetrically significant are non-stratified polymictic volcaniclastic breccia facies. Minor facies include thinly bedded volcaniclastic sandstone to pebble breccia-conglomerate facies, some of which are shard- and pumice-bearing pyroclastic deposits preserved in thinly bedded deposits, indicative of episodes of explosive volcanism and the eruption-fed nature of some of the deposits.\nNorth of Chinitna Bay, coherent facies tend to be thin and relatively small in volume. Volcaniclastic facies provide evidence of subaerial-fluvial deposition, and pyroclastic activity. Thinly bedded, laterally continuous beds locally exhibit cross-laminations, channel fills, normal grading and lenticular beds, and contain plant fossils. Within this sequence is a 10-m-thick pumice breccia containing fossilized logs, underlain by a thin, weakly laminated, pumice- and lithic-bearing volcaniclastic siltstone to sandstone. The log-bearing pumice breccia and the lithic-bearing laminated basal unit represent pyroclastic density current (PDC) facies deposited in a subaerial or possibly shallow aqueous environment. Underlying the PDC deposit are several 30-cm-thick maroon and olive green volcaniclastic fine-grained sandstone and siltstone beds containing channel fills, cross-beds and lenticular beds.\nMarbles exposed in the contact zone between the intrusions of Alaska-Aleutian Batholith and the Jtk, indicate relatively shallow marine deposition at the base of the Jtk. The marbles are interbedded with poorly sorted volcaniclastic sandstones and breccias, some pumice-bearing.",

            "abstract": "Drilling-induced damage to coring samples has been a problem ever since coring sampling began. Often this is from the fragility of certain formations (sands, for example) being sampled. Other times, the act of coring itself affects the core samples (e.g., biscuitting). One new recognized factor affecting core recovery comes from coring at extreme depths in scientific drilling.\nDuring IODP Expedition 343, J-FAST, D/V Chikyu drilled and cored to 7760.5 mBRT. An experiment to collect borehole temperature and pressure data was attempted by running an empty inner core barrel holding 3 pressure and temperature data recorders. Although the temperature experiment failed, pressure data indicated that the inner core barrel experienced severe elastic shock when recovered by the core line winch cable.\nThe elastic response delay of the core line winch cable, and subsequent bouncing of the core barrel as it is being recovered to the drill floor are examined; methods of minimizing this damage are offered. This becomes more important as the Center for Deep Earth Exploration and D/V Chikyu prepare for drilling and sampling the Nankai megasplay fault/plate boundary estimated to lie at 7500 mBRT.",

            "abstract": "Convection and magnetic field of the Earth's outer core are expected to have vast length scales. To resolve these flows, high performance computing is required for geodynamo simulations using spherical harmonics transform (SHT), a significant portion of the execution time is spent on the Legendre transform. Calypso is a geodynamo code designed to model magnetohydrodynamics of a Boussinesq fluid in a rotating spherical shell, such as the outer core of the Earth. The code has been shown to scale well on computer clusters capable of computing at the order of 10⁵ cores using Message Passing Interface (MPI) and Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) parallelization for CPUs. To further optimize, we investigate three different algorithms of the SHT using GPUs. One is to preemptively compute the Legendre polynomials on the CPU before executing SHT on the GPU within the time integration loop. In the second approach, both the Legendre polynomials and the SHT are computed on the GPU simultaneously. In the third approach , we initially partition the radial grid for the forward transform and the harmonic order for the backward transform between the CPU and GPU. There after, the partitioned works are simultaneously computed in the time integration loop. We examine the trade-offs between space and time, memory bandwidth and GPU computations on Maverick, a Texas Advanced Computing Center (TACC) supercomputer. We have observed improved performance using a GPU enabled Legendre transform. Furthermore, we will compare and contrast the different algorithms in the context of GPUs.",

            "abstract": "It is well established that sedimentary basins can increase the amplification and duration of earthquake ground motion. Past earthquakes have shown that site effects have a major influence on seismic damage and loss in urban areas. However, the response at any given site can vary significantly, even within the LA basin. We aim to investigate site response within the LA Basin through the application of the Horizontal-to-Vertical (H/V) spectral ratio method. This method was applied to 3-component broadband waveforms from the Los Angeles Syncline Seismic Interferometry Experiment (LASSIE). LASSIE is a collaborative, temporary, and dense array of 73 broadband seismometers that were active for a two month period starting October 2014 until November 2014, transecting the Los Angeles basin from Long Beach to La Puente. We use the Geopsy software to measure the fundamental frequency and minimum site amplification at each station. Data analysis and interpretation were conducted in accordance to the Site Effects Assessment Using Ambient Excitations (SESAME) guidelines for implementing the H/V ratio technique for investigations of site effects. Results from our initial data analysis indicate an average fundamental period at the basin center of 6 s – 12 s and peaks in the spectral ratio curves at much shorter periods for sites the basin edge of. We will show maps of the amplification and fundamental frequencies based on our spectral ratio analysis of the LASSIE data and compare our results with damage patterns of historic earthquakes, as well as models of the LA basin.",

ISF Academy is a private Chinese bilingual school in Hong Kong serving over 1500 students K-12, following the framework and curriculum of the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO).\nThe strategy behind the implementation of this policy includes: development of a scientific sustainable curriculum that is age appropriate; establish a culture of sustainability within the ISF community and beyond to the wider HK community; install sustainable infrastructure that allows students to learn; and learn first hand sustainable living practices. It is well understood that solutions to the environmental challenges facing Hong Kong and our planet will require multiple disciplines.\nThe current sustainability programs at ISF include: a) a whole school aerobic food waste composting system and organic farming, b) energy consumption monitoring of existing buildings, c) upcoming installation of an air pollution monitoring equipment that will correlate with the AQHI data collected by the Hong Kong government, d) a Renewable Energy Education Center (REEC) that will teach students about RE and also produce solar energy for classroom consumption, and e) student lead environmental group that manages the paper and used cooking oil recycling on campus.\nThe Shuyuan Science and Sustainability faculty work closely with classroom teachers to ensure that the above mentioned projects are incorporated into the curriculum throughout the school. Interdisciplinary units (IDU) of study are being developed that encourage faculty and students to work across subject areas. Projects include Personal Projects, Extended Essays, bilingual organic farming for primary school students, and opportunities for students to work with outside researchers. There are also specific enrichment courses taught: green chemistry, earth systems, sustainability in a changing world, and natural water systems. Since 2013, senior students have presented at AGU Fall Meetings.",

            "abstract": "The asteroids preserve information from the earliest times in solar system history, with compositions in the population reflecting the material in the solar nebula and experiencing a wide range of temperatures. Today they experience ongoing processes, some of which are shared with larger bodies but some of which are unique to their size regime. They are critical to humanity’s future as potential threats, resource sites, and targets for human visitation. However, over twenty years since the first spacecraft encounters with asteroids, they remain poorly understood. The mission we propose here, the Main-belt Asteroid and NEO Tour with Imaging and Spectroscopy (MANTIS), explores the diversity of asteroids to understand our solar system’s past history, its present processes, and future opportunities and hazards.\nMANTIS addresses many of NASA’s highest priorities as laid out in its 2014 Science Plan and provides additional benefit to the Planetary Defense and Human Exploration communities via a low-risk, cost-effective tour of the near-Earth and inner asteroid belt. MANTIS visits the materials that witnessed solar system formation and its earliest history, addressing the NASA goal of exploring and observing the objects in the solar system to understand how they formed and evolve. MANTIS measures OH, water, and organic materials via several complementary techniques, visiting and sampling objects known to have hydrated minerals and addressing the NASA goal of improving our understanding of the origin and evolution of life on Earth. MANTIS studies the geology and geophysics of nine diverse asteroids, with compositions ranging from water-rich to metallic, representatives of both binary and non-binary asteroids, and sizes covering over two orders of magnitude, providing unique information about the chemical and physical processes shaping the asteroids, addressing the NASA goal of advancing the understanding of how the chemical and physical processes in our solar system operate, interact, and evolve. Finally, the set of measurements carried out by MANTIS at near-Earth and main-belt asteroids will by definition characterize objects in the solar system that pose threats to Earth or offer resources for human exploration, a final goal in the NASA Science Plan.",

            "abstract": "Although the forecasting of mainshocks is not possible, recent research demonstrates that probabilistic forecasts of expected aftershock activity following moderate and strong earthquakes is possible. Previous work has shown that aftershock sequences in intraplate regions behave similarly to those in California, and thus the operational aftershocks forecasting methods that are currently employed in California can be adopted for use in areas of the eastern U.S. such as New England. In our application, immediately after a felt earthquake in New England, a forecast of expected aftershock activity for the next 7 days will be generated based on a generic aftershock activity model. Approximately 24 hours after the mainshock, the parameters of the aftershock model will be updated using the observed aftershock activity observed to that point in time, and a new forecast of expected aftershock activity for the next 7 days will be issued. The forecast will estimate the average number of weak, felt aftershocks and the average expected number of aftershocks based on the aftershock statistics of past New England earthquakes. The forecast also will estimate the probability that an earthquake that is stronger than the mainshock will take place during the next 7 days. The aftershock forecast will specify the expected aftershocks locations as well as the areas over which aftershocks of different magnitudes could be felt. The system will use web pages, email and text messages to distribute the aftershock forecasts. For protracted aftershock sequences, new forecasts will be issued on a regular basis, such as weekly. Initially, the distribution system of the aftershock forecasts will be limited, but later it will be expanded as experience with and confidence in the system grows.",

We develop a statistical relationship through multiple linear regression (MLR) to quantify the impact of the BH variations on surface ozone variability during the ozone season in the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) area, a major ozone nonattainment region on the Gulf Coast. We find that the variability in BH location, represented by a longitude index of the BH west edge (BH-Lon) in the MLR, explains 50-60% of the year-to-year variability in monthly mean ozone over HGB for Jun and July during 1998-2013, and the corresponding figure for Aug and Sep is 20%. Additional 30%-40% of the ozone variability for Aug and Sep can be explained by the variability in BH strength, represented by two BH intensity indices (BHI) in the MLR, but its contribution is only 5% for June and not significant for July. Including a maximum Through stepwise regression based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the MLR model captures 58~72% of monthly ozone variability during Jun-Sep with a cross-validation R2 of 0.5. This observation-derived statistical relationship will be valuable to constrain model simulations of ozone variability attributable to large-scale circulation patterns.",

These intruding downslope windstorm-type flows are produced when the depth of the temperature inversion and accompanying southwesterly downslope flow on the surrounding gently sloping plain exceeds the height of the crater rim. As the southwesterly katabatic flow approaches the crater it decelerates, splits around the crater at elevations below the crater rim, and cascades over the crater rim at upper elevations. The intruding cold katabatic air accelerates down the inner sidewall of the crater, perturbing the prexisting shallow inversion on the crater floor, sometimes creating the atmospheric equivalent of ocean or lake basin seiches. When the cold air intrusions are strong, warm air is brought down into the crater from the upwind atmosphere above the mesoscale inversion, and hydraulic jumps may form on the southwest side of the crater while leaving the rest of the crater atmosphere relatively undisturbed. In this talk, evidence for these flow features will be presented, featuring dual Doppler and time-lapse IR animations of the intruding flows.",

Its deformation pattern can be viewed as the key to constrain the dynamic evolution of the Tibetan Plateau. Studies from northern Qilian Shan revealed an image of the forward propagation of the range growth (Zheng Wj Helishan paper, Qilian 9Ma, Yumushan ~3-4Ma, Heli Shan, ~2Ma). However, researches are still sparse to reveal late Cenozoic deformation along the southern Qilian Shan. To quantify the evolution of the Qilian Shan, we therefore carry out thermochronology study at Huaitoutala region within the adjacent Qaidam basin and southern Qilian Shan transition belt.\nOur thermal modeling of fission track results show that the rapid exhumation of the southern Qilian Shan was initiated at 13-15Ma ago, providing the dominated sediments to the Huaitoutala region, which was also verified by the paleocurrent data within the Huaitoutala section. Sediment recycling was further revealed by our detrital fission track data. Both the paleocurrent and lithoface data indicate that the onset of rapid rising of the Oulongbuluke Mountain was at about 6~8Ma ago. Growth strata were observed at the bottom of Qigequan formation led us to conclude that the Huaitoutala anticline began to form at about 2.5-3.5Ma ago. The folded and faulted Qigequan formation and the overlying Quaternary sediments all suggest that the faulting movement were active during Quaternary.\nIn summary, our study revealed an out-of-sequence pattern of late Cenozoic deformation along the southern margin of the Qilian Shan, different from the previous finding from northern Qilian Shan. 1)at 13-15Ma ago, exhumation and rapid uplift began along the southern Qilian Shan. 2)starting from 6-8Ma ago, the tectonic activity propagated southward to the Oulongbuluke Mountain region 3) at about 2.5-3.5 Ma ago, however, the deformation jumped backward to the north near Huaitoutala reservoir region, between the southern Qilian Shan and uplifted Oulongbuluke Mountain. We hypothesize here that this out-of-sequence deformation was resulted from the stress rebalance between southward expanding of the Qilian Shan and the resistance of the more rigid Qaidam basement. Our finding indicates a complex spatial and temporal evolution for this young outward growing margin of the Tibetan Plateau.",

            "abstract": "We estimate methane fluxes across Alaska over a multi-year period using observations from a three-year aircraft campaign, the Carbon Arctic Reservoirs Vulnerability Experiment (CARVE). Existing estimates of methane from Alaska and other Arctic regions disagree in both magnitude and distribution, and before the CARVE campaign, atmospheric observations in the region were sparse. We combine these observations with an atmospheric particle trajectory model and a geostatistical inversion to estimate surface fluxes at the model grid scale. We first use this framework to estimate the spatial distribution of methane fluxes across the state. We find the largest fluxes in the south-east and North Slope regions of Alaska. This distribution is consistent with several estimates of wetland extent but contrasts with the distribution in most existing flux models. These flux models concentrate methane in warmer or more southerly regions of Alaska compared to the estimate presented here. This result suggests a discrepancy in how existing bottom-up models translate wetland area into methane fluxes across the state. We next use the inversion framework to explore inter-annual variability in regional-scale methane fluxes for 2012-2014. We examine the extent to which this variability correlates with weather or other environmental conditions. These results indicate the possible sensitivity of wetland fluxes to near-term variability in climate.",

            "abstract": "Kings Bowl is a ~2200ka pit crater created by a phreatic blast along a volcanic fissure in the eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP), Idaho. The main crater measures approximately 80m in length, 30m in width, and 30m in depth, with smaller pits located nearby on the Great Rift fissure, and has been targeted by the FINESSE team as a possible analogue for Cyane Fossae, Mars. The phreatic eruption is believed to have occurred due to the interaction of groundwater with lava draining back into the fissure following a lava lake high stand, erupting already solidified basalt from this and previous ERSP lava flows. The contemporaneous draw back of the lava with the explosions may conceal some smaller possible blast pits as more lava drained into the newly formed pits. Ballistic ejecta from the blasts occur on both sides of the fissure. To the east, the ballistic blocks are mantled by fine tephra mixed with eolian dust, the result of a westerly wind during the explosions. We use differential GPS to map the distribution of ballistic blocks on the west side of the fissure, recording position, percent vesiculation, and the length of 3 mutually perpendicular axes for each block >20cm along multiple transects parallel to the fissure. From the several hundred blocks recorded, we have been able to separate the ballistic field into several distinct blast deposits on the basis of size distributions and block concentration. The smaller pits identified from the ballistic fields correspond broadly to the northern and southern limits of the tephra/dust field east of the fissure. Soil formation and bioturbation of the tephra by sagebrush have obliterated any tephrostratigraphy that could have been linked to individual blasts. The ballistic block patterns at Kings Bowl may be used to identify distinct ejecta groups in high-resolution imagery of Mars or other planetary bodies.",

            "abstract": "Continued study of Archean rocks is important for calibrating the thermal history of the mantle and crust, and the resulting geodynamic settings of lithosphere formation. The Pilbara craton in northwestern Australia contains an important record of Mesoarchean tectonics as it preserves granite-gneiss domes bound by greenschist facies supracrustals that typify many Archean terranes. These structures and their comparison with modern orogenic belts are key to the debate regarding the secular evolution of tectonics on Earth.\nIn order to better understand the thermo-tectonic evolution of the eastern Pilbara craton, we obtained ID-TIMS apatite and titanite U-Pb ages (with nominal Tc of 350-550 °C) from three of the most prominent granite-gneiss domes. Our data are compared to existing models for dome and keel formation, which hypothesize thermal incubation of the middle crust leading to gravitational instability and partial convective overturn ca. 3.3 Ga.\nThe three ca. 30-50 km diameter domes currently under investigation record diverse apatite cooling ages. They show:\n (1) Radial cooling patterns, where the center of the dome cooled ~15 Ma after the outer rim, supporting diapiric emplacement or post-intrusion cooling (Corunna Downs dome). (2) Large ranges in cooling ages between 3.3 and 2.95 Ga, that indicate portions of these domes were above ~400 ˚C after 3.3 Ga (Mt. Edgar dome). Preliminary thermal modeling shows that partial resetting of apatite due to post tectonic intrusions is possible but unlikely, potentially indicating that young cooling ages reflect tectonic exhumation. (3) Older cooling ages of ~3.44 Ga that indicate early emplacement, deformation and exhumation into the upper crust, which are not well explained by current models (Muccan dome). These thermochronological data provides new temporal constraints on the thermal and deformation history of the eastern Pilbara craton, which are key for constraining increasingly sophisticated models for Mesoarchean geodynamics.",

The MJO could significantly impact the global weather and climate [Zhang, 2005]. Recent studies also suggested that the Northern Hemisphere (NH) stratospheric polar vortex could be modulated by the MJO with strengthened (weakened) polar vortex during the enhanced (suppressed) convection in the tropical central Pacific Ocean [Garfinkel et al., 2014]. Using the Aura/Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) observations, Specified Dynamics of Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (SD-WACCM), and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis interim dataset datasets, we study the MJO impacts in the stratosphere and mesosphere. During the MJO phase 7 when the deep convection propagates to the central Pacific Ocean, we see in both satellite observation and SD-WACCM simulation the NH stratosphere polar temperature warming and mesosphere cooling. The opposite temperature anomalous pattern is seen in the equatorial region. We will discuss the mechanism of the mesosphere responses to MJO using SD-WACCM and ECMWF.",

            "abstract": "The dominant degree-2 pattern of mantle convection is a commonly inferred feature from seismological observations (Dziewonski et al., 2010). This pattern is likely associated with large-scale structures like hotspot super-swells and Pacific subduction-zones. The mechanism that dictates this long-wavelength structure is currently a subject of debate. Interestingly, mantle convection models featuring temperature- and depth-dependent viscosity and Earth-like convective vigor typically predict a shorter characteristic wavelength, reflected in the spatial distribution of upwelling plumes and downwellings (Zhong et al., 2000). Plate generating physics is an additional effect that possibly governs the long-wavelength convective pattern; i.e., tectonic plates constitute the top cold thermal boundary layer, subduction of which is the most efficient component of the mantles convective heat transport.\nTo address the effect of plate generation on convective wavelength, we combine a boundary-layer model of mantle convection (Turcotte & Oxburgh, 1967), with the grain-damage model of lithospheric shear-localization (Bercovici & Ricard, 2012). As shown by Solomatov (1995), the strongly temperature-dependent viscosity of Earth materials would render it in the stagnant lid regime of convection, much like what is observed on Venus. Grain-damage allows for self-weakening that remobilizes the lithosphere, making plate like flow possible. Such self-weakening necessarily has an effect on the length of the lithospheric boundary layer and hence convective wavelength. Our simple model thus infers a characteristic size of tectonic plates for a given convective vigor. Superposition of the long convective length-scale, dictated by the cold, stiff, yet damaged and deformable thermal boundary layer, onto the length-scale dictated by convective instability yields a range of material parameters for which the convective pattern is consistent with observations.",

In addition to measures of participation, completion, and performance, we have administered surveys of the learners that measure science literacy, attitudes towards science and technology, and sources of information about science. Beyond the usual core of video lectures and quizzes, we have used peer reviewed writing assignments, observing project, and citizen science to create a richer learning environment.

TIDDBIT is a fully digital HF Doppler sounder that uses CW signals across a spaced array. TIDDBIT systems have been deployed in Texas, Virginia, Florida, Hawaii, and Peru. TIDDBIT measures the entire wave packet, including the horizontal and vertical phase propagation speeds as a function of TID period from the acoustic (1-min) to the gravity wave (10-90 min) part of the spectrum. It is desirable to be able to use these data to specify the TID structure not only at the measurement height, but to extend it in 3D to greater and lower heights, and beyond the immediate vicinity of the TIDDBIT system.

It is pertinent to build a robust coupled flash flood and landslide disaster early warning system for disaster preparedness and hazard management based. In this study, we built an ensemble-based coupled flash flood and landslide disaster early warning system, which is aimed for operational use by the US National Weather Service, by integrating the Coupled Routing and Excess STorage (CREST) model and Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting Model (SAC-SMA) with the physically based SLope-Infiltration-Distributed Equilibrium (SLIDE) landslide prediction model. We further evaluated this ensemble-based prototype warning system by conducting multi-year simulations driven by the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) rainfall estimates in North Carolina and Oregon. We comprehensively evaluated the predictive capabilities of this system against observed and reported flood and landslides events. We then evaluated the sensitivity of the coupled system to the simulated hydrological processes. Our results show that the system is generally capable of making accurate predictions of flash flood and landslide events in terms of their locations and time of occurrence. The occurrence of predicted landslides show high sensitivity to total infiltration and soil water content, highlighting the importance of accurately simulating the hydrological processes on the accurate forecasting of rainfall triggered landslide events.",

These log structures were designed to address many of the restoration goals including creating scour pools, creating and maintaining a sinuous river planform, providing fish cover, and increasing complexity of fish habitat. This study uses geomorphic change detection techniques to monitor topographic change under and around the 26 log structures in two different river reaches over a six to seven year period. This study finds that the ELJs are remaining stable within the river, even following a large flood in 2011. While some pools are shallowing or shifting laterally slightly, in general they are maintaining deep pool habitat. The study provides insight into which log structure variables are most related to the patterns and amounts of aggradation and degradation. Analysis suggests that volume of aggradation is related to both porosity and volume of the log structures, while the area of aggradation was correlated with porosity, as well as, the proportion of logs within bankfull. Understanding the geomorphic changes to the riverbed in response to the placement of the ELJs can influence the design and future effectiveness of ELJs.",

            "abstract": "Flooding is one of the most hazardous and damaging natural disasters causing serious economic loss and casualties across the world (Jongman et al., 2015). Previous studies showed that the global temperature increase affects regional weather pattern, and several general circulation model (GCM) simulations suggest the increase of flood events in both frequency and magnitude in many parts of the world (Hirabayashi et al., 2013). Effective adaptation to potential flood risks under the warming climate requires an in-depth understanding of both the physical and socioeconomic contributors of the flood risk. To assess the realistic future potential flood risk, future sophisticated vulnerability scenarios associated with the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) are necessary.\nIn this study we propose a new future vulnerability scenarios in mortality. Our vulnerability scenarios are constructed based on the modeled flood exposure (population potentially suffered by flooding) and a past from 1980 to 2005. All the flood fatality data were classified according to four income levels (high, mid-high, mid-low and low). Our proposed scenarios have three pathways regarding to SSPs; High efficiency (HE) scenario (SSP1, SSP4 (rich country) and SSP5), Medium efficiency (ME) scenario (SSP2), and Low efficiency (LE) scenario (SSP3 and SSP4 (poor country)). The maximum mortality protection level on each category was detected by applying exponential curve fitting with offset term. Slopes in the HE scenario are assumed to be equal to slopes estimated by regression analysis in each category. The slope in the HE scenario is defined by the mean value of all countries’ slope value that is approximately -0.33 mortality decreases per year. The EM-DAT mortality data shows a decreasing trend in time in almost all of the countries. Although mortalities in some countries show an increasing trend, this is because these countries were affected by once-in-hundred-years floods after 1990’s. The slope in the ME scenario are half of that in the HE scenario, and a quarter in the LE scenario. In addition, we set three categories depending on mortality level. Our proposed vulnerability scenarios would enable us to reasonably replicate self-sustained vulnerability change against flood hazard associated with the SSPs.",

The upper mantle beneath the Main Ethiopian Rift and the East African Rift farther south has been seismically imaged following the deployment of several temporary regional arrays. However, due to uneven distribution of seismic arrays, key questions regarding a connection between these upper mantle anomalies at the Turkana Depression and the effect that the thick Congo Craton has on diverting upwelling material towards the East African Rift are poorly resolved. We use overlapping records from several temporary and permanent broadband seismic arrays (1980-2014) located throughout the African continent and surrounding regions in order to image the upper mantle beneath the East African Rift and the Congo Craton where regional seismic arrays have not been deployed. We do this by seismic ambient noise tomography using the recently developed frequency-time normalization (FTN) method to extract empirical Green’s functions (EGFs) at periods of 7-250 seconds. We cross correlate the normalized continuous records and stack them to obtain EGFs for each temporally coincident station-station pair. We simulate wave propagation through a spherical Earth using a finite-difference method, measure phase delay times between synthetics and EGFs, and invert them for velocity perturbations with 3D Rayleigh wave sensitivity kernels. We will present results from full-wave ambient noise inversions that illuminate upper mantle structure throughout the continent, with particular focus on the Congo Craton and northern sections of the East African Rift System.",

            "abstract": "Amazonian tropical ecosystems cycle large amounts of carbon and water. The interactions between Amazonian hydrologic and carbon cycles are uncertain and therefore an important research topic. We analyzed the water and carbon budgets in a ~9,000 km2 central Amazon basin near Manaus, Brazil, using an observationally constrained (streamflow) and tested process-based adaptive watershed simulator (PAWS) coupled with the community land model (CLM). The coupled model (PAWS+CLM) includes detailed representations of subsurface and land surface hydrologic and carbon cycle processes. We compared model predictions with site observed carbon states and fluxes (LAI, NPP, and GPP), satellite-based estimates of evapotranspiration and Leaf Area Index (LAI), and water storage anomalies from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite. The simulated results and correlation analysis support the following observations. First, the high-resolution, distributed PAWS+CLM model better matches available hydrologic and carbon cycle observations than the one-dimensional CLM. Second, in this tropical forest headwater basin, most hydrologic components are very sensitive to precipitation forcing, while ET is not. Third, groundwater is the dominant contributor to streamflow, although the streamflow peaks are highly correlated with intense precipitation input. Fourth, carbon fluxes, represented by LAI, NPP and GPP are correlated with hydrologic processes both temporally and spatially, and in particular to ET and groundwater flow. Our simulations provide new estimates of water budgets and storage changes in an Amazonian headwater catchment. The results suggest that prognostic groundwater and lateral flows are important for accurate representation of hydrologic and carbon fluxes at the watershed scale and that accurate prediction of these processes requires accurate climate forcing data.",

            "abstract": "Various aseismic sliding processes preceding large earthquakes have been investigated observationally and theoretically. Especially, the slip nucleation process, in which accelerating aseismic slip is expected to occur immediately before earthquake occurrence, was extensively studied. On the other hand, numerical simulations of recurrent interplate earthquakes assuming rate- and state-dependent friction on a fault indicates that aseismic sliding progressively develops on a seismogenic part of the fault during an interseismic period. In the present study, aseismic sliding within a seismogenic region during an interseismic period of simulated cycles of large interplate earthquakes at a subduction zone is examined, and possible crustal deformation due to the aseismic sliding is discussed. A 2D uniform elastic half-space is considered, and friction on a shallower part of a plate boundary is assumed to obey a rate- and state-dependent friction law, while steady aseismic sliding is assumed on the deeper part. Shear stress is concentrated at the deeper edge of the seismogenic plate boundary due to deeper steady aseismic sliding, and aseismic sliding penetrates into the seismogenic part in an early phase of interseismic period. This aseismic sliding gradually propagates updip, and the aseismic slip rate is one order of magnitude smaller than the assumed relative plate velocity. This aseismic sliding is accelerated and an episodic aseismic slip event occurs even without heterogeneity of frictional property. The slip rate of the episodic slip event tends to be larger for a small characteristic slip distance of the friction law, and this event is possibly observable in the surface deformation. The average aseismic slip rate within the seismogenic part increases inversely proportional to the time to the earthquake occurrence and its amplitude is proportional to the characteristic slip distance and inversely proportional to the effective normal stress on the plate boundary.",

Among studies about tropical cyclone precipitation (TCP), separating rainfall into tropical and non-tropical cyclone components is a challenging task. Therefore, a need exists for continued spatial climatological analysis of rainfall associated of TCs. To provide a long-term climatology of TCP in this study, 305 TCs having tracks located within 500 km of the U.S. coastline from 1948-2012 are examined. The daily precipitation amounts on 0.25°× 0.25° latitude-longitude grids are from the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) Unified Precipitation Data (UPD). A GIS and Python based method is developed to identify rainfall swaths produced by TCs. Then we overlay all TCP swaths on a U.S. county map to get cumulative frequency of counties receiving rainfall from a TC with value greater than 25.4 mm. We find that there are 2533 counties in 25 states had been affected by TCP with value greater than 25.4 mm at least once during 1948 to 2012. The total area of TCP and TCP area averaged by annual TC counts and days shows significant increases after the 1990s. By comparing the rainfall swaths to the wind swaths as reported by previous work, we determine the frequency with which locations receive either condition produced by TCs. The results reveal that TCPs extend more inland and have more frequency than TC winds, since TC winds decays quickly after make landfall, while rainfall field may expand due to extra-tropical transition or land surface conditions.",

Incorporating prior information of the subducting slab into the inversion scheme, we obtained a three-dimensional resistivity model in which a vertically continuous conductive zone is imaged from the subducting slab surface to the lower crust beneath the the central orogenic belt of the northeastern Japan arc (Ou Backbone Range). The conductive body indicates a saline fluid and/or melt pathway from the subducting slab surface to the lower crust. The lower crust conductor is 10 Ωm or more conductive, and the estimation of saline fluid and/or melt volume fraction is 0.7 vol. % at minimum. Other resistivity profiles in the across-arc direction reveal that the conductive body segregates from the subducting slab surface at 80–100 km depth and takes an overturned form toward the backarc direction. The head of the conducting body reaches the lower crust just beneath Mt. Gassan, one of the prominent backarc volcanoes. This suggests that the backarc volcanism is caused by saline fluid and/or melt overturn rising toward the backarc direction.",

In this study, large-eddy simulation is used to investigate the effect of the absorbing smoke layer on the stratocumulus to cumulus transition (SCT). A prognostic absorbing smoke model incorporates humidity effects on optical properties, and is coupled with a two-moment bulk microphysics scheme and an interactive radiation code. Smoke both absorbs shortwave radiation and acts as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Simulations are of three day duration. \nThe simulations assess sensitivity of the SCT to distance of the smoke layer from the cloud top, aerosol optical thickness and single scattering albedo, and precipitation. Our simulations show that 1) As a shortwave absorber, the smoke stabilizes the free atmosphere and strengthens the temperature jump at the boundary layer top, which limits entrainment; 2) Smoke helps evaporate cloud during daytime, which amplifies the diurnal cycle of cloud cover; 3) As a source of CCN, the entrained smoke suppresses rain formation, which inhibits precipitation-generated cloud breakup. The net effect of smoke is modification of heating profiles to limit the deepening of the planetary boundary layer, and suppression of precipitation. This leads to enhancement of the diurnal cycle of cloudiness but a delay in the SCT.",

            "abstract": "Seismic attenuation is an important property of wave propagation used in numerous applications. However, the attenuation is also a complex phenomenon, and it is important to differentiate between its two typical uses: 1) in forward problems, to model the amplitudes and spectral contents of waves required for hazard assessment and geotechnical engineering, and 2) in inverse problems, to determine the physical properties of the subsurface. In the forward-problem sense, the attenuation is successfully characterized in terms of empirical parameters of geometric spreading, radiation patterns, scattering amplitudes, t-star, alpha, kappa, or Q. Arguably, the predicted energy losses can be correct even if the underlying attenuation model is phenomenological and not sufficiently based on physics. An example of such phenomenological model is the viscoelasticity based on the correspondence principle and the Q-factor assigned to the material. By contrast, when used to invert for in situ material properties, models addressing the specific physics are required. In many studies (including in this session), a Q-factor is interpreted as a property of a point within the subsurface; however this property is only phenomenological and may be physically insufficient or inconsistent. For example, the bulk or shear Q at the same point can be different when evaluated from different wave modes. The cases of frequency-dependent Q are particularly prone of ambiguities such as trade-off with the assumed background geometric spreading.\nTo rigorously characterize the in situ material properties responsible for seismic-wave attenuation, it is insufficient to only focus on the seismic energy loss. Mechanical models of the material need to be considered. Such models can be constructed by using Lagrangian mechanics. These models should likely contain no Q but will be based on parameters of microstructure such as heterogeneity, fractures, or fluids. I illustrate several such models based on viscosity, Coulomb friction, poroelasticity, squirt flows, structures containing “wave-induced flows”, and thermoelasticity. The phenomenological and frequency-dependent Q-factors, kappas, wave dispersion, and other propagation parameters are obtained by modeling the specific wave modes of interest.",

Thus, appropriate calibration objectives and model uncertainty analysis are essential for ecohydrological modeling. In recent years, Bayesian inference has become one of the most popular tools for quantifying the uncertainties in hydrological modeling with the development of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. Our study aims to develop appropriate prior distributions and likelihood functions that minimize the model uncertainties and bias within a Bayesian ecohydrological framework.\nIn our study, a formal Bayesian approach is implemented in an ecohydrological model which combines a hydrological model (HyMOD) and a dynamic vegetation model (DVM). Simulations focused on one objective likelihood (Streamflow/LAI) and multi-objective likelihoods (Streamflow and LAI) with different weights are compared. Uniform, weakly informative and strongly informative prior distributions are used in different simulations. The Kullback-leibler divergence (KLD) is used to measure the dis(similarity) between different priors and corresponding posterior distributions to examine the parameter sensitivity.\nResults show that different prior distributions can strongly influence posterior distributions for parameters, especially when the available data is limited or parameters are insensitive to the available data. We demonstrate differences in optimized parameters and uncertainty limits in different cases based on multi-objective likelihoods vs. single objective likelihoods. We also demonstrate the importance of appropriately defining the weights of objectives in multi-objective calibration according to different data types.",

In the NASA decadal survey for Earth science, the GEO-CAPE mission was proposed to address coastal and air pollution events in geosynchronous orbit, complementing similar initiatives in Asia by the South Koreans and by ESA in Europe, thereby covering the northern hemisphere. In addition to analyzing the challenges of identifying instrument capabilities to meet the science requirements, and the implications of hosting the instrument payloads on commercial geosynchronous satellites, the GEO-CAPE mission design team conducted a short study to explore strategies to optimize the science return for the coastal imaging instrument. The study focused on intelligent scheduling strategies that took into account cloud avoidance techniques as well as onboard processing methods to reduce the data storage and transmission loads. This paper expands the findings of that study to address the use of intelligent scheduling techniques and near-real time data product acquisition of both the coastal water and air pollution events. The topics include the use of onboard processing to refine and execute schedules, to detect cloud contamination in observations, and to reduce data handling operations. Analysis of state of the art flight computing capabilities will be presented, along with an assessment of cloud detection algorithms and their performance characteristics. Tools developed to illustrate operational concepts will be described, including their applicability to environmental monitoring domains with an eye to the future. In the geostationary configuration, the payload becomes a networked “thing” with enough connectivity to exchange data seamlessly with users. This allows the full field of view to be sensed at very high rate under the control of ground infrastructure, resulting in improved efficiencies, accuracy and science benefits. Hence a remote sensing payload and its data may become one of millions of connected objects in the emerging Internet of Things (IoT), and be as easily accessible by a user’s smart phone as any other smart appliance.",

            "abstract": "For several decades, unusual reflectance and polarization phase curves have been reported on Europa by experienced ground based astronomers (Rosenbush et al., 1997, 2015). The observed reflectance phase curve is consistent with the phase curves reported in the laboratory in fine grained particulate media (Nelson et al., 2000, 2002, Shkuratov et al., 2002). Shkuratov et al. (2002) also measured polarization properties of fine grained media showing that they relate to the coherent backscatter enhancement phenomenon and are consistent with the astronomical data.\nWe have reconfigured a goniometric photopolarimeter (GPP) (Nelson et al., 2000, 2002) to measure in the laboratory the polarization phase curves of highly reflective particulate materials that simulate the Europa’s predominately water ice regolith. We apply the Helmholtz Reciprocity Principle - we present our samples with linearly polarized light and measure the change in the intensity of the reflected component with phase angle from 0.05 to 15 degrees. This is physically equivalent to the astronomical polarization measurements. We report here the polarization phase curves for a suite of high albedo particulates of size 0.1<D< 30 µm, five of which are 1.5 µm or smaller in diameter. The depth and position of the polarization minimum, the crossover point, and the slope at the crossover point all correlate with particle size. We find no polarization effects for the particle sizes greater than 2 µm.\nOur laboratory polarization measurements are remarkably consistent with the astronomical data. These observations can be explained by a European regolith that is extremely fine grained and with very high porosity, perhaps with void space exceeding 90%.\nIf a reflectance phase curve and a polarization phase curve of solar system object can be obtained (even at a very small range of phase angles), it will soon be possible to determine (or at least constrain) important regolith properties. Future missions to the Jovian system (particularly Europa) would derive great benefit from including polarization measurement capability.\n This work is supported by NASA’s Cassini Saturn Orbiter mission.",

Some fraction of these particles is derived from sources in common with true coarse mode particles (diameters between ~2.5 and 10 microns), while the remainder are derived from sources that dominate submicron particles, including cloud processing. In this presentation we review measurements by our group in various U.S.-based field studies to demonstrate the variability in this mode and in its contributions to the aforementioned characteristics of atmospheric relevance.

We use the energy and water balance measured with two eddy-covariance towers, coupled with a dense network of small, wireless meteorological stations in a small (3.5 km2) catchment to understand these relationships. Time series of monthly averages of soil moisture, rainfall, air temperature, cloud cover, components of net radiation, wind speed, and NDVI are presented in relation to the evaporative fraction and energy balance. We found that both latent and sensible heat fluxes are greater over mixed forest and savanna areas compared agricultural land. Sensible heat is found to be most different between the two land-covers at the end of the year, when the grass and vegetation is dry, and latent heat is found to be most different at the beginning of the year, when bare ground dominates. Further examination shows that soil moisture and vegetation indexes provide the main controls on evaporative fraction. These findings have implications for modeling the evaporation over large regions based on remotely sensed land surface temperature. The site is characteristic of the contrasts in vegetation and moisture availability present in the rocky escarpments found in Northern Benin and Southeastern Burkina Faso. Historically these sites are important in location for village choice and land use designation. These findings reinforce local cultural beliefs of the importance of vegetation for climate regulation and may provide support to local farmers for improving the resilience of natural resources and livelihood security.",

            "abstract": "The recent discovery of a 25-day cycle in precipitation and circulation in the storm track region during austral summer, may provide new potential for predictability on intra-seasonal timescales. Investigations of the \"Baroclinic Annular Mode\" by Thompson et al have shown a robust period of ~25-days in eddy-kinetic energy, heat-flux and precipitation. Furthermore, a complete latitude-by-latitude budget of finite-amplitude wave activity (FAWA) reveals that low-level poleward heat flux gives rise to a similar periodicity in the waves themselves.\nThe mean state of the summer circulation provides a waveguide that supports a small number of discrete modes. These modes, corresponding with zonal wavenumbers 4, 5 and 6, tend to be associated with short synoptic timescales. So the question remains: what mechanism generates a 25-day timescale in the atmosphere? Using a series of GCM simulations we test a theory that interference between discrete wave modes gives rise to this unexpected timescale. This new wave interaction paradigm is based on the idea that waves with the same zonal wavenumber, but different vertical structures, can interfere constructively and modulate the poleward heat flux.

This study reports on the calibration of an integrated soil-tree-atmosphere continuum (STAC) model using Bayesian inference with the DREAM algorithm and temporal observations of soil moisture content, matric head, sap flux, and leaf water potential from the King's River Experimental Watershed (KREW) in the southern Sierra Nevada mountain range in California. Water flow through the coupled system is described using the Richards' equation with both the soil and tree modeled as a porous medium with nonlinear soil and tree water relationships. Most of the model parameters appear to be reasonably well defined by calibration against the observed data. The posterior mean simulation reproduces the observed soil and tree data quite accurately, but a systematic mismatch is observed between early afternoon measured and simulated sap fluxes. We will show how this points to a structural error in the STAC-model and suggest and test an alternative hypothesis for root water uptake that alleviates this problem.",

According to provincial guidelines, mined area must be reclaimed to an “equivalent capacity” and should contain ~33% wetlands by area. Paleoecological studies have proven useful for the development of restoration strategies through establishment of pre-disturbance baselines and assessing the possibility of returning ecosystems to pre-disturbance state. The task of wetland reclamation is challenged by salinization in the post mined environment, thus understanding the evolution of natural saline wetlands will aid in the development of improved reclamation strategies. The study was carried out in a natural saline wetland situated ~10 km southeast of Fort McMurray, Alberta. Paleoecological changes were investigated using diatoms, pollen and non-pollen palynomorphs in sediment cores taken from a pond in the central part of the wetland. Variations in physicochemical properties and microfossils assemblages in the core demonstrate dynamic changes associated with saline wetland initiation and its trajectory. The transition from clay sediments, characterized by low concentration of microfossils, to gyttja indicates that lake drainage preceded establishment of the wetland. Upcore shifts in microfossil assemblages reflect cycling between periods of very high salinity (recorded by a dominance of marine-brackish and brackish diatoms) followed by period of decreased salinity (indicted by a rise in fresh-brackish species) with gradual increases in salinity thereafter. Identification of the processes driving variation in salinity over time may be useful in the post-mined reclamation setting. Assessment of temporal changes in ecosystem functioning associated with differences in level of dissolved salts may lead to different reclamation approaches capable of dealing with the higher salinity conditions.",

            "abstract": "November 2014, Aso Volcano resumed the eruption after approximately 20 years quiescence. The main activity was ash eruption with silent large plumes, but Strombolian eruption of spouting scoriae without ash also was observed. Most of scoriae are highly vesiculated, and have low density (Yokoo and Miyabuchi, 2015). In order to understand the evolution of bubble texture, I observed the scoriae in three methods, the microscope, CT scan, and SEM those can observe different scales of 10 mm, 1 mm, 10μm, respectively.\nThe microscope images show that larger bubbles (10mm) are surrounded by small bubbles (< 1mm), which shows elongated structure and suggesting that deformed by the large bubbles. CT images also show that larger bubbles (1mm) are surrounded by small bubbles (100μm). SEM images show that the bubble film thickness is approximately 1μm or less.\n According to the observation of pumices in other volcanoes, the typical bubble film thickness is estimated to be about 0.1-1μm (Nguyen, et al, 2013). In general, the volume fraction of bubbles and number density determine the thickness of the bubble films. For a smaller number density of bubbles, bubble size becomes larger in a same bubble volume fraction, so that the bubble film becomes thicker. In other words, the bubble films in the bubbly magma with a large number density reach the minimum thickness at a lower degree of bubble fraction. As a result, the bubble films rupture, or by coagulation, the larger bubble assimilates small bubbles. By the increase of the bubble size, thickness of the bubble film increases to be larger than the minimum thickness of 1μm. If such coalescences occur, the bubble size must have variety. From the varying bubble size and 1 1μm film thickness of scoriae, I infer that bubble coalescence occurred in the ascending bubbly magma in the conduit.",

            "abstract": "The Bay Area is one of the world’s most vulnerable places to earthquakes, and being ready is vital to survival. The purpose of this study was to determine the distribution of places affected in a 7.0 Hayward Earthquake and the effectiveness of earthquake early warning (EEW) in this scenario. We manipulated three variables: the location of the epicenter, the station placement, and algorithm used for early warning. To compute the blind zone and warning times, we calculated the P and S wave velocities by using data from the Northern California Earthquake Catalog and the radius of the blind zone using appropriate statistical models. We came up with a linear regression model directly relating warning time and distance from the epicenter. We used Google Earth to plot three hypothetical epicenters on the Hayward Fault and determine which establishments would be affected. By varying the locations, the blind zones and warning times changed. As the radius from the epicenter increased, the warning times also increased. The intensity decreased as the distance from the epicenter grew. We determined which cities were most vulnerable. We came up with a list of cities and their predicted warning times in this hypothetical scenario. For example, for the epicenter in northern Hayward, the cities at most risk were San Pablo, Richmond, and surrounding cities, while the cities at least risk were Gilroy, Modesto, Lincoln, and other cities within that radius. To find optimal station placement, we chose two cities with stations placed variable distances apart from each other. There was more variability in scattered stations than dense stations, suggesting stations placed closer together are more effective since they provide precise warnings. We compared the algorithms ElarmS, which is currently used in the California Integrated Seismic Network (CISN) and Onsite, which is a single-sensor approach that uses one to two stations, by calculating the blind zone and warning times for each. Onsite was better issuing quick warnings, but less reliable due to its one station dependency. ElarmS had more delay, but was more accurate since it used four stations. Knowing how the different variables affect EEW can provide citizens with an outlook of how to be prepared for a big earthquake in the Bay Area based on their location and proximity to faults and seismic stations.",

            "abstract": "The greatest horizontal compression in much of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin appears to uniformly trend NE-SW. Beyond this, major gaps remain in our knowledge of stress magnitudes and even faulting regimes. This lack of quantitative information impedes a proper understanding of seismic events that appear to be linked to hydraulic fracturing stimulations. Apart from this immediate concern, such seismicity could impact long term green-house gas sequestration and geothermal energy development. As part of the Helmholtz-Alberta geothermal collaboration, we are developing a program to update this crustal stress state information. The program consists of more immediate studies related to conventional analysis of borehole image logs, core fractures, and transient pressure records as can be made available. Data sets analyzed to date include logs to 3.5 km depth from areas experiencing induced seismicity, from 2.5 km depth within the Precambrian craton in NE Alberta, and to 400 m depth within a large carbonate platform. All these data largely confirm the NE-SW stress directions. In some cases, the configurations of drilling induced tensile fractures and borehole breakouts allow the faulting regime to be constrained. The addition of new seismometers to the region is also allowing for the refinement of earthquake focal mechanisms. Finally, a dramatic contrast in lithosphere thickness, composition and geothermal gradient exists at the contact between the Cordillera and the North American craton; therefore, lithosphere-scale numerical models are also being developed to quantify the relative contribution of geodynamic processes, such as mantle flow and contact geometry, to the observed stress regime within the basin.",

            "abstract": "In northern Taiwan, contraction, transcurrent shearing, block rotation and extension are four essential tectonic deformation mechanisms involved in the progressive deformation of this arcuate collision mountain belt. The neotectonic evolution of the Taiwan mountain belt is mainly controlled not only by the oblique convergence between the Eurasian plate and the Philippine Sea plate but also the corner shape of the plate boundary. Based on field observations and analyses, and taking geophysical data (mostly GPS) and experimental modelling into account, we interpret the curved belt of northern Taiwan as a result of of contractional deformation (with compression, thrust-sheet stacking & folding, back thrust duplex & back folding) that induced vertical extrusion, combined with increasing transcurrent & rotational deformation (with transcurrent faulting, bookshelf-type strike-slip faulting and block rotation) that induced transcurrent/rotational extrusion and extension deformation which in turn induced extensional extrusion. As a consequence, a special type of extrusional folds was formed in association with contractional, transcurrent & rotational and extensional extrusions subsequently. The extrusional tectonics in northern Taiwan reflect a single, albeit complicated, regional pattern of deformation. The crescent-shaped mountain belt of Northeastern Taiwan develops in response to oblique indentation by an asymmetric wedge indenter and opening of the Okinawa trough at plate corner.",

Approximately 50 are distributed throughout the Mexico and Caribbean region funded by the TLALOCNet and COCONet projects. The entire network is processed in real-time at UNAVCO using Precise Point Positioning (PPP). The real-time streams are freely available to all and user demand has grown almost exponentially since 2010. Data usage is multidisciplinary, including tectonic and volcanic deformation studies, meteorological applications, atmospheric science research in addition to use by national, state and commercial entities. 21 RT-GNSS sites in California now include 200-sps accelerometers for the development of Earthquake Early Warning systems. All categories of users of real-time streams have similar requirements, reliable, low-latency, high-rate, and complete data sets.\nTo meet these requirements, UNAVCO tracks the latency and completeness of the incoming raw observations and also is developing tools to monitor the quality of the processed data streams. UNAVCO is currently assessing the precision, accuracy and latency of solutions from various PPP software packages. Also under review are the data formats UNAVCO distributes; for example, the PPP solutions are currently distributed in NMEA format, but other formats such as SEED or GeoJSON may be preferred by different user groups to achieve specific mission objectives. In this presentation we will share our experiences of the challenges involved in the data operations of a continental-scale, multi-project, real-time GNSS network, summarize the network’s performance in terms of latency and completeness, and present the comparisons of PPP solutions using different PPP processing techniques.",

Due to its measuring difficulties, sound velocity is often not measured directly but instead calculated from water temperature, salinity, and depth, which are much easier to obtain. This research develops a new method to directly measure the sound velocity in the ocean’s near-surface layer using multi-channel seismic (MCS) hydrophones. This system consists of a device to make a sound pulse and a long cable with hundreds of hydrophones to record the sound. The distance between the source and each receiver is the offset. The time it takes the pulse to arrive to each receiver is the travel time.\nThe errors of measuring offset and travel time will affect the accuracy of sound velocity if we calculated with just one offset and one travel time. However, by analyzing the direct arrival signal from hundreds of receivers, the velocity can be determined as the slope of a straight line in the travel time-offset graph. The errors in distance and time measurement result in only an up or down shift of the line and do not affect the slope.\nThis research uses MCS data of survey MGL1408 obtained from the Marine Geoscience Data System and processed with Seismic Unix. The sound velocity can be directly measured to an accuracy of less than 1m/s. The included graph shows the directly measured velocity verses the calculated velocity along 100km across the Mid-Atlantic continental margin. The directly measured velocity shows a good coherence to the velocity computed from temperature and salinity. In addition, the fine variations in the sound velocity can be observed, which is hardly seen from the calculated velocity. Using this methodology, both large area acquisition and fine resolution can be achieved. This directly measured sound velocity will be a new and powerful tool in oceanography.",

Under such condition, water shortage problems have frequently occurred in northern Taiwan in recent years such that water is usually transferred from irrigation sectors to public sectors during drought periods. Facing the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of water resources and the problems of increasing water shortages, it is a primary and critical issue to simultaneously satisfy multiple water uses through adequate reservoir operations for sustainable water resources management. Therefore, we intend to build an intelligent reservoir operation system for the assessment of agricultural water resources management strategy in response to food security during drought periods. This study first uses the grey system to forecast the agricultural water demand during February and April for assessing future agricultural water demands. In the second part, we build an intelligent water resources system by using the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II), an optimization tool, for searching the water allocation series based on different water demand scenarios created from the first part to optimize the water supply operation for different water sectors. The results can be a reference guide for adequate agricultural water resources management during drought periods.\nKeywords: Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II); Grey System; Optimization; Agricultural Water Resources Management.",

            "abstract": "Plinian eruptions are the largest historically recorded volcanic phenomena, and have the potential to be widely destructive. Yet when a volcano becomes newly restless we are unable to anticipate whether or not a large eruption is imminent. We present the findings from a multi-parametric study of 42 large explosive eruptions (29 Plinian and 13 Sub-plinian) that form the basis for a new Bayesian Belief network that addresses this question. We combine the eruptive history of the volcanoes that have produced these large eruptions with petrological studies, and reported unrest phenomena to assess the probability of an eruption being plinian. We find that the 'plinian probability' is increased most strongly by the presence of an exsolved volatile phase in the reservoir prior to an eruption. In our survey 60% of the plinian eruptions, had an excess SO2 gas phase of more than double than it is calculated by petrologic studies alone. Probability is also increased by three related and more easily observable parameters: a high plinian Ratio (that is the ratio of VEI≥4 eruptions in a volcanoes history to the number of all VEI≥2 eruptions in the history), a repose time of more than 1000 years, and a Repose Ratio (the ratio of the average return of VEI≥4 eruptions in the volcanic record to the repose time since the last VEI≥4) of greater than 0.7. We looked for unrest signals that potentially are indicative of future plinian activity and report a few observations from case studies but cannot say if these will generally appear. Finally we present a retrospective analysis of the probabilities of eruptions in our study becoming plinian, using our Bayesian belief network. We find that these probabilities are up to about 4 times greater than those calculate from an a priori assessment of the global eruptive catalogue.",

This was based on a variety of evidence including the dramatic reduction in tree pollen and dune activity in currently humid areas such as the Blue Mountains of NSW. Maintaining arid conditions under significantly lower temperatures is quite challenging and not all lines of evidence supported strong aridity. Over the last four years an ARC project has worked to develop new lines of evidence to test these inferences. Outcomes from the project indicate that winter temperatures were significantly colder than at present (an 8-11 C decrease) while summer temperatures were cooler but not as extreme (4-6.5 C). Moisture balances appear to have been more positive than present along the eastern highlands, while areas to the west were comparatively drier. The humid zone along the divide maintained at least seasonally stronger flows in the major rivers, meaning that water was more available in western districts than under modern climates. I will summarise the evidence for this new pattern and highlight the climatological patterns that would be consistent with the reconstruction. I will conclude by speculating on the implications for both human landscape use and what happened to the vegetation.",

            "abstract": "The south hinge of the Torres Syncline in southernmost Brazil hosts a volcanic succession of pahoehoe and rubbly Gramado-type lavas belonging to the ~132 Ma Paraná–Etendeka Igneous Province. We employ local-scale stratigraphy in three distinct profiles (Santa Cruz do Sul-Herveiras, Morro da Cruz and Lajeado geologic sections) as guidelines for geochemical and Sr-Nd-Pb isotope studies in order to discuss the petrogenesis of lava flows in a single magma type and to quantitatively evaluate the role of crustal contamination and the potential contaminants involved. In all profiles, the lava flows exhibit compositions ranging from basalt to andesite with tholeiitic affinity. The compositional and isotopic variations are not systematic according to stratigraphy, implying that the magma chamber could have undergone periodic replenishments or distinct magma pulses through time or multiple plumbling systems may have existed. The andesites (SiO2 55–58 wt.%) with ponded pahoehoe morphology represent evolved melts at early stages of volcanism with strong susceptibility to crustal contamination as they established pathways to the surface. The olivine basalts (SiO2 47–50 wt.%) and basaltic andesites (SiO2 51–56 wt.%) showing compound morphology and simple pahoehoe morphology, respectively, could be explained by longer time residence of liquids in the crust with higher degrees of crustal assimilation than the ponded pahoehoe lavas. The basaltic andesites (SiO2 52–56 wt. %) with rubbly morphology are related to late differentiation process in shallow magma chambers. Crustal assimilation process accounts for the high initial 87Sr/86Sr ratios at 0.707798–0.715751, very low εNd between −8.36 and −5.41, high 206Pb/204Pb ratios at 18.424–18.865, with intermediate 207Pb/204Pb and 208Pb/204Pb ratios at 15.649–15.710 and 38.618–39.369, respectively. The isotopic variations require assimilation of both Paleoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic contaminants at variable degrees.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Poster_v1.2_grey_left.pdf\nData assimilation (DA) has emerged as a promising technique for combining information from paleoclimate proxy data and climate models. Research on this topic has progressed to the point where an operational grid reconstruction project is underway using an ensemble approach (the Last Millennium Reanalysis; LMR). For problems on weather timescales, ensemble DA typically utilizes a “cycling” process, where an ensemble of forecasts provides the prior estimate to be combined with observational information. For the paleoclimate problem, cycling faces dual challenges of very large computational cost, and weak predictive skill on annual-decadal timescales. As a result, recent work in this area has used a “no cycling” approach where the prior ensemble is instead drawn randomly from a long climate simulation. Here we investigate the viability of adding cycling by means of a low-cost alternative for climate forecasting known as a linear inverse model (LIM).\nLIMs have been shown to have forecast skill comparable to coupled global climate models on annual time scales and due to their simplicity have low computational expense. In this study, we assess the reconstruction skill of ensemble DA with cycling relative to a control no-cycling reconstruction. Each reconstruction uses a random draw from a pre-industrial climate simulation as its initial (cycling) or annual (no-cycling) prior estimate, and assimilates observations from the PAGES 2k proxy dataset. Reconstructions for the period from 1000-2000 CE are performed, and both the correlation and coefficient of efficiency (CE) values for global averages and spatial fields are calculated against observational datasets during the instrumental record. Preliminary results for global mean temperature show that while correlations are high with the cycling approach (>0.8), they are slightly lower than results for the no-cycling reconstruction.",

The results constrain both the dependence on Si content of the bulk modulus of these liquids, and the temperature-dependence of their elasticity. These elastic data are utilized to assess both relatively low-pressure (to 12 GPa) compressional data on Fe-Si liquids, and to extrapolate to higher pressure and temperature conditions. If a single equation of state for Fe-Ni-Si liquids of a given composition applies from low pressure to near core conditions, then our results imply that the isothermal pressure derivative of the bulk modulus of these liquids is high: likely 8 and above at high temperatures. This high value of the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus at low-pressures in Fe-Si liquids causes marked stiffening at higher pressures, leading to notable incompressibility and apparent low values of the pressure derivative of the bulk modulus at core conditions. These results reinforce the conclusion that silicon is not a major alloying component of Earth’s core.",

However, our planet emits much more heat than that expected for the energy produced by the calculated concentration of these elements in the Earth's Mantle, even if we consider solar radiation and planetary accretion energy too. Such data suggest that the concentration of all these elements, or some of them, is underestimated and several authors suggest that some of these elements could be enriched even in the Earth’s core, despite their lithophyle characteristics. In this study, we focus on the potassium behavior, concentration in the mantle and we aim to find stable mineral phases under high pressure and temperature, able to keep potassium (and by consequence its radioactive 40K isotope) and water in their structure in the mantle conditions. In such way, we will be able to better understand the role of potassium in the mantle as a heat source to the Earth’s interior. We conducted experimental runs in which synthetic vitreous samples, stoichiometrically equivalent to different concentrations of leucite, nepheline and diopside, are processed in a 1000 tonf hydraulic press, under 4.0 GPa (equivalent to 120 km Earth deep) and temperatures up to 1400 °C. As run products, we obtained euhedral minerals in equilibrium with a liquid (melt), simulating a potassium enriched mantle environment. The samples are analyzed by XRD, SEM-EDS and EPMA techniques, and the produced data is used to construct the “Leucite-Nepheline-Diopside under 4.0GPa and dry conditions” ternary phase diagram. Preliminary semiquantitative data (EDS), plotted in the diagram, show that clinopyroxene keeps up to 2wt% of K2O in its structure in absence of potassic phases and in the presence of nepheline. The amount of K2O decreases to 0,1wt% if kalsilite is present, which is the potassic stable phase in the experiment conditions. Compared to previous studies of this diagram under atmospheric conditions, forsterite field disappear and clinopiroxene stability field show a substantial growth under 4.0 GPa, while nepheline and kalsilite stability fields are partially suppressed. Data also show that wollastonite is well crystallized in the experimental conditions, despite the absence of CO2.",

            "abstract": "This study investigates the rainfall induced seepage behaviors and slope stability of an unsaturated natural slope of colluviums along the A-A' profile of Lu-Shan landslide using two-dimensional finite element method. At first, a steady/transient seepage analysis was carried out using 42 days rainfall records from Mat-Sa typhoon in 2005. Through the inspection of the coincidence of the groundwater variation between simulation and measurement, a set of best fit unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function kr(ψ)~(ψ) and horizontal and vertical saturated conductivities kx and ky for colluviums can be determined. Where, the variable ψ denotes the matrix suction of soil stratum. The function, kr(ψ)~(ψ), considers the seepage behaviors of unsaturated colluviums gradual transition from unsaturated to saturated state.\nFor a 48-hrs design rainfall with different return periods 5, 25 and 50 years, the range of the transient saturated zone formed in the slope during rainfall will expand with the increase of rainfall intensity. The self-weight of soil mass increases due to the rainwater absorption and which alternately introduces a higher down sliding force to the slope and leads to a large extent reduction of factor safety FS of the unsaturated natural slope (A-A'profile).\nWhen the matrix suction, ψ, in the function kr(ψ)~(ψ) was adjusted to a higher value (ψ→10ψ), physically it represents a soil stratum with finer particle, the infiltration and pore-water pressure variation becomes not observable in the rainfall induced seepage analysis. Conclusively, an unsaturated natural slope with higher matrix suction (ψ→10ψ) always possesses a higher FS value than that with lower matrix suction (ψ→0.10ψ). For the slope with anisotropic hydraulic conductivity ratio (ky/kx =0.01), due to the downward infiltration rate of rainwater is lower than that with isotropic hydraulic conductivity (kx/ky =1), the occurrence time for a FS value starting to downgrade may lag behind during rainfall.",

            "abstract": "Understanding fault slip rates in the eastern California shear zone (ECSZ) is complicated by possible near-fault or broadly distributed deformation. Furthermore, geodetically-constrained models that include elastic deformation due to locked faults require fault geometries to be prescribed, and incorrect fault parameterization may introduce off-fault deformation artifacts. We address the potential role of block model fault system geometry in describing ECSZ deformation with total variation regularization (TVR), an L1 regularization method that allows for an algorithmic assessment of the best-fitting geometry based on geodetic observations from a combined Western United States velocity field. Beginning with 62 ECSZ blocks, we reduce the number of active faults to identify a simpler block model geometry containing only 9 ECSZ blocks. We find that this model fits GPS observations with a regional mean residual velocity (MRV) of 1.5 mm/yr with deformation due to block rotations and elastic strain accumulation alone. This approach does not resolve discrepancies between geologically and geodetically estimated slip rates in the eastern California shear zone, reproducing only 5 of 11 geologic slip rates within their reported uncertainties. The largest remaining slip rate discrepancies occur on the Calico and Garlock faults. Furthermore, the presence of additional deformation processes, as quantified by the internal deformation likelihood, cannot be rejected in the southeastern Mojave, adjacent to the 1992 Landers and 1999 Hector Mine earthquake rupture zones, where postseismic deformation is ongoing.",

            "abstract": "Venus' cloud-level atmosphere is characterized by the presence of waves with a range of periods and scale sizes. Wave phenomena can have important dynamical effects and may deposit significant momentum and energy into the atmosphere. Fluctuations with scale sizes of a few km to 10's of km have been observed at cloud altitudes in temperatures, winds or UV images from Mariner 10, Pioneer Venus, Venera 9, Magellan and Venus Express, suggesting the presence of gravity waves. Measurements of Venus' cloud level atmosphere have also identified planetary scale waves, with periods of around 4 to 5 days, which have been associated with Rossby or Kelvin waves. Longer term variations have also been observed in wind velocities at cloud heights, with periods of the order of several years. Planetary scale waves or gravity waves at cloud altitudes may be generated by a number of different mechanisms, for example by instabilities such as the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability or convective instability below the upper cloud layer, or they may be generated at lower altitudes and propagate upwards. Recent analyses from Venus Express observations suggest an association of gravity waves at cloud heights with significant topographical features. Although many measurements are available at cloud altitudes, little is known about waves in the poorly measured deep atmosphere. In order to explore the characteristics of waves generated near the surface we perform numerical simulations using the Venus Community Atmosphere Model general circulation model, which includes realistic topography based on measurements from the Magellan mission. We examine the influence of topography in generating waves near the surface associated with topographical features and the vertical development of simulated waves.",

            "abstract": "For detecting the seafloor crustal deformation and Tsunami associated with large earthquakes in real-time, it is necessary to monitor them just above the possible source region. For this purpose, we have been dedicated in developing a real-time continuous observation system using a multi-purpose moored buoy. Sea-trials of the system have been carried out near the Nanakai trough in 2013 and 2014 (Takahashi et al., 2014). We especially focused on the GPS/Acoustic measurement (GPS/A) in the system for horizontal crustal movement. The GPS/A on a moored buoy has a critical drawback compared to the traditional ones, in which the data can be stacked over ranging points fixed at an optimal position. Accuracy in positioning with a single ranging from an arbitrary point is the subject to be improved in this study. Here, we report the positioning results in the buoy system using data in the 2014 sea-trial and demonstrate the improvement of the result. We also address the potential resolving power in the positioning using synthetic tests.\nThe target GPS/A site consists of six seafloor transponders (PXPs) forming a small inner- and a large outer-triangles. The bottom of the moored cable is anchored nearly the center of the triangles. In the sea-trial, 11 times successive ranging was scheduled once a week, and we plotted positioning results from different buoy position. We confirmed that scatter in positioning using six PXPs simultaneously is ten times smaller than that using individual triangle separately. Next, we modified the definition of the PXP array geometry using data obtained in a campaign observation. Definition of an array geometry is insensitive as far as ranging is made in the same position, however, severely affects the positioning when ranging is made from various positions like the moored buoy. The modified PXP array is slightly smaller and 2m deeper than the original one. We found that the scatter of positioning results in the sea-trial is reduced from 4m to 1.7m with the modified geometry.\nFinally we produced a synthetic data with an artificial error in the array geometry and evaluated its effect on the positioning as a function of ranging point. This is interpreted with potential resolving power formulated in Kido (2007). In the presentation, we will show the results of synthetic test for systematic variation of the error condition.",

Recently, Lynner and Long (2014) tested several of these conceptual models against a quasi-global source-side shear wave splitting dataset and found that a model in which sub-slab dynamics varies with the age of the down-going plate best matches the observations. A major limitation of that study, however, was the employment of very simplified geodynamics; especially in cases that invoke 3-dimensional return flow, where highly complex flow patterns are expected near and around slab edges. Here, we examine sub-slab shear wave splitting patterns from geodynamic models aimed at mimicking real world subduction beneath Central American and Tonga; which exhibit entrained and 3D return flow patterns, respectively. Using a variety of olivine LPO and other anisotropic fabrics, we compare shear wave splitting from these models against actual source-side measurements in order to better understand sub-slab deformation.",

A few experiments consisting of microphones on poles and tethered aerostats comprise the remainder. Such surface and near-surface arrays likely do not capture the full diversity of acoustic signals in the atmosphere. Here, we describe results from a balloon mounted infrasound array that reached altitudes of up to 38 km (the middle stratosphere). The balloon drifted at the ambient wind speed, resulting in a near total reduction in wind noise. Signals consistent with tropospheric turbulence were detected. A spectral peak in the ocean microbarom range (0.12 - 0.35 Hz) was present on balloon-mounted sensors but not on static infrasound stations near the flight path. A strong 18 Hz signal, possibly related to building ventilation systems, was observed in the stratosphere. A wide variety of other narrow band acoustic signals of uncertain provenance were present throughout the flight, but were absent in simultaneous recordings from nearby ground stations. Similar phenomena were present in spectrograms from the last balloon infrasound campaign in the 1960s. Our results suggest that the infrasonic wave field in the stratosphere is very different from that which is readily detectable on surface stations. This has implications for modeling acoustic energy transfer between the lower and upper atmosphere as well as the detection of novel acoustic signals that never reach the ground. Our work provides valuable constraints on a proposed mission to detect earthquakes on Venus using balloon-borne infrasound sensors.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing is the key stimulation technology to improve unconventional hydrocarbon recovery nowadays. Stimulation increases permeability of tight formations by causing fractures at depth. It involves pumping high-pressure fluid into reservoir rocks to force the opening of cracks, which could allow oil and gas to flow freely. The progress of a fracturing operation must be monitored carefully as fracturing could activate existing faults, leading the fluid mixed with chemicals to propagate beyond the targeted treatment zone. In order to study dynamic processes involved in hydraulic fracturing, we deployed a small-scale seismic array consisting of 22 broadband seismographs at the surface above a hydraulic fracturing area to monitor the whole fracturing progress. We made continuous recording for 20 days, and detected a total of 961 microseismic events with relatively high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) recordings. We found that these events occurred either during the fracturing operation or after the fluid pumping. Some of the events also do not seem to be directly induced by the pumping, based on their locations and sizes. We determined the focal mechanisms of all events using the P-wave polarity data, and found that both the microseismicity and their focal mechanisms exhibit significant spatial and temporal variations. This variability can be associated with the hydraulic treatment, pre-existing faults, as well as the evolving stress field during the treatment. We computed the Coulomb stress changes of the observed seismicity to seek its contribution to the observed seismic variability.",

This area is protected by the Hong Kong Government and the WWF since 1996.\nHuman activities have caused large amounts of greenhouse gasses to be released into the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide has caused the global temperature to rise and made ocean waters more acidic due to ocean respiration. The ocean is a carbon sink for mankind and the effect of severe acidification is negatively affecting marine life. The increase of temperature diminishes the amount of diversity of marine life; the decreasing acidity of the water has eliminated many species of shellfish and sea anemone; the increase of marine exploitation has decreased the diversity of marine life. The release of toxic waste, mainly mercury, waste and plastic products has also polluted the oceans which negatively impact coral reefs and endanger marine life.\nThe data has been collected by observing the colours and discolouration (bleaching) of the corals of approximately 40 colonies per month. The species of coral in Hoi Ha Wan include, Favites flexuosa, Goniopora columna,Leptastrea purpurea, Lithophyllon undulatum, Pavona decussata. and Platygyra acuta (AFCD,1).

In this study, we used High Pressure Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ionization- Mass Spectroscopy (HPLC-ESI-MS) and Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) to compare the IPL distributions of two oligotrophic environments: surface waters of Lake Tahoe in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, and the water column of the Tonga Trench in the South Pacific. We hypothesized that the similar nutrient dynamics of the two oligotrophic environments would result in similar eukaryotic and prokaryotic communities, which would be reflected in the IPL composition of suspended particulate organic matter (POM). For simplicity we focused on the classes of IPLs most commonly observed in the marine environment: phosphotidylglycerol (PG), phosphotidylethanolamine (PE), diacylglyceryl-trimethyl-homoserine (DGTS), diacylglyceryl-hydroxymethyl-trimethylalanine (DGTA), sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG), monoglycosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) and diglycosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG). Our results showed that all of the marine IPLs of interest were present in Lake Tahoe which confirms that there are many of the same microbial communities in the fresh waters of Lake Tahoe and the salt waters Tonga Trench.",

            "abstract": "Lithospheric magnetic field characterizes response of magnetic properties of rocks, which are mainly dependent on mineral and temperature variations. Hence, lithospheric magnetic structure brings important information to understand tectonic and thermal processes in the crust and uppermost mantle. In particular, the reliable global geomagnetic field models with large-scales based on satellite magnetic measurements provide regional view of the lithospheric magnetic structure. Here, with smallest and flattest constraints we use the inversion method based on the single layer model to calculate the spatial distribution of apparent susceptibility of continental lithosphere in China and its surroundings. It should be noted that: (1) magnetic anomaly data we used has removed the effect of global oceanic remanent magnetization, (2) the error of magnetic anomaly data is estimated from statistical analysis among MF7, GRIMM_L120, CHAOS5 and CM5 models, (3) the magnetic layer is bounded by the bottom of sediment and the Moho from CRUST1.0 model and is discretized into ellipsoidal prisms with equal angles in latitude and longitude, and (4) an adaptive subdivision & Gauss-Legendre quadrature with fixed order is adopted to solve the forward problem and IGRF11 is utilized as inducing field model. Since the missing longest wavelength components in the lithospheric magnetic field models and the so-called magnetic annihilators, the Apparent Susceptibility Contrast (ASC) distribution is obtained. The ASC distribution has obvious variations and illustrates the mosaic continent with old blocks, orogenic belts, rework fragments and also earthquake regions/zones. Moreover, the ASC distribution provides new insights and evidences of the destruction of North China Craton and geodynamic processes of Tibetan plateau and Baikal rift etc. This study is supported by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (Grant No.: 2015M572217) and Natural Science Fund of Hubei Province (Grant No.: 2015CFB361).",

            "abstract": "The behavior of chalcophile elements during mantle melting, melt extraction, and basalt differentiation is critical for formation of ore deposits and geochemical model and evolution of crust-mantle system. While chalcophile elements are strongly partitioned into sulfides, their behavior with different extent of melting, in particular, in the absence of sulfides, can only be modeled with complete knowledge of the partitioning behavior of these elements between dominant mantle minerals and basaltic melt with or without dissolved sulfide (S2-). However, experimental data on mineral-melt partitioning are lacking for many chalcophile elements.\nCrystallization experiments were conducted at 3 GPa and 1450-1600 °C using a piston cylinder and synthetic silicate melt compositions similar to low-degree partial melt of peridotite. Starting silicate mixes doped with 100-300 ppm of each of various chalcophile elements were loaded into Pt/graphite double capsules. To test the effect of dissolved sulfur in silicate melt on mineral-melt partitioning of chalcophile elements, experiments were conducted on both sulfur-free and sulfur-bearing (1100-1400 ppm S in melt) systems. Experimental phases were analyzed by EPMA (for major elements and S) and LA-ICP-MS (for trace elements).\nAll experiments produced an assemblage of cpx + melt ± garnet ± olivine ± spinel and yielded new partition coefficients (D) for Sn, Zn, Mo, Sb, Bi, Pb, and Se for cpx/melt, olivine/melt, and garnet/melt pairs. Derived Ds (mineral/basalt) reveal little effect of S2- in the melt on mineral-melt partition coefficients of the measured chalcophile elements, with Ds for Zn, Mo, Bi, Pb decreasing by less than a factor of 2 from S-free to S-bearing melt systems or remaining similar, within error, between S-free and S-bearing melt systems. By combining our data with existing partitioning data between sulfide phases and silicate melt we model the fractionation of these elements during mantle melting and basalt crystallization. The model results are compared with the chalcophile element abundance in oceanic basalts. We will discuss the implications of our new partitioning data and model results on sulfur and chalcophile element geochemistry of mantle source regions of ocean floor basalts and the fate of sulfides during mantle melting.",

This study focuses on the formulation of such a constitutive framework for Castlegate sandstone, a high porosity fluvial-deposited reservoir analog rock. Experimentalists report that for high porosity sandstones, accounting for the evolution of the elastic moduli with stress and plastic strain is essential to properly represent deformation response. Hence, the principles of hyperplasticity (e.g., Houlsby and Puzrin, 2006) were employed to develop a thermodynamically consistent constitutive framework for high porosity sandstone. The mechanical data set of Ingraham et al. (2013) was then used to develop a specific constitutive model for Castlegate sandstone.\nThrough systematic analyses of stress-strain unloading data for Castlegate, it was found that the bulk modulus evolved with mean stress and plastic volume strain during the hydrostatic portion of the loading. During the subsequent deviatoric loading, the shear modulus evolved with von Mises equivalent shear stress and plastic shear strain. With this understanding, general expressions for the elastic moduli were formulated and subsequently assessed for thermodynamic consistency. Once thermodynamic consistency was confirmed, analytical and numerical techniques were applied to the mechanical data set to obtain explicit expressions and material parameters for the elastic moduli. The key outcome of this study is a thermodynamically consistent constitutive framework for high porosity sandstone which accounts for the evolution of the elastic moduli with stress and plastic strain.",

            "abstract": "The North China Craton (NCC) is a classical example of ancient destroyed cratons. The NCC experienced widespread thermotectonic reactivations in the Phanerozoic. Recent work suggested that the old craton has been significantly modified or destroyed during this process. However, most of the studies were confined to the Eastern NCC, the nature and evolution of the lithosphere beneath the Central and Western NCC was less constrained due to the lack of data.\nWhile, recent geodetic data, with the advantages of high resolution and coverage, offers an opportunity to study the deep structure underneath the whole NCC. Here we construct a lithospheric-scale 3D model based on the integration of regional elevation, gravity, geoid and thermal data together with available seismic data. The combined interpretation of these data provides information on the density and temperature distribution at different depth ranges.\nIn the Eastern NCC, a rapid thickness decrease of both crust and lithosphere is reflected, concordant with abrupt changes in surface topography and Bouguer gravity anomaly. Our results together with the widespread magmatic rocks suggest that the Eastern NCC has experienced significant destruction of the lithospheric mantle with substantial modifications and thinning of the crust. In the Central and Western NCC, the generally thick and ‘cold’ lithosphere suggests that the cratonic mantle root is preserved in the central and western NCC, in agreement with the relatively low heat flow, rare magmatic activity and long-term tectonic stability observed at the surface, with some areas mildly modified as indicated by thin lithosphere.",

The Solar Wind Ion Analyzer (SWIA) onboard MAVEN identified a strong CME on March 8th, 2015, characterized by an increase in the solar wind density and solar wind speeds up to about 800 km/s. Simultaneously with the MAVEN observations, the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and Ionospheric Sounding (MARSIS) on MEX detected unusually high local electron density and local magnetic field values in the nightside Martian ionosphere. The Ion Mass Analyzer (IMA) on Analyzer of Space Plasmas and Energetic Atoms (ASPERA-3) instrument, also on MEX, saw a sharp CME front followed by an increase in the ion speed and a sharp enhancement in the electron flux seen by the ASPERA-3 Electron Spectrometer (ELS) signals the CME. ASPERA-3 data also suggest an increase in the plasma temperature when the shock hits Mars. Finally, the peak ionospheric density obtained with MARSIS remote sounding exhibits a discrete enhancement over a period of about 30 hrs around the same latitude and local time. We believe that this high density ionospheric plasma is forced by the CME from dayside to the nightside towards high altitudes.",

Many cities will not be able to rely solely on engineering structures for protection and will need to develop a suite of policy responses to increase their resilience to impacts of rising sea level. Local governments generally maintain day-to-day responsibility and control over the use of the vast majority of property at risk of flooding, and the tools to promote flood risk adaptation are already within the capacity of most cities. Policy tools available to address other land-use problems can be refashioned and used to adapt to sea level rise.\nThis study reviews approaches for urban adaptation through case studies of cities which have developed flood adaptation strategies that combine structural defences with innovative approaches to living with flood risk. The aim of the overall project is to produce a ‘roadmap’ to guide practitioners through the process of analysing coastal flood risk in urban areas. Technical knowledge of flood risk reduction measures is complemented with a consideration of the essential impact that local policy has on the treatment of coastal flooding and the constraints and opportunities that result from the specific country or locality characteristics in relation to economic, political, social and environmental priorities, which are likely to dictate the approach to coastal flooding and the actions proposed. Detailed analyses of the adaptation strategies used by Rotterdam (Netherlands), Bristol (UK), and Norfolk (Virginia) are used to draw out a range of good practice elements that promote effective adaptation to sea level rise. These can be grouped into risk reduction, governance issues, and insurance, and can be used to provide examples of how other cities could adopt and implement flood adaptation strategies from a relatively limited starting position. Most cities will neither be able to defend all areas nor retreat entirely and will need to make a decision to retreat from certain locations or to relocate particular assets in areas at lower risk. We identify a series of specific questions which should be answered by city managers when selecting the most appropriate response for a particular location.",

It incorporates a novel tri-axial accelerometer developed by Quartz Seismic Sensors, Inc, a pressure sensor developed by Paroscientific Inc., and a low-power, high-precision frequency counter and data logger built by RBR, Ltd. The sensors, counters, and loggers are housed in a 7 cm o.d., 70 cm long pressure case designed for use in up to 12 km of water. Sampling intervals are programmable from 0.1 s to 1 hr; standard memory can store up to 30 million samples; total power consumption is roughly 115 mW when operating continuously (1 s.p.s. or higher) and proportionately lower when operating intermittently (e.g., 2 mW at 1 sample per min.). Serial and USB communications protocols allow a variety of download and cable-connection options. Measurement precision of the order of 10-8 of full scale (e.g., 4000 m water depth, 1 g) allows observations of pressure and acceleration variations of 0.4 Pa and 0.1 μm s-2. Long-term variations in vertical acceleration are sensitive to displacement through the gravity gradient at a level of roughly 2 cm; long-term variations in horizontal acceleration are sensitive to tilt at a level of 0.01 μRad. With these sensitivities and the broad bandwidth (5 Hz to DC), ground motion associated with microseisms and seismic waves, tidal loading, and slow and rapid geodynamic deformation normally studied by disparate instruments can be observed with a single tool. The first c. 1-year deployment with the instrument connected to the Ocean Networks Canada NEPTUNE observatory cable is underway to study interseismic deformation of the Cascadia subduction zone. It will then be deployed at the Hikurangi subduction zone to study episodic slow slip. Deployment of the tool for the initial test was accomplished by pushing the tool vertically below the seafloor with the remotely operated vehicle Jason, with no profile remaining above the seafloor to cause current-induced noise. The weight of the tool is designed to approximately match the sediment it displaces to optimize coupling.",

Unlike later instruments at geosynchronous orbit, the CPA detectors had separate ion and electron instruments and the ion instruments did not suffer from false counts caused by energetic electrons. Hence, the ion-radiation-belt measurements by the multispacecraft CPA detectors are of high quality. Contrary to common opinion, the proton radiation belt at geosynchronous orbit is robust; its number density is about 10 times higher than the number density of the electron radiation belt. Recently, (1) reprocessed CPA proton and electron measurements have become available for the years 1976-1995 and (2) a collection of 53 high-speed-stream-driven storms in the years 1976-1992 have been identified. These 53 storms are used to examine the evolution of the proton and electron radiation belts at geosynchronous orbit in high-speed-stream storms. The pre-storm decay, the early storm dropout, the sudden recovery, and the slow long-duration stormtime hardening of the spectra are examined. Some of the stormtime phenomena are similar between protons and electrons (i.e. the pre-storm decay, dropout, and sudden recovery) and some are different (the longtime enhancement during extended storms). The question is posed: Do similar behaviors of the protons and electrons imply that the same physical processes are acting on both populations?",

            "abstract": "With the decline of manufacturing industries, many Rust Belt cities, which enjoyed prosperity in the past, are now suffering from financial stress, population decrease and urban poverty. As a consequence, urban neighborhoods deteriorate. Houses are abandoned and left to decay. Neighborhood vacancy brings on many problems. Governments and agencies try to survey the vacancy level by going through neighborhoods and record the condition of each structure, or by buying information of active mailing addresses to get approximate neighborhood vacancy rate. But these methods are expensive and time consuming. Remote sensing provides a quick and comparatively cost-efficient way to access spatial information on social and demographical attributes of urban area. In our study, we use remote sensing to detect a major aspect of neighborhood deterioration, the vacancy levels of neighborhoods in Detroit city.\nWe compared different neighborhoods using Landsat 8 images in 2013. We calculated NDVI that indicates the greenness of neighborhoods with the image in July 2013. Then we used thermal infrared information from image in February to detect human activities. In winter, abandoned houses will not consume so much energy and therefore neighborhoods with more abandoned houses will have smaller urban heat island effect. Controlling for the differences in terms of the greenness obtained from summer time image, we used thermal infrared from winter image to determine the temperatures of urban surface. We find that hotter areas are better maintained and have lower house vacancy rates. We also compared the changes over time for neighborhoods using Landsat 7 images from 2003 to 2013. The results show that deteriorated neighborhoods have increased NDVI in summer and get colder in winter due to abandonment of houses.\nOur results show the potential application of remote sensing as an easily accessed and efficient way to obtain data about social conditions in cities. We used the neighborhood vacancy survey data for Detroit data (2013-2014) to validate the results of vacancy levels of local neighborhood.",

            "abstract": "Heterogeneous streambed materials may be expected to develop two general porosity domains: a more-mobile porosity dominated by advective exchange, and a less-mobile porosity dominated by diffusive exchange. Less-mobile porosity containing unique redox conditions or contaminant mass may be invisible to traditional porewater sampling methods, even using “low-flow” techniques, because these methods sample water preferentially from the mobile porosity domain. Further, most tracer breakthrough curve analyses have only provided indirect information (tailing) regarding the prevalence and connectivity of less-mobile porosity, typically over experimental flowpath scales between 1-10 meters. To address the limitations of conventional methods, we use electrical geophysical methods to aid in the inference of less-mobile porosity parameters. Unlike traditional fluid sampling, electrical methods can directly sense less-mobile solute and can target specific points along subsurface flowpaths. We demonstrate how the geophysical methodology developed for dual-domain groundwater transport can be scaled to the streambed through synthetic, laboratory column, and field experiments; further we show how previously-used numerical modeling techniques can be replaced by a more-simple analytical approach. The new analytical method is based on electrical theory, and involves characteristics of electrical hysteresis patterns (e.g. hinge point values) that are used to quantify (1) the size of paired mobile and less-mobile porosities, and (2) the exchange rate coefficient through simple curve fitting. Results from the analytical approach compare favorably with results from calibration of numerical models and also independent measurements of mobile and less-mobile porosity. Lastly, we demonstrate a method of focused solute streambed injection to quantify less-mobile porosity and explain redox zonation in contrasting stream environments.",

            "abstract": "Nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) play a key role in atmospheric chemistry. During the day, they catalyze ozone (O3) production, while at night they can react to form nitric acid (HNO3) and nitryl chloride (ClNO2) and remove O3 from the atmosphere. These processes are well studied in the summer, but winter measurements are more limited. Coal-fired power plants are a major source of NOx to the atmosphere, making up approximately 30% of emissions in the US (epa.gov). NOx emissions can vary seasonally, as well as plant-to-plant, with important impacts on the details of the plume chemistry. In particular, due to inefficient plume dispersion, nighttime NOx emissions from power plants are held in concentrated plumes, where rates of mixing with ambient O3 have a strong influence on plume evolution.\nWe will show results from the aircraft-based WINTER campaign over the northeastern United States, where several nighttime intercepts of power plant plumes were made. Several of these intercepts show complete O3 titration, which can have a large influence on NOx lifetime, and thus O3 production, in the plume. When power plant NO emissions exceed background O3 levels, O3 is completely consumed converting NO to NO2. In the presence of O3, NO2 will be oxidized to NO3, which will then react with NO2 to form N2O5, which can then form HNO3 and/or ClNO2 and, ultimately, remove NOx from the atmosphere or provide next-day oxidant sources. If there is no O3 present, however, no further chemistry can occur and NO and NO2 will be transported until mixing with sufficient O3 for higher oxidation products. Modeling results of plume development and mixing, which can tell us more about this transport, will also be presented.",

            "abstract": "In the past few decades, Great Beijing area has experienced rapid and widespread urbanization, which has substantially modified the land surface physical characteristics and affected urban regional weather and climate.\nA single layer urban canopy module has been developed based on the Community Land Surface Model Urban Module (CLMU) with several improvements: the energy balances on the five surface conditions (building roof, sun side and shaded side wall, pervious and impervious land surfaces) are considered separately. A method to calculate sky view factor is developed based on the physically process while most urban models simply provide an empirical value. This method improves the solar and long wave radiation simulation on each surface. The latent heat flux on both wall and impervious land is calculated; the anthropogenic heat is considered in terms of industrial production, domestic wastes, vehicles and air conditions.\nThe urban effect on summer convective precipitation over Beijing was investigated by simulating a heavy storm event on July 21st 2012, when precipitation of averagely 164 mm was brought to Beijing within 6 hours, which is the heaviest during the past 60 years’ record in the region. Numerical simulating experiment was set up by coupling Weather Research and Forecast (WRF)/SSiB3 model with the Modified CLMU (MCLMU). Several control cases without MCLMU were set up. The horizontal resolution in the inner domains was set to be 2 km.\nWhile all of the control results drastically underestimate the urban precipitation, the result of WRF/SSiB3/MCLMU is much closer to the observation. Sensitive experiments show that although large areas of impervious surfaces restrain the surface latent heat flux in urban, the anthropogenic heat and enhanced sensible heat flux warmed up the lower atmospheric layer then strengthen the vertical stratification instability, which is the key factor for heavy storm while moisture is sufficient.",

            "abstract": "The operation of most engineered hydrogeological systems relies on simulating physical processes using numerical models with uncertain parameters and initial conditions. The predictions of such models can be greatly improved by data assimilation techniques. Kalman-type techniques sequentially assimilate monitoring data in real-time to update model predictions. Essentially, this update constitutes a nonlinear optimization, which is solved by linearizing an objective function around the model forecast and applying a linear correction to the predictions. However, if model parameters are uncertain, the optimization problem becomes strongly nonlinear and a linear correction may yield unphysical results. This effect can be reduced by smoothing-based filters, in which current observations are used to correct the state and parameters one step back in time. We propose the smoothing-based Compressed State Kalman filter (sCSKF), an algorithm that combines smoothing-based filtering to tackle nonlinearity effects, with an accurate covariance compression scheme that reduces the computational cost by exploring the high-dimensional state and parameter space more efficiently. The latter feature is crucial for large-scale applications with a large number of unknowns. Our numerical experiments for a CO2 sequestration application show that the sCSKF gives more accurate model and parameter estimates than its non-smoothing variant for large assimilation intervals or highly uncertain model parameters. As such conditions are often true in real field applications, the sCSKF presents a reliable and practical method for large-scale joint state-parameter estimation problems with strong non-linearity. Finally, in our experiments the sCSKF provides similar accuracy at an equal or lower computational cost than the iterative Kalman Filter, a more conventional approach for reducing nonlinearity effects.",

            "abstract": "Shallow cumulus cloud fields in Amazonia are typical of the morning hours. They play a critical role in the mean observed diurnal cycle of precipitation in the Amazon Basin, which is characterized by the occurrence of heavy precipitation events in the afternoon. Shallow clouds act both to reduce incident shortwave radiation at the surface and in the transport of humidity from the lowest portions of the troposphere to higher levels. These two processes are poorly represented in numerical models, but are critical in the transition to deep convection and associated precipitation. Numerical models have problems in properly representing shallow cumulus fields and their transition to deep precipitating convection, the net result of which is producing rainfall to early in the diurnal cycle. Due to their importance, detailed characterization of morning shallow clouds is critical for understanding the shallow-to-deep transition as well as providing for model validation purposes.\nIn this study we report 16 month data of observations of shallow cumulus with respect to cloud cover (CC), cloud base height (CBH), liquid water path (LWP), precipitable water vapor (PWV) and GOES (Visible and IR)analysis. Results showed a consistent pattern of evolution in the cloud field throughout the morning period. After sunrise the cloud field starts to move from a random cloud field to an organized shallow clouds field. In fact, there is an absence of any pattern in CBH from 6LT to 7LT. Once some amount of radiation reaches the surface shallow convection is established around 8:00LT, when a mode of CBH at 100 m is established and rises to 900 m at noon. During this time interval, CC grows up to 50% (mean), however with significant variability and oscillations. With respect to microphysical properties, both LWP and PWV were remarkably stable for single mornings and for shallow clouds, with LWP/PWV ~ 6.10-4. All of these results are being compared with GOES observations of cloud fields (Visible and IR), with the goal of directly comparing satellite and surface observations of clouds.",

            "abstract": "Pi2 pulsations are irregular oscillations having 40-150 s periods, and their source lies in the nightside magnetosphere. Electromagnetic disturbances associated with Pi2 pulsations propagate through the magnetosphere by magnetohydrodynamic waves. The compressional fast mode waves are launched by localized plasma sheet fast flows and propagate into the inner magnetosphere. On the other hand, the velocity shears at the edge of these flows excite shear Alfven waves, which transport magnetic shear and carry field-aligned currents along field lines. These propagation processes have been proposed based on several previous studies using magnetic field observations and numerical simulations. However, there have been few results by electric field observations although the electric field is an important quantity for detecting Pi2 pulsations than magnetic field. In addition, Pi2 pulsations are known to be associated with substorms. Nishimura et al. [2012] shows evolution of auroral streamers at the substorm onset time followed by Pi2 pulsations after a few minutes, using ground-based observations. It suggests that Pi2 pulsations are driven by multiple plasma sheet flow bursts to earthward, and reflects the nature of the current wedge and plasma sheet flow bursts. However, it is unknown whether Pi2 pulsations in the magnetosphere are caused by the oscillating current wedge or induced by a cavity mode. Therefore, simultaneous spacecraft and ground-based observations need to investigate this issue. In this study, we investigate the evolution and propagation of the electric field during Pi2 pulsations using THEMIS, Van Allen Probes, GOES 13 and 15, SuperDARN and HF Doppler radars. Pi2 events are identified by the low-latitude geomagnetic field detected at Kakioka and AL index. We will investigate several events that satellites and radars have the same local time, and evaluate the possible propagation process of the electromagnetic energy associated with Pi2 pulsations.",

            "abstract": "Hyperpycnal flows are river-derived turbidity currents, which - in the marine realm - commonly contain interstitial fluid that is fresher and therefore less dense than ambient fluid. These flows travel along the seabed surface due to their high suspended sediment concentrations, and their fate depends heavily on the balance between factors that increase bulk flow density, e.g. entrainment of sediment or ambient water, and those that decrease bulk flow density, e.g. deposition of suspended sediment. If suspended sediment is rapidly deposited from the flow, bulk flow density and flow velocity will decrease until it reaches a point of equal density to the ambient fluid through which it is travelling. Once this point is reached, the flow can begin to rise to the water surface or to a depth of neutral buoyancy in a process known as lofting.\nWe ran 21 experimental turbidity currents with varying bulk flow and interstitial fluid densities, across three different basin geometries, in order to characterize the effect on deposit geometry. Our findings show that lofted turbidity currents are width-limited and generate narrower, more elongate deposits than bed-attached flows. We also show that steeper ramp gradients push the lofting point farther out into the basin. We show the effect of variations in bulk flow density, suspended sediment concentration, and fluid density on overall deposit geometry and flow run-out distances. Most importantly, the use of a 3-dimensional experimental tank allows for the first detailed analysis of the lofting process and its effects on length-to-width ratios of turbidite lobes.",

            "abstract": "Mass loss across the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) has accelerated in recent decades and recently a fundamental change in the nature of this mass loss has begun. The dominant GrIS mass-loss process has switched from ice dynamics to surface mass balance (SMB) processes, including melt generation and runoff. This recent shift further emphasizes the need to monitor and constrain SMB, which, across most of the GrIS, is dominated by accumulation. High resolution, near-surface radar data have shown good fidelity at mapping spatial patterns of accumulation to validate model outputs. To better constrain accumulation over the GrIS, we derive annual accumulation rates using NASA Operation IceBridge (OIB) Snow Radar data collected from 2009 through 2012. Accumulation is calculated using the radar-determined depth to an annual layer and the local snow/firn density profile. Up to 30 years of annual stratigraphy is observed in the interior of the ice sheet, near Summit Station, while only the past year is detectable in the ablation zone around the perimeter of the ice sheet. Annual layering is traced using a semi-automatic algorithm and mapped across large areas (tens of thousands of line kilometers). A combined measured and modeled density profile is used to convert the annual stratigraphy into accumulation. Modeled density profiles from the Modèle Atmosphérique Régional (MAR) model are shown to be less than half of in situ observations in the top 1 m of snow/firn and are, therefore, replaced with in situ measurements. Using a compilation of in situ measurements, the mean GrIS snow/firn density is found to be ~340 +/- 40 kg/m3 in the top 1 m. Error in the snow density profile represents the largest error in the radar-derived accumulation. The pattern of radar-derived accumulation rate compares well with MAR estimates, although the latter has a mean bias of 4.6 cm water equivalent, a root mean square error of 16.8 cm water equivalent and a correlation coefficient of 0.6 across the entire GrIS. The accumulation-rate dataset we produced represents the largest Greenland-wide validation dataset for recent annual accumulation and, hence, SMB studies.",

We here present the first ambient measurements of N2O5 and ClNO2 in inland regions of northern China, which is suffering from severe photochemical smog and haze pollution. A chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) was deployed at a semi-rural site in Wangdu, Hebei and on the top of Mt Tai, Shandong (1500 m a.s.l.) during the summer of 2014. At Wangdu, significant levels of ClNO2 were observed persistently throughout the campaign, with the maximum concentration of up to 2.1 ppbv (1-min data). N2O5 were generally in small concentrations but on few occasions reached up to hundreds of pptv. Clear variation of ClNO2 and N2O5 from night to night suggests the variability of N2O5 heterogeneous reactivity under different conditions over the region. On the mountain-top, elevated ClNO2-laden plumes were frequently observed around mid-night with a 1-min maximum of 2.1 ppbv, whilst N2O5 was always in very low levels indicating a fast N2O5 hydrolysis. The elevated ClNO2 levels at both locations were significantly influenced by the high NOx-saturated urban plumes and non-oceanic sources of chloride like biomass burning and coal-fired power plants in the region. MCM (Master Chemical Mechanism) modeling analyses indicate the significance of ClNO2 photolysis to the daytime radical and ozone production. Our study implies that the N2O5 reactivity and chlorine activation are significant in North China, and should be also important in other non-marine regions of China where NOx and particle chloride are in great abundances.",

Current methods for obtaining in-situ data, including radar and satellite imagery as well as drop-sondes deployed from repeated aircraft flights above or even within the hurricane itself, are costly, dangerous and limited in duration or resolution. We demonstrate how a swarm of inexpensive, buoyancy-controlled, sensor-laden balloons can be deployed from altitude or from sea-level within a hurricane flow field, and coordinated autonomously in an energetically-efficient fashion to persistently and continuously monitor relevant properties (pressure, humidity, temperature, windspeed) of a hurricane for days at a time. Rather than fighting the gale-force winds in the storm, the strong, predictable stratification of these winds is leveraged to disperse the balloons into a favorable, time-evolving distribution and to follow the hurricane track as it moves. Certain target orbits of interest in the hurricane can be continuously sampled by some balloons, while other balloons make continuous sweeps between the eye and the spiral rain bands. We expect the acquired data to complement current measurement methods and to be instrumental in improving the numerical models’ forecast skills.",

Presently, Canada doesn’t have a national dataset that can provide near-real-time geospatial information on crop growth stage and harvest systematically so that reporting on risk events can be linked directly to the grain supply chain and crop production fluctuations.\nThe intent of this study is to develop an integrated approach using Earth observation (EO) technology to provide a consistent, comprehensive picture of crop growth cycles (growth conditions and stages) and agricultural management activities (field preparation for seeding, harvest, and residue management). Integration of the optical and microwave satellite remote sensing technologies is imperative for robust methodology development and eventually for operational implementation. Particularly, the current synthetic aperture radar (SAR) system Radarsat-2 and to be launched Radarsat Constellation Mission (RCM) are unique EO resources to Canada. Incorporating these Canadian SAR resources with international SAR missions such as the Cosmesky-Med and TerraSAR, could be of great potential for developing change detection technologies particularly useful for monitoring harvest as well as other types of agricultural management events.\nThe study revealed that radar and multi-scale (30m and 250m) optical satellite data can directly detect or infer 1) seeding date, 2) crop growth stages and gross primary productivity (GPP), and 3) harvest progress. Operational prototypes for providing growing-season information at the crop-specific level will be developed across the Canadian agricultural land base.",

In that regard, the reconstruction of past extreme weather events can help in the assessment of vulnerability and risk mitigation actions. Using novel modeling approaches, dynamical downscaling of long-term integrations from global circulation models can be useful for risk analysis, providing more accurate climate information at regional scales.\nOriginally developed at the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP), the Regional Spectral Model (RSM) is being used in the dynamical downscaling of global reanalysis, within the South American Hydroclimate Reconstruction Project. Here, RSM combines scale-selective bias correction with assimilation of satellite-based precipitation estimates to downscale extreme weather occurrences. Scale-selective bias correction is a method employed in the downscaling, similar to the spectral nudging technique, in which the downscaled solution develops in agreement with its coarse boundaries. Precipitation assimilation acts on modeled deep-convection, drives the land-surface variables, and therefore the hydrological cycle.\nDuring the downscaling of extreme events that took place in Brazil in recent years, RSM continuously assimilated NCEP Climate Prediction Center morphing technique precipitation rates. As a result, RSM performed better than its global (reanalysis) forcing, showing more consistent hydrometeorological fields compared with more sophisticated global reanalyses.\nUltimately, RSM analyses might provide better-quality initial conditions for high-resolution numerical predictions in metropolitan areas, leading to more reliable short-term forecasting of severe local storms.",

Currently, global underground nuclear explosion monitoring relies on seismic and infrasound sensor networks to provide rapid initial detection of potential underground nuclear tests. While seismic and infrasound might be able to generally locate potential underground nuclear tests, additional sensing methods might be required to further pinpoint test site locations. Optical remote sensing is a robust approach for site location and characterization due to the ability it provides to search large areas relatively quickly, resolve surface features in fine detail, and perform these tasks non-intrusively. Optical remote sensing provides both cultural and surface geological information about a site, for example, operational infrastructure, surface fractures. Surface geological information, when combined with known or estimated subsurface geologic information, could provide clues concerning test parameters. We have characterized two legacy nuclear test sites on the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS), U20ak and U20az using helicopter-, ground- and unmanned aerial system-based RGB imagery and light detection and ranging (lidar) systems. The multi-faceted information garnered from these different sensing modalities has allowed us to build a knowledge base of how a nuclear test site might look when sensed remotely, and the standoff distances required to resolve important site characteristics.",

This research analyzes the relationship between two readily-accessible drought indices – the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and Palmer Hydrologic Drought Index (PHDI) – and the damage incurred by such droughts in terms of monetary loss, over the 1975-2010 time period on monthly basis, for five states in the south-central U.S.A. Because drought damage in the Spatial Hazards Events and Losses Database for the United States (SHELDUSTM) is reported at the county level, statistical downscaling techniques were used to estimate the county-level PDSI and PHDI. Correlation analysis using the downscaled indices suggests that although relatively few months contain drought damage reports, in general drought indices can be useful predictors of drought damage at the monthly temporal scale extended to 12 months and at the county-wide spatial scale. The varying time lags between occurrence of drought and reporting of damage, perhaps due to varying resilience to drought intensity and duration by crop types across space, irrigation methods, and adaptation measures of the community to drought varies over space and time, are thought to contribute to weakened correlations. These results present a reminder of the complexities of anticipating the effects of drought but they contribute to the effort to improve our ability to mitigate the effects of incipient drought.",

            "abstract": "In order to better understand the kinematic history of the Qaidam block after the breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent, paleomagnetic studies have been carried out on late Carboniferous sediments from the Dachaidan areas in the internal Qaidam block. Totally, 200 sedimentary samples were collected from 20 sites in the late Carboniferous limestones. The stepwise thermal demagnetizations successfully isolated high unblocking temperature characteristic directions (HTC). The tilt-corrected mean direction is D/I =319.3°/-45.6° with α95=4.9° and N=20 sites, corresponding to a paleopole at -15.1°N, 133.1°E with A95=5.0°. All late Carboniferous samples from the studied section yield stable and coherent magnetic directions with reverse magnetic polarity. The predominance (100%) of reversed directions favor the interpretation that the HTC represents a primary remanence acquired during the permo-Carboniferous reversed polarity superchron. Comparisons of the late Carboniferous paleomagnetic poles of the Tarim block and Siberia blocks indicate (1) significant latitudinal relative motion (11.3° ± 6.7° and 8.1° ± 4.3°) occurred since the Late Carboniferous among these blocks, and they may have not accreted together by the late Carboniferous, (2) the 89.9°± 8.3° and the 77.5°± 4.9° counterclockwise rotations of the Qaidam block with respect to Tarim and Siberia block took place since late Carboniferous. These rotations may be accommodated by the post-late Carboniferou strike–slip faults along Altyn Tagh fault and Tianshan Belt and the Altay Belt.",

It was suspected that this earthquake may have been associated with an unrecognized active fault in the area. In this study, soil-gas samples were collected from eighty-four measuring stations covering an area of approximately 50 km2. Radon in soil-gas samples was quantified using Scintrex Radon Detector, RDA-200. The samplings were conducted twice: during December 2014–January 2015 and March 2015–April 2015. The soil-gas radon map obtained from this study reveals linear NNW-SSE trend of high concentration. This anomaly corresponds to the direction of the prospective fault system interpreted from satellite images. The findings from this study support the existence of this unknown fault system. However a more detailed investigation should be conducted in order to confirm its geometry, orientation and lateral extent.",

A rainfall decline of consistent direction but of larger amplitude than those simulated has been observed in Chile during the last decades, but the causes of this trend have never been formally attributed. With this purpose, we analyze local rain-gauge data and contrast them to a large ensemble both of fully-coupled and sea surface temperature-forced simulations. In concomitance with large-scale circulation changes, we show that the Pacific Decadal Oscillation explains about 50% of the rainfall trend observed since 1979 in central Chile. Our results also indicate that the remaining fraction of the observed drying is unlikely (p < 0.05) to be driven exclusively by natural phenomena, but is consistent with the simulated regional effect of climate change. Given these results, we conclude that the increasing frequency of drought, such as the one that has been affecting central Chile since 2010, emerges as a realistic scenario for this region under the current socio-economic pathway.",

This type of flow is considered to be characterized by developing roll waves (surges) due to flow instabilities and by a weak sediment concentrations. For a understanding of initial phenomenon and fluctuation of the flow depth, wave equations and understanding characteristics of the solutions are needed. It is presented a wave equation and some solutions of roll waves based on shallow water momentum equation. These results show an improved understanding of the phenomena and wave equation of developing roll wave.\n2. WAVE EQUATION AND SOME SOLUTIONS\nConsidering momentam equation of shallow water on inclined channel and using reductive perturbation method, a wave equation which is a kind of KdV-Burgers equation was obtained. For on long wave velocity, some analitical solutions and numerical solutions ware obtained. Relationships of wave equation, it's solutions and phenomenon are discussed.\n3. CONCLUSION\nA wave of minute disturbance on long wave velocity is governed by Burgers equation. For not fixed boundary condition and initial wave condition of not multiple wave number, an initial wave is deformed to a wave which wave number is one.\nThe wave is caused a phase and the phenomena is shifted from Burgers equation to KdV-Burgers equation which has the characteristic of the solitary wave.",

            "abstract": "Estimations of hydrocarbon and water resources as well as reservoir management during production are the main challenges facing the resource recovery industry nowadays. The recently discovered reservoirs are not only deep but they are also located in complicated geological formations. Hence, the effect of anisotropy on reservoir imaging becomes significant.\nShear wave (S-wave) splitting has been observed in the field and laboratory experiments for decades. Despite the fact that S-wave splitting is widely used for evaluation of subsurface anisotropy, the effects of stresses as well fluid saturation on anisotropy have not been understood in detail. In this paper we present the laboratory study of the effect of stress and saturation on S-wave splitting for a Bentheim sandstone sample.\nThe cubic sample (50mm3), porosity 22%, density 1890kg/m3) was placed into a true-triaxial cell. The sample was subjected to several combinations of stresses varying from 0 to 10MPa and applied to the sample in two directions (X and Y), while no stress was applied to the sample in the Z-direction. The sample’s bedding was nearly oriented parallel to Y-Z plane. The ultrasonic S-waves were exited at a frequency of 0.5MHz by a piezoelectric transducer and were propagating in the Z-direction. Upon wave arrival onto the free surface the displacement of the surface was monitored by a Laser Doppler interferometer. Hodograms of the central point of the dry sample (Fig. 1) demonstrate how S-wave polarizations for both “fast” and “slow” S-waves change when increasing the stress in the X direction, while the stress in direction Y is kept constant at 3 MPa. Polarization of the fast S wave is shifted towards the X-axis (axis of the maximum stress). While both S-wave velocities increase with stress, the anisotropy level remains the same. No shift of polarization of fast wave was observed when the stress along the Y-axis was kept at 3 MPa, while the stress along the X-axis was increasing. However, in that case, S-wave splitting is more prominent. The fast S-wave velocity is increasing with the stress increase while the slow S-wave velocity starts decreasing after 5MPa, indicating possible cracks opening in the Y-direction. Interestingly no change in anisotropy was observed for the water-saturated sample.",

            "abstract": "Natural river’s bedload often hard to measure, which leads numerous uncertainties for us to predict the landscape evolution. However, the measurement of bedload flux has its certain importance to estimate the river hazard. Thus, we use seismometer to receive the seismic signal induced by bedload for partially fill the gap of field measurement capabilities.\nOur research conducted a controlled dam breaking experiments at Landao River, Huisun Forest since it has advantage to well constraining the spatial and temporal variation of bedload transport. We set continuous bedload trap at downstream riverbed of dam to trap the transport bedload after dam breaking so as to analyze its grain size distribution and transport behavior. In the meantime we cooperate with two portable velocity seismometers (Guralp CMG6TD) along the river to explore the relationship between bedload transport and seismic signal.\nBedload trap was divided into three layers, bottom, middle, and top respectively. After the experiment, we analyzed the grain size and found out the median particle size from bottom to top is 88.664mm, 129.601mm, and 214.801mm individually. The median particle size of top layer is similar with the upstream riverbed before the experiment which median particle size is 230.683mm. This phenomena indicated that as the river flow become stronger after dam breaking, the sediment size will thereupon become larger, which meant the sediment from upstream will be carried down by the water flow and turned into bedload. Furthermore, we may tell apart the seismic signal induced by water flow and bedload by means of two different position seismometers. Eventually, we may estimate the probable error band of bedload quantity via accurately control of water depth, time-lapse photography, 3D LiDAR and other hydrology parameters.",

            "abstract": "We present a catalog of full seismic moment tensors for 63 events from Uturuncu volcano in Bolivia. The events were recorded during 2011-2012 in the PLUTONS seismic array of 24 broadband stations. Most events had magnitudes between 0.5 and 2.0 and did not generate discernible surface waves; the largest event was Mw 2.8. For each event we computed the misfit between observed and synthetic waveforms, and we also used first-motion polarity measurements to reduce the number of possible solutions. Each moment tensor solution was obtained using a grid search over the six-dimensional space of moment tensors. For each event we characterize the variation of moment tensor source type by plotting the misfit function in eigenvalue space, represented by a lune. We plot the optimal solutions for the 63 events on the lune in order to identify three subsets of the catalog: (1) a set of isotropic events, (2) a set of tensional crack events, and (3) a swarm of events southeast of the volcanic center that appear to be double couples. The occurrence of positively isotropic events is consistent with other published results from volcanic and geothermal regions. Several of these previous results, as well as our results, cannot be interpreted within the context of either an oblique opening crack or a crack-plus-double-couple model; instead they require a multiple-process source model. Our study emphasizes the importance of characterizing uncertainties for full moment tensors, and it provides strong support for isotropic events at Uturuncu volcano.",

During a first intensive campaign in January-February 2014, evidence was observed for substantial elevations in a wide range of greenhouse gases and ozone depleting substances, including CO­2 and CH4 and industrially-derived halocarbons such as HCFCs, HFCs and chlorinated solvents, during “cold surge” conditions at the end of the winter monsoon. Carbon monoxide and ozone were also elevated at such times. Air mass footprints indicated that flow during these events was from eastern China and the Indochina Peninsular. Satellite fire counts indicated that substantial biomass burning was taking place, notably in Vietnam and Cambodia, at this time. As the air mass footprints moved east towards the Western Pacific, mixing ratios of all such gases declined to typical northern hemispheric background conditions. These findings are of note both as a clear indication of the long-range transport of a mixture of biomass burning products and industrial emissions over thousands of kilometres across the South China Sea, and also because such transported pollutants may be subject to rapid vertical transport to the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere by tropical deep convection.",

The chemical composition of these lavas ranges from normal-MORB to enriched-MORB, and the newly analyzed 18O/16O ratios of hand-picked fresh glasses from these 53 lavas were measured using laser-fluorination technique, with a typical precision of ±0.08‰ (1σ).\nOur results show that the δ18OSMOW values of EPR glasses span ～0.64‰ (from 5.08‰ to 5.72‰), with an average value of 5.53(±0.12, 1σ) ‰, which is comparable to results from previous survey of global MORBs (5.52±0.11‰) [1]. Two andesitic glasses show unusually lower δ18O values (5.08‰ and 5.27‰, respectively) and exhibit excess Cl addition ([Cl]>3000ppm), probably indicating an assimilation of seawater-derived component (e.g., saline brines or altered oceanic crust). Previous studies [2, 3, 4, 5] have shown the correlated variations of trace element ratios (e.g. La/Sm, and K2O/TiO2 element ratios) and radiogenic isotope compositions (e.g. 87Sr/86Sr, 143Nd/144Nd, Pb isotope ratios), suggesting the presence of at least two components in the source of EPR MORBs, an enriched component and depleted component. Our results show that δ18O values of these glasses lack statistically-significant correlations with other geochemical indicies in the same sample, suggesting that (1) the source of EPR MORBs has a uniform oxygen isotope composition, (2) the enriched components in the sources cannot be directly derived from recycled upper oceanic crustal rocks/sediments.\n",

            "abstract": "We have developed an efficient technique to process and measure surface-wave amplitude and phase from a large collection of seismic waveforms. These amplitude and phase data sets are used to jointly invert for 2D phase velocity and attenuation maps. As demonstrated by Dalton and Ekstrom (2006), correcting for the effects of focusing and defocusing by elastic structure is crucial in order to obtain reliable attenuation structures.\nA robust theory that can reliably predict focusing-defocusing effects and is insensitive to the details of making the phase velocity maps is preferred. Great circle ray theory can give useful predictions for the focusing-defocusing effects if careful attention is paid to how the phase velocity model is smoothed. However, the predictions of the finite frequency kernels are more robust at the low-intermediate frequency range (below 25mHz) and suggest that they are better suited as a basis for inversion.\nWe invert for the phase velocity, attenuation, source, and receiver terms simultaneously. Our models provide 60-70% variance reduction to the raw data though the source terms are the biggest contribution to the fit of the data. The attenuation maps show structures that correlate well with surface tectonics and the age-dependent trend of attenuation is clearly seen in the ocean basins. We have also identified problematic stations and earthquake sources as a by-product of our data selection process.\nAlthough our approach was developed for a global study, it can be extended to regional studies. Our first regional-scale application of this approach is to the Atlantic upper mantle.",

Five phases of effusive activity have now occurred, characterized by dome building and collapse, causing numerous evacuations and the emigration of half of the population.\nOver the years, the volcano monitoring network has greatly expanded. The GPS network, started from few geodetic markers, now consists of 14 continuous dual frequency GPS stations, distributed on and around the edifice, where topography and vegetation allow. The continuous GPS time series have given invaluable insight into the volcano behavior, notably revealing deflation/inflation cycles corresponding to phases and pauses of effusive activity, respectively.\nIn 2014, collaboration of the CALIPSO Project (Penn State; NSF) with the Montserrat Volcano Observatory enriched the GPS and seismic monitoring networks with six ‘spider’ stations. The ‘spiders’, developed by R. Lahusen at Cascades Volcano Observatory, are designed to be deployed easily in rough areas and combine a low cost seismic station and a L1-only GPS station. To date, three ‘spiders’ have been deployed on Soufrière Hills Volcano, the closest at ~1 km from the volcanic conduit, adjacent to a lava lobe on the dome.\nHere we present the details of GPS data processing in a network consisting of both dual and single frequency receivers (‘spiders’) using GAMIT/GLOBK software. Processing together single and dual frequency data allowed their representation in a common reference frame, and a meaningful geophysical interpretation of all the available data. We also present the ‘spiders’ time series along with the results from the rest of the network and examine if any significant deformation, correlating with other manifestations of volcanic activity, has been recorded by the ‘spiders’ since deployment. Our results demonstrate that low cost GNSS equipment can serve as valuable components in volcano deformation monitoring networks.",

One of the most complex of such problems is the role of aerosol-clouds-climate interactions in climate change. During the last 7 years we have designed field experiments with light weight UAVs that are flown in stacked as well as formation flying patterns to map out the three dimensional structure of the atmosphere. Such formation and stacked formation flights have enabled us to measure simulatneously aerosol chemistry, cloud micro physics, cloud albedo, divergence of radiative heating of the atmosphere and more recently the vertical structure of turbulent fluxes of water avpor and momentum. These first-such measurments have provided new insights into the role of aerosols in cloud albedo; vertical distribution of black and brown carbon heating; role of absorbing aerosols in the melting of Himalayan glaciers; role of mixing state of aerosols in aerosol forcing and recently the link between absorbing aerosols and turbulent fluxes. All of the instruments had to be miniaturized to fit into the UAVs with maximum of 6 kg of payload. The most impprtant aspects of our studies are that the instruments and their intergration with the UAvs were all developed by post doctoral candidates and students. Thus the light weight UAVs are ideal platforms for making pioneerign studies by students and young scientists.",

It is said that there are CO2-trap mechanisms in the geological formations, such as capillary trap, dissolution trap, and mineral trap. In this study, we focus on another trap mechanism: namely, hydrate trap. If the water is deep in the ocean, say more than 250 m, CO2 hydrate forms near the sea floor, at which temperature and pressure conditions can stabilise CO2 hydrate. To predict the gas productivity, it is important to know permeability damage in hydrate bearing sediments. Although hydrate saturation is the same, the permeability is different depending on its spatial distribution within the pore of sand sediment. Here, to know where hydrate is formed in the pore of porous media, we propose a numerical model for estimating the microscopic distribution of CO2 hydrate in sand sediment using a classical nucleation theory and the phase-field model.",

Sorption technology is increasingly considered as a reliable, efficient and environmentally friendly P removal method from aqueous solution. In this study, a series of Mg-Al-based layered double hydroxide nanocomposites and their corresponding calcined products were fabricated and applied as phosphate adsorbents. The prepared samples were with average size at ~50 nm and self-assembled into larger particles in irregular shapes. The results of batch adsorption experiments demonstrated that calcination significantly enhanced the adsorption ability of LDHs for phosphorus, and the maximum adsorption capacity of calcined Mg-Al-LDH was as high as 100.7 mg-P/g. Furthermore, incorporation of Zr4+ and La3+ into LDH materials increases the sorption selectivity as well as sorption amount of phosphorus in LDHs, which was confirmed by experiments operated in synthetic human urine. For the first time ammonia (NH4OH) and potassium hydroxide (KOH) solutions were employed to desorb the P-loaded LDH. Identification of solids derived from two eluting solutions showed that struvite (MgNH4PO4•6H2O, MAP) was precipitated in ammonia solution while most phosphate was desorbed into liquid phase in KOH system without crystallization of potassium struvite (MgKPO4•6H2O) due to its higher solubility. Quantitative X-ray diffraction technique was used to determine struvite contents in obtained solids and the results revealed that ~ 30% of adsorbed P was transferred into struvite form in the sample extracted by 0.5M NH4OH. Leaching tests suggested that the phosphorus releasing kinetics of ammonia treated LDH was comparable to that of pure struvite product, indicating that postsorption Mg-Al-LDH desorbed with ammonia could serve as a slow-releasing fertilizer in agriculture (see Figure 1).",

The typical approach to simulating this process involves the solution of coupled mass conservation equations with Darcy-based flux terms, but this method ignores the complex pore-scale processes that influence the propagation rate and shape of drainage fronts. Therefore, we explore weaknesses in the practical application of the continuum-scale Darcy approach for modeling primary drainage by comparing 1D numerical simulations to laboratory core-scale observations. The multiphase properties of cylindrical bead packs are characterized by stepped outflow experiments and standard hydrological models are used to describe water retention and relative permeability, such as van Genuchten-Mualem. Subsequently, we generate predictions of drainage front breakthrough time with Tough2 and compare them to observations of gravitationally stabilized primary drainage at low capillary number. We find that Corey’s critical nonwetting saturation parameter must be used in relative permeability curves in order to match observations, and that the best-fit value is flow-rate dependent and grid-size independent. We also argue that the value of this parameter is not constrained by current experimental methods or physical arguments, and that it is an important but irreducible source of uncertainty in the standard approach to multiphase flow. This highlights the need for a scalable model that incorporates dynamic percolation thresholds with dependency on pore-scale processes.",

            "abstract": "That deglaciation influences mid-ocean ridge volcanism is well established for Iceland, where depressurization associated with melting a ~2 km ice cap led to order of magnitude increases in volcanism during the last deglaciation. The case was also made that the more subtle ~100 m changes in sea level that accompany glacial cycles have identifiable implications for undersea mid-ocean ridge systems using both models and data from the Australian-Antarctic Ridge (Crowley et al., 2015). Sea level rising at ~1 cm/year during deglaciation leads to an expectation of ~10\\% decreases in melt production at ridges, given mantle upwelling rates of \\sim3 cm/yr at intermediate spreading ridges and mantle density being ~3 times that of seawater. The implications of variations in melt production for bathymetry, however, involve numerous considerations, including whether melt signals are cancelled within the melt column, appreciably alter accretionary or fault processes, and have identifiable surface expressions. Further empirical assessment of bathymetry is thus useful for purposes of confirming patterns and constraining processes. Here we report on spectral analyses of bathymetry recently acquired from the Juan de Fuca ridge between 44°30'N and 45°15'N during the SeaVOICE expedition. Multibeam swath sonar data were acquired with an EM122 sonar insonfiying seafloor to crustal ages of \\sim2 ma with 35 m spatial resolution. We examine (1.) the statistical significance of concentrations of bathymetric variability at the 100 ky, 41 ky, and 23 ky periods characteristic of late-Pleistocene sea level variability; (2.) whether sea level responses are primarily at 41 ky periods in crust accreted during the early Pleistocene, when global sea level variations were primarily at this period; and (3.) if sea level responses are superimposed on bathymetry variations or, instead, align with fault features. We also note that Juan de Fuca's proximity to the Cordilleran Ice Sheet implies that regional sea level variations could be distinct from global changes. ",

The >4 km uppermost Cretaceous–lower Miocene EC succession and ~2.5 km upper Oligocene–Miocene SAZ clastic successions record a shift from fluvial backbulge to pedogenic forebulge deposition. Braided, meandering, and lacustrine foredeep deposition records the most-rapid subsidence, with a later shift to progradational braided and alluvial fan deposition in the wedge-top zone. Growth strata preserved in EC and SAZ wedge-top deposits suggest unsteady eastward advance of the deformation front. Distal foreland deposits show west-directed paleocurrents with >1 Ga detrital zircon populations. Emerging Andean sources are indicated by east-directed paleocurrents, <0.7 Ga detrital zircon populations, and hinterland clast compositions. Time-transgressive patterns of punctuated exhumation in the EC (>36-25 Ma), Interandean Zone (IAZ, ~22-7 Ma) and SAZ (<6 Ma) can be linked to eastward passage of a flexural forebulge, recorded as a 50-200 m thick condensed zone in EC and SAZ basin fill. Integrated assessment of basin architecture, provenance, and exhumation highlights the potential influence of pre-Cenozoic IAZ heterogeneities on orogenic wedge growth.",

Representative Concentration Pathway, RCP 8.5, characterized by increasing greenhouse gas emissions over time is taken for the analysis.\nData from four GCMs (MPI-ESM-LR, CSIRO-MK3.6, CMCC-CMS, BCC-CSM1.1) is used and downscaled spatial and temporally to local gages sites using standard statistical procedures. The model selection procedure was based on the preservation of the observed precipitation and temperature regimes for the base line period through the comparison of the average monthly values of the observed and spatial downscaled variables normalized respect to annual values for one of the sites. Base line data is defined for the period 1975-2005 and two future periods are studied: near future stands for 2015-2045 and far ahead future stands for 2045-2075. For the analysis we consider hydrologic year starting on April and ending on March of following year.\nWe analyse the behaviour of daily time series of precipitation and temperature for gages located at -33.5° latitude, -70.5° longitude to -37.7° latitude, -72° longitude. Mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, the number of days with precipitation, the number of days with precipitation less or greater than specific values, the mean temperature during rainy days and in extreme events, for each period (base line, near and far ahead future) are determined for each site. Special attention is given to the effect of temperatures on rainy days on the elevation of 0°C isotherm on representative watersheds and to the occurrence of extreme events during the snowmelt period with high elevation of 0°C isotherm.\nIn general, results show a spatial decay of annual precipitation from north to south from base line to future being greater the falloff for far ahead future. Similarly the number of rainy days decreases in the future and this decay is greater at the northern site than at the southern site. Results for temperature indicate that this variable would rise in the future in Chile for all the sites we analysed; nevertheless the increase is higher at the southern site than at the northern one.",

            "abstract": "The high flux of magma associated with super eruptions is hypothesized to rebuild the deep crust, altering the source(s) of subsequent magmatism. Climax-type Mo deposits are commonly generated immediately after eruption of large ignimbrites within a volcanic field, and provide an opportunity to understand the evolution of magma sources following high flux events. The Questa caldera of the Latir volcanic field, NM exposes a 10 Ma long record of pre-, syn- and post-ignimbrite intrusive and extrusive rocks, and hosts the Questa Climax-type Mo deposit. New detailed geochronology and geochemistry from Questa (including extensive sampling of subsurface rocks in the mine) permit detailed reconstruction of the temporal evolution of magma sources through the waxing and waning stages of super eruption magmatism.\nComparison of chemical and isotopic data waxing, ignimbrite, Mo-mineralizing and waning stage magmas reveals several patterns. Waxing and waning magmas (waxing: 29-25.7 Ma; waning: 24.5-19 Ma) have intermediate trace elements and radiogenic isotopes relative to other magmatism (87Sr/86Sri=0.7050 to 0.7070, ɛNd=-5.2 to -7.2). Ignimbrite magmatism (25.5 Ma) is depleted in incompatible elements, enriched in MREE and HREE’s and has more evolved radiogenic isotopes (87Sr/86Sri=0.7095, ɛNd=-8.0). Molybdenum mineralizing magmas (24.9-24.5 Ma), are enriched in incompatible elements, depleted in MREE and HREE’s and have distinct radiogenic isotopes (87Sr/86Sri=0.7055 to 0.7075, ɛNd=-4.2 to -5.7). We suggest the lower crustal source of magmas changed during ignimbrite generation, and as a result, subsequent mineralizing magmas incorporated more juvenile, mafic components. This mantle influence is the metallogenesis for Climax-type deposits and indicates that deep crustal hybridization, rather than upper crustal differentiation, is pivotal in their generation. These results indicate that a lower crustal source of magmatism for a volcanic field is altered due to super eruptions.",

Here we model the magnetosphere of the comet using a hybrid plasma solver (ions as particles, electrons as a fluid). The undisturbed upstream solar wind ion conditions are estimated from observations by ASPERA-3/IMA on Mars Express during several orbits. It is found that Mars probably passed through a solar wind that was disturbed by the comet during the flyby. The uncertainty derives from that the size of the disturbed solar wind region in the comet simulation is sensitive to the assumed upstream solar wind conditions, especially the solar wind proton density.",

To date, the mechanisms driving the growth of the plateau remain unknown, thus leaving the role of the Tibetan plateau in the collision largely debated. Using three-dimensional numerical models we investigate the controls of subduction dynamics on the deformation in the upper plate interiors and focus on the relation among thickening, shearing/faulting and lateral extrusion. The models illustrate the formation of lithospheric-scale shear zones as an effect of the breakoff of part of the oceanic slab from the continental lithosphere. The localized deformation pattern in the upper plate interiors profoundly controls the structural grain of the continent interiors, accommodating further deformation driven by far field forces. The emerging picture illustrates plateau-like thickening and shearing in front of the indenting down-going plate within a plate-scale extrusion tectonics, providing the frame to investigate the role of plateau formation in the wider tectonic context. The comparisons with various observables, such as strain axes and GPS motions, support the discussion on the possible processes at work, allowing inferences on the driving mechanisms of Tibetan plateau formation within the coupled plate margin-interiors tectonics. Our conclusions allow confuting some of the proposed models, supporting the view that the Tibetan plateau is best explained within the large-scale tectonic context.",

            "abstract": "Launched in 2005 by industrialized nations, the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) began building the Global Earth Observation System of Systems (GEOSS). Consisting of both a policy framework, and an information infrastructure, GEOSS, was intended to link and/or integrate the multitude of Earth observation systems, primarily operated by its Member Countries and Participating Organizations, so that users could more readily benefit from global information assets for a number of society’s key environmental issues. It was recognized that having ready access to observations from multiple systems was a prerequisite for both environmental decision-making, as well as economic development. From the very start, it was also recognized that the shear complexity of the Earth’s system cannot be captured by any single observation system, and that a federated, interoperable approach was necessary. While this international effort has met with much success, primarily in advancing broad, open data policies and practices, challenges remain.\nIn 2014 (Geneva, Switzerland) and 2015 (Mexico City, Mexico), Ministers from GEO’s Member Countries, including the European Commission, came together to assess progress made during the first decade (2005 to 2015), and approve implementation strategies and mechanisms for the second decade (2016 to 2025), respectively. The approved implementation strategies and mechanisms are intended to advance GEOSS development thereby facilitating the increased uptake of Earth observations for informed decision-making.\nClearly there are interoperability challenges that are technological in nature, and several will be discussed in this presentation. There are, however, interoperability challenges that can be better characterized as economic, governmental and/or political in nature, and these will be discussed as well.\nWith the emergence of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction (WCDRR), and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) having occurred this year, it will be essential that the interoperability challenges described herein, regardless of their nature, be expeditiously addressed so that Earth observations can indeed inform societal decision-making.",

            "abstract": "Understanding and improving the integrity of wellbores are crucial to prevent CO2 leakage during geologic CO2 sequestration (GCS). With advanced knowledge, cement deterioration caused by injected CO2 can be minimized. We have experimentally analyzed the chemical and mechanical property changes of Portland cement paste samples after 10 days of exposure to 0.5 M NaCl brine saturated with 100 bar CO2 at 95 oC. After exposure, the 3 mm thick cement samples had a total CO2-attacked depth of 1220 μm from both sides, including a 960 μm thick portlandite-depleted region next to the intact core, a 100 μm thick carbonated layer, and a 170 μm surface layer. The portlandite-depleted zone developed abundant micro-cracks and showed a decreased hardness. A hard carbonated layer which developed near the sample surface could not protect the cement due to formation of this portlandite-depleted zone, where abundant micro-cracks accounted for a 90% decrease in strength of the bulk sample.\nUsing the reactive transport code CrunchTope, we further investigated the mechanism of portlandite-depleted zone formation. The cement deterioration process was simulated with a 1-D continuum model that captured the dissolution of the portlandite and the formation of a calcite zone closer to the sample edge. Modeling results highlighted that the apparent bypass of CO2 through the carbonated layer is critical for the evolution of the portlandite-depleted zone, since otherwise the 1-D model predicts complete clogging of the porosity. Defects within the carbonated zone could be due to reaction-induced fractures or to the heterogeneity of the cement. We also incorporated nucleation kinetics for secondary calcite precipitation using previously obtained thermodynamic parameters. We found that the nucleation energy barrier does not suppress calcite formation and thus cannot explain the absence of calcite in the portlandite-depleted zone. The findings from our study help further our understanding of CO2 attack on wellbore cement during GCS, and improve our ability to predict cement seal integrity.",

As a university-governed consortium facilitating research and education in the geosciences, UNAVCO is well-situated to both prepare students for geoscience technical careers and advanced research positions. Since 1998, UNAVCO has offered over 165 student assistant or intern positions including engineering, data services, education and outreach, and business support. UNAVCO offers three formal programs: the UNAVCO Student Internship Program (USIP), Research Experiences in Solid Earth Science for Students (RESESS), and the Geo-Launchpad (GLP) internship program. Interns range from community college students up through graduate students and recent Masters graduates. USIP interns gain real-world work experience in a professional setting, collaborate with teams toward a common mission, and contribute their knowledge, skills, and abilities to the UNAVCO community. RESESS interns conduct authentic research with a scientist in the Front Range area as well as participate in a structured professional development series. GLP students are in their first 2 years of higher education and work alongside UNAVCO technical staff gaining valuable work experience and insight into the logistics of supporting scientific research.\nUNAVCO’s efforts in preparing the next generation of scientists largely focuses on increasing diversity in the geosciences, whether continuing academic studies or moving into the workforce. To date, well over half of our interns and student assistants come from backgrounds historically underrepresented in the geosciences. Over 80% of former interns continue to pursue careers or education in the geosciences. This presentation will highlight elements of the programs that can be easily replicated in other facilities as well as activities that may be incorporated into university-based experiences.",

            "abstract": "The ephemeral saline acidic lakes on the Yilgarn Craton of Western Australia have been suggested as geochemical analogues to martian terrains. Both are characterized by interbedded phyllosilicates and hydrated sulfates. On Mars, these areas indicate shifting environmental conditions, from the neutral/alkaline and wet conditions that dominated during the Noachian era to the more familiar dry, acidic conditions that began in the Hesperian. The habitability of such a dynamic environment can be informed by investigation of the Yilgarn Lake system. Previous work has found phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) evidence of microbial communities in sections of sediment cores taken from Lake Gilmore. These communities include both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, Actinomycetes, and even methanotrophs. Given recurring detection of methane on the martian surface, evidence of a methane cycling community in an analogous environment is of particular interest.\nIn this study we analyze the carbon isotope composition of bulk organic material as well as extracted lipids from the Lake Gilmore sediment cores at both a near-shore and mid-lake location. These analyses reveal very low accumulations of organic carbon, concentrated primarily in the gypsum-rich near-shore core. The near-shore sediments show a down-core decrease in abundance of organic carbon as well as depletion in the carbon isotope composition (δ13C) with depth. Bulk carbon did not exhibit the unique, highly depleted, diagnostic signature associated with methanotrophic biomass. Compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) of carbon in extracted methanotroph PFLAs can confirm the presence of a methane cycling metabolism at depth. Also, additional extractions have isolated lipids associated with lake-edge grasses. These analyses consider both the chain-length distribution and carbon CSIA of these lipids in order to understand the effect of terrestrial detritus on any preserved methanotroph carbon signal, given the very low amounts of microbial biomass found in lake cores. While the mineralogy does not suggest anaerobic conditions, further investigation includes extraction of archaeal lipids in order to identify the presence of any methanogenic community associated with the putative methanotrophic community.",

            "abstract": "Over the last five years, Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry has dramatically democratized the availability of high quality topographic data. This approach involves the use of a non-linear bundle adjustment to estimate simultaneously camera position, pose, distortion and 3D model coordinates. In contrast to traditional aerial photogrammetry, the bundle adjustment is typically solved without external constraints and instead ground control is used a posteriori to transform the modelled coordinates to an established datum using a similarity transformation. The limited data requirements, coupled with the ability to self-calibrate compact cameras, has led to a burgeoning of applications using low-cost imagery acquired terrestrially or from low-altitude platforms.\nTo date, most applications have focused on relatively small spatial scales where relaxed logistics permit the use of dense ground control and high resolution, close-range photography. It is less clear whether this low-cost approach can be successfully upscaled to tackle larger, watershed-scale projects extending over 102-3 km2 where it could offer a competitive alternative to landscape modelling with airborne lidar. At such scales, compromises over the density of ground control, the speed and height of sensor platform and related image properties are inevitable. In this presentation we provide a systematic assessment of large-scale SfM terrain products derived for over 80 km2 of the braided Dart River and its catchment in the Southern Alps of NZ. ",

We demonstrate how a low cost multi-camera platform providing both nadir and oblique imagery can support robust camera calibration, enabling the generation of high quality, large-scale terrain products that are suitable for precision fluvial change detection.",

            "abstract": "The fate, transport and depositional rate of fine grained sediments are known to depend on floc size, hydrodynamic stress, cohesive sediment types and organic matter. In recent laboratory studies, it was determined that flocculated sediments will readily disaggregate at moderate Reynolds numbers and degrade further as the hydrodynamic stresses increase. This was the case for pure clays of montmorillonite, kaolinite and illite with biopolymers that had varied net charges of net neutral, anionic and cationic. In these initial studies, flocculated sediments were found to rapidly disaggregate under high shear stresses from large aggregates of 500 to 2000 microns to approximately three to four times the median grain size of the primary particles or 30 to 40 microns. More recently, laboratory and natural flocs were analyzed to determine if particle disaggregation was reversible and if particles would increase in size as the stress state was reduced. The montmorillonite rich samples were found to begin to reaggregate within 20 minutes of a reduction in shear stress and these flocs approached that of the original floc sizes. On the other hand, kaolinite rich samples displayed a slower rate of reaggregation and a significant delay in reaggregation after the reduction of shear stress. results indicate that clay mineralogy plays a large role in flocculation, and specifically dissaggregation and reaggregation rates at varied hydrodynamic conditions that regularly occur within estuarine and nearshore environments.",

            "abstract": "The Himalaya Frontal Thrust (HFT) is the longest active contractional structure on Earth. Understanding the activity of HFT and its surrounding area is a key for both unraveling the mechanism of Himalayan growth and preparing the major earthquake disasters. The latter issue became much more important after the April 25th 2015 Nepal earthquake (also known as the Gorkha earthquake), which killed more than 8,800 people and injured more than 23,000. This earthquake is a dramatic manifestation of the ongoing convergence between the Indo-Australian and Asian tectonic plates that has progressively built the Himalayas over the last 50 million years. Despite its importance, only a few preliminary studies have focused on the frontal part of the western Himalaya. The Himalaya and adjoining Ganga (also called Gangetic) plain in Uttarakhand state of India are traversed by a number of neotectonically active longitudinal and transverse faults. However, the pattern and extent of present day surface deformations caused by these faults is not yet well known. We herein present the preliminary results of our investigation directed in this direction. Surface deformations induced by active faults during a period of seven years from 2003 to 2010 in the south western Himalaya and adjoining proximal part of the Ganga Plain in Uttarakhand state of India have been firstly monitored. Multidate ENVISAT radar images of the area have been analyzed by applying the latest radar remote sensing technique of Persistent Scatterers Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PSI). Since PSI can extracts surface information even on vegetated or mountainous regions as well. The study reveals some conspicuous surface deformation patterns, which may be related directly to the active movements along some of the major fault /thrust in the area. For example the HFT and the transverse Garampani-Kathgodam Fault (G-KF). A campaign GPS network of 20 stations has also been installed in 2013 in our study area. This network also provided us important ground data to proof and adjust our PSI measurement and can help us better understanding the present deformation behavior of this area.",

            "abstract": "Mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) can be separated into convective and stratiform regions, with each region being associated with characteristic microphysical processes. As such, latent heating that occurs within convective and stratiform regions also has distinct vertical profiles. The latent heating in MCSs plays an important role in the (1) redistribution of energy and moisture from near the Earth’s surface to the upper atmosphere, (2) generation of buoyancy forcing for updrafts and downdrafts, and (3) creation of pressure waves that can propagate away from the MCS and alter the surrounding environment.\nDuring the various stages of an MCS’s lifecycle, the latent heating vertical profiles within the convective and stratiform regions can change. To provide details on these dynamic latent heating profiles, results from two MCS simulations will be presented. Three-dimensional, cloud-resolving model simulations are performed using the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) to represent two MCS events from the Midlatitude Continental Convective Cloud Experiment (MC3E), which occurred in Spring 2011 in the Southern Great Plains of the United States. Comparisons of simulations against observations demonstrate that both simulations capture many features of the observed MC3E MCS events very well, such as precipitation, cold pool strength, and MCS cloud structure.\nPrecipitation regions within these simulations are broken up into convective and stratiform regions using a convective-stratiform separation algorithm. Region-specific latent heating vertical profiles are assessed both as averages over the simulation and as a function of time. In the middle and upper troposphere, convective region warming from latent heating decreases in magnitude throughout the MCS lifecycle, while stratiform warming increases in magnitude in a more confined region between 4 and 8 kilometers above the surface. In the lower troposphere, cooling from latent heating is dominant in both convective and stratiform regions, and the elevation of peak cooling increases with time. Such trends will be explained through the evolution of simulated microphysical processes.",

            "abstract": "Previous Os isotopic investigations of lavas from the Ontong Java Plateau1 observed that geographically widely dispersed samples of differing chemistries preserved an isochron of 123±8 Ma with an initial 187Os/188Os = 0.1289±0.0095. Samples from the Manihiki Plateau, itself a portion of the greater Ontong Java Nui (OJN) magmatic event, preserve a far greater range in Os isotopic signatures than previously reported for the OJP alone.\nIn contrast to the OJP data which points towards a near-chondritic, primitive mantle source for both Kroenke and Kwambaita lavas, the low Ti Manihiki samples preserve 187Os/188Os(i) ranging from 0.1056-0.1714. High Ti Manihiki samples preserve 187Os/188Os(i) = 0.1094-0.1288. Such strongly subchondritic signatures require some component of recycled material in the mantle source, possibly SCLM (TRD low Ti samples ~3.1Ga; and ~2.3-2.6Ga for the high Ti samples). Higher initial Os isotope ratios could indicate the presence of metasomatised lithosphere and/or lower crust.\nThe low Ti samples from Manihiki have been interpreted as the result of a two stage melting process, analogous to boninites2, the depleted source of which has itself been metasomatised by a HIMU component entrained within the plume head.\nCollectively the Ontong Java and Manihiki samples could conceivably contain mantle sourced from both an undifferentiated, near-chondritic source, as well as ancient, unradiogenic recycled sources. Thus the greater OJN province samples a heterogeneous source containing both primitive and recycled components. It is probable that greater degress of partial melting beneath Ontong Java homogenised these heterogeneities, whereas more complex, multi stage melting processes near the plume margin at Manihiki allowed sampling of the inherent heterogeneities within the plume head.\n 1: Parkinson et al., 2002, GCA 66(15A) A580.\n2: Golowin et al., in prep.",

            "abstract": "Extensive deforestation of tropical rainforest often leads to agricultural abandonment and secondary forest regeneration. The land area of secondary rainforest is soon likely to exceed that of primary forest, highlighting the importance of secondary tropical rainforest in the global carbon (C) cycle. Secondary forests often grow rapidly, but the role soil nutrients play in regulating secondary forest productivity remains unsettled. Consistent with biogeochemical theory, a landmark study from a set of sites in the Amazon Basin showed that secondary forests had low nitrogen (N) availability and relatively higher phosphorus (P) availability immediately after abandonment, but that as succession proceeded, N availability “recuperated” and there was relatively less P available. To address whether such changes in N and P availability during secondary forest growth are common, we reviewed 38 studies in lowland tropical rainforest that reported changes in 23 different metrics of N and P cycling during secondary succession. We calculated slopes (rates of change) during secondary succession for each metric in each study, and analyzed patterns in these rates of change. Significant trends during secondary succession were more evident in soils than in plants, but in most cases, the variability among studies was surprisingly low. Both soil N and P availability increased through succession, at least in surface soil. Such consistent changes imply substantial biogeochemical resilience of tropical forest soils in spite of differing land use histories and species compositions among studies. In most cases, slopes were similar whether primary forest was included in, or excluded from, our analysis, suggesting that secondary succession eventually leads to similar biogeochemical conditions as those found in primary forest. Our results suggesting consistent changes in N and P availability during succession provide a biogeochemical rationale for the conservation and restoration value of tropical secondary forests, and may be of utility to coupled C-nutrient models projecting primary productivity in a dynamic tropical biome.",

Following reaction in the chamber, droplets and particles were sampled with a Particle-Into-Liquid-Sampler (PILS), a capillary waveguide cell for UV/visible spectroscopy, and a total organic carbon analyzer (TOC). Particle size distributions were measured with a scanning mobility particle sizer and used to determine the mass absorption coefficient (a normalized absorbance measurement). Absorption spectra were recorded while aerosol or gas phase aqBrC precursors were introduced into the humid chamber. Sampling was continuous during and after cloud events. The events lasted 5-10 minutes and produced measurable brown carbon signal at 365 nm. When lights were used, absorbance at 365 nm decreased steadily indicating photobleaching of aqBrC products or preferential formation of different, non-absorbing products. Although absorptivity increases prior to cloud formation, cloud events produce sharp increased in aqBrC absorptivity. While measurable absorbance at 365 nm indicates aqBrC formation, very little absorbance was recorded beyond 450 nm indicating that the products were not as oligomerized as products observed in prior work in multi-day, bulk phase simulations.",

However, only a few programs for estimation of the ETAS parameters are publicly available, and it is difficult to automatically apply some of them to observed data due to initial value dependence (e.g. Ogata, 2006). A robust ETAS estimation program is required to meet the recent enhancement of earthquake catalogs. In this study, we developed a new program, etas_solve, that is based on Newton’s method and calculates exact gradient and Hessian by using the automatic differentiation technique (Griewank, 1989). The program also supports auxiliary window in time and magnitude (Wang et al., 2010).\nTo demonstrate robustness of the developed program, we tested the dependence of estimated parameters on the choice of initial value by running the program from 1,024 randomly chosen initial values, and then compared the results with that of SAPP (Ogata 2006). We used aftershock data of 26th July 2003 earthquake of M6.2 at the northern Miyagi japan, which is shipped with SAPP, as a testing data. We found that estimation values with etas_solve were independent of the initial value for the testing data, while that with SAPP were varied with the initial value. Although there was initial value dependence in the SAPP's results, the estimated values by SAPP with small (≤10-5) gradient coincided with the solution by etas_solve. etas_solve took longer computation time per iteration than SAPP due to the exact Hessian calculation, but total execution time was comparable to that of SAPP since less number of iterations for convergence was required. In addition, etas_solve was faster than SAPP on multicore machines (around 8-fold speed up with a 16 core machine) since etas_solve is parallelized by OpenMP.\netas_solve is written in Fortran and distributed under GNU General Public License at https://github.com/kshramt/fortran_lib and https://bitbucket.org/kshramt/fortran_lib.",

            "abstract": "The Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project (AgMIP) has been working since 2010 to construct a protocol-based framework enabling regional assessments (led by regional experts and modelers) that can provide consistent inputs to global economic and integrated assessment models. These global models can then relay important global-level information that drive regional decision-making and outcomes throughout an interconnected agricultural system. AgMIP’s community of nearly 800 climate, crop, livestock, economics, and IT experts has improved the state-of-the-art through model intercomparisons, validation exercises, regional integrated assessments, and the launch of AgMIP programs on all six arable continents. AgMIP is now launching Coordinated Global and Regional Assessments (CGRA) of climate change impacts on agriculture and food security to link global and regional crop and economic models using a protocol-based framework. The CGRA protocols are being developed to utilize historical observations, climate projections, and RCPs/SSPs from CMIP5 (and potentially CMIP6), and will examine stakeholder-driven agricultural development and adaptation scenarios to provide cutting-edge assessments of climate change’s impact on agriculture and food security. These protocols will build on the foundation of established protocols from AgMIP’s 30+ activities, and will emphasize the use of multiple models, scenarios, and scales to enable an accurate assessment of related uncertainties. The CGRA is also designed to provide the outputs necessary to feed into integrated assessment models (IAMs), nutrition and food security assessments, nitrogen and carbon cycle models, and additional impact-sector assessments (e.g., water resources, land-use, biomes, urban areas).\nThis presentation will describe the current status of CGRA planning and initial prototype experiments to demonstrate key aspects of the protocols before wider implementation ahead of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report.",

            "abstract": "Mixed-phase clouds are ubiquitous in all regions of Earth, yet are poorly constrained due to difficulty in obtaining observations of these clouds. Many models underestimate the supercooled liquid proportion of mixed-phase clouds, which biases estimates of the Earth’s radiation budget due to the contrasting optical properties of liquid droplets and ice crystals. Using global satellite observations obtained by NASA’s CALIOP instrument, mixed-phase clouds simulated by NCAR’s global climate model, CESM, are constrained by tuning various microphysical parameters relevant to mixed-phase clouds processes in its atmospheric model component, CAM5. The equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates of the satellite-constrained simulations range from 5 to 5.3 degrees Celsius, which is up to 1.3 degrees Celsius greater than the standard simulation and 2.1 degrees Celsius greater than the CMIP archive ensemble mean. The higher equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates are linked to a weakened negative cloud phase feedback that depends on the supercooled liquid proportion of its mixed-phase clouds in the initial state. Climate models that underestimate the supercooled liquid proportion in the initial state are shown to exhibit an unrealistically strongly negative cloud phase feedback that counteracts warming that would otherwise occur.",

Newly developed, commercially available open-source sensors have been designed to accurately measure PM 2.5 at a cost that is a fraction of the commercially available DustTrak device used in previous work. Our team conducted multiple follow-up sampling events, measuring PM 2.5 using co-located AirBeam and DustTrak devices at BART stations. Overall, our research indicates that PM 2.5 concentrations at Embarcadero have not declined since previous sampling efforts were undertaken in 2013. Also, the low cost AirBeam sensors were found to be less effective at measuring elevated PM 2.5 concentrations such as those found in the Embarcadero BART station. However, the AirBeam devices were effective at quickly identifying areas with elevated PM 2.5. Our research also indicates a decrease in concentration of PM 2.5 as one moves west along the station platform away from the East Bay Tube that connects San Francisco to the East San Francisco Bay Area. We speculate that the East Bay Tube is a reservoir of hazardous fine-grained particulate matter, which poses a significant human health risk, particularly in emergency evacuations or for workers with chronic exposure. The research has been used to refine a conceptual site model of the source for airborne particles found at the Embarcadero Station and suggests that primary source control via high-pressure-washing of the East Bay Tube may be an economical and rapid remedy prior to improved ventilation and engineering controls.",

            "abstract": "Biogeochemical processes reflecting interaction of vegetation and hydrology govern long-term export of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon over successional time scales. While management concepts of watershed “recovery” from disturbance back towards pre-disturbance conditions are often considered over much shorter timescales, few studies have directly explored watershed biogeochemical responses to disturbance long enough to directly document the longer-term trajectory of responses to severe land disturbance on nitrogen export.\nThe objectives of this study were to document both the initial magnitude and patterns of longer-term recovery of stream nitrogen after the 2003 Lost Creek wildfire over nine years in front ranges of the Rocky Mountains in south-west Alberta, Canada. The study was conducted in seven instrumented catchments (4-14 km2), including burned, burned and salvage logged, and unburned (reference) conditions since 2004.\nTotal nitrogen (TN) and nitrate (NO3-) concentrations and area-normalized yields were greater and more variable in burned and post-fire salvage logged catchments when compared with unburned catchments. Large initial increases in stream TN and NO3- production 1-3 years after both wildfire and post-fire salvage logging declined strongly to levels similar to, or below that of unburned watersheds 4-6 years after the fire, and continued to decline (although more slowly) 7-9 years after the wildfire. Post-fire salvage logging produced lower impacts on TN and NO3- in streams and these effects declined even more rapidly compared to the effects of wildfire alone. These changes closely corresponded to the early trajectory of establishment and rapid juvenile growth of post-fire regenerating forest vegetation in both catchment groups.\nWhile the concept of hydrologic recovery from disturbance is both a practical and meaningful concept for integrated landscape management for protection of forest water resources, the benchmark for “recovery” based on present conditions in undisturbed forests may vary widely depending on forest age and successional status.",

PDCs can traverse tens to hundreds of kilometers and surmount ridges 100s of m tall, yet the effects of complex topography on PDC liftoff and runout distance are uncertain. Here we used scaled laboratory experiments to explore how barriers affect dilute density current dynamics and the occurrence of liftoff. We created dilute density currents by heating and suspending 20 μm diameter talc in air in an 8.5 x 6.1 x 2.6 m tank. We scaled the currents with respect to Froude, densimetric and thermal Richardson, particle Stokes and Settling numbers such that they were dynamically similar to natural PDCs. While currents were fully turbulent, their Reynolds numbers were not as high as those for natural PDCs. We performed the first set of experiments in a laterally unconfined volume, used laser sheets to illuminate the currents, measured bulk sedimentation rates down the current centerlines, and positioned four to twenty-four cm tall ridge-like barriers in the path of the currents. We found that relatively small barriers (~ half the current height) caused PDC liftoff. By comparison, conservation of kinetic and potential energy predicts that incompressible density currents are able to surmount barriers twice their height. Furthermore, we observed increased sedimentation immediately upstream of barriers and conclude that small barriers initiated buoyancy reversal through a combination of increased air entrainment and sedimentation. We conducted a second set of experiments with the same thermal scaling and mass flux rates but where the currents were laterally confined within a 0.6 m wide channel. We found that small barriers also triggered liftoff of confined currents, but that the body of these currents reattached after liftoff. Those results suggest that lateral confinement inhibits buoyancy reversal by limiting the surface area of the current-air interface and air entrainment. Real dilute PDCs that originate in confined valleys may therefore have different fates and longer runout distances than those on unconfined planes.",

New datasets from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter enable further analysis of this crater through measurements of surface and near-subsurface rock populations at a variety of spatial scales and wavelengths. We used Diviner, Mini-RF, and LROC datasets to analyze the block population and distribution around Tsiolkovskiy crater. We found that Tsiolkovskiy has an external deposit where (1) Diviner rock abundance was anomalously high, similar to Copernican aged craters, (2) Diviner estimates of rock-free regolith thickness were anomalously low, consistent with <1.5 Ga of regolith gardening, (3) Mini-RF CPR indicated well preserved massive impact melt, which is rough at the decimeter scale, and (4) LROC imagery provided clear examples of surface block population morphology similar to the crater interior. Furthermore, we used LROC imagery to perform a new calculation of modeled crater age consistent with an ancient origin at least 3.2 Ga. Together these data showed that Tsiolkovskiy has a unique massive impact melt and blocky ejecta deposit for a crater of its size and age and may be the youngest crater capable of producing this type and scale of deposit. To reconcile the anomalously blocky appearance of Tsiolkovskiy with its age, we propose mechanisms that support a higher surface rock production rate. The most likely scenario requires (1) Tsiolkovkiy’s impactor and target properties and/or impact geometry to produce a massive impact melt deposit with sufficiently large blocks, and (2) the recent disruption of surface fines exposing original blocks from local, regional, and/or antipodal impacts. The source of this disruption is unknown, but Tsiolkovskiy crater is located antipodal to the Copernican-aged Aristarchus crater. Future modeling of the seismic effects of this impact may help to determine whether this was a likely source for the recent surface modification at Tsiolkovskiy crater.",

For example, the averaged wind speed is crucial information for a site selection of an offshore wind farm. It has widely been recognized that a total amount of the offshore wind generation is strongly depended on the annual average wind speeds. A advanced scatterometer (ASCAT), which is a kind of scatterometer aboard METOP-A and B, has observed sea surface wind speeds at the height of 10 m above the sea surface approximately twice a day using active microwaves. The annual average wind speed can be calculated from the observed wind speed. For an actual use of the annual average wind speed, generalities and representativeness of the wind speed must be clarified.\nTo investigate annual variations in sea surface wind speed around Japan (120°E to 165°E, 19°N to 49°N), the annual average wind speeds and these standard deviations are calculated from 5 years of ASCAT observations from 2010 through 2014.\nIt is found that there are some sea areas where standard deviations are relatively higher than their surroundings. Annual average wind speed maps indicate that the high standard deviation is caused by strong winds from Eurasia in the winter of 2011 in part of North Pacific Ocean and Sea of Okhotsk. Additionally standard deviations for only winter are also higher than for summer in those sea areas. Therefore the strong wind speed in the winter of a particular year can easily affect to the annual average wind speed. Meanwhile off the coast of Niigata and Hokkaido, there are also higher standard deviation areas than their surroundings. Differences between monthly maximum wind speeds for the winter and minimum wind speeds for the summer in these areas are larger and the large differences seem to be a cause of the high standard deviations.",

Previous studies also have shown that the Microtremor Survey Method is effective to map the shallow crustal structure. In order to obtain the shallow crustal velocity structure beneath the Wudalianchi Weishan volcano area, an array of 29 new no-cable digital geophones were deployed for three days at the test site (3km×3km) for recording continuously seismic noise. Weishan volcano is located in the far north of Wudalianchi Volcanoes, the volcanic cone is composed of basaltic lava and the volcano area covered by a quaternary sediments layer (gray and black loam, brown and yellow loam, sandy loam). Accurate shallow crustal structure, particularly sedimentary structure model can improve the accuracy of location of volcanic earthquakes and structural imaging.\nWe use ESPAC method, which is one of Microtremor Survey Methods, to calculate surface wave phase velocity dispersion curves between station pairs. A generalized 2-D linear inversion code that is named Surface Wave Tomography (SWT) is adopted to invert phase velocity tomographic maps in 2–5 Hz periods band. On the basis of a series of numerical tests, the study region is parameterized with a grid spacing of 0.1km×0.1km, all damping parameters and regularization are set properly to ensure relatively smooth results and small data misfits as well. We constructed a 3D Shallow Crustal S-wave Velocity model in the area by inverting the phase velocity dispersion curves at each node adopting an iterative linearized least-square inversion scheme of surf96. The tomography model is useful in interpreting volcanic features.",

            "abstract": "Previous studies have found correlations between glacial cycles and volcanism. Any such feedback mechanisms could have important implications for climate through variations in volcanic outgassing. Although decompression melting has been established as a cause for increased volcanism during deglaciation at mid-ocean ridge systems (Jull and McKenzie, 1996), it has not been determined how changes in glacial loading affect other settings such as volcanic arcs. We examine the Mount Mazama volcanic system, Oregon, where pulses of volcanism have been suggested to follow major deglaciations (Bacon et al. 2006). A statistical test regarding the timing of eruptions is first developed, and its application to eruption dates demonstrates statistically significant clustering of eruptions following deglaciation. To explore potential causes for the identified changes in probability of eruptions, the effects of glacial unloading on melt production are computed using a 1D mantle melting model, and the effect of ice unloading on shallow crustal stress conditions is tested with a viscoelastic stress model. Combining these effects into a simple eruption model, we propose that variations in melt supply rates from the mantle and changing stress conditions around a shallow crustal magma reservoir modulate eruption probability during glacial cycles. This model illustrates the physical plausibility of glacial variability causing the identified changes in eruption rates at Mt Mazama.",

            "abstract": "Cenozoic clastic deposits in western Argentina provide key opportunities to evaluate the timing and duration of Andean deformation and uplift. We studied the Malargüe segment of the Andean foreland basin at 35°S to better understand latest Cretaceous to Pliocene deformation and eastward propagation of Andean retroarc shortening. Our multi-technique approach included logging of a well-exposed ~1500m Paleocene–Miocene stratigraphic succession, paleocurrent measurements, conglomerate clast counts, and detrital zircon U-Pb geochronological analyses of basin fill exposed in the Sosneado region along the Rio Atuel. The Pircala and Coihueco Formations define the lowermost ~180 m of the section and are represented by fine to medium sandstones, siltstones, claystones and marls interpreted as distal fluvial floodplain and localized lacustrine deposits. Pircala paleocurrents show a major reversal from west- to east-directed flow. These finer deposits of the lower succession are separated from the overlying coarser-grained ~800 m thick Agua de la Piedra Formation by a conspicuous unconformity that spans up to roughly 20 Myr. The Agua de la Piedra Formation is composed of upward-coarsening amalgamated beds of massive medium to coarse sandstones and lenticular conglomerates interpreted as a prograding proximal fluvial to alluvial fan system. Conglomerate clast counts show initial dominance by Mesozoic detritus from the pre-Andean Neuquen basin system, with a progressive upsection increase in Cenozoic volcanic detritus from the Andean magmatic arc. Collectively, the paleocurrents, clast compositions, sedimentary facies associations, and emerging U-Pb results suggest a long-term shift, commencing in the Paleocene, from eastern cratonic sources to magmatic-arc and thrust-belt sources during a systematic eastward propagation of deformation, with a pronounced phase of Miocene magmatism and shortening that incorporated the proximal foreland basin into the advancing thrust belt.",

            "abstract": "Biodiversity loss, one of the most crucial challenges of our time, endangers ecosystem services that maintain human wellbeing. Traditional methods of measuring biodiversity require extensive and costly field sampling by biologists with extensive experience in species identification. Remote sensing can be used for such assessment based upon patterns of optical variation. This provides efficient and cost-effective means to determine ecosystem diversity at different scales and over large areas.\nSampling scale has been described as a “fundamental conceptual problem” in ecology, and is an important practical consideration in both remote sensing and traditional biodiversity studies. On the one hand, with decreasing spatial and spectral resolution, the differences among different optical types may become weak or even disappear. Alternately, high spatial and/or spectral resolution may introduce redundant or contradictory information. For example, at high resolution, the variation within optical types (e.g., between leaves on a single plant canopy) may add complexity unrelated to specie richness.\nWe studied the scale-dependence of optical diversity in a prairie ecosystem at Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, Minnesota, USA using a variety of spectrometers from several platforms on the ground and in the air. Using the coefficient of variation (CV) of spectra as an indicator of optical diversity, we found that high richness plots generally have a higher coefficient of variation. High resolution imaging spectrometer data (1 mm pixels) showed the highest sensitivity to richness level. With decreasing spatial resolution, the difference in CV between richness levels decreased, but remained significant. These findings can be used to guide airborne studies of biodiversity and develop more effective large-scale biodiversity sampling methods.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU_2015_Jiangjiang_Zhang.pdf\nThere are increasing interests in applying surrogates for inverse Bayesian modeling to reduce repetitive evaluations of original model. In this way, the computational cost is expected to be saved. However, the approximation error of surrogate model is usually overlooked. This is partly because that it is difficult to evaluate the approximation error for many surrogates. Previous studies have shown that, the direct combination of surrogates and Bayesian methods (e.g., Markov Chain Monte Carlo, MCMC) may lead to biased estimations when the surrogate cannot emulate the highly nonlinear original system. This problem can be alleviated by implementing MCMC in a two-stage manner. However, the computational cost is still high since a relatively large number of original model simulations are required. In this study, we illustrate the importance of incorporating approximation error in inverse Bayesian modeling. Gaussian process (GP) is chosen to construct the surrogate for its convenience in approximation error evaluation. Numerical cases of Bayesian experimental design and parameter estimation for contaminant source identification are used to illustrate this idea. It is shown that, once the surrogate approximation error is well incorporated into Bayesian framework, promising results can be obtained even when the surrogate is directly used, and no further original model simulations are required.",

            "abstract": "Knowledge of columnar aerosol particles at nighttime is essential to completely understand aerosol dynamics and so will largely improve aerosol models. However, the current knowledge columnar nighttime aerosol is poor due to the lack of continuous measurements partly associated with previous technological limitations. Here we present the development, set up, calibration and data quality algorithms for the star photometer at the station of Granada (37.16 N, 3.60 W, 680 m a.s.l.) in Spain. The main advantage of this instrument is that make uses of a CCD camera as detector allowing direct star flux measurements. Filters center at 380, 440, 500, 670, 880 and 1020 nm allows spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements. Among all the stars, only those that are isolated and possess constant extratarrestial flux are considered.\nTwo methods for the calibration of the system at high mountain places are presented. The first one consists of doing a Langley calibration of a selected star together with measurements of other stars. From the Langley calibration, we transferred AOD and get the calibration constants for other stars. The second method is the Astronomical Langley Method that consists of dividing the measurements by the optical air mass and so more stable calibration constant are obtained. On the other hand, the atmospheric turbulence is important for very short exposure times (< 1 s) and so uncertainties in AOD are of ±0.02 for λ < 800nm and ±0.01 for λ > 800nm.\n The instrument operated continuously for more than four consecutive years and so a large database was created. Cloud screening and data quality algorithms following AERONET inheritance were developed. Basically, moving averages are applied with different temporal-windows combined with a procedure to detect outliers. On the other hand, with quality data guaranteed the analysis of day-to-night columnar aerosol properties is presented. Mean AOD(440 nm) (0.18 ± 0.10 and 0.19 ± 0.11 for daytime and nighttime) and Angstrom exponents (1.0 ± 0.4 and 0.9 ± 0.4 for day and night respectively) are similar, but the study of the spectral dependence of the Angstrom exponent reveals that at nighttime the contributions of the fine mode and the fine mode radius are larger than during daytime, which has been explained by changes in the atmosphere dynamics and by aerosol aging.",

            "abstract": "The Nili Fossae region is the site of a number of proposed Landing Sites for the Mars 2020 Rover. A distinguishing feature of many of these sites is the access to large exposures of carbonate (Ehlmann et al. 2008). Serpentinization has been proposed as a formation mechanism of these carbonates, including carbonated (Brown et al. 2010, Viviano, et al. 2013) and low temperature, near surface serpentinization.\nThe potential for carbonated serpentization at Nili Fossae links the region to Earth analogs in terrestrial greenstone belts such as the Pilbara in Western Australia, where talc-carbonate bearing komatiite cumulate units of the Dresser Formation overlie the siliceous, stromatolite-bearing Strelley Pool Chert unit (Van Kranendonk and Pirajno, 2004). If a similar relationship exists on Mars, investigations of rocks stratigraphically beneath the carbonate-bearing units at Nili Fossae (\"the basement rocks\") may provide the best chance to examine well preserved organic material from the Noachian. This hypothesis is testable by Mars 2020.\nIn preparation for the the Mars 2020 landing site, we are examining the thermodynamic relationships that favor formation of serpentine and talc-carbonate and different pressures and temperatures in the crust (Barnes 2007). This will allow us to constrain the low grade metamorphism required to replicate the proposed models of serpentinisation and help us understand the regional metamophic gradient that is critical to furthering our knowledge of the ancient rocks of Nili Fossae.\nRefs:\nBarnes, S.

The discovery was carried out based on the systematic survey method of geological technique and a developed acoustic device using AUV. The knoll caldera 12 km east of Aogashima volcanic island is the size 10 km to 9 km of its rim and 820 m deep at its deepest caldera floor. According to the results of heavy mineral analysis for caldera sediments by a gravity corer, at least two areas were inferred to sites of potential hydrothermal activity associated with seafloor massive sulfides. After the precise acoustic survey using AUV there are many mound-like structures in the both inferred areas on the floor. Two major hydrothermal fields among them so far, which are a conical sulfide mound on the southeast flank of the central cone and a ridge-like mound on the inferred caldera boundary fault in the southeast, were confirmed based on sulfide samples recovered by a gravity corer during the next survey stage. One of them occurs at the water depth of 760 m to 770 m. It has active sulfide chimneys (ca. 20 m high) on the conical sulfide mound of about 40 m in diameter with 20 m high. Samples from the mound are composed of major sphalerite with moderate galena and barite, and minor chalcopyrite and pyrite. Another mound associated with chimneys at the water depth ranging from 740m to 770m on the southeast caldera boundary fault forms a small, east-west trend ridge-like shape. The ridge sizes more than 100 m long with 10 m wide. Chimneys are more than 30 m high. It is inferred that the mound is composed of major sphalerite and moderate barite based on samples cored at the margin of the mound. These results indicate that more than several sulfide mounds would be confirmed in the caldera floor by ROV surveys this September.",

            "abstract": "To predict future changes in atmospheric blocks and the resulting weather extremes, some studies have proposed the negative phase of Arctic Oscillation (AO), an internal mode of climate variability, as an analogue for Arctic Amplification because of similarities between their atmospheric mean-states anomalies: reduction in midlatitude-to-pole temperature gradient and weakening and equatorward-shift of midlatitude jets. Observations show an increase and poleward-shift in blocking activity in the negative phase of AO; hence, this analogy suggests increased blocking activity under Arctic Amplification.\nUsing well-controlled experiments with an idealized GCM, we show that blocking activity variations associated with mean-state anomalies are opposite depending on whether these anomalies are driven by the internal atmospheric dynamics as in AO, or forced externally as under Arctic Amplification. We find that blocking activity increases and its latitudinal-distribution shifts poleward in the negative phase of AO (consistent with observation), but decreases and shifts equatorward when the high-latitudes are forced to warm (as shown previously in Hassanzadeh et al. 2014 GRL), and even when a mean-state anomaly almost identical to that of the negative phase of AO is externally forced. The latter is achieved using the linear response function of the idealized model.\nWe conclude that the observed blocking-AO relationship is a correlation which does not imply that the negative phase of AO mean-state causes increased blocking, and should not be used as a prototype for Arctic Amplification. To understand the contrasting variations of blocking activity with the negative phase of AO and under Arctic Amplification, we further investigate the synoptic eddies, which are known to play critical roles in the dynamics of both AO and blocking.\nMoreover, given that the atmospheric mean responses to external forcings other than Arctic Amplification also project onto Arctic/Antarctic-Oscillation, these results show that a careful consideration of causality is required before using internal variability as analogues to predict response to external forcings.",

            "abstract": "The impacts of climate and socioeconomic change in the future are important factors to consider when discussing the issues of sustainable development in the Pacific Islands, since their impacts here are relatively large compared to those in other regions due to the severe limitation of internal resources and the external dependency of the life essentials. The tourism industry is the key driving force behind the economic growth in island region and it is promoted by the environmental attractions. This study constructs scenarios that foresees the effects of these changes and assesses the subsequent impact on both the local community and the tourism industry.\nIn this study, the scenarios have been developed based on the representative concentration pathways (RCPs) and the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The progress of climate change was expected to affect the attraction of tourists as well as resources availability and food production. The difference of SSPs was expected to affect the quality of life in the local society and the quantity and/or the quality of tourism. A downscale and bias-correction using a local dataset was applied to assess the impacts of climate change, and the relationships between GDP, population, and estimated land availability in the current situation were applied to assess the impact of socioeconomic change.\nAs case studies, the scenarios were constructed to assess the impacts in the Republic of Palau and Ishigaki Island, Japan. Both are typical islands where tourism is the main industry. The situation of environmental resources, local society, and tourism under changing climate and socioeconomic conditions was assessed using these scenarios. The creation of reasonable projections under appropriate scenarios can contribute to sustainable development not only in these islands but also in most Pacific Islands.",

            "abstract": "In the modern climate of the Bahamas, a latitudinal precipitation gradient only allows Pine (Pinus caribaea var. bahamensis) dominated forests to exist on the more mesic (humid) northern islands (Abaco, Andros, New Providence, Grand Bahamas). Previous research suggests that the northern Bahamas underwent dramatic environmental changes in the late Holocene (e.g., waves of human arrival, shifts in terrestrial vegetation and animal extinctions). However, disentangling the timing and relative forcing (climatic vs. anthropogenic) of these changes has proven challenging without high-resolution terrestrial climate records. Recently, a late Holocene decadal to multi-decadal laminated sedimentary record was recovered from Blackwood Sinkhole, on Abaco Island. The bottom of the sinkhole is characterized by anoxic, saline groundwater, while the upper, brackish meteoric lens provides a habitat to fish, algae and other organisms. Here, we present δ13Corg and δ15Norg values of bulk organic matter (OM) taken every cm of the 110 cm core to help elucidate changes in the chemical composition of the source of OM reaching the anoxic sediments of the sinkhole. δ13Corg values change at 812 Cal yrs BP (2s: 931-681 Cal yrs BP, 31.7 cm depth) from −30.5 ± 1.6‰ in the lower 80 cm of the core to −27.6 ± 1.2‰ in the upper 30 cm. There is a synchronous change from more enriched δ15N values, 3.7 ± 1.1‰, in the lower portion of the core, to lower δ15N values (1.9 ± .5‰), in the upper portion of the core. A pollen-based reconstruction of terrestrial vegetation from the same core indicates that these isotopic shifts are concomitant with a shift from a dominance of Arecaceae (Palms) and tropical dry hardwoods below 30 cm, to Pinus and Conocarpus predominance above 30 cm. These results indicate that the source of sedimentary OM deposited into the sinkhole changed coherently with regional landscape change. Biomarker analyses will be used to further identify the role of autochthonous vs. allochthonous inputs of OM and hydrological residence time on sedimentary records of the Northern Bahamas in the late Holocene.",

The delta has prograded more than 200 km over at least the last 6–7 ka. The river-mouth area of the delta is meso-tidal with the mean tidal range of 2.5 ± 0.1 m and the maximum tidal range is 3.2–3.8 m. The mean wave height is 0.9 m. Its water discharge is 470 km3/y and its sediment discharge is 160 million t/y, or tenth and ninth largest in the world, respectively. The water discharge varies by season because most of the drainage area is under a monsoonal tropical regime. The flow at Phnom Penh, Cambodia, reaches a maximum in October (typically 39,000 m3/s) and a minimum in May (about 1700 m3/s). Tidal water-level changes are observed in Cambodia, more than 200 km upstream from the river mouth.\nTo understand the combined influenced of river and tide on river bottom sediments, we have collected ~210 surface samples from river bottoms of the whole Mekong River delta in Vietnam, covering five distributaries during dry season from January to May 2015. Sediment characteristics show clearly tide- and river-influenced areas, which are closely linked with river morphology.",

The predicted zonal mean response is enhanced horizontal moisture transport associated with increased saturation vapor pressure, which in turn drives additional net precipitation in the tropics and additional net evaporation in the subtropics. The observed two-dimensional response suggests that the spatial pattern of sea surface salinity is, in fact, amplifying. High salinity regions have become saltier while low salinity regions are have become fresher. Most noticeable is the widening gap between the relatively fresh Pacific ocean and the relatively salty Atlantic ocean. Changes in evaporation minus precipitation (E-P) over the global ocean in response to warming are difficult to observe directly, but changes in sea surface salinity provide a useful proxy for these changes in that they integrate changes in the highly variable surface freshwater flux. To quantify the relationship between sea surface salinity and temperature, we project sea surface salinity anomalies onto evaporation minus precipitation (E-P) to create an index of salinity variability. Conceptually, this index can be thought of as an indicator of the strength of the hydrological cycle, and is dominated by the rate of freshwater transport in the Hadley Cell. The results reveal a strong relationship between tropical temperature variability and the dominant pattern of sea surface salinity. This relationship is coherent across a broad range of frequencies. There are also strong differences in the physical response to warming in the Atlantic and Pacific ocean basins, with the Atlantic salinity response more closely tied to mean salinity and the Pacific salinity response more closely tied to evaporation minus precipitation. We hypothesize that this is due to large-scale evaporative regions and mixed-layer dynamics dominating the salinity response in the Atlantic ocean and the Pacific ocean exhibiting the highly variable nature of the major climate modes in the region. We extend the results to early the 20th century by examining archival of sea surface salinity measurements from 1900-2014.",

Patagonia has been identified as a key dust source to East Antarctica during Ice Age climates; however, the dust sources to West Antarctica during these times have remained unknown.\nWe present radiogenic isotope (Sr, Nd, Pb isotopes) and trace element data of the insoluble dust extracted from 15 WAIS Divide ice core and 4 Byrd ice core samples between ~40ky and the end of the Last Glacial Maximum, and combine these with a novel set of observations on potential sources of dust from around the Pacific sector of the polar Southern Hemisphere. We use these geochemical tools to identify, in a multi-dimensional view, the source(s) of dust to West Antarctica. We also identify the sources of dust across two millennial-scale climate events. The data indicate that Patagonia was a dominant source of dust for West Antarctica during glacial periods, highlighting the importance of southern South America as a dust source for broad swaths of the polar and sub-polar Southern Hemisphere.",

In 2002, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) started an assessment to conduct a geology-based analysis of the occurrences of gas hydrates within northern Alaska. As a result of this assessment, many potential gas hydrate prospects were identified in the eastern National Petroleum Reserve Alaska (NPRA) region of Alaska North Slope (ANS) with total gas in-place of about 2 trillion cubic feet. In absence of any field test, reservoir simulation is a powerful tool to predict the behavior of the hydrate reservoir and the amount of gas that can be technically recovered using best suitable gas recovery technique. This work focuses on the advanced evaluation of the gas production potential of hydrate accumulation in Sunlight Peak - one of the promising hydrate fields in eastern NPRA region using reservoir simulations approach, as a part of the USGS gas hydrate development Life Cycle Assessment program.\nThe main objective of this work is to develop a field scale reservoir model that fully describes the production design and the response of hydrate field. Due to the insufficient data available for this field, the distribution of the reservoir properties (such as porosity, permeability and hydrate saturation) are approximated by correlating the data from Mount Elbert hydrate field to obtain a fully heterogeneous 3D reservoir model. CMG STARS is used as a simulation tool to model multiphase, multicomponent fluid flow and heat transfer in which an equilibrium model of hydrate dissociation was used. Production of the gas from the reservoir is carried out for a period of 30 years using depressurization gas recovery technique. The results in terms of gas and water rate profiles are obtained and the response of the reservoir to pressure and temperature changes due to depressurization and hydrate dissociation over a period of time is studied. A sensitivity analysis study is also performed to study the effect of the reservoir properties and operational parameters on the overall productivity of the reservoir.",

Due to this energy-water nexus, energy efficiency measures might be a cost-effective approach to reducing water use and water efficiency measures might support energy savings as well. This research characterizes the cost-effectiveness of different efficiency approaches in households by quantifying the direct and indirect water and energy savings that could be realized through efficiency measures, such as low-flow fixtures, energy and water efficient appliances, distributed generation, and solar water heating. Potential energy and water savings from these efficiency measures was analyzed in a product-lifetime adjusted economic model comparing efficiency measures to conventional counterparts. Results were displayed as cost abatement curves indicating the most economical measures to implement for a target reduction in water and/or energy consumption. These cost abatement curves are useful in supporting market innovation and investment in residential-scale efficiency.",

The persistence of the SAM is suggested due to the positive eddy-zonal flow feedbacks. In this study, the influence of extratropical air-sea interactions in the eddy-mean flow interactions in the SAM is investigated by using the ERA-40 reanalysis data(1982-2001) ,GODAS ocean data and the OISST-V2 SST data. Our lagged regression analysis show that the poleward shift of the barotropic eddy driven jet induces a robust dipolar SST anomaly pattern with cold anomalies at high latitude around 60S and warm anomalies at midlatitude near 40S .This is mainly attributed to the anomalous Ekman heat transport and surface turbulent heat flux induced by the anomalous zonal wind in the SAM. Further analysis shows that this SST anomaly may have a positive feedback to the persistence of the SAM by maintaining the lower-tropospheric temperature anomalies which further results in anomalous eddy momentum forcing. Furthermore, our analysis suggests two possible mechanisms through which the lower-level temperature anomalies can affect the eddy momentum forcing. With a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian Finite Amplitude Wave Activity diagnostic method, it is found that the SAM induced SST anomaly can influence both the upper-layer eddy propagation and the low-troposphere eddy generation. Both of these two processes can lead to anomalous eddy momentum flux and eventually extend the persistence of the SAM.",

This work presents a methodology for estimating slope, aspect and the components of the incoming solar radiation by using a vectorial approach within a topocentric coordinate system by establishing geometric relations between groups of TIN elements and the sun position. A normal vector to the surface of each TIN element describes slope and aspect while spherical trigonometry allows computing a unit vector defining the position of the sun at each hour and DOY. Thus, a dot product determines the radiation flux at each TIN element. Remote shading is computed by scanning the projection of groups of TIN elements in the direction of the closest perpendicular plane to the sun vector. Sky view fractions are computed by a simplified scanning algorithm in prescribed directions and are useful to determine diffuse radiation. Finally, remote radiation scattering is computed from the sky view factor complementary functions for prescribed albedo values of the surrounding terrain only for significant angles above the horizon. This methodology represents an improvement on the current algorithms to compute terrain and radiation parameters on TINs in an efficient manner. All terrain features (e.g. slope, aspect, sky view factors and remote sheltering) can be pre-computed and stored for easy access for a subsequent ground surface or hydrologic simulation.",

            "abstract": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently proposed lowering the 8-hr ozone standard to between 65-70 ppb. Not all regions of the U.S. are in attainment of the current 75 ppb standard and it is expected that many regions currently in attainment will not meet the future, lower surface ozone standard. Ozone production is a nonlinear function of emissions, biological processes, and weather. Federal and state agencies rely on regulatory air quality models such as the Community Multi-Scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model and Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) to test ozone precursor emission reduction strategies that will bring states into compliance with the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). We will describe various model scenarios that simulate how future limits on emission of ozone precursors (i.e. NOx and VOCs) from sources such as power plants and vehicles will affect air quality. These scenarios are currently being developed by states required to submit a State Implementation Plan to the EPA. Projections from these future case scenarios suggest that strategies intended to control local ozone may also bring upwind states into attainment of the new NAAQS. Ground based, aircraft, and satellite observations are used to ensure that air quality models accurately represent photochemical processes within the troposphere. We will highlight some of the improvements made to the CMAQ and CAMx model framework based on our analysis of NASA observations obtained by the OMI instrument on the Aura satellite and by the DISCOVER-AQ field campaign.",

In the zero guide-field case we discover a new signature of Hall-reconnection in the out-of-plane magnetic field, namely an octupolar pattern, as opposed to the well-studied quadrupolar out-of-plane field of reconnection. The emergence of the octupolar components was found to be caused by ion currents and is a general feature of X-point collapse. In a comparative study of tearing-mode reconnection, signatures of octupolar components are found only in the out-flow region. It is argued that space-craft observations of magnetic fields at reconnection sites may be used accordingly to identify the type of reconnection [1][2]. Further, initial oscillatory reconnection is observed, prior to reconnection onset, generating electro-magnetic waves at the upper-hybrid frequency, matching solar flare progenitor emission. When applying a guide-field, in both open and closed boundary conditions, thinner dissipation regions are obtained and the onset of reconnection is increasingly delayed. Investigations with open boundary conditions show that, for guide-fields close to the strength of the in-plane field, shear flows emerge, leading to the formation of electron flow vortices and magnetic islands [3]. Asymmetries in the components of the generalised Ohm's law across the dissipation region are observed. Extended in 3D geometry, it is shown that locations of magnetic islands and vortices are not constant along the height of the current-sheet. Vortices formed on opposite sites of the current-sheet travel in opposite directions along it, leading to a criss-cross vortex pattern. Possible instabilities resulting from this specific structure formation are to be investigated [4].\n[1] J. Graf von der Pahlen and D. Tsiklauri, Phys. Plasmas 21, 060705 (2014), \n[2] J.

            "abstract": "Combination of climate change and urbanization are heating up cities and putting the lives of millions of people in danger. More than half of the world’s total population resides in cities and urban centers. Cities are experiencing urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. Hotter days are associated with serious health impacts, heart attaches and respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Densely populated cities like Manhattan, New York can be affected by UHI impact much more than less populated cities. Even though many studies have been focused on the impact of UHI and temperature changes between urban and rural air temperature, not many look at the temperature variations within a city. These studies mostly use remote sensing data or typical measurements collected by local meteorological station networks. Local meteorological measurements only have local coverage and cannot be used to study the impact of UHI in a city and remote sensing data such as MODIS, LANDSAT and ASTER have with very low resolution which cannot be used for the purpose of this study. Therefore, predicting surface temperature in urban cities using weather data can be useful.Three months of Field campaign in Manhattan were used to measure spatial and temporal temperature variations within an urban setting by placing 10 fixed sensors deployed to measure temperature, relative humidity and sunlight. Fixed instrument shelters containing relative humidity, temperature and illumination sensors were mounted on lampposts in ten different locations in Manhattan (Vant-Hull et al, 2014). The shelters were fixed 3-4 meters above the ground for the period of three months from June 23 to September 20th of 2013 making measurements with the interval of 3 minutes. These high resolution temperature measurements and three months of weather data were used to predict temperature variability from weather forecasts. This study shows that the amplitude of spatial and temporal variation in temperature for each day can be predicted by regression of weather variables. In addition amplitude of spatial variations were most dependent on temperature, north winds, and high level lapse rate and the temporal variations were most dependent on temperature and lapse rates.",

The fossil ridge in South China Sea (SCS), along with the overriding seamounts, is now subducting along Manila trench below the Luzon Island, Philippines, providing a unique setting to study such a complex process. Here we present an upper mantle P-wave velocity structure derived from a finite frequency teleseismic tomography using primarily OBS data in SCS. The OBS data was collected from two passive source experiments carried out along the fossil ridge close to Manila trench. Both the deployments were over six months, and they retrieved valid data at 10 and 6 OBSs, respectively. To constrain the upper mantle structure beneath Luzon, we will employ the Source Side Seismic tomography (3STomo) method, in which the roles of station and earthquake are interchanged compared to the conventional teleseismic tomography. We will combine the 3STomo with the conventional tomography using OBSs and a few land stations to construct an upper mantle structure model for the whole region. We expect our seismic images would be helpful to explain the seismicity pattern and the geochemical signature observed on Luzon Island.",

Groundwater at the site has high concentrations of chloride, alkalinity and U(VI) as a owing to ore processing at the site from 1941 to 1974. We previously calibrated a multicomponent reactive transport model to data collected at the site from 1986 to 2001. A two dimensional nonreactive transport model used a uniform hydraulic conductivity which was estimated from observed chloride concentrations and tritium helium age dates. A reactive transport model for the 2km long site was developed by including an equilibrium U(VI) surface complexation model calibrated to laboratory data and calcite equilibrium. The calibrated model reproduced both nonreactive tracers as well as the observed U(VI), pH and alkalinity. Forward simulations for the period 2002-2015 conducted with the calibrated model predict significantly faster natural attenuation of U(VI) concentrations than has been observed by the persistent high U(VI) concentrations at the site. Alternative modeling approaches are being evaluating evaluated using recent data to determine if the persistence can be explained by multirate mass transfer models developed from experimental observations at the column scale(~0.2m), the laboratory tank scale (~2m), the field tracer test scale (~1-4m) or geophysical observation scale (~1-5m). Results of this comparison should provide insight into the persistence of U(VI) plumes and improved management options.",

            "abstract": "Oceanic surface gravity waves called as swells with period of several seconds appear anytime and anywhere on the ocean. They continuously radiate atmospheric acoustic waves called as microbaroms, while they also generate seismic surface waves called as microseisms. We can continuously observe both microbaroms and microseisms near the coast, and using these data we could estimate the wave height of oceanic swells. We could also estimate atmospheric temperature and wind, and solid earth density because they affect the propagation velocity of microbaroms and microseisms.\nFor the estimation we have developed a coupled atmosphere-ocean-solid earth model. If we connect independent parts of atmosphere, ocean and solid earth, we need to impose complicated boundary conditions. Instead we have modeled atmosphere, ocean and solid earth as a unified continuum to exclude the boundary conditions, using CIP-CUP (Constrained Interpolation Profile - Combined and Unified Procedure) scheme. This method makes it possible to precisely compute the advection part and to stably compute the ocean-atmosphere and ocean-solid earth boundaries, which have considerable gap of density and sound speed.\nOur model successfully simulates a theoretical microbarom radiation [Arendt and Fritts, 2000]: 1) A microbarom is radiated by two swells propagating in opposite directions. 2) The period of the microbarom is half of the swells’. 3) The amplitude of the radiated pressure perturbation is in proportion to the squared vertical velocity of the swells. We will also compare the features of computed seismic waves with theory [Longuet-Higgins, 1950], which is very similar to the one for microbaroms.",

Our current understanding of Arctic biogeochemistry implies that changes in terrestrial fluxes of carbon can be expected as the Arctic warms. Vast stores of organic carbon are thought to be frozen in Arctic soils, and if mobilized to the atmosphere, would have significant impacts on global climate.\nObservations of greenhouse gases in the Arctic and globally have been collected for several decades. Analysis of this data does not currently support significantly changed Arctic emissions of CH4, however it is difficult to detect changes in Arctic emissions because of transport from lower latitudes and large inter-annual variability. Modeling systems can help untangle the Arctic budget of greenhouse gases, but they are dependent on underlying prior fluxes and wetland distributions, as well as possible transport model biases, leading to significant uncertainties.\nWe discuss our current understanding of the Arctic carbon budget from both top-down and bottom-up approaches. We show that current atmospheric inversions agree well on the CH4 budget. On the other hand, bottom-up models vary widely in their predictions of wetland emissions, with some models predicting emissions too large to be accommodated by the budget implied by global observations. Large emissions from the shallow Arctic ocean are also inconsistent with atmospheric observations. We also discuss the sensitivity of the current atmospheric network to what is likely small, gradual increases in emissions over time by examining modeled and observed spatial and seasonal variability. Spectral decomposition of CH4 observations reveal subtle but significant changes in the amplitude and phase of the seasonal cycle. We attribute these changes, using isotope data and an atmospheric transport model, to changes in natural and anthropogenic sources.",

However, dynamically consistent 3-D numerical models of double subduction have yet to be explored, and so the physics of such double slab systems remain poorly understood. Here we build on the comparison of a fully numerical finite element model (CitcomCU) and a time-dependent semi-analytic subduction models (FAST) presented for single subduction systems (Royden et. al., 2015 AGU Fall Abstract) to explore how subducting slab kinematics, particularly trench and plate motions, can be affected by the presence of an additional slab, with all of the possible slab dip direction permutations. A second subducting slab gives rise to a more complex dynamic pressure and mantle flow fields, and an additional slab pull force that is transmitted across the subduction zone interface. While the general relationships among plate velocity, trench velocity, asthenospheric pressure drop, and plate coupling modes are similar to those observed for the single slab case, we find that multiple subducting slabs can interact with each other and indeed induce slab kinematics that deviate significantly from those observed for the equivalent single slab models.\n",

            "abstract": "The GWHP system uses a stable temperature of groundwater for cooling and heating in buildings and thus has been known as one of the most energy-saving and cost-efficient renewable energy techniques. A GWHP facility was installed at an island located at the confluence of North Han and South Han rivers, Korea. Because of well-developed alluvium, the aquifer is suitable for application of this system, extracting and injecting a large amount of groundwater. However, the numerical experiments under various operational conditions showed that it could be vulnerable to thermal interference due to the highly permeable gravel layer, as a preferential path of thermal plume migration, and limited space for well installation. Thus, regional groundwater flow must be an important factor of consideration for the efficient operation under these conditions but was found to be not simple in this site. While the groundwater level in this site totally depends on the river stage control of Paldang dam, the direction and velocity of the regional groundwater flow, observed using the colloidal borescope, have been changed hour by hour with the combined flows of both the rivers. During the pumping and injection tests, the water discharges in Cheongpyeong dam affected their respective results. Moreover, the measured NO3-N concentrations might imply the effect of agricultural activities around the facility on the groundwater quality along the regional flow. It is obvious that the extraction and injection of groundwater during the facility operation will affect the fate of the agricultural contaminants. Particularly, the gravel layer must also be a main path for contaminant migration. The simulations for contaminant transport during the facility operation showed that the operation strategy for only thermal efficiency could be unsafe and unstable in respect of groundwater quality. All these results concluded that the integrated approach on groundwater flow and heat/solute transport is necessary for the sustainable GWHP system operation.\nAcknowledgment: This work was supported by the research project of \"Advanced Technology for Groundwater Development and Application in Riversides (Geowater+)\" in \"Water Resources Management Program (code 11 Technology Innovation C05)\" of the MOLIT and the KAIA in Korea.",

            "abstract": "Numerous submarine deep-sea hydrothermal vents related to volcanic activity of the East Pacific Rise (EPR) are situated along the Pacific margins of Mexico. Until recently, active hydrothermal venting was unknown between the Guaymas Basin and 21°N on the EPR. MBARI's recent oceanographic surveys have added 7 new active vent sites. In this study, we aimed to sample the high-temperature hydrothermal fluids emanating from two distinct vent sites, named Meyibo and Auka, located in the Alarcon Rise and Pescadero Basin, respectively.\nMantle-derived He have long been identified in hydrothermal fluid releases. The presence of He in aqueous fluids with 3He/4He ratios greater than in-situ production values (~0.05 RA, where RA = air He or 1.4 x 10-6) indicates the presence of mantle-derived melts. Preliminary analyses of He-isotope ratios derived from the newly discovered Meyibo and Auka hydrothermal fields show high 3He/4He ratios (~8RA), typical of MORB’s. Auka vent field, characterized by chimneys composed of light carbonate minerals and oil-like hydrocarbons, and temperatures between 250-290oC, show average values of ~7.87RA. In contrast, the black-smokers at the Meyibo field, composed of dark sulfide minerals and temperatures over 350oC, yielded a higher He ratio of ~8.24RA.\nRecently, it has become clear that regional maximum mantle He values correlate with the velocity structure in the mantle, therefore, He has the potential to map regions of the underlying mantle that are undergoing partial melting. Seismic records could then be compared with the geochemical He ratio signal and supply information regarding tectonics and other processes involved in the generation of these gases. The data presented here will be completing a totally new inventory of He results from hydrothermal vents in the EPR and fault-termination basins distributed along the P-NA plate boundary in the Gulf of California. The results will be further coupled with the analysis of other geochemical indicators of mantle degassing to assess the relationship between He-isotopes and mantle velocity structure in the region.",

            "abstract": "Urban expansion accompanied by losses of vegetated spaces and their ecological services raises significant concerns about the future of humans in metropolitan “habitats”. Despite recent growth of urban studies globally, it is still not well understood how environmental effects of urbanization vary with the rate and socioeconomic context of development. Our study hypothesized that with urban development, spatial patterns of surface thermal properties and green plant cover would shift towards higher occurrence of relatively warmer and less vegetated spaces such as built-up areas, followed by losses of greener and cooler areas such as urban forests, and that these shifts would be more pronounced with higher rate of economic and/or population growth. To test these ideas, we compared 1992-2011 changes in remotely sensed patterns of green vegetation and surface temperature in three example cities that experienced peripheral growth under contrasting socio-economic context – Dallas, TX, USA, Beijing, China and Kyiv, Ukraine. To assess their transformation, we proposed a metric of thermal-vegetation angle (TVA) estimated from per-pixel proxies of vegetation greenness and surface temperature from Landsat satellite data and examined changes in TVA distributions within each city’s core and two decadal zones of peripheral sprawl delineated from nighttime satellite data. We found that higher economic and population growth were coupled with more pronounced changes in TVA distributions, and more urbanized zones often exhibited higher frequencies of warmer, less green than average TVA values with novel patterns such as “cooler” clusters of building shadows. Although greener and cooler spaces generally diminished with development, they remained relatively prevalent in low-density residential areas of Dallas and peripheral zones of Kyiv with exurban subsistence farming. Overall, results indicate that the effects of modified green space and thermal patterns within growing cities highly vary depending on economy, population trends and historical legacies of planned green spaces. Remote sensing-based metrics such as TVA facilitate their comparisons and offer useful strategies to cost-effectively monitor urban transformation and inform more explicit environmental modeling of cities in the future.",

            "abstract": "The current California drought, induced by a combination of low precipitation and high temperature, is estimated to be the worst in at least 1200 years. According to media headlines, a “super El Niño” with above-normal precipitation over California may provide some drought relief. This particular case highlights an underlying perception that ENSO events (and other modes of climate variability) will always be a source of relief (or damage). We argue that this expectation is not realistic in regions where the mean change in terrestrial aridity/moistening in response to greenhouse warming becomes larger than the expected range of current variability.\nWith few exceptions, most projections studies focus either on the change in mean state or on the change in variability, and neglect to investigate the combined effects of mean and variability changes at regional scale. Here, we use a suite of state-of-the-art climate model simulations to identify the regions where a projected change in aridity exists, and consider whether this change is large enough to overwhelm the effect of local drying/moistening associated with ENSO variability.\nBy the end of the 21st century, warming is expected virtually everywhere, independent of the phase of ENSO. In contrast, expectations regarding the net anomalies in regional precipitation (compared to some historical reference) are much more complex. This is because changes in the mean state and variability are governed by a number of different, spatially-complex mechanisms (e.g., via the ‘rich-get-richer/poor-get-poorer’ mechanism and through well-known teleconnections). Here, we provide a comprehensive assessment of the relative contributions to future drought from changes in moisture supply (precipitation) versus evaporative demand (potential evapotranspiration). We also investigate the competing effects of mean changes and ENSO variability in terms of ameliorating or exacerbating drought.\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory under Contract DE-AC52-07NA27344, and is supported, among others, by the PCMDI SFA funding and C.B.

            "abstract": "Exceptionally warm, dry conditions in the Pacific Northwest and southern latitudes of western Canada commenced in 2013 and continue today. The winter of 2014/2015, for example, saw freezing levels in the Cascade Mountains rise to elevations not seen in the instrumental record. Record thin snow packs have similarly occurred for many regions with some mountains lacking any measurable snow cover at the end of the accumulation season. Our study objectives are twofold: First, we quantify recent changes in glacier area and mass and evaluate these changes against longer term records from the region. Second, we address the importance of extreme mass change events for long-term glacier fluctuations and mass change. Our data are derived from air- (LiDAR and 1-m resolution aerial photographs) and space-borne platforms (Landsat 8, WorldView) in addition to direct mass balance measurements of key glaciers throughout the region. WorldView stereo imagery is currently being acquired for select glaciers where we routinely fly LiDAR surveys. Use of varied methods for mass and area change assessment allows us to quantify methodological biases and uncertainties. Long term trends in glacier shrinkage are controlled by warming air temperatures whereas precipitation is an important factor in decadal variability. Glacier retreat, particularly in maritime environments, slowed during the period 2005-2013 relative to retreat rates observed during 1985-2005. Retreat rates for the past two years, however, have strongly accelerated. Our results from Washington, British Columbia and Southeast Alaska indicate that 2014/2015 will be a record year of glacier mass and area loss for the region.",

            "abstract": "Recent high-resolution age dating demonstrates that the end-Triassic mass extinction overlapped with the eruption of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP), and the release of CO2 and other volatiles to the atmosphere has been implicated in the extinction. Given the potentially massive release of CO2, ocean acidification is commonly considered a factor in the extinction and the collapse of shallow marine carbonate ecosystems. However, the timing of global marine biotic recovery versus the CAMP eruptions is more uncertain. Here, we use Hg concentrations and Hg/TOC ratios as indicators of CAMP volcanism in continental shelf sediments, the primary archive of faunal data. In Triassic-Jurassic strata, Muller Canyon, Nevada, Hg and Hg/TOC levels are low prior to the extinction, rise sharply in the extinction interval, peak just prior to the appearance of the first Jurassic ammonite, and remain above background in association with a depauperate (low diversity) earliest Jurassic fauna. The return of Hg to pre-extinction levels is associated with a significant pelagic and benthic faunal recovery. We conclude that significant biotic recovery did not begin until CAMP eruptions ceased. Furthermore, the initial benthic recovery in the Muller Canyon section involves the expansion of a siliceous sponge-dominated ecosystem across shallow marine environments, a feature now known from other sections around the world (e.g., Peru, Morocco, Austria, etc.). Carbonate dominated benthic ecosystems (heralded by the return of abundant corals and other skeletal carbonates) did not recover for ~1 million years following the last eruption of CAMP, longer than the typical duration considered for ocean acidification events, implying other factors may have played a role in carbonate ecosystem dynamics after the extinction.",

Volcano-associated, silica-rich, mineral deposits have been identified on Mars, so the study of terrestrial examples is warranted. We studied a hot spring in Long Valley Caldera near Little Hot Creek, California, as part of the 2015 Geobiology Summer Course to characterize biological diversity and the potential for biosignature preservation in the rock record. Subsurface hydrothermal waters interact with the rhyolitic Bishop Tuff and feed Little Hot Creek, which exhibits progressively decreasing temperatures (~82-71°C) and rising pH (6.7-7.6) along a 23 m spatial transect. Creek water and sediment samples were collected along the entire transect, in addition to rim-encrusting carbonate-silica structures located ~6 m downstream from the creek source. 16S rRNA sequencing of both water and sediment samples yielded operational taxonomic units (OTUs) reflecting the potential capability for autotrophic thiosulfate oxidation and reduction, hydrogen oxidation, and sulfur oxidation near the creek source. Despite the obvious presence of life in the creek, the preservation potential of biosignatures in mineral deposits has proven ambiguous in at least three ways: 1. Sulfur isotope fractionation between aqueous sulfate and sulfide (~0.3‰) is consistent with both biotic and abiotic sulfur oxidation; 2. The increasing d13C of DIC down the transect can be solely explained by CO2 degassing; and 3. The d13C of rim-encrusting carbonates likely record a similar degassing signal. However, amorphous silica precipitates do exhibit textural evidence of life, with low inheritance between layers and lack of isopachous layering. Our results suggest that mineral deposits in Little Hot Creek show little potential for biosignature preservation; hence, further consideration of hot springs as astrobiological targets is necessary.",

            "abstract": "One of several mechanisms by which bedrock rivers can incise is abrasion of the bedrock surface by colliding sediment particles. This effect has been captured in terms of a “cover factor” corresponding to the areal fraction p of the bed that is covered with sediment. According to this formulation, a value of p equal to 1 corresponds to complete alluvial cover: sediment particles strike each other and no bedrock abrasion is accomplished. Correspondingly, a value of p equal to 0 corresponds to the absence of sediment: no particles are available to strike the bed, and again no bedrock abrasion is accomplished. Thus the condition 0 < p < 1 is hypothesized to be the condition for incision driven by abrasion. At the microscopic level, however, p can take only the binary values 0 and 1: either a point on the bedrock surface is covered or is not covered. Therefore, the value of p that enters into any morphodynamic formulation of cover must represent an average over some spatiotemporal window. Here we consider the case of a highly sinuous meandering flume. The bed is set in concrete to take the topography corresponding to purely alluvial mobile-bed equilibrium. The recirculation of sediment over this bed at below-capacity conditions leads to a complex pattern of free and forced bars that only partially cover the bed. At certain locations, such as near the inside of bends, the bed is always covered, where at other locations, such as right near the apexes of the very tight bends in the flume, the bed is almost never covered. At other locations, the instantaneous cover fluctuates between the binary values 0 and 1, reflecting the migration of bars of various sizes over the bedrock surface. The averaging of these binary values over appropriate time windows allows determination of the local spatial variation of p that can serve as input to a numerical model of the evolution of bedrock meandering channels.",

            "abstract": "The spatiotemporal fault slip history of the 2008 Iwate-Miyagi Nairiku earthquake, Japan, is obtained by the joint inversion of 1-Hz GPS waveforms and near-field strong motion records. 1-Hz GPS data from GEONET is processed by GAMIT/GLOBK and then a low-pass filter of 0.05 Hz is applied. The ground surface strong motion records from stations of K-NET and Kik-Net are band-pass filtered for the range of 0.05 ~ 0.3 Hz and integrated once to obtain velocity. The joint inversion exploits a broader frequency band for near-field ground motions, which provides excellent constraints for both the detailed slip history and slip distribution. A fully Bayesian inversion method is performed to simultaneously and objectively determine the rupture model, the unknown relative weighting of multiple data sets and the unknown smoothing hyperparameters. The preferred rupture model is stable for different choices of velocity structure model and station distribution, with maximum slip of ~ 8.0 m and seismic moment of 2.9 × 1019 Nm (Mw 6.9). By comparison with the single inversion of strong motion records, the cumulative slip distribution of joint inversion shows sparser slip distribution with two slip asperities. One common slip asperity extends from the hypocenter southeastward to the ground surface of breakage; another slip asperity, which is unique for joint inversion contributed by 1-Hz GPS waveforms, appears in the deep part of fault where very few aftershocks are occurring. The differential moment rate function of joint and single inversions obviously indicates that rich high frequency waves are radiated in the first three seconds but few low frequency waves.",

These stations are classified based on proximity to artificial surfaces, buildings, and other such objects with unnatural thermal mass using guidelines established by Leroy (2010). The relatively few stations in the classes with minimal artificial impact are found to have raw temperature trends that are collectively about 2/3 as large as stations in the classes with greater expected artificial impact. The trend differences are largest for minimum temperatures and are statistically significant even at the regional scale and across different types of instrumentation and degrees of urbanization. The homogeneity adjustments applied by the National Centers for Environmental Information (formerly the National Climatic Data Center) greatly reduce those differences but produce trends that are more consistent with the stations with greater expected artificial impact.

            "abstract": "The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a tropical phenomenon that develops over the Indian Ocean. This intraseasonal oscillation consists of an extensive area of convection, about 1000 km across, that releases latent heat in the mid-troposphere, and this heating forces planetary-scale waves to travel through the upper troposphere. These waves can affect weather and climate in the extratropical regions. Since our computational models do not simulate the MJO correctly, international efforts are underway to improve our understanding of the processes involved, especially during the MJO’s early stages. This study examines and compares MJO initiation events and types (primary, intensifying, non-MJO) identified by researchers using four methods during 1998–2009 boreal winters. Two methods focused on the precipitation aspect of the oscillation, and the others focused on circulation. Five variables were selected for analysis: temperature at 400 hPa, outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR), sea level pressure (SLP), and zonal winds at 200 and 850 hPa. Twelve MJO events were selected, and four were analyzed. The five variables’ contributions to each event were mapped using the MJO-like mode recently identified by other scientists from unfiltered five-day mean gridded data. These visualizations show consistent behaviors in OLR, temperature, and SLP. Positive OLR anomalies occurred in the Indian Ocean before MJO convection began, supporting another research group’s idea of an MJO “dry dynamic mode.” The MJO-like mode also depicts some previously observed behavior in MJO precursor variables. The results also serve to validate the MJO-like mode and demonstrate that it identifies both MJO and non-MJO convection.",

            "abstract": "The newly discovered Miocene Markagunt gravity slide (MGS; Utah, USA) represents the largest volcanic landslide structure on Earth. Recent geologic mapping of the MGS indicates that it was a large contiguous volcanic sheet of allochthonous andesitic mudflow breccias and lava flows, volcaniclastic rocks, and intertonguing regional ash-flow tuffs that blanketed an area of at least 5000 km2 with an estimated volume of ~3000 km3. From its breakaway zone in the Tushar and Mineral Mountains to its southern limits, the MGS is over 95 km long and at least 65 km wide. The MGS consists of four distinct structural segments: 1) a high-angle breakaway segment, 2) a bedding-plane segment, ~60 km long and ~65 km wide, typically located within the volcaniclastic Eocene-Oligocene Brian Head Formation, 3) a ramp segment ~1-2 km wide where the slide cuts upsection, and 4) a former land surface segment where the upper-plate moved at least 35 km over the Miocene landscape. The presence of basal and lateral cataclastic breccias, clastic dikes, jigsaw puzzle fracturing, internal shears, pseudotachylytes, and the overall geometry of the MGS show that it represents a single catastrophic emplacement event. The MGS represents gravitationally induced collapse of the southwest sector of the Oligocene to Miocene Marysvale volcanic field. We suggest that continuous growth of the Marysvale volcanic field, loading more volcanic rocks on a structurally weak Brian Head basement, created conditions necessary for gravity sliding. In addition, inflation of the volcanic pile due to multiple magmatic intrusions tilted the strata gently southward, inducing lateral spreading of the sub-volcanic rocks prior to failure. Although similar smaller-scale failures have been recognized from individual volcanoes, the MGS represents a new class of low frequency but high impact hazards associated with catastrophic sector collapse of large volcanic fields containing multiple volcanoes. The relationship of the MGS to volcanic field development provides an analog for better understanding of such extreme events. We propose that magmatic doming and lateral volcanic field spreading prior to collapse could have important implications on the detection potential and consequent hazard assessment of gigantic landslide events from collapsing volcanic fields.",

It was shown that the changes in climate types are small between MWP and LIA due to weak changes in temperature and precipitation. The changes in climate types between PD and LM are largely driven by greenhouse gas induced warming but anthropogenic aerosols largely affect the regional climate types by causing a noticeable decrease in precipitation. The impact of natural forcing in LM and anthropogenic aerosols in PD on climate types becomes much smaller than those due to greenhouse gas increase at the end of the 21st century.",

The largest discrepancies between estimations and field measurements of deposition velocity also occur on rough surfaces, these discrepancies often reach 2 to 3 orders of magnitude. For decades, these discrepancies are repeatedly reported, yet not understood.\nPrevious deposition models use the flow over a single cylinder to approach the flow over more complex surfaces, and use a constant surface drag for all surfaces. These models cannot distinguish the drag for different roughness densities and different wind speeds, particularly on rough surfaces where the influence of roughness elements and shear flow on drag is significant.\nThis study proposes a deposition model, which reproduces the measurements of deposition velocity over rough surfaces, based on a study of turbulent shear flow over rough surfaces, a proposed physical drag theory and a series of large eddy simulation data. The numerical simulations of particle-laden flow are conducted on 11 rough surfaces with different roughness density (λ) at 6 wind speeds with particle diameters from 0.1 to 10 μm. These data are studied to associate the geometry of surfaces, the structure of shear flow and the drag on surfaces with deposition velocity. The wind profile and shear stress on surfaces are measured to validate the simulation. The simulated deposition velocities agree well with these field measurements for the first time.\nThe attached figure shows the comparison between deposition velocity from field experiments (markers) and the estimation from this study (curves), for 2 surfaces (λ = 0.033 and λ = 0.5) under 6 wind speeds (1 - 25 ms-1) and different particle sizes (dp). The measurements are well reproduced by the proposed deposition model. Deposition velocity increases as wind speed increases, thus the curves are not distinguished for each wind speed on each surface.",

            "abstract": "Pacaya volcano is a frequently active and potentially dangerous volcano situated in the Guatemalan volcanic arc. It is also a National Park and a major touristic attraction, constituting an important economic resource for local municipality and the nearby communities. Recent eruptions have caused fatalities and extensive damage to nearby communities, highlighting the need for risk management and loss reduction from the volcanic activity. Volcanic monitoring at Pacaya is done by the Instituto Nacional de Sismologia, Vulcanologia, Meteorologia e Hidrologia (INSIVUMEH), instrumentally through one short period seismic station, and visually by the Parque Nacional Volcan de Pacaya y Laguna de Calderas (PNVPLC) personnel.\nWe carry out a project to increase the local technical capacities for monitoring volcanic activity at Pacaya. Funding for the project comes from the Society of Exploration Geophysicists through the Geoscientists Without Borders program. Three seismic and continuous GPS stations will be installed at locations within 5 km from the main vent at Pacaya, and one webcam will aid in the visual monitoring tasks. Local educational and outreach components of the project include technical workshops on data monitoring use, and short thesis projects with the San Carlos University in Guatemala. A small permanent exhibit at the PNVPLC museum or visitor center, focusing on the volcano’s history, hazards and resources, will also be established as part of the project.\nThe strategy to involve a diverse group of local collaborators in Guatemala aims to increase the chances for long term sustainability of the project, and relies not only on transferring technology but also the “know-how” to make that technology useful. Although not a primary research project, it builds on a relationship of years of joint research projects at Pacaya between the participants, and could be a model of how to increase the broader impacts of such long term collaboration partnerships.",

In light of proposed geo-engineering with artificial enhancement of the stratospheric aerosol layer, accurate understanding of the impact of the natural analogue provided by volcanoes is imperative. Here, I provide an overview over a mounting body of evidence from observations that suggest very anomalous stratospheric dynamics following the Pinatubo eruption, much more so than after the eruption of El-Chichon. Analysis of general circulation models forced with observed sea surface temperatures and prescribed stratospheric aerosol shows that the models generally fail to reproduce the anomalous dynamic state, and it is unclear how, or even whether, the anomalous lower stratospheric dynamics are linked to the Pinatubo aerosol. Comparison of 3 different aerosol datasets based on observations shows large differences in the stratospheric aerosol radiative heating following the Pinatubo eruption. A suite of numerical model calculations using a comprehensive chemistry-climate model, and a primitive equation model, are used to study the impact of the change in the lower stratospheric radiative budget on temperature and dynamics, and their sensitivity to magnitude and distribution of the forcing from aerosol, and sea surface temperature distribution.",

Waveform similarity search applied to datasets of months to years of continuous seismic data will identify significantly more events than traditional detection methods. With the anticipated increase in number of detections and associated increase in false positives, manual inspection of the detection results will become infeasible. This motivates the need for new approaches to process the output of similarity-based detection. We explore data mining techniques for improved detection post-processing. We approach this by considering similarity-detector output as a sparse similarity graph with candidate events as vertices and similarities as weighted edges. Image processing techniques are leveraged to define candidate events and combine results individually processed at multiple stations. Clustering and graph analysis methods are used to identify groups of similar waveforms and assign a confidence score to candidate detections. Anomaly detection and classification are applied to waveform data for additional false detection removal. A comparison of methods will be presented and their performance will be demonstrated on a suspected induced and non-induced earthquake sequence.",

            "abstract": "A thousand times smaller in mass than Ganymede, Enceladus was known from Voyager data to be extremely bright and a dearth of craters on some parts of its surface suggested geologic activity. Cassini discovered the presence and composition of a plume erupting from the south polar terrain of Enceladus, approximately 100 narrow, distinct “geysers” or “jets” that feed it, and anomalous thermal signatures along fractures from which the geysers erupt. Cassini discovered organic and nitrogen-bearing molecules in the plume vapor, and detected salts in the plume icy grains, arguing strongly for ocean water being in contact with a rocky core. As much as Cassini has done, it cannot tell us whether the ocean of Enceladus hosts an active biota today. Enceladus Life Finder (ELF) is a Discovery-class solar-powered Saturn orbiter designed to fly multiple times through the plume of Enceladus. It carries two state-of-the-art mass spectrometers designed to analyze the gas and grains in the plume. The goals of the mission are derived directly from the most recent decadal survey: first, to determine primordial sources of organics and sites of organic synthesis today, second, to determine if there are modern habitats in the solar system beyond Earth where the conditions for life exist today and third, if life exists there now. ELF conducts three tests for life. The first test looks for a non-abiotic distribution of amino acids, the second determines whether the carbon number distribution in fatty acids or isoprenoids is biased toward a particular rule, and the third measures carbon and hydrogen isotopic ratios, together with the abundance of methane relative to other alkanes, to assess whether the values fall in the range for biological processes. The ELF mission spacecraft conducts ten science plume fly-throughs; the baseline science is completed in the first five plume passages.",

            "abstract": "The Japan Sea located in the northwestern Pacific has three major back-arc basins. Based on previous results, it is suggested that the back-arc opening of the Japan Sea was taken from the Early Oligocene to the Middle Miocene (e.g., Tamaki et al., 1992). From 3.5 Ma, in the eastern and southwestern margins, the crustal shortening by a strong compression occurred (Tamaki, 1988; Sato, 1994). Because of this opening and this shortening, the deformation such as active faults and folds has developed in these margins (e.g., Okamura et al., 2007). The Japan Sea has a unique tectonic setting to clarify the relationship between the back-arc opening process and the crustal deformation. However, we have little information concerning with a crustal structure formed by the back-arc opening and distribution of the crustal deformation. To obtain this information, we have been carrying out active-source seismic surveys using ocean bottom seismographs (OBSs) and multi-channel streamer system (MCS) to cover these margins of the Japan Sea.\nThe margin of the southern part of the Japan Sea has two crustal types. One is a thicker oceanic crust in the basin area (Yamato Basin), and the other is the rifted continental crust in the continental shelf in comparison with crustal structures of typical oceanic type (White et al., 1992) and of the northeastern Japan Island arc (Iwasaki et al., 2001). On the other hand, in the margin of the northern part of this Sea, the crust is divided into three types; the oceanic crust in the basin area (Japan Basin), the thicker oceanic crust in the transition area from the basin to the continental shelf, and the rifted continental crust in the continental shelf (No et al., 2014). In the distribution of the crustal deformation, the southern part differs from the northern one, like the crustal structure type. These might show that the distribution of the crustal deformation is related to the crustal structure types.",

            "abstract": "The failure of gradient diffusion parameterization for mean variables is a wide known issue in canopy turbulence. Especially for scalars like temperature, parameterizing the scalar flux with the mean scalar gradient with a turbulent diffusivity (K) as a proportionality parameter (hence K-theory) often fails in the canopy sub-layer. The main reasons behind this failure can be identified as (i) variable source or sink distribution inside the canopy, i.e., near field effects, (ii) lack of local balance between turbulent production and dissipation and (iii) vertical transport by coherent eddy motions of characteristic dimensions larger than the scale at which change of mean gradients takes place, i.e., non-local effects. All of these reasons can be traced to the triple moment in the turbulent scalar flux budget equation. While a prognostic approach can be taken to attempt writing closure equations for this triple moment which takes care of the first two local effects, a diagnostic approach can also be attempted to link the nonlocal effects to the scalar triple moment. The relative importance between sweep and ejections can be linked to this triple moment by means of an Incomplete Cumulant Expansion Method (ICEM), which provides the basis for a non-local closure. In the present work, a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is used to resolve scalar turbulence in a vegetation canopy. Quadrant analysis is performed to quantify the contributions from sweep and ejections events and this ICEM closure is investigated. When the flux transport term is closed by a gradient diffusion, and when expanded by third order cumulants, and those two approximations to the same term are equated, predictions of how the relative importance of ejections and sweeps emerges from local gradient diffusion can be made. Deviations between Quadrant analysis and such predictions can also highlight the role of nonlocal transport by ejections and sweeps beyond those associated with gradient diffusion of triple moment. Thus a new closure for the triple moment anchored to the ejection sweep cycle may emerge and it will be investigated by means of field data and LES.",

            "abstract": "A drought prone region such as the Great Plains of the United States (US GP) requires credible and actionable drought early warning. Such information cannot simply be extracted from available climate forecasts because of their large uncertainties at regional scales, and unclear connections to the needs of the decision makers. In particular, current dynamic seasonal predictions and climate projections, such as those produced by the NOAA North American Multi-Model Ensemble experiment (NMME) are much more reliable for winter and spring than for the summer season for the US GP. To mitigate the weaknesses of dynamic prediction/projections, we have identified three key processes behind the spring-to-summer dry memory through observational studies, as the scientific basis for a statistical drought early warning system. This system uses percentile soil moisture anomalies in spring as a key input to provide a probabilistic summer drought early warning. The latter outperforms the dynamic prediction over the US Southern Plains and has been used by the Texas state water agency to support state drought preparedness. A main source of uncertainty for this drought early warning system is the soil moisture input obtained from the NOAA Climate Forecasting System (CFS). We are testing use of the beta version of NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture data, along with the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), and the long-term Essential Climate Variable Soil Moisture (ECV-SM) soil moisture data, to reduce this uncertainty. Preliminary results based on ECV-SM suggests satellite based soil moisture data could improve early warning of rainfall anomalies over the western US GP with less dense vegetation. The skill degrades over the eastern US GP where denser vegetation is found. We evaluate our SMAP-based drought early warning for 2015 summer against observations.",

To quantify the sensitivity of modeled climate to these parameters, sufficiently long simulations are usually required to reduce the effect of natural variability. However, such long simulations are too expensive for a high-resolution model, especially when many simulations are needed to identify the parametric uncertainty. As an alternative approach, nudging (also called Newtonian relaxation) constrains large-scale meteorology and can distinguish the target signal from the natural noise in relatively short simulations. Here, we test whether this method biases the sensitivity of simulations to model parameters. We nudged the model towards a common baseline simulation, for both winds and temperature or winds alone. We found that constraining both winds and temperature suppresses the interaction between clouds and meteorological fields, inhibiting the response of moisture convergence and precipitation to changes in parameter values. Instead, nudging winds alone can capture the climate response to parameter perturbations more effectively. In addition, nudging simulations can reduce the computational cost by more than a factor of six.",

Improved understanding of the range of flood conditions and spatial variability within floodplains, or hydrospatial conditions, is needed to improve water and land management and restoration activities to support the variable conditions under which species adapted. This research quantifies the flood regime of a floodplain site undergoing restoration through levee breaching along the lower Cosumnes River of California. One of the few lowland alluvial rivers of California with an unregulated hydrograph and regular floodplain connectivity, the Cosumnes River provides a useful test-bed for exploring river-floodplain interaction. Representative floods of the Cosumnes River are selected from previously-established flood types comprising the flood regime and applied within a 2D hydrodynamic model representing the floodplain restoration site. Model output is analyzed and synthesized to quantify and compare conditions in space and time, using metrics such as depth and velocity. This research establishes methods for quantifying a flood regime’s floodplain inundation characteristics, illustrates the role of flow variability and landscape complexity in producing heterogeneous floodplain conditions, and suggests important implications for managing more ecologically functional floodplains.",

A variety of measurement techniques such as eddy covariance, dendrochronology, automatic soil CO2 chambers and remote sensing are employed fully understand forest carbon dynamics. Here, we present carbon flux measurements from 2003-2014 in a 76-year old managed temperate pine (({\\it -Pinus strobus L.}) forest, near Lake Erie in southern Ontario, Canada. Forest was partially thinned (30% tree harvested) in 1983 and 2012. The thinning in 2012 did not significantly impact carbon fluxes as post-thinning fluxes were within the range of inter-annual variability. Mean annual post-thinning (2012-2104) gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) measure by the eddy covariance technique was 1518 ± 78 g C m−2 year−1 as compared to pre-thinning (2003-2011) GEP of 1384 ± 121 g C m−2·year−1. Over the same period, mean post-thinning net ecosystem productivity (NEP) was 185 ± 75 g C m−2 year−1 as compared to post-thinning NEP of 180 ± 70 g C m−2 year−1, indicating that pre-thinning NEP was not significantly different than post-thinning NEP. Only post-thinning mean annual ecosystem respiration (Re; 1322 ± 54 g C m−2 year−1) was higher than pre-thinning Re (1195 ± 101 g C m−2 year−1). Soil CO2 efflux measurements showed similar trends. We also evaluated the impacts of climate variability and management regime on the full life cycle of the forest using annual radial tree-ring growths from 15 trees and compared them with historical climate (temperature and precipitation) data. While the annual growth rates displayed weak correlation with long-term climatic records, the growth was generally reduced during years with extreme drought (-36% of mean annual precipitation) and extreme temperature variability (±0.6 – 1.0°C). Overall, forest was more sensitive to management regime than climate variability. It showed higher growth stress during low light condition after crown closure. When partial thinning was introduced in 1983, it responded slowly and took about 5 to 7 years to show measureable increase in its growth, despite favorable climatic conditions. This study will help to advance our understanding of carbon dynamic of forest ecosystems.",

            "abstract": "Anisotropy of Earth’s inner core is a key to understand its evolution and the generation of the Earth’s magnetic field. All the previous inner core anisotropy models have assumed a cylindrical anisotropy with the symmetry axis parallel (or nearly parallel) to the Earth’s spin axis. However, we have recently found that the fast axis in the inner part of the inner core is close to the equator from inner-core waves extracted from earthquake coda. We obtained inner core phases, PKIIKP2 and PKIKP2 (round-trip phases between the station and its antipode that passes straight through the center of the Earth and that is reflected from the inner core boundary, respectively), from stackings of autocorrelations of the coda of large earthquakes (10,000~40,000 s after Mw>=7.0 earthquakes) at seismic station clusters around the world. We observed large variation of up to 10 s along equatorial paths in the differential travel times PKIIKP2 – PKIKP2, which are sensitive to inner-core structure. The observations can be explained by a cylindrical anisotropy in the inner inner core (IIC) (with a radius of slightly less than half the inner core radius) that has a fast axis aligned near the equator and a cylindrical anisotropy in the outer inner core (OIC) that has a fast axis along the north-south direction. We have obtained more observations using the combination of autocorrelations and cross-correlations at low-latitude station arrays. The results further confirm that the IIC has an equatorial anisotropy and a pattern different from the OIC. The equatorial fast axis of the IIC is near the Central America and the Southeast Asia. The drastic change in the fast axis and the form of anisotropy from the IIC to the OIC may suggest a phase change of the iron or a major shift in the crystallization and deformation during the formation and growth of the inner core.",

The spikes were seen in electron energies below 100 keV during a period, but not confined to, the arrival of energetic particles from active region AR2371. The spikes were separated by regular time intervals when the spacecraft was on the dayside of the planet. The spikes were consecutively located closer to the planet as the spacecraft approached the subsolar point. The dramatic increase in electron counts could be explained by the acceleration of the electrons at a Ceres bow shock. The dependence of the location of the spikes with relation to the subsolar point is consistent with a bow shock geometry. If a bow shock is confirmed, this would have considerable implications for the density of the Ceres exosphere during periods of high solar activity.",

Significant and spatially systematic variations in the apparent depths of the d410 and d660 are observed. The mean apparent depth of d410 and d660 for the entire study area is 416±1.87 km and 664±1.83 km, respectively. The variations of the apparent depths of d410 and d660 result in a complex mantle transition zone (MTZ) structure. Central and south-central Alaska are characterized by a normal MTZ thickness, suggesting that the subducting Pacific slab does not thermally affect the upper MTZ. Beneath the Yakutat microplate, a complex MTZ structure is observed with an overall thin MTZ thickness, coinciding with a low velocity zone and thin lithospheric thickness revealed by previous seismic tomography and receiver function studies. Two large regions with hot MTZ are mapped beneath NNW and NNE Alaska with abnormal temperature ranges between +360 and +390 °K. Despite of the complexity of the MTZ structure beneath Alaska, the mean MTZ thickness for the entire Alaskan orocline is 247 ±2.76 km, suggesting normal MTZ temperature on average. For the majority of the areas, our study shows that lateral upper mantle velocity variations contribute the bulk of the observed apparent undulations of the MTZ discontinuities.",

            "abstract": "Land surface model (LSM), which simulates energy, water and momentum exchanges between land and atmosphere, is an important component of Earth System Models (ESM). As shown in CMIP5, different ESMs usually use different LSMs and represent various land surface status. In order to select a land surface model which could be embedded into the ESM developed in Tsinghua University, we firstly evaluate the performance of three LSMs: Community Land Model (CLM4.5) and two different versions of Common Land Model (CoLM2005 and CoLM2014). All of three models were driven by CRUNCEP data and simulation results from 1980 to 2010 were used in this study. Diagnostic data provided by NCAR, global latent and sensible heat flux map estimated by Jung, net radiation from SRB, and in situ observation collected from FluxNet were used as reference data.\nTwo variables, surface runoff and snow depth, were used for evaluating the model performance in water budget simulation, while three variables including net radiation, sensible heat, and latent heat were used for assessing energy budget simulation.\nFor 30 years averaged runoff, global average value of Colm2014 is 0.44mm/day and close to the diagnostic value of 0.75 mm/day, while that of Colm2005 is 0.44mm/day and that of CLM is 0.20mm/day. For snow depth simulation, three models all have overestimation in the Northern Hemisphere and underestimation in the Southern Hemisphere compare to diagnostic data.\nFor 30 years energy budget simulation, at global scale, CoLM2005 performs best in latent heat estimation, CoLM2014 performs best in sensible heat simulation, and CoLM2005 and CoLM2014 make similar performance in net radiation estimation but is still better than CLM. At regional and local scale, comparing to the four years average of flux tower observation, RMSE of CoLM2005 is the smallest for latent heat (9.717 W/m2) , and for sensible heat simulation, RMSE of CoLM2005 (13.048 W/m2) is slightly greater than CLM(10.767 W/m2) but still better than CoLM2014(30.085 W/m2).\nOur analysis shows that both CoLM 2005 and CoLM 2014 are able to reproduce comparable land surface water and energy fluxes. It implies that the ESM developed in Tsinghua University may use CoLM, a LSM developed and maintained in China, as the land surface component. .",

Recently, the interseismic surface movements are detected with very high spatial resolution using combination of InSAR and GNSS survey. Most of the successful reports, however, addressed the fault creep in less vegetated area which enables C-band SAR interferometry. In this study, we report the interseismic crustal deformation in and around the Atotsugawa fault system, a strike-slip active fault in central Japan. This area is covered with dense vegetation in summer and with heavy snow in winter. We created a series of InSAR images acquired by ALOS/PALSAR and applied SBAS based time-series analysis (Berardino et al., 2002) to extract small deformation. Next, we corrected the long wave-length phase trend by GNSS network maintained by Japanese University Group (e.g, Ohzono et al., 2011) and GSI, Japan. The mean velocity field thus obtained shows a strain concentration zone along the Ushikubi fault, a major strand of the Atotsugawa fault system. The Ushikubi fault is seismically less active than the Atotsugawa fault, but it shows good correlation with a zone of large spatial gradient of Bouguer gravity anomaly. We further discuss on the deformation style at the junction between the Atotsugawa fault and the Hida mountain range (Tateyama volcano).

However, eruptions of some volcanoes remain stubbornly difficult to forecast effectively using seismic data alone. The Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) has responded to 28 eruptions from 10 volcanoes since 2005. Eruptions that were not forecast include those of frequently active volcanoes with basaltic-andesite magmas, like Pavlof, Veniaminof, and Okmok volcanoes.\nIn this study we quantify the success rate of eruption forecasting in Alaska and explore common characteristics of eruptions not forecast. In an effort to improve future forecasts, we re-examine seismic data from eruptions and known intrusive episodes in Alaska to test the effectiveness of the distal VT model commonly employed by the USGS-USAID Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP). In the distal VT model, anomalous brittle failure or volcano-tectonic (VT) earthquake swarms in the shallow crust surrounding the volcano occur as a secondary response to crustal strain induced by magma intrusion. Because the Aleutian volcanic arc is among the most seismically active regions on Earth, distinguishing distal VT earthquake swarms for eruption forecasting purposes from tectonic seismicity unrelated to volcanic processes poses a distinct challenge. In this study, we use a modified beta-statistic to identify pre-eruptive distal VT swarms and establish their statistical significance with respect to long-term background seismicity. This analysis allows us to explore the general applicability of the distal VT model and quantify the likelihood of encountering false positives in eruption forecasting using this model alone.",

New faculty members are at a pivotal stage in their careers as they step from being research-focused graduate students and post-doctoral scholars, under the guidance of advisors, towards launching independent careers as professors. New faculty commonly, and not unexpectedly, feel overwhelmed as they face challenges to establish themselves in a new environment, prepare new courses, begin new research, and develop a network of support.\nThe workshop for Early Career Geoscience Faculty: Teaching, Research, and Managing Your Career has been offered annually in the U.S. since 1999. The workshop is currently offered through the National Association of Geoscience Teachers On the Cutting Edge professional development program with support from the NSF, AGU and GSA. This five-day workshop, with associated web resources, offers guidance for incorporating evidence-based teaching practices, developing a research program, and managing professional responsibilities in balance with personal lives. The workshop design includes plenary and concurrent sessions, individual consultations, and personalized feedback from workshop participants and leaders.\nSince 1999, more than 850 U.S. faculty have attended the Early Career Geoscience Faculty workshop. Participants span a wide range of geoscience disciplines, and are in faculty positions at two-year colleges, four-year colleges, comprehensive universities and research universities. The percentages of women (~50%) and underrepresented participants (~8%) are higher than in the general geoscience faculty population. Multiple participants each year are starting positions after receiving all or part of their education outside the U.S. Collectively, participants report that they are better prepared to move forward with their careers as a result of the workshop, that they plan to incorporate evidence-based teaching in their classrooms, and that they leave the workshop with a network of support and the resources needed to enable them succeed.\nhttp://serc.carleton.edu/NAGTWorkshops/earlycareer",

This scheme is based on an entraining-plume model; the lateral entrainment rate vertically varies depending on buoyancy and updraft velocity; the updraft ensemble is spectrally represented with cloud types defined by updraft velocity at cloud base; the cloud base mass flux is prognostic according to the method of the prognostic Arakawa-Schubert scheme.\nThe operational GFS and the CS-GFS were configured to T126 horizontal resolution and each integrated 3 years with climatological SST and sea ice boundary conditions. Preliminary analysis indicates that the CS simulation was found to reduce surface and top of atmosphere imbalances in the total energy balances present in the control simulation. The CS simulation also increased, albeit excessively, the frequency distribution of intense precipitation rates and precipitatable water. Further differences in model mean state and variability will be analyzed and presented.",

            "abstract": "Transpired water contributes roughly 25% to total precipitation over the Earth’s land surface. In addition to transpiration’s impact on climatological mean precipitation, recent work suggests that transpiration reduces daily and intraseasonal precipitation variability in tropical forest regions. Projected increases in the concentration of CO2 are expected to reduce transpiration through changes in plant physiology (termed the CO2 physiological effect). Here, we use an ensemble of climate model experiments to assess the potential contribution of the CO2 physiological effect to future changes in precipitation variability and extreme precipitation events. Within our model simulations, precipitation responses to the physiological effects of increased CO2 concentrations are greatest throughout the tropics. In most tropical forest regions CO2 physiological forcing increases the annual number of dry (less than 0.1 mm/day) and extremely wet (rainfall exceeds 95th percentile) days. Changes in precipitation are primarily driven by an increase in surface temperature and subsequent changes in atmospheric stability and moisture convergence over vegetated tropical land regions. Our results suggest that the plant physiological response to CO2 forcing may serve as an important contributor to future precipitation variability in the tropics, and that future work should aim to reduce uncertainty in the response of plant physiology to changes in climate.",

            "abstract": "Water isotope ratios in precipitation have been used as paleothermometers for at least 50 years. Most temperature reconstructions using isotope ratios rely on the empirical observation of a correlation between isotope ratios and temperature. While this approach is supported by theoretical considerations, it is nevertheless inherently imprecise because the correlation arises from myriad processes in the atmosphere that cannot be direclty quantified. In this talk, I will discuss two major innovations in the use of isotope ratios to obtain paleotemperature from ice cores. First, the measurement of very high resolution isotope records allows for the determination of the diffusion length (the amount of isotope diffusion that has occurred), which is strongly dependent on temperature. Second, the novel measurement of the third naturally occuring isotope of oxygen -- oxygen 17 -- allows the measurement of the oxygen-17 excess, which provides new constraints temperature because it depends strongly on the temperature-dependent supersaturation. Both these approaches have a stronger theoretical foundation than the tradiational\nδ\n18\nO\nmethod, and have the potential to be both more accurate and precise.",

The Martian surface remains hostile, but its subsurface geology holds promise for present or ancient astrobiology and future habitation, specifically lava tube (pyroduct) systems, whose presence has been confirmed by HiRISE imagery.The location and characterization of these systems could provide a basis for understanding the evolution of the red planet and long-term shelters for future manned missions on Mars.\nTo detect and analyze the subsurface geology of terrestrial bodies from orbit, a novel compact (smallsat-scale) and cost-effective approach called the High-resolution Orbiter for Mapping gEology by Radar (HOMER) has been proposed. Adapting interferometry techniques with synthetic aperture radar (SAR) to a ground penetrating radar system, a small satellite constellation is able to achieve a theoretical resolution of 50m from low-Mars orbit (LMO).

            "abstract": "Oil spills are a hazard worldwide with potential of causing high impact disasters, and require an active oil spill response capability to protect personnel, the ecosystem, and the energy supply. As the amount of oil in traditionally accessible reserves decline, there will be increasing oil extraction from the Arctic and deep-water wells, both new sources with high risk and high cost for monitoring and response. Although radar has long been used for mapping the spatial extent of oil slicks, it is only since the Deepwater Horizon spill that synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been shown capable of characterizing oil properties within a slick, and therefore useful for directing response to the recoverable thicker slicks or emulsions. Here we discuss a 2015 Norwegian oil-on-water spill experiment in which emulsions of known quantity and water-to-oil ratio along with a look-alike slick of plant oil were released in the North Sea and imaged with polarimetric SAR (PolSAR) by NASA’s UAVSAR instrument for several hours following release. During the experiment, extensive in situ measurements were made from ship or aircraft with meteorological instruments, released drift buoys, and optical/IR imagers. The experiment was designed to provide validation data for development of a physical model relating polarization-dependent electromagnetic scattering to the dielectric properties of oil mixed with ocean water, which is the basis for oil characterization with SAR. Data were acquired with X-, C-, and L-band satellite-based SARs to enable multi-frequency comparison of characterization capabilities. In addition, the data are used to develop methods to differentiate mineral slicks from biogenic look-alikes, and to better understand slick weathering and dispersion. The results will provide a basis for modeling oil-in-ice spills, currently a high priority for nations involved in Arctic oil exploration. Here we discuss the Norwegian experiment, the validation data, and the results of analysis of the SAR data acquired during the experiment.\nThis work was carried out in part at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with NASA. The Norwegian experiment was partly financed by CIRFA – Centre for integrated remote sensing and forecasting for arctic operations.",

Automatic catchment delineation at gully gratings for urban areas using appropriate software packages/methods along with an appropriate set of input data and parameters is still a research challenge. Considering the above, the aim of this study is to (i) identify the best suitable software for automatic catchment delineation by considering gully grating as outlet (ii) understand the effect of resolution of DEM on catchments delineated (iii) understand whether to consider DEM or DSM for catchment delineation (iv) study the effect of grid based and TIN based DEM. In this study catchment delineation has been investigated considering IIT Kanpur as a study site. LiDAR data are used to generate DEM/DSM of the study area. A comparative study of catchment delineation has been carried out between ArcHydro 10.1, BASINS 4.1, ArcSWAT, WMS 7.1, and HEC-GeoHMS approaches. Catchments have been delineated for different drainage threshold areas using gully grating points as outlets and their effects have been compared for the aforementioned software. In order to understand the effect of resolution of data, DEMs of 1m and 5m resolution have been generated and compared against each other. Effects of building ridge lines and their contribution to catchment delineation has been studied by generating a DSM of 1m resolution, and comparing the results with catchments delineated using 1m DEM. In order to assess the effects of the types of DEM over catchment delineation, a grid based DEM and TIN based DEM are compared against each other using WMS 7.1 software. The results for the catchment delineation using various software illustrate that ArcHydro 10.1 performs better than any other aforementioned software. Also, it is noted that varied drainage threshold area parameters, resolutions of DEM, selection of DEM/DSM, selection of Grid or TIN based DEM play a significant role in determining catchment area. Results have been validated by analysing the study site through physical inspection. This study shows that, automatic catchment delineation for gully grating depends on the type of input data provided, software used, and drainage parameters selected.",

            "abstract": "Both nanocrystalline uraninite (UO2) and non-crystalline U(IV) occur in anoxic sediments, controlling the fate and transport of U in contaminated aquifers. It is important to distinguish between these forms of U because non-crystalline species are more reactive towards oxidants and aqueous complexing ligands, increasing the likelihood of U re-release into groundwater in the presence of such solutes. Much work has been done to elucidate microbiological and geochemical conditions favoring non-crystalline U(IV) or UO2 formation, primarily in model systems containing a single type of U(VI)-reducing bacterium. Research suggests that microbial biomass, including cell walls and exopolymeric substances (EPS), can adsorb U(IV), likely via phosphoryl groups. Furthermore, conditions that favor EPS formation appear to promote non-crystalline U(IV) formation. Non-crystalline U(IV) formation is also favored in the presence of phosphate. However, U(IV) behavior in complicated systems containing competing U(IV) sorbents has not been studied. Investigations of U(IV) behavior in such systems are needed to understand uranium mobility in natural sediments, which contain multiple sinks for U(IV).\nWe have developed a model system in which the native microbial consortia associated with partially decayed plant roots utilize homogenized root material to facilitate U(VI) reduction during anaerobic incubations. The model is intended to simulate an environment similar to that found in anoxic sediments where buried organic matter drives anaerobic respiration. We use this model to address the following questions: (1) Does U(IV) become associated with organic materials or minerals (or both)? (2) Does U(IV) form complexes with particular ligands, such as P? (3) Is UO2 produced when aqueous U(VI) concentrations are relatively low (~1 μM), which is typical of even contaminated sites? We have found that U(IV) does not form UO2 at low, environmentally relevant U:sorbent ratios. Furthermore, nanocrystalline and non-crystalline U(IV) associate with both inorganic and organic sorbents, suggesting that, although microbially-derived sedimentary organic matter can play an important role in U(IV) behavior, so can the inorganic sedimentary matrix.",

Yet tunnels are often constructed in geological structures with complex geometries, and in which the rock mass is fragmented from past structural deformations. Tunnel Geology Prediction (TGP) is a geophysical technique widely used during tunnel construction in China to ensure safety during construction and to prevent geological disasters. In this paper, geostatistical techniques were applied in order to integrate seismic velocity from TGP and borehole information into spatial predictions of RMR (Rock Mass Rating) in unexcavated areas. This approach is intended to apply conditional probability methods to transform seismic velocities to directly observed RMR values. The initial spatial distribution of RMR, inferred from the boreholes, was updated by including geophysical survey data in a co-kriging approach. The method applied to a real tunnel project shows significant improvements in rock mass quality predictions after including geophysical survey data, leading to better decision-making for construction safety design.",

            "abstract": "We estimated a fluorine flux associated with hydrothermal fluid emission at mid-ocean ridges (MOR) based on vent fluid chemistry and MORB vesicle compositions. Multiplication of fluorine concentrations in submarine hydrothermal fluids and the vent fluid flux at MOR may give us an estimate of fluorine flux at MOR. A worldwide vent chemistry research [1] suggested that submarine vent fluids are depleted in fluorine (<0.74 ppm F) relative to seawater (1.29 ppm F). The global flux of submarine hydrothermal fluids of (8.0+/-2.1)x1015 g/y was calculated using a numerical Bayesian inversion procedure to explain the relationship between compositions of high-temperature hydrothermal fluids and altered sheeted dikes, which enables us to estimate fluorine flux to be less than (3.1+/-0.8)x108 mol/y. This value is almost comparable with fluorine flux of (7.1+/-2.8)x108 mol/y estimated using F/3He ratios in MORB vesicles and the known 3He flux at MOR [3]. This flux calculation is based on preferentially degassed components from the magma as a form of MORB vesicle, thus may be related to fluorine flux associated with hydrothermal fluid emission. However, this flux should be overestimated because seawater incursion was not considered for the calculation. The average of the two different fluxes was calculated to be (5.1+/-2.0)x108 mol/y, which may be the maximum value of fluorine flux associated with hydrothermal fluid emission at MOR. It should be noted that this flux is much lower than the one estimated using the F/CO2 ratio in the MORB source and the known CO2 flux from the mantle [4] because the most of fluorine resides in the melt and should not be released immediately after formation of oceanic crust. Comparing MOR and arc fluxes, the global cycle of fluorine will be discussed in the presentation.\n[1] German & Von Damm (2006) Treatise On Geochemistry 6 (eds Holland & Turekian) 181-222 (Elsevier, London).

Modeling these fluxes and their chemical fate utilizes both chemical and physical parameterizations that depend on the representation of the forest canopy and turbulence within and above the forest canopy, as well as the emissions, deposition and chemical speciation. Depending on the chemical species, the turbulent component timescale competes with the atmospheric reactivity that can control biosphere-atmosphere exchange. A suite of models, ranging from 1D models that represent the canopy structure to large eddy simulation modeling to regional scale atmospheric chemistry modeling, can elucidate the role of the land surface in the drivers of boundary layer atmospheric chemistry.",

Based within the Science Application division of the US Fish and Wildlife Service, Landscape Conservation Cooperatives (LCCs) are regional conservation science partnerships that provide scientific and technical expertise needed to support conservation planning at landscape scales and promote collaboration in defining shared conservation goals. The five LCCs with jurisdiction in Alaska recently held a training workshop with the goals of advancing staff understanding and skills related to science communication and translation. We report here preliminary results from analysis of workshop discussions and pre- and post- workshop interviews and surveys revealing expectations, assumptions, and mental models regarding science communication and the process of conducting use-inspired science. Generalizable conclusions can assist scientists and boundary organizations bridge knowledge gaps between science and resource management.",

            "abstract": "Ice Sheet Mass balance is measured from the difference between the ice discharge along the coast and surface mass balance of the drainage basins of the glaciers. Precise estimation of the mass balance of each glacier needs an exact delineation of their drainage basin, which, ultimately, is defined by the flow of the ice. The precision of mapping is, however, limited by the precision of the actual maps of ice flow, mainly based on speckle tracking, which is not sufficient to fully capture the direction of flow in slow-moving parts of the ice sheets. Here we revisit prior drainage basins of Antarctica using a new precise velocity map based on the interferometric phase by combining InSAR tracks from ALOS/PALSAR-1, ENVISAT/ASAR, ERS-1/-2 and RADARSAT-1/-2. We map ice flow in the interior of the ice sheet at the meter/year level precision. We discuss differences observed between new divides and topographic divides. In addition, we combine this information with a new bed topography from the mass conservation approach and a time history of glacier velocity from Landsat 1975-2015 and InSAR 1992-2015 to calculate the continental discharge since 1975. The results are combined with RACMO2 output products to reconstruct the mass balance of the ice sheet for the past 40 years. The results indicate a significant increase in mass loss from Antarctica starting in the 1990s.

            "abstract": "Previous studies have shown that gauge-observed daily streamflow peak times (DPT) during spring snowmelt can exhibit distinct temporal shifts through the season. These shifts have been attributed to three processes that affect the timing of snowmelt arrival: 1) melt flux translation through the snowpack or percolation, 2) surface and subsurface flow of melt from the base of snowpacks to streams, and 3) translation of water flux in the streams to streamgage stations. The goal of this study is to evaluate and quantify how these processes affect observed DPT variations at the Reynolds Mountain East (RME) research catchment in southwest Idaho, USA. To accomplish this goal, DPT was simulated for the RME catchment over a period of 25 water years using a modified snowmelt model, iSnobal, and a hydrology model, PIHM. The influence of each controlling process was then evaluated by simulating the DPT with and without the process under consideration. Both intra- and inter-seasonal variability in DPT were evaluated. Results indicate that the average DPT is dominantly influenced by subsurface flow, whereas the seasonal variations in DPT are primarily controlled by percolation through snow. In addition to the three processes previously identified in the literature, processes governing the time for ripening of the snowpack are identified as additionally influencing DPT variability. Results also indicate that the relative dominance of each control varies through the melt season, and between wet and dry years. The results could be used for supporting DPT prediction efforts and for prioritization of observables for DPT determination.",

            "abstract": "The Cretaceous Baseline Sandstone of the Sevier foreland basin deposits in southern Nevada exhibits intense diagenetic iron-oxide coloration and bleaching, and contains abundant cemented masses. The Baseline Formation is ~1 km thick with three alluvial to fluvial members: the basal White (Kbw) Member, overlain by coeval Red (Kbr) and Overton Conglomerate (Kbo) Members. Iron-oxide diagenetic features occur in two broad classes: 1) bedding parallel coloration facies of diffuse to banded red, pink, purple, white, to yellow colors; and 2) concretionary facies of heavily cemented horizons, pods/lenses, spherical to spheroidal concretions, boxworks, pipes, and irregular concretion forms. A distinctive geometry is the occurrence of large (~1 m diameter) spherical “beach ball” concretions within the Kbr. Preliminary mapping of diagenetic features shows that concretionary facies are more common within a ~125 m interval near the bottom of Kbw, and within the lower ~125 m of Kbr. Intense coloration changes are present throughout Kbw but occur only in the lowermost ~150 m of Kbr. In the Kbw, concretionary forms commonly occur in stratigraphic intervals of fine-grained sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone lithologies, whereas cemented masses are much less common in stratigraphic intervals composed of medium-grained sandstone and conglomerate lithologies. Additionally, both Kbw and Kbr Members exhibit rare examples of wood fragments in the center of iron-oxide concretions, suggesting the importance of organics as nucleation sites for precipitation. The distribution of complex and overprinted diagenetic patterns indicates nested scales of processes involving iron-oxide dissolution, mobilization, and precipitation. Overall stratigraphic architecture influenced formation-scale patterns, but specific lithologies and textures influenced the type and distribution of diagenetic facies at outcrop scales, and organic content encouraged cementation at grain-scales.",

            "abstract": "The Capacity-based Saltation Abrasion (CSA) bedrock incision introduced by Sklar and Dietrich (2004) has opened new horizons in the study of the morphodynamics of mixed bedrock-alluvial rivers. The CSA formulation has a major limitation, however, in that it relates bedrock cover only to the sediment supply rate, without providing a mechanism to route this sediment downstream. As a result, the formulation cannot treat the morphodynamics of bedrock incision under the condition of waves of alluviation passing down the river. The Macro-Roughness-based Saltation-Abrasion-Alluviation (MRSAA) model introduced here a) relates areal fraction of alluvial cover to the thickness to which characteristic bedrock roughness elements are buried in alluvium (rather than sediment supply rate), and b) tracks alluvial thickness via an Exner equation of sediment conservation modified to capture both at-capacity and below-capacity transport. MRSAA thus has the ability to track the waves of alluviation and rarification that are likely to characterize the morphodyamics of bedrock-alluvial landscapes subject to dynamic relative base level change (e.g. rock uplift), where discrete landslides and debris flows may be common. Here we apply MRSAA to the case of a 1D channel subject to repeated “sedimentographs” of sediment supply at the upstream end. We show that under such conditions, an “incisional boundary layer” forms in the first ~ 20 km downstream of the sediment feed point, where the mean bedrock slope can differ substantially from that associated with constant sediment feed rate. Farther downstream, the sediment wave is damped and smeared out, and the long-term bedrock morphodynamics differ little from that associated with a constant feed rate. Here we consider both the cases of a repeated periodic sedimentograph and a randomized sedimentograph.",

In many environments, biomass burning contributes a significant source of primary aerosol as well as reactive gas-phase precursors that can form secondary organic aerosol (SOA). One class of these precursors, semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), has been shown to have a large contribution to the amount of SOA formed from fire emissions. At present, SVOC emissions from biomass burning are poorly constrained and understanding their contributions to SOA formation is an important research challenge.\nIn the Amazonian dry season, biomass burning is a major source of gases and aerosols reducing regional air quality. As part of the GoAmazon 2014/5 field campaign, we deployed the Semi-Volatile Thermal desorption Aerosol Gas Chromatograph (SV-TAG) instrument at the rural T3 site, 60 km to the west of Manaus, Brazil to measure hourly concentrations of SVOCs in the gas and particle phases. This comprehensive technique detects thousands of compounds, enabling the discovery of previously unidentified compounds. In this work we explore compounds for which a correlation with well-known biomass burning tracers is observed to discover the identities of new tracers. We discuss contributions to the total organic aerosol from well-known, rarely reported and newly-identified biomass burning tracers. We find that levoglucosan, perhaps the most commonly used particle phase biomass burning tracer, contributed 0.6% and 0.3% of total organic aerosol in the dry and wet seasons, respectively.",

We relocated 785 events from the Reviewed ISC Bulletin with local array data, 379 newly detected intermediate-depth events, as well as 1976-2012 events with Global Centroid-Moment-Tensor (CMT) solutions. The events were relocated with both local and teleseismic P, pP, and S arrivals using a hypocentroidal decomposition relative location algorithm. The results show a double-seismic zone (DSZ) with a separation of about 30 km along the Tonga slab within a depth range of about 70 – 300 km. The upper plane is more seismically active and characterized by downdip compressional stress whereas the lower plane is characterized by downdip tensional stress, consistent with the slab unbending model. Accordingly, focal mechanisms of the earthquakes along the surface of the slab show downdip extension above the depth of 80 km, but turn to compression below it, coinciding with the change of the slab dip angle from 30˚ to 60˚ at the same depth. The lower limit of the DSZ beneath Tonga is significantly deeper than that in Japan and Mariana (about 200 km), implying the importance of thermal variations in controlling the DSZ. Since the Tonga slab, with the fastest subduction rate, is cooler than other slabs, thermally controlled processes such as dehydration embrittlement can occur at greater depths, resulting in a deeper depth extent of the DSZ.",

Karst subsurface processes such as dissolution, cave formation and speleothem deposition are sensitive to environmental change, which is precisely why speleothems have been widely used as recorders of surface and climate change at an annual to millennial temporal scale. The effect of fire on karst processes is poorly understood. We hypothesise that a wildfire induced change at the surface will impact karst dissolution and precipitation processes. Firstly, sterilisation of the soil by heating causes a reduction in soil CO2 concentration which is a key component in dissolution processes. Secondly, removal of vegetation alters surface albedo and soil water storage properties. This could change the hydrology and isotopic signature of speleothem-forming drip water. We also hypothesise that a wildfire will produce a unique biogeochemical signature due to a change in the organic and inorganic properties of soil, which can be transported into speleothem forming drip water. Fire changes the organic matter character which is an important component in the mobilisation and transport of trace metals. Combustion of vegetation results in addition of ash derived minerals to the soil. Quantifying the biogeochemical signature from a burnt landscape will enable us to determine whether this wildfire signature is preserved in speleothems. This would provide the opportunity to use speleothems as recorders of fire history for the first time. Determining the impact of fire on karst processes would inform fire management and karst conservation policies.",

            "abstract": "“Data-model comparisons” using paleo data and simulations can provide strong out-of-sample tests of the ability of climate models to simulate climates other than those of the present. Data-model comparisons have shown that such large-scale patterns of simulated future climates (like enhanced land/ocean and latitudinal contrasts, and changes in seasonality) are also present in paleoclimate simulations, and critically, in paleo observations, indicating that those patterns are robust features of climate change, and are not simply model artifacts. Data-model comparisons have also shown that there are mismatches between simulations and observations on regional scales that have persisted across generations of models. The source of the mismatches in individual models are often inferred through simple data analyses and visualizations, and the subjective application of our conceptual models of “how climate works.” The availability of multiple simulations, including ensembles, both within and among models, and across generations of models, allow more objective statistical approaches to be applied to test hypotheses about the specific mechanisms (e.g. atmospheric circulation, surface water-and-energy balances) that contribute to the mismatches. These approaches range from familiar methods for characterizing multivariate data sets to newer approaches that attempt to infer cause-and-effect relationships among such data.",

The xenoliths, which include spinel and plagioclase facies peridotites and lower crustal rocks (representing a depth range of ~25-60 km), were collected from two localities ~80 km apart: the Cima and Dish Hill volcanic fields. We document how stress, temperature, water content, deformation mechanism, lattice preferred orientation (LPO), and style of localization vary spatially and with depth. Key findings include the following:\n(1) Both xenolith suites exhibit a wide range of deformation textures, ranging from granular, to protogranular, to porphyroclastic and mylonitic. Higher strain fabrics show no evidence for static annealing, thus are likely reflecting youthful deformation and strain gradients at depth.\n(2) Both xenolith suites show abundant dynamic recrystallization and other evidence for dislocation creep as the dominant deformation mechanism.\n(3) A- and E-type olivine LPOs occur in both xenolith suites. In general, E-type LPO is associated with higher strain fabrics than A-type.\n(4) Water contents—found using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS)—range from 115-254 ppm for clinopyroxene, 35-165 ppm for orthopyroxene, and less than 10 ppm for olivine. We have found no correlation between water content and olivine LPO, despite experimental work associating higher water content with the development of E-type LPO, compared to A-type.\n(5) Deformation in most lower crustal gabbros is weak, but some show strong fabrics associated with plagioclase-rich zones. Water content from clinopyroxene in one highly-deformed gabbro is <1 ppm.\n(6) Paleopiezometers for olivine and plagioclase indicate stress magnitudes of 16-21 MPa for the uppermost mantle, and 0.1 MPa for the lowermost crust.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - Araragi_et_al.pdf\nDynamic and static stress changes often result in changes of seismic velocities (e.g. Brenguier et al., 2008; 2014). In Mt. Fuji volcanic region, the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake and a Mw 5.9 earthquake occurred 4 days after the Tohoku-oki earthquake radically perturbed the stress field (e.g., Kato et al., 2013; Miyazawa, 2011; Toda, et al., 2011). The area is thus an adequate location to consider the influence of stresses changes caused by two earthquakes.\nIn this study, we conducted seismic interferometry to estimate seismic velocity change following Brenguier et al. (2008) in the frequency range from 0.1 to 0.9 Hz. We used seismic data from November 2010 to October 2011 in 18 seismic stations around Mt. Fuji. While many previous studies investigated cross-correlation of the vertical-vertical component to obtain the time resolution of approximately a few days, here we attempted to improve the temporal resolution of the measurements. We calculated 9-component noise cross-correlation tensors from three-component seismic records and stacked the changes to obtain the seismic velocity change between two stations.\n\nAfter these procedure, we successfully distinguished the seismic velocity changes by the Tohoku-oki earthquake and the Mw 5.9 earthquake. Coseismic velocity drops are followed by recovery. Velocity changes are large in the station pairs crossing the vicinity of the summit of Mt. Fuji. In contrast, the velocity changes are not significant away from the summit. In addition, the seismic velocity changes by the Tohoku-Oki earthquake are larger than those by the Mw 5.9 earthquake. Since the pattern of velocity changes is not consistent with the static stress changes in the area, we interpret that these differences are due to the damage caused by the dynamic stress from the Tohoku-oki earthquake that did not yet recover by the time of the Mw 5.9 earthquake.",

            "abstract": "The identification of sedimentary records of paleotsunamis is the key to tsunami hazard assessment. However, it is often challenging to distinguish the tsunami deposits due to their variability, influence of local context, variable sediment sources, as well as postdepositional alterations. Among the most commonly used approaches to identify paleotsunami is the study of microfossils (e.g. foraminifera, diatoms). They are most commonly used to show marine origin of sediments. The common problem with microfossils in coastal settings (eg. marshes, peat bogs) is that they may not be preserved. For instance, it was found during studies on post-depositional changes of 2004 tsunami deposits and in paleotsunami deposits in Thailand that the tests composed of calcium carbonate as well as from silica have been largely dissolved with time. The rapid progress in paleogenetic studies suggests that analyses of DNA preserved in marine sediments may be a new research direction. A recent successful application of the method to the deep sea and fjord sediments, greater than 30,000 years old proved that it is possible to extract DNA and identify it from sediments that are affected by oxygenated waters and bioturbating organisms.\nHere we apply the paleogenetic studies for a series of paleotsunami deposits from Urahoro, eastern Hokkaido Island, Japan dated to be from several hundreds of years to more than 2000 years old based on tephrochronology. The sandy tsunami deposits intercalated by muddy peat contained rare diatoms of various origin but foraminifera and radiolaria tests were missing. Nevertheless, we were able to retrieve short fragments of the foraminiferal DNA from marine species using high-throughput sequencing technology. Our study provides first evidence that eukaryotic DNA can be preserved in tsunami deposits in coastal marsh environment for as long as 2000 years even in absence of any micropaleontological evidence. Thus paleoDNA analyses may provide a new useful tool to help in identification of catastrophic coastal inundations.",

            "abstract": "The process of differentiation is a defining moment in a planet’s history. Direct observation of this process at work is impossible in our solar system because it was complete within the first few tens of millions of years. Geochemical and geophysical evidence points to magma ocean scenarios to explain differentiation of large planets such as Earth. Smaller planets and planetesimals likely never achieved the high temperatures necessary for wide scale melting. In these smaller bodies, silicates may have only partially melted, or not melted at all. Furthermore, isotopic signatures in meteorites suggest that some planetesimals differentiated within just a few million years. Achieving efficient core segregation on this rapid timescale is difficult, particularly in a solid or semi-solid silicate matrix. Direct measurements of metallic melt migration velocities have been difficult due to experimental limitations and most previous work has relied on geometric models based on 2-D observations in quenched samples. We have employed a relatively new technique of in-situ, high pressure, high temperature, X-ray micro-tomography coupled with 3-D numerical simulations to evaluate the efficiency of melt percolation in metal/silicate systems. From this, we can place constraints on the timing of core formation in early solar system bodies. Mixtures of olivine and KLB-1 peridotite and up to 12 vol% FeS were pre-synthesized to achieve an initial equilibrium microstructure of silicate and sulfide. The samples were then were then pressed again to ~2GPa, and heated to ~1300°C to collect X-ray tomography images as the partially molten samples were undergoing shear deformation. The reconstructed 3-D images of melt distribution were used as the input for lattice Boltzmann simulations of fluid flow through the melt network and calculations of permeability and melt migration velocity. Our in-situ x-ray tomography results are complemented by traditional 2-D image analysis and high-resolution 3-D imaging of the starting materials and quenched samples using a focused ion beam/SEM cross beam instrument.",

As part of the endeavor seasonal climate outlook, as well as information for weather within climate may be helpful for advance planning and risk management in agriculture. The General Circulation Model (GCM) provide an alternative to gather information for weather within climate but variability is very low in comparison to observation. On the other hand, the spatial resolution of GCM predicted rainfall is not found at the observed station/grid point.\nTo tackle the problem, initially a statistical downscaling over 19 station of Odisha state is undertaken using the atmospheric parameters predicted by a GCM (NCEP-CFSv2). For the purpose, an extended domain is taken for analyzing the significant zone for the atmospheric parameters like zonal wind at 850hPa, Sea Surface Temperature (SST), geopotential height. A statistical model using the pattern projection method is further developed based on empirical orthogonal function. The downscaled rainfall is found better in association with station observation in comparison to raw GCM prediction in view of deterministic and probabilistic skill measure. Further, the sub-seasonal and seasonal forecast from the GCMs can be used at different time steps for risk management. Therefore, downscaled seasonal/monthly rainfall is further converted to sub-seasonal/daily time scale using a non-homogeneous markov model. The simulated weather sequences are further compared with the observed sequence in view of categorical rainfall events. The outcomes suggest that the rainfall amount are overestimated for excess rainfall and henceforth larger excess rainfall events can be realized. The skill for prediction of rainfall events corresponding to lower thresholds is found higher. A detail discussion regarding skill of spatial downscale rainfall at observed stations and its further representation of sub-seasonal characteristics (spells, less rainfall, heavy rainfall, and moderate rainfall events) of rainfall for disaggregated outputs will be presented.",

These N transformations could either produce or consume NO3－ and thus the HZ could serve as a NO3－sink or source in the fluvial system. The reactants within the hyporheic zone are transported through advection by flow induced by bedform topography. However, most previous studies have focused on two-dimensional (2-D) and simple bedforms. Recent studies showed that even a simple 3-D bedform would have a higher hyporheic flux and a slightly larger volume or exchange zone depth, and thus a different residence time compared to its equivalent 2-D bedform. This implies that the competition between reactant supply and demand for the 3-D bedforms might be different from 2-D bedforms. In this study we will investigate the ecological role of HZ with much more complex and more natural 3-D bedforms through numerical simulations. We are investigating synthetic but realistic complex bedforms considering the superimposition of smaller dunes upon larger dunes. The goal of the study is improve our understanding and the prediction of the ecological function of HZ as a nitrate sink or source for a natural system.",

            "abstract": "Arctic clouds play a key role in surface radiation budget and may influence sea ice and snow melting. In this study, 10-year (2004-2013) observations of cloud from Micro-Pulse Lidar (MPL) and surface longwave (LW) radiation at Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard are analyzed to investigate cloud radiative effect. The cloud fraction (CF) derived from MPL shows distinct monthly variation, having higher CF (0.90) in summer and lower CF (0.79) in winter. Downward longwave radiation (DLW) during wintertime (Nov., Dec., Jan., and Feb.) decreases as cloud base height (CBH) increases. The DLW for CBH < 1km (264.7±35.4 W m-2) is approximately 1.46 times larger than that for cloud-free (181.8±25.8 W m-2) conditions. The temperature difference (ΔT) and DLW difference (ΔDLW), which are calculated as the difference of monthly mean temperature and DLW between all-sky and cloud-free conditions, are positively correlated (R2 = 0.83). This implies that an increase of DLW may influence surface warming, which can result in snow and sea ice melting. However, dramatic changes in surface temperature, cloud and DLW are observed with a time scale of a few days. The averaged surface temperature on the presence of low-level clouds (CBH < 2km) and under cloud-free conditions are estimated to be -6.9±6.1°C and -14.5±5.7°C, respectively. The duration of low-level clouds, showing relatively high DLW and high surface temperature, is about 2.5 days. This suggests that DLW induced by low-level clouds may not have a critical effect on surface temperature rising and sea ice melting.",

            "abstract": "Ontake volcano erupted on 27th September 2014. Components in fallout samples were analyzed with microscope, XRD, and SEM-EDS. Pyrophyllite, smectite, muscovite, kaoline group minerals, quartz, cristobalite, tridymite, pyrite, alunite, gypsum and anhydrite were identified from bulk samples. Coarse ash fraction (> 125 µm) consists mainly of siliceous fragments that are intensely altered and contain pyrite and rutile. Weakly-altered dark-gray volcanic rock fragments are also contained. Fine fraction is abundant in euhedral free crystals of alunite and gypsum and aggregates of silica minerals. The 34S/32S ratios of bulk ash samples were analyzed for sulfur leached by water (water-soluble sulfate), gastric (HCl-soluble sulfate), and HNO3 (sulfide). Gastric and HNO3 leaching methods were applied to coarse fraction too. The bulk δ34SCDT compositions of water-soluble sulfate, HCl-soluble sulfate and sulfide were +14.7 ‰, +15.7 ‰, and -4.7 ‰, respectively. Those of HCl-soluble sulfate and sulfide in coarse fraction were +9.1 ‰ and -4.3 ‰, respectively. Paragenesis of quartz and pyrophyllite in single grain implies hydrothermal alteration by hot (> 230 °C), acidic fluid in the sub-volcanic system. The sulfur isotope geothermometry (Ohmoto and Rye, 1979) applied to the pair of water-soluble sulfate and bulk sulfide resulted in 306 °C. Similar temperature (ca. 296 °C) was estimated for the pair of HCl-soluble sulfate and sulfide in bulk ash. The mineralogy and sulfur isotopic study indicate that the 2014 Ontake eruption was derived from an acidic high-temperature (ca. 300 °C) sub-volcanic hydrothermal fluid. However, the estimated temperature for the pair of HCl-soluble sulfate and sulfide from coarse fraction resulted in higher temperature (ca. 482 °C). The coarse fraction preserved the past temperature record of the hydrothermal fluid, because the coarse lithic fragments were derived from pre-existing altered rocks.",

It is one of the few lakes in the tropical Andes that can provide a continuous record throughout the last glacial cycle and it is ideally situated to record long­-term variations in the South American Summer Monsoon. Lake Junín was drilled in 2015 to recover sediment cores which will provide the longest independently­-dated record of tropical water balance, glacier variability, vegetation history, and paleomagnetic secular variation for the region. We collected six cores across a NE­-SW transect to characterize the controls on sediment composition and distribution prior to drilling. The cores range from 2 to 9 m in length and each contains a complete Holocene section and glacial transition. Interglacial sediments are composed primarily of authigenic carbonates, whereas minerogenic material sourced from nearby glacial outwash fans dominates the late glacial sediment record. All cores exhibit a similar two-­component stratigraphy: an upper section of primarily whitish pink marl with intermittent light brown mud and a lower section of characteristic light gray glacial flour. Magnetic susceptibility data show that the carbonate/clastic contact deepens from NE to SW, and the thickness of the upper carbonate section displays a significant positive correlation with distance from the NE shore. Quantification of Holocene carbonate sediment dynamics in Lake Junín will facilitate more accurate interpretation of their stratigraphic significance in the longer sediment record.",

            "abstract": "Hydrofracturing associated with elevated fluid pressure coupled with changes in stress has been crucial in enhancing the production and recovery of hydrocarbons. Furthermore, it is also an important issue to access the efficiency and stability of long-term CO2 geologic storage reservoirs. Veins are mineral-filled extension fractures developed along the plane of σ1-σ2 and perpendicular to σ3, and the fluid pressure must exceed σ3applied to the plane when the vein opens. Therefore, vein is a well-known natural analogue for fluid migration in a paleo-reservoir. In the Salt Wash Graben of SE Utah, CO2-charged vein systems hosted in the bleached Entrada Formation are well developed and examined to understand the conditions of fluid pressure and stress during the injections of CO2-charged fluid. Based on color and relative cross-cutting relationship in the field, veins are subdivided into two sets; sub-vertical black mineral-rich veins and orthogonal calcite veins that have previously been described as ‘grid-lock fractures’. The vein distribution and fluid leakage along through-going fractures in mechanic units allow us to determine the stress regime and driving stress condition through 3D-Mohr circle reconstruction. The results of this statistical analysis for the veins show that the orthogonal veins indicate a ‘stress transition’ with maximum principal stress direction changing from vertical to NNW-SSE sub-horizontal which coincides with the current regional stress regime. The possible causes of the stress transition can be considered. The process of repeated sealing, reactivation and localization of veins within the bleached zone is a natural indication of a coupled change in pore pressure and stress in the reservoir. Thus, an understanding of the effect of stress changes due to the volumetric injection of CO2 in the subsurface as well as a knowledge of how pre-existing fractures affect fluid flow with respect to elevated pore pressures in layered rocks are important for reservoir characterization and efficient site selection of geologic CO2 storage in the subsurface.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU-Sridhara P.pdf\nA series of experimental studies over the last decade have reviewed the feasibility of using CO2 or CO2+N2 gas mixtures to recover CH4 gas from hydrates deposits. That technique would serve the dual purpose of CO2 sequestration and production of CH4 while maintaining the geo-mechanical stability of the reservoir. In order to analyze CH4 production process by means of CO2 or CO2+N2 injection into gas hydrate reservoirs, a new simulation tool, Mix3HydrateResSim (Mix3HRS)[1], was previously developed to account for the complex thermodynamics of multi-component hydrate phase and to predict the process of CH4 substitution by CO2 (and N2) in the hydrate lattice.\nIn this work, Mix3HRS is used to simulate the CO2 injection into a Class 2 hydrate accumulation characterized by a mobile aqueous phase underneath a hydrate bearing sediment. That type of hydrate reservoir is broadly confirmed in permafrost and along seashore. The production technique implies a two-stage approach using a two-well design, one for an injector and one for a producer. First, the CO2 is injected into the mobile aqueous phase to convert it into immobile CO2 hydrate and to initiate CH4 release from gas hydrate across the hydrate-water boundary (generally designating the onset of a hydrate stability zone). Second, CH4 hydrate decomposition is induced by the depressurization method at a producer to estimate gas production potential over 30 years. The conversion of the free water phase into the CO2 hydrate significantly reduces competitive water production in the second stage, thereby improving the methane gas production. A base case using only the depressurization stage is conducted to compare with enhanced gas production predicted by the CO2-assisted technique. The approach also offers a possibility to permanently store carbon dioxide in the underground formation to greater extent comparing to a direct injection of CO2 into gas hydrate sediment. Numerical models are based on the hydrate formations at the Prudhoe Bay L-Pad region on the Alaska North Slope.\n",

To better understand the environment of this region, We utilizes the available lunar topography, image and geology data with high resolution(in meters), as well as image data captured by the landing camera and topography camera on CE-3(in centimeters) to analyze the topography, landforms, geology and lunar dust from perspectives ranging from large spatial areas(hundreds of kilometers like Sinus Iridum and North Mare Imbrium, 45×75 km) to a smaller scale of kilometers near the landing site(4×4 km) and finally to the immediate area around the landing site in meters. We can find that:1)The probe landed on a flat lunar mare with an elevation of -2615m. The landing site is high titanium basalt stratum, and its geological age is young Eratoshenian. 10km to the north of the landing site is the older Mare Imbrium stratum, and the location of the landing site is in the area that is the intersection of these two strata; 2)The landing site lies on the edge of a plateau in a flat plain with a declining trend from west to east, and the topographic slope and waviness of the area are low, which is typical for terrain in lunar mare; 3)The adjacent area of the landing point is flat terrain, with landforms such as craters, domes, strata and rocks with different albedos, which are good targets for scientific exploration; 4)By comparing images captured before and after landing, we find that during the landing process of CE-3, lots of lunar dust was blown away by the engine plume, and the scope of influence is about 60m from east to west and 135m from south to north. Thus, this leads to a redistribution of lunar dust and changes in space weathering on the lunar surface.",

The slow doubling rate represents growth likely experienced in the subsurface. The chemostats were fed formate as an electron donor and trichloroethene (TCE) as the terminal electron acceptor. Under excess formate conditions, stable operation was observed with respect to TCE transformation, steady-state hydrogen (H2) concentrations (40 nM), and the structure of the dehalogenating community. Both cultures completely transformed TCE to ethene, with minor amounts of vinyl chloride (VC) observed, along with acetate formation. When formate was limited, TCE was transformed incompletely to ethene (40-60%) and VC (60- 40%), and H2 concentrations ranged from 1 to 3 nM. The acetate concentration dropped below detection. Batch kinetic studies of TCE transformation with chemostat harvested cells found transformation rates of c-DCE and VC were greatly reduced when the cells were grown with limited formate. Upon increasing formate addition to the chemostats, from limited to excess, essentially complete transformation of TCE to ethene was achieved. The increase in formate was associated with an increase in H2 concentration and the production of acetate. Results of batch kinetic tests showed increases in transformation rates for TCE and c-DCE by factors of 3.5 and 2.5, respectively, while VC rates increased by factors of 33 to 500, over a six month period. Molecular analysis of chemostat samples is being performed to quantify the changes in copy numbers of reductase genes and to determine whether shifts in the strains of Dehalococcoides mccartyi where responsible for the observed rate increases. The results demonstrate the importance of electron donor supply for successful in-situ remediation.",

It is proximal to the Salmon River suture zone, the Cretaceous-age western margin of North America that juxtaposes accreted terranes to the west and cratonic North America to the east. We applied (U-Th)/He zircon and apatite thermochronometry to samples along an EW transect across Hells Canyon. (U-Th)/He zircon and apatite ages record the time at which rocks cool below ~ 200 and 60 °C, respectively, providing information on both the timing and rate at which rocks cooled. Samples were collected with respect to structural position relative to the basal Columbia River basalt flow (Imnaha), dated at ~ 17.4 Ma, with most samples taken <100 m below the contact. Given that all localities were at the Earth’s surface - and thus cooled below 60˚C - at ~ 17.4 Ma, the variation in obtained ages are assessed relative to this common datum.\nThe easternmost sites were taken on the western margin of the Idaho batholith at Lava Buttes, ID at ~2,700 m elevation: The (U-Th)/He zircon and apatite ages are 64.9±4.6 Ma and 53.8±4.9 Ma, respectively. The westernmost sites occur in the Wallowa Mountains, Oregon, where the base of the Imnaha flow exists at ~3,000 m: The (U-Th)/He zircon and apatite ages are 136.2±42.8 Ma and 21.7±10.0 Ma. Additionally, the basal basalt contact occurs at ~900 m and ~600 m at the bottom of the Salmon River Canyon and Hells Canyon respectively.

The data indicate that: 1) The western Wallowa (accreted) terrane cooled below ~200 °C prior to the formation of the Idaho batholith; 2) The western side of the Idaho batholith shows a rapid and consistent cooling between ~200 °C and ~60 °C in the Paleogene; and 3) Samples at low elevation in Hells Canyon cooled below 60˚C in the Pliocene, which requires reburial of the rocks after deposition of the basal portions of the Miocene Columbia River basalts.

The resultant time varying electric fields at Earth’s surface drive very low frequency, currents through electricity supply transformers which reduces transforming capacity. In extreme cases, electricity supply grids can collapse as multiple transformers are affected. GICs have larger magnitudes at auroral latitudes and should be related to the field aligned current (FAC) and auroral ionosphere currents systems. At ground locations under the regions between upward and downward FACs, the GIC related fields show a direct relationship with the time derivative of the FACs. This allows a conversion factor between FAC and GIC magnitudes. Examples of the relationship between FAC and GIC related fields are presented using data derived from the Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) and SuperMAG.",

Such analyses are needed to inform policy recommendations that minimize potential conflicts between conservation and RE development. We use the state of California’s rapid development of utility-scale RE as a case study to examine how possible land use constraints impact the total electricity land area, areas with conservation value, water use, and electricity cost of ambitious RE portfolios. We developed the Optimal Renewable energy Build-out (ORB) model, and used it in conjunction with the Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) Calculator, a RE procurement and transmission planning tool used by utilities within California, to generate environmentally constrained renewable energy potential and assess the cost and siting-associated impacts of wind, solar photovoltaic, concentrating solar power (CSP), and geothermal technologies. We find that imposing environmental constraints on RE development achieves lower conservation impacts and results in development of more fragmented land areas. With increased RE and environmental exclusions, generation becomes more widely distributed across the state, which results in more development on herbaceous agricultural vegetation, grasslands, and developed & urban land cover types. We find land use efficiencies of RE technologies are relatively inelastic to changes in environmental constraints, suggesting that cost-effective substitutions that reduce environmental impact and achieve RE goals is possible under most scenarios and exclusion categories. At very high RE penetration that is limited to in-state development, cost effectiveness decreases substantially under the highest level of environmental constraint due to the over-reliance on solar technologies. This additional cost is removed once the in-state constraint is lifted, suggesting that minimizing both negative conservation impacts and electricity costs at very high RE penetration will require California to utilize a combination of in-state and out-of-state RE resources.",

            "abstract": "The bioerosion of coastal limestones and biogenic carbonates by boring filamentous or pseudo-filamentous cyanobacteria is not only a geomicrobial phenomenon of global proportions, but also plays an important role in the demise of coral reefs, and affects significantly human enterprises like bivalve fisheries. In spite of its importance, the mechanism by which cyanobacteria excavate carbonates constitutes an apparent paradox, in that their metabolism will tend to precipitate carbonates, not dissolved them. We have previously advanced, and obtained evidence for, a mechanism of excavation that relies on the uptake of Ca2+ by cells at the boring front, its trans-cellular transport along the filaments, and its eventual active excretion at the solid/liquid interface. It was postulated that the mechanism involved the strategically organized deployment of Ca2+ transport enzymes like P-type Ca2+ ATPases and Ca2+ channels. Here we present evidence that confirms this basic mechanism, but also reveals that it is based on an unexpected level of cellular complexity. The model organism Mastigocoleus testarum BC008, transports Ca2+ from the mineral to the external medium using a repetitive, polar arrangement of Ca2+ ATPases, localized preferentially on one cellular pole, in a ring conformation on the cell membrane adjacent to the trans-cellular septum, pumping Ca2+ locally towards the periplasmic space, from which it passively enters the next cell. This strain also develops specialized groups of cells, which we named calcicytes, often but not exclusively located at the ends of filaments, that accumulate large concentrations of Ca2+, some 40-fold higher than typical in microbes, and seem to act as sinks or capacitors in the trans-cellular Ca2+ transport. Calcicytes are also characterized by a lack of photosynthetic pigments, and a very high intracellular pH. These cellular adaptations can also be found in evolutionary distant euendoliths such as the pseudofilamentous Hyella sp.",

This earthquake resulted in ~1.4 m of coastal uplift, accompanied by inland subsidence. The focal mechanism of the earthquake indicated motion along a low-angle, east-dipping thrust plane, consistent with the subduction zone interface or a subsidiary fault. If the earthquake occurred on the megathrust itself, we might expect that high strain rates resulting from Gorda/North American plate convergence would cause measurable vertical interseismic deformation in the 23 years since the event. Along other subduction zones with historic ruptures, large amounts of deformation had occurred within 10-50 years after the mainshock, resulting in crustal recovery in a direction opposite that of the coseismic deformation. However, a subsidiary fault would not accumulate strain as quickly, thus little to no vertical deformation should be observed after just 23 years. Using high resolution static GPS relocation of benchmarks and comparing these positions to the 1992 leveling elevations, we have found that there has been little to no vertical deformation since the leveling in 1992. These results indicate that the 1992 event was likely not a subduction zone rupture but rather occurred along a low strain rate subsidiary fault.",

            "abstract": "Hydraulic fracturing has revolutionized the U.S.’s energy portfolio by making shale reservoirs productive and commercially viable. However, the public is concerned that the chemical constituents in hydraulic fracturing fluid, produced water, or natural gas itself could potentially impact groundwater or adjacent streams. Here, we conduct fate and transport simulations of surface spills, the most likely contamination pathway to occur during oil and gas production operations, to evaluate whether or not these spills pose risks to groundwater quality. We focus on the South Platte Alluvial Aquifer, which is located in the greater Denver metro area and overlaps a zone of high-density oil and gas development. The purpose of this work is to assess the mobility and persistence of chemical contaminants (e.g. biocides, friction reducers, surfactants, hydrocarbons, etc.) —based on sorption to soil, degradation potential, co-contaminant interactions, and spill conditions—and to understand the site characteristics and hydrologic conditions that would make a particular location prone to groundwater quality degradation in the event of an accidental release. We propose a coupled analytical-numerical approach that could be duplicated by environmental consultants. Results suggest that risk of groundwater pollution, based on predicted concentration at the groundwater table, is low in most areas of the South Platte system for the contaminants investigated under common spill conditions. However, substantial risk may exist in certain areas where the groundwater table is shallow. In addition, transport of certain contaminants is influenced by interactions with other constituents in produced or stimulation fluids. By helping to identify locations in the Front Range of Colorado that are at low or high risk for groundwater contamination due to a surface spill, it is our hope that this work will aid in improving prevention, mitigation, and remediation practices so that decision-makers can be better prepared to address accidental releases in Colorado.",

Currently, two principal modelling approaches are used to estimate terrestrial CO2 exchange: top-down and bottom-up approaches (e.g., CO2 inversions and ecosystem model simulations, respectively). Since the early 2000s, the research community has invested substantial effort in the development of bottom-up and top-down CO2 exchange estimations; however, current estimates of terrestrial CO2 exchange by the two approaches remain inconsistent. To overcome this issue, we adopted more data-driven methods for both top-down and bottom-up approaches: specifically, integration of a global coverage of column averaged CO2 concentration by the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) to CO2 inversion, and empirical upscaling of eddy flux observations by support vector regression. In this study, we focused on biosphere flux, net CO2 exchange resulted only from natural vegetation (no fire and fossil fuel emissions), and referred fluxes estimated by the two methods as GOSAT and SVR biosphere fluxes, respectively.\nWe evaluated seasonal variability of biosphere fluxes estimated by these two methods at 42 terrestrial regions, and found consistent results in the northern mid-high latitudes. Meanwhile, the two biosphere fluxes differed largely in magnitude of seasonal variability in tropical regions; SVR biosphere flux tended toward strong CO2 sink than GOSAT biosphere flux. Despite the large offset in magnitude, however, seasonal patterns (in the form of anomaly) were similar even in the tropical regions. This result implies that current data-driven methods are limited in producing consistent CO2 budget, but they can still produce consistent seasonal patterns of CO2 exchange. Consistency in seasonal pattern between the two methods further suggests that reliable trends of interannual variability may be inferred by the data-driven methods.",

Western SLP and adjacent parts of TIC are affected by the Steelhead Lake  Shear Zone (SLSZ), with leucogranitic dikes, abundant qz-tm veins, ductile epidote-chlorite alteration, and massive qz veins. While TIC shows uniform stable isotope values, isotope studies of other Sierra Nevada pendants evidence diversity of fluid sources: Jurassic seawater, Cretaceous magmatic fluids, metamorphic fluids, and meteoric-hydrothermal fluids. We conducted a stable isotope study of 49 samples from units across the SLSZ, focusing on the shear zone. Unlike other pendants, both δ18 O and δD values from SLSZ showed great variability, and most samples were not in isotopic equilibrium. Overall, δ18 O mineral values ranged from –1.5‰(plag) to +15.8‰(bt); mineral δD values ranged from –140‰(tm) to –67‰(bt). TIC δ18 O was +7.8 to +10.0 (plag) and +4.8 to +9.2 (tm), normal magmatic values, and δD were –105 to –75. Paleozoic and Triassic metasedimentary units had most qz δ18 O from +11.3 to +15.8, so within metamorphic range, and δD from –100 to –72 (ep and tm). Jurassic metasedimentary units (Sawmill) and Triassic metavolcanics (Koip) had largest isotopic variability: δ18 O qz from +8.1 to +14.8, plag from –1.1 to +11.8, but ep and tm between +1.3 and +9.3 and δD between –108 and –81. All lower (submagmatic) isotopic values were from a wider, possibly transtensional, part of the SLSZ, transected by Sawmill Canyon. Although TIC and many of the Paleozoic units do not show isotopic evidence for alteration, the Koip and Sawmill units were likely infiltrated by later magmatic waters, and then subjected to very localized meteoric water infiltration in the area surrounding Sawmill Canyon.\n ",

            "abstract": "The South American subduction zone is characterized by its along-strike variation from flat to steeply dipping slabs. Both formation mechanisms and geometry of flat slabs in South America remain unclear. To evaluate the relative contribution of different mechanisms to flat slab formation, we simulate the post-100 Ma subduction history below South America using 3-D geodynamic models by progressively incorporating key tectonic features including seafloor ages, buoyant oceanic crusts, thickened oceanic plateaus (i.e. the Inca plateau, Nazca Ridge and Juan Fernandez Ridge), continental cratons, as well as deformable trench profiles according to recent geological reconstructions. With a uniform seafloor age of 30 Ma (i.e., the spatial average of the Nazca Plate since 20 Ma), we get steep (>30°, measured at 200 km depth) subduction everywhere except at 25°S -35°S, where the slab dip is affected by earlier subduction at depth. With the actual reconstructed seafloor ages, the slab dip angle is systematically reduced with an average of ~25°; the long-wavelength lateral variation of slab dip angle that resembles the observation results from the spatial variation of slab buoyancy and strength. The addition of a uniformly thick overriding plate, with enhanced dynamic suction in the mantle wedge, further reduces the slab dip angle (<23°) along the entire trench, where the young slab portions are affected more than the old one. Realization of the 3D geometry of cratonic roots enhances along-trench variation of suction force, which results in an additional reduction of slab dip (<20°), especially next to the cratons. While dynamic suction from the overriding plate reduces the long-wavelength slab dip angle, subducting oceanic plateau and aseismic ridges lead to more localized flat-slabs (as low as 15°) as observed. The subduction of aseismic ridges also generates tears within the flat slabs, due to the accumulation of strain at the down-dip end of the ridge. These slab tears are spatially correlated with the absence of seismicity inside the slab. These slab tears may be responsible for the observed adakitic magmatism through slab melting. Our model also suggests a partially molten asthenosphere beneath these tears with eclogites formed on top from solidified melts, and these predictions are consistent with recent seismic images.",

            "abstract": "Estimating actual evapotranspiration (ETa) spatial variability in orchards is key when trying to quantify water (and associated nutrients) leaching, both with the mass balance and inverse modeling methods. ETa measurements however generally occur at larger scales (e.g. Eddy-covariance method) or have a limited quantitative accuracy. In this study we propose to establish a statistical relation between field ETa and field averaged variables known to be closely related to it, such as stem water potential (WP), soil water storage (WS) and ETc. For that we use 4 years of soil and almond trees water status data to train artificial neural networks (ANNs) predicting field scale ETa and downscale the relation to the individual tree scale. ANNs composed of only two neurons in a hidden layer (11 parameters on total) proved to be the most accurate (overall RMSE = 0.0246 mm/h, R2 = 0.944), seemingly because adding more neurons generated overfitting of noise in the training dataset. According to the optimized weights in the best ANNs, the first hidden neuron could be considered in charge of relaying the ETc information while the other one would deal with the water stress response to stem WP, soil WS, and ETc. As individual trees had specific signatures for combinations of these variables, variability was generated in their ETa responses. The relative canopy cover was the main source of variability of ETa while stem WP was the most influent factor for the ETa / ETc ratio. Trees on drip-irrigated side of the orchard appeared to be less affected by low estimated soil WS in the root zone than on the fanjet micro-sprinklers side, possibly due to a combination of (i) more substantial root biomass increasing the plant hydraulic conductance, (ii) bias in the soil WS estimation due to soil moisture heterogeneity on the drip-side, and (iii) the access to deeper water resource. Tree scale ETa responses are in good agreement with soil-plant water relations reported in the literature, and well supported by an independent analysis of the soil water balance on the same site, which is encouraging for the future use of ANNs in the context of ETa downscaling.",

            "abstract": "We used the Canopy Trimming Experiment (CTE), an ongoing ecosystem manipulation study in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF), Puerto Rico to determine the decadal-scale effects of canopy disturbance and debris deposition on biogeochemistry throughout the soil profile of a wet tropical forest. These manipulations represent the most significant effects of hurricanes, which may increase in frequency or intensity with warming, strengthening their ecosystem-level effects on carbon (C) and nutrient cycling. Four replicated treatments were applied in 2005 using a complete randomized block design: canopy trimming + debris deposition, canopy trimming only, debris deposition only, and untreated control. In 2015, we sampled soils at 10 cm intervals to 1 m depth in each of 12 plots (3 per treatment). We measured gravimetric moisture content, pH, HCl and citrate-ascorbate (CA) extractable iron (Fe) species, organic (Po) and inorganic fractions of NaHCO3 and NaOH phosphorus (P), as well as total C and nitrogen (N). Soil moisture decreased markedly with depth up to ~60-70 cm, and then stabilized at ~33% down to 1 m. Across all treatments, pH increased significantly with depth, ranging from 4.6 in surface soils (0-10 cm) of trimmed plots to 5.2 in deep soils (80-90 cm) of control plots. Canopy trimming decreased pH significantly, possibly due to increased root activity in surface soils as vegetation recovered. Both HCl and CA extractable Fe showed strong depth dependance, decreasing linearly to 50 cm, and stabilizing at very low concentrations (<0.2 mg/g) down to 1 m. Inorganic P concentrations were low and did not vary significantly with depth. The majority of P was associated with organic matter, with significantly higher values in the upper soil profile (<50 cm). Debris deposition significantly increased Po, revealing the role of hurricanes in subsidizing the available soil P pool in these highly productive, low-P wet tropical forests. Debris deposition also increased soil C and N concentrations in surface soils (<20 cm). Our results suggest that the dominant effects of disturbance are limited to the upper soil profile in this wet tropical forest. However, effects were persistent and detectable after ten years of the CTE, suggesting that hurricanes result in long-term changes in tropical forest biogeochemistry.",

Productivity is controlled mostly by seasonal upwelling starting in fall (early November) and extending into spring. We are currently analyzing δ18Odiatom from a boxcore (BC-43) using microfluorination (Menicucci, et al. 2013). This boxcore was previously analyzed for UK '37 alkenones and 210Pb activity (Goni, et al. 2001). Residual BC-43 material was sampled at ~2cm intervals. Samples were cleaned to isolate diatoms from other sediments, then equilibrated in water with δ18Owater = +85‰ for 70 hours at 21oC prior to vacuum dehydroxylation and microfluorination. The latter equilibration was done to account for fractionation between covalently bound O and OH- groups during vacuum dehydroxylation, preserving the original δ18Odiatom value.\nWe present δ18Odiatom data from BC-43 samples covering 27cm, equivalent to >225 years of sediment accumulation. δ18O data are converted to temperature (T) based on an existing calibration (Leclerc and Labeyrie 1987). Our data suggest δ18Odiatom values record a T range of 22-18oC, corresponding to the mixed layer depth and the chlorophyll maximum during the fall bloom. These T values are offset from SST data by a mean of 5oC for the same sample intervals. However, δ18Odiatom values from the most recent samples suggest a ~2oC increase in diatom T relative to SST during the last 35 years. This subsurface warming may be due to decreased fall upwelling, increased mixed layer and chlorophyll maximum depths, and/or the timing of the peak diatom bloom. Such correlations are being investigated and the latest results will be presented.\nGoni, M. A., et al. (2001).

Here we argue that large vapor chambers are unnecessary, and that a liquid-filled crack 1 meter wide extending along the 500 km length of the tiger stripes would be an adequate source (right figure). We consider controlled boiling (companion paper by Nakajima and Ingersoll 2015AGU) regulated by friction between the gas and the walls. Postberg et al use formulas from Rayleigh-Benard convection, which we argue does not apply when bubbles are transferring their latent heat across the liquid-gas interface. We show that modest convection currents in the liquid (few cm/s) can supply energy to the boiling zone and prevent it from freezing.\nHedman et al (2013) reported brightness variations with orbital phase, but they also reported that their 2005 observations were roughly 50% higher than the 2009 observations. Here we extend the observation period to 2015 (Ingersoll and Ewald 2015). Our analysis relies on ISS images whereas Hedman et al rely on VIMS near-IR images, which have 40 times lower resolution. We successfully separate the brightness of the plume from the E-ring background. Our earlier analysis of the particle size distribution (Ingersoll and Ewald 2011) allows us to correct for differences in scattering angle. We confirm a general decline in activity over the 10-year period, but we find hints of fluctuations on shorter time scales.\nKempf (Cassini project science meeting, Jan 22, 2015) reported that the mass of particles in the plumes could be an order of magnitude less than that reported by Ingersoll and Ewald (2011). Kempf used in situ particle measurements by CDA, whereas I&E used brightness observations and the assumption that the particles are solid ice. Here we show (Gao et al 2015AGU) that fractal aggregates fit the brightness data just as well as solid ice, and are consistent with the lower mass reported by Kempf.",

The residual saturation measured (SCO2,r = 12%) was significantly lower than in an analogue strongly water-wet plug (SCO2,r = 35%). The residual CO2 was split into many small disconnected clusters, and the cluster size distributions followed a power law correlation, similar to those reported for water-wet rock. However, the CO2 was more frequently located in smaller pores than in the analogue water-wet case. On the μCT images we were able to measure scCO2-water interfacial areas and capillary pressures of each CO2 bubble in-situ. These capillary pressures (Pc) showed a distribution function which ranged from -1 MPa to +1 MPa, and peaked at Pc = 0. This variation in Pc will influence the mass transfer process (of CO2 into water) as it changes the chemical potential; but it is clear that the interfacial areas are large and thus provide a good basis for dissolution trapping.\nOverall we conclude that oil-wet storage rock has a significantly lower capillary trapping capacity, although we still observed residual CO2 at the pore-scale.",

Expansion phase onset began at 06:04 UT at which time three midlatitude SuperDARN radars observed strong pulsations in the Pi2 frequency range with peak to peak amplitude reaching as high as 1km/s. Similar pulsations occurred during a later auroral intensification which started at 06:20 UT. Both sets of pulsations were detected in a region of radar backscatter located inside the subauroral polarization stream (SAPS) equatorward of the auroral oval specified by THEMIS all sky imagers and inside the midlatitude density trough as mapped by GPS/TEC measurements. The amplitude of the pulsations was large enough to reverse the direction of the SAPS flow from westward to eastward. Similar pulsations were detected by electric field instrument aboard the THEMIS probe D located inside the plasmasphere. Simultaneous observations from several low-latitude ground magnetometers (some located on the dayside) further illustrate the global nature of the pulsations and suggest they may have been associated with a plasmaspheric cavity resonance (PCR). Pulsed tailward plasma flow observed by THEMIS probe E at the geosynchronous orbit suggests that the compressional energy to generate the PCR was from the Bursty Bulk Flows (BBFs) braking against the magnetospheric dipolar region.",

            "abstract": "The HadGEM2 earth system climate model was used to assess the impact of biomass burning on surface ozone concentrations over the Amazon forest and its impact on vegetation, under present-day climate conditions. Here we consider biomass burning emissions from wildfires, deforestation fires, agricultural forest burning, and residential and commercial combustion. Simulated surface ozone concentration is evaluated against observations taken at two sites in the Brazilian Amazon forest for years 2010 to 2012. The model is able to reproduce the observed diurnal cycle of surface ozone mixing ratio at the two sites, but overestimates the magnitude of the monthly averaged hourly measurements by 5–15 ppb for each available month at one of the sites. We vary biomass burning emissions over South America by ± 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100% to quantify the modelled impact of biomass burning on surface ozone concentrations and ozone damage on vegetation productivity over the Amazon forest. We used the ozone damage scheme in the “high” sensitivity mode to give an upper limit for this effect. Decreasing South American biomass burning emissions by 100% (i.e. to zero) reduces surface ozone concentrations (by about 15 ppb during the biomass burning season) and suggests a 15% increase in monthly mean net primary productivity averaged over the Amazon forest, with local increases up to 60 %. The simulated impact of ozone damage from present-day biomass burning on vegetation productivity is about 230 TgC yr-1. Taking into account that uncertainty in these estimates is substantial, this ozone damage impact over the Amazon forest is of the same order of magnitude as the release of carbon dioxide due to fire in South America; in effect it potentially doubles the impact of biomass burning on the carbon cycle.",

However, most of the schemes produced a higher frequency of larger raindrops than observed.

We researched shear-wave splitting to obtain seismic image in the central part of Japan by the use of the seismic stations at the temporary seismic network and Hi-net. The deep earthquakes which occurred from 2009 to 2014 were used.\nThe results suggested remarkable lateral variation of the polarization directions. In the northeast of the fault area, the data showed NE-SW polarization directions. In the south of the fault area, the polarization direction was E-W. Those data were consistent with the results of previous researches of the area. However, the polarization directions around the 1891 Nobi earthquake were NW-SE. The data with spatially high dense network figured out fine scale lateral variation of polarization directions. The time delays of the splitting were larger than 0.5 sec. The crustal anisotropy had been studied in the area. The maximum crustal anisotropy in the area was around 0.1 sec. The large anisotropic area should be located in the mantle wedge.\nThe polarization direction in the northeastern part of the research area can be explained by the anisotropy which is caused by mantle flow related to the subduction of Philippine Sea plate. The polarization direction in the southern part of the research area can be explained by the mantle anisotropy caused by the flow related to the subduction of Pacific plate. The polarization direction with NW-SE, which was observed at the source area of the 1891 Nobi earthquake, is not consistent with both of the directions of the subducting oceanic plates. In the area, low velocity zone and high conductive zone were detected above the subducting slab. The zone characterized as low velocity and high conductivity seems to be related to the fluid dehydrated from slab. The observed large shear-wave splitting might be caused by the heterogeneous structure related to the fluid or magma.",

With tritium values below detection limits in terminal glacier ice, values between 1 and 5 Tritium Units (TU) in spring water, and greater than 3 TU but declining with elevation in the Langtang River, the role of glacier melt in river hydrology can be compared to that estimated using oxygen-18 values in two component mixing models. Tritium results suggest that oxygen-18 mixing model results over-estimate glacier ice contributions to river discharge.",

            "abstract": "Many coastal and inland waterways are dominated by muddy sediments; typically a mixture of clay minerals and various types of organic matter. When cohesive sediment is entrained into suspension, the particles tend to flocculate. Flocs are less dense, but faster settling than their constituent particles thus affecting their depositional characteristics. As flocs grow their effective densities generally decrease, but their settling rates rise due to a Stokes’ Law relationship. Flocculation effects become even more complex when purely cohesive sediments are mixed with different ratios of non-cohesive sediments, and the amount of biological activity changes, i.e. affecting the resultant cohesion. Developing instrumentation that can provide key physical and dynamical data on depositional rates of flocculating sediments is extremely important in advancing our understanding of natural flocculation processes. The data need to be both qualitative and quantitative, as the latter improves our understanding of the depositional and aggregational physical processes through parameterization.\nThis presentation will demonstrate recent advances in the study of the flocculation process through the use of video image technology. One such device pioneered at HR Wallingford, and implemented with co-authors, is the high resolution floc video camera, LabSFLOC – Laboratory Spectral Flocculation Characteristics (developed by Prof. Manning). LabSFLOC can observe floc spectral physical properties, including: floc size, settling velocity, effective density, porosity, shape, mass, and settling flux (using controlled volume referencing). These data are highly desirable for sediment transport modelers. Examples of floc measurements from locations in estuaries, tidal lagoons, river deltas, and lakes from locations across the USA will be presented. In addition, we will demonstrate how video floc data can be used to parameterize floc settling characteristics for use in modeling.",

            "abstract": "Cholera outbreaks can be classified in three forms– epidemic (sudden or seasonal outbreaks), endemic (recurrence and persistence of the disease for several consecutive years) and mixed-mode endemic (combination of certain epidemic and endemic conditions) with significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Endemic cholera is related to floods and droughts in regions where water and sanitation infrastructure are inadequate or insufficient. With more than a decade of terrestrial water storage (TWS) data obtained from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), understanding dynamics of river discharge is now feasible. We explored lead-lag relationships between TWS in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna (GBM) basin and endemic cholera in Bangladesh. Since bimodal seasonal peaks in cholera in Bangladesh occur during the spring and autumn season, two separate models, between TWS and disease time series (2002 to 2010) were developed. TWS, hence water availability, showed an asymmetrical, strong association with spring (τ=-0.53; p<0.001) and autumn (τ=0.45; p<0.001) cholera prevalence up to five to six months in advance. One unit (cm of water) decrease in water availability in the basin increased odds of above normal cholera by 24% [confidence interval (CI) 20-31%; p<0.05] in the spring season, while an increase in regional water by one unit, through floods, increased odds of above average cholera in the autumn by 29% [CI:22-33%; p<0.05]. Epidemic cholera is related with warm temperatures and heavy rainfall. Using TRMM data for several locations in Asia and Africa, probability of cholera increases 18% [CI:15-23%; p<0.05] after heavy precipitation resulted in a societal conditions where access to safe water and sanitation was disrupted. Results from mechanistic modeling framework using systems approach that include satellite based hydroclimatic information with tradition disease transmission models will also be presented.",

As researchers begin to assess the safety of coastal infrastructures, proper assessment of tsunami-induced forces on coastal structures is critical. Hydrodynamic forces on these structures are fundamentally proportional to the local momentum flux of the fluid, and experimental data included momentum flux measurements at many instrumented gauge locations. The GeoClaw tsunami model, which solves the two-dimensional shallow water equations, was compared against other codes during the benchmarking workshop, and more recently a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model using the open-source OpenFOAM software has been developed and results from this model are being compared with both the experimental data and the 2D GeoClaw results. In addition, the 3D model allows for computation of fluid forces on the faces of structures, permitting an investigation of the common use of momentum flux as a proxy for these forces. This work aims to assess the potential to apply these momentum flux predictions locally within the model to determine tsunami-induced forces on critical structures. Difficulties in working with these data sets and cross-model comparisons will be discussed. Ultimately, application of the more computationally efficient GeoClaw model, informed by the 3D OpenFOAM models, to predict forces on structures at the community scale can be expected to improve the safety and resilience of coastal communities.",

            "abstract": "Plutonic rocks in the western Alaska Range were emplaced prior to, during, and after accretion of the Wrangellia Composite Terrane (WCT) to the southern Alaska margin (locally, Farewell terrane, FT). Docking between (mostly) oceanic WCT and (mostly) Paleozoic continental FT was done largely by ca. 80 Ma on the basis of youngest detrital zircon ages from an overlapping flysch basin and the oldest post-deformational plutons. Plutons before and during progressive basin closure and terrane accretion (~100-76 Ma) were emplaced in WCT basement or proximal to the WCT–FT margin, are calcalkaline diorite to granite, and likely products of the migrating arc associated with closure of the intervening ocean basin. Plutons emplaced after 76 Ma are organized axially and cross into both sides of the inferred suture zone, suggesting an association with faults formed during crustal shortening and transcurrent deformation. These Late Cretaceous gabbro to granodiorite plutons have arc to collisional affinity, some with “adakitic” compositions, possibly due to crustal thickening associated with WCT collision. In contrast, younger Paleocene plutons are spatially scattered and widespread fractionated granites. Hf isotopes and U/Pb ages were measured in zircons from ~110 to ~30 Ma plutons by LA-ICPMS using the split-stream configuration. Maximum eHf decreases gradually over time (+15 to +12) suggesting either more enriched mantle or an increasing role of crustal components in the melt source and/or during magma ascent and emplacement. However, most Late Cretaceous and a subset of Paleocene plutons have anomalously low eHf (+6 to –2). Paleocene granite isotopes correlate with location and basement type; plutons emplaced in Paleozoic basement have lower eHf compared with those in Mesozoic basement. This pattern, most extreme in Paleocene plutons, is also seen in Cretaceous to Eocene plutons where similar-aged rocks were emplaced in both domains, suggesting strong basement control on Hf isotopes. Peak zircon Th content in the Late Cretaceous indicates a significant role for mature sediment, and apparent isotopic correlation with basement suggests a crustal origin of the sediment. However, correlations between sediment signatures, collisional and adakitic affinities, and low eHf suggest this component is added at depth.",

Climate change, including abrupt shifts and fluctuations in precipitation is an important factor influencing hydrological extreme conditions. In addition, human activities are widely recognized as another reasons leading to high flood risk. With the effects of climate change and human interventions on hydrological cycle, there are several questions that need to be addressed. Are floods in the Xiang River basin getting worse? Whether the extreme streamflow shows an increasing tendency? If so, is it because the extreme rainfall events have predominant effect on floods? To answer these questions, the article detected existing trends in extreme precipitation and discharge using Mann-Kendall test. Continuous wavelet transform method was employed to identify the consistency of changes in extreme precipitation and discharge. The Pearson correlation analysis was applied to investigate how much degree of variations in extreme discharge can be explained by climate change. The results indicate that slightly upward trends can be detected in both extreme rainfalls and discharge in the upper region of Xiang River basin. For the most area of middle and lower river basin, the extreme rainfalls show significant positive trends, but the extreme discharge displays slightly upward trends with no significance at 90% confidence level. Wavelet transform analysis results illustrate that highly similar patterns of signal changes can be seen between extreme precipitation and discharge in upper section of the basin, while the changes in extreme precipitation for the middle and lower reaches do not always coincide with the extreme streamflow. The correlation coefficients of the wavelet transforms for the precipitation and discharge signals in most area of the basin pass the significance test. The conclusion may be drawn that floods in recent years are not getting worse in Xiang River basin. The similar signal patterns and positive correlation between extreme discharge and precipitation indicate that the variability of extreme precipitation has an important effect on extreme discharge of flood, although the intensity of human impacts in lower section of Xiang River basin has increased markedly.",

            "abstract": "It is generally believed that clay minerals can protect organic matter from degradation in redox active environments, but both biotic and abiotic factors can influence the redox process and thus potentially change the clay-organic associations. However, the specific mechanisms involved in this process remain poorly understood. In this study, a model organic compound, 12-Aminolauric acid (ALA) was selected to intercalate into the structural interlayer of nontronite (an iron-rich smectite, NAu-2) to form an ALA-intercalated NAu-2 composite (ALA-NAu-2). Shawanella putrefaciens CN32 and sodium dithionite were used to reduce structural Fe(III) to Fe(II) in NAu-2 and ALA-NAu-2. The bioreduced ALA-NAu-2 was subsequently re-oxidized by air. The rates and extents of bioreduction and air re-oxidation were determined with wet chemistry methods. ALA release from ALA-NAu-2 via redox process was monitored. Mineralogical changes after iron redox cycle were investigated with X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and scanning and transmission electron microscopy. At the beginning stage of bioreduction, S. putrefaciens CN32 reduced Fe(III) from the edges of nontronite and preferentially reduced and dissolved small and poorly crystalline particles, and released ALA, resulting a positive correlation between ALA release and iron reduction extent (<12%). The subsequent bioreduction (reduction extent ranged from 12~30%) and complete air re-oxidation showed no effect on ALA release. These results suggest that released ALA was largely from small and poorly crystalline NAu-2 particles. In contrast to bioreduction, chemical reduction did not exhibit any selectivity in reducing ALA-NAu-2 particles, and a considerable amount of reductive dissolution was responsible for a large amount of ALA release (>80%). Because bacteria are the principal agent for mediating redox process in natural environments, our results demonstrated that the structural interlayer of smectite can serve as a potential shelter to protect organic matter from oxidation.",

            "abstract": " The Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) was launched on January 2009 and continues its operation for more than six years. The thermal and near infrared sensor for carbon observation Fourier-Transform Spectrometer (TANSO-FTS) onboard GOSAT measures greenhouse gases (GHG), such as CO2 and CH4, with wide and high resolution spectra from shortwave infrared (SWIR) to thermal infrared (TIR). This instrument has the advantage of being able to measure simultaneously the same field of view in different spectral ranges. The combination of column-GHG form SWIR band and vertical profile-GHG from TIR band provide better understanding and distribution of GHG, especially in troposphere.\n This work describes the radiometric validation and sensitivity analysis of TANSO-FTS TIR spectra, especially CO2, atmospheric window and CH4 channels with forward calculation.\n In this evaluation, we used accurate in-situ dataset of the HIPPO (HIAPER Pole-to-Pole Observation) airplane observation data and GOSAT vicarious calibration and validation campaign data in Railroad Valley, NV.\nThe HIPPO aircraft campaign had taken accurate atmospheric vertical profile dataset (T, RH, O3, CO2, CH4, N2O, CO) approximately pole-to-pole from the surface to the tropopause over the ocean. We implemented these dataset for forward calculation and made the spectral correction model with respect to wavenumber and internal calibration blackbody temperature\n The GOSAT vicarious calibration campaign have conducted every year since 2009 near summer solstice in Railroad Valley, where high-temperature desert site. In this campaign, we have measured temperature and humidity by a radiosonde and CO2, CH4 and O3 profile by the AJAX airplane at the time of the GOSAT overpass. Sometimes, the GHG profiles over the Railroad Valley show the air mass advection in mid-troposphere depending on upper wind. These advections bring the different concentration of GHG in lower and upper troposphere. Using these cases, we made sensitivity analysis of TANSO-FTS TIR band in troposphere changing in-situ GHG profiles.",

            "abstract": "In the ablation zone of the Greenland Ice Sheet, melting during the summer drives drainage development in which flow is routed downslope through a network of supgraglacial streams and lakes until it is sequestered by the englacial system or flows off of the glacier. This supraglacial drainage network sets the efficacy by which melt water is transport into the glacier and thus has important implications for coupling between ice sheet sliding and surface melt. Thermal erosion in supraglacial streams is rapid compared to other fluvial environments, raising the possibility that supraglacial topographic evolution is to some extent set by local fluvial incision rather than by underlying bedrock or iceflow.\nWe study a series of supraglacial drainage basins on top of the West Greenland Ice Sheet between 1000-1500 m elevation using a combination of high-resolution images, and concurrent (2 m resolution) DEMs constructed from World View Imagery. Although large-scale topography correlates well with underlying bedrock topography, spectral filtering of the surface also reveals broad, low relief valleys that suggest fluvial modification at all elevations. We extract several hundred supraglacial stream longitudinal profiles per drainage basin, finding many channel segments that are clearly out of equilibrium but also numerous concave up channel segments that are not well correlated with underlying bedrock. These concave up segments have a similar power law exponent, suggesting similarities to equilibrium bedrock and alluvial rivers (although the exponent is different in this setting). We develop a stream-power model to predict equilibrium longitudinal profiles where erosion is due to melting driving by viscous dissipation of heat within streams. We speculate that fluvial erosion driven by viscous dissipation is in part responsible for shaping the Greenland Ice Sheet ablation zone annually, superimposed on long wavelength bedrock control of surface topography and basins.",

The new mission MAVEN dedicated to observe the upper atmosphere and the plasma interactions provides the first comprehensive observations of the low altitude nightside ionosphere. Observations show that at density gradients the plasma is unstable and significant wave power, heated/accelerated electrons, and heated ions are co-located. Below 300 km, thermal electrons (>3 eV) are observed at the gradients to low density regions. The nightside ionosphere below 180 km is thought to be maintained by electron impact ionization and therefore these regions with thermal electrons may be the primary energy source for the low altitude ionosphere. Outside of the low density regions the plasma is cold. These observations suggest that the wave heating might be the primary process in the Matrian nightside ionosphere. The characteristics of these regions associated with density gradients will be presented and discussed in this presentation.",

            "abstract": "In the past 100 years, Morocco has undertaken a heavy investment in developing water infrastructure that has led to a dramatic expansion of irrigated agriculture. Irrigated agriculture is the primary user of water in many arid countries, often accounting for 80-90% of total water usage. Irrigation is adopted by farmers not only because it leads to increased production, but also because it improves resilience to an uncertain climate.\nHowever, the Mediterranean region as a whole has also seen an increase in the frequency and severity of drought events. These droughts have had a dramatic impact on farmer livelihoods and have led to a number of coping strategies, including the adoption or disadoption of irrigation. In this study, we use a record of the annual extent of irrigated agriculture in Morocco to model the effect of drought on the extent of irrigated agriculture.\nUsing an agent-based socioeconomic model, we seek to answer the following questions: 1) Do farmers expand irrigated agriculture in response to droughts? 2) Do drought events entail the removal of perennial crops like orchards? 3) Can we detect the retreat of irrigated agriculture in the more fragile watersheds of Morocco?\nUnderstanding the determinants of irrigated crop expansion and contractions will help us understand how agro-ecological systems transition from 20th century paradigms of expansion of water supply to a 21st century paradigm of water use efficiency. The answers will become important as countries learn how to manage water in new climate regimes characterized by less reliable and available precipitation.",

Although the limits to distribution is among the most fundamental of ecological questions, there are few studies that determine quantitatively which processes can explain observed distributions. Focusing on two contrasting Eucalypt species, a fast-growing coastal species (E. saligna) and a slower-growing inland species (E. sideroxylon), we examined to what extent plant physiological characteristics limit species distributions. The ecophysiology of both species has been extensively characterised in both controlled and field environments. We parameterised an ecosystem model (GDAY, Generic Decomposition and Yield) for both species, using the best available experimental data. We then used the model to predict the spatial distribution of productivity for these species in eastern Australia, and compared these predictions with the actual distributions. The results of this comparison allow us to identify where the distributions of these species are limited by physiological constraints on productivity, and consequently their vulnerability to changes in climate.",

            "abstract": "Microbial communities that control nutrient transformation and storage in ecosystems are themselves influenced by landscape topography and vegetative cover. Globally, disturbances such as fires and insect outbreaks are increasing in frequency and severity with enormous impacts on global carbon cycling. The resiliency of soil microbial communities to these heterogeneous disturbances determines rates of nutrient transformations as well as ecosystem structure and recovery.\nNatural and anthropogenic disturbances are a common thread throughout Critical Zone Observatories and ecosystems in general. Using the 2013 Thompson Ridge Fire in the Jemez River Basin CZO as a case study, we examine the effect of a wildfire disturbance regime on successional changes in soil microbiota and ecosystem fluxes across a landscape with high topographic variation. We find that, layered over the topographic controls of hotspots of biogeochemical activity, fire alters organic substrate quality, microbial biomass, community structure, and activity. For example, fire increases soil pH, which is commonly found as an explanatory variable describing bacterial community structure. Soil microbes excrete exoenzymes to decompose polymers and acquire nutrients, and these activities can indicate changing microbial function or soil quality. In these mixed conifer forests, we find shifts from carbon to nitrogen-dominated exoenzyme activities in burned forests with alkaline soils, suggesting shifts of microbial taxa and function that correspond with recovering soil microbial biomass.\nMore generally we ask – what combination of tools and perspectives is needed to fully understand soil microbial ecology and biogeochemistry of the critical zone? Results from an NSF Science Across Virtual Institutes (SAVI) CZO Network Biogeochemistry Workshop highlight the importance of incorporating a standard suite of microbial activity and community assays along with soil biogeochemical and flux measurements to enable comparisons across the broader CZO network. These characterizations would provide regional microbial function and biodiversity data in a standardized framework that can be used to enable more effective management and valuation of critical zone services and inform projections under global change scenarios.",

            "abstract": "We investigated the characteristics of strong ground motions separated from acceleration Fourier spectra and acceleration response spectra of 5% damping calculated from weak and moderate ground motions observed by K-NET, KiK-net, and the JMA Shindokei Network in Japan using the generalized spectral inversion method. The separation method used the outcrop motions at YMGH01 as reference where we extracted site responses due to shallow weathered layers. We include events with JMA magnitude equal to or larger than 4.5 observed from 1996 to 2011. We find that our frequency-dependent Q values are comparable to those of previous studies. From the corner frequencies of Fourier source spectra, we calculate Brune’s stress parameters and found a clear magnitude dependence, in which smaller events tend to spread over a wider range while maintaining the same maximum value. We confirm that this is exactly the case for several mainshock-aftershock sequences. The average stress parameters for crustal earthquakes are much smaller than those of subduction zone, which can be explained by their depth dependence.\nWe then compared the strong motion characteristics based on the acceleration response spectra and found that the separated characteristics of strong ground motions are different, especially in the lower frequency range less than 1Hz. These differences comes from the difference between Fourier spectra and response spectra found in the observed data; that is, predominant components in high frequency range of Fourier spectra contribute to increase the response in lower frequency range with small Fourier amplitude because strong high frequency component acts as an impulse to a Single-Degree-of-Freedom system.\nAfter the separation of the source terms for 5% damping response spectra we can obtain regression coefficients with respect to the magnitude, which lead to a new GMPE as shown in Fig.1 on the left. Although stress drops for inland earthquakes are 1/7 of the subduction-zone earthquakes, we can see linear regression works quite well. After this linear regression we correlate residuals as a function of Brune’s stress parameters of corresponding events as shown in Fig.1 on the right for the case of 1Hz. We found quite good linear correlation, which makes aleatoric uncertainty 40 to 60 % smaller than the original.",

            "abstract": "The Tohoku-oki earthquake was not only the costliest natural disaster in history it was the best monitored. The unprecedented data set showed that anomalously large lateral motion of the seafloor near the trench contributed to the size of the tsunami. Also, for the first time it was shown that a large subduction earthquake was followed by extensional aftershocks in a broad region of the upper plate (up to 250 km from the Japan Trench). Several observations suggest that the near-trench seafloor motion and the extensional aftershocks are linked. For example, a seismically imaged fault, just landward of the region of large seafloor motion, slipped in a normal sense during the earthquake. Also, inspired by the Tohoku data, researchers have searched for and found upper plate extensional aftershocks associated with several other subduction earthquakes that produced large tsunami.\nExtension of the upper plate can be driven by a reduction in the dip of a subducting slab. Such a dip change is suggested by the post-Miocene westward migration of the volcanic arc in Honshu. Numerical models show that a long-term reduction in slab dip can generate enough extensional stress to cause normal faulting over a broad region of the upper plate. The time step of the numerical model is then reduced to treat the inter-seismic time scale of 100-1000 years, when the subduction interface is locked. The interface dip continues to be reduced during the inter-seismic period, but extensional fault slip is suppressed by the relative compression of the upper plate caused by continued convergence. The relief of compressional stresses during dynamic weakening of the megathrust triggers a release of bending-related extensional strain energy. This extensional yielding can add significantly to the co-seismic radiated seismic energy and seafloor deformation. This mechanism is analogous to the breaking of a pre-stressed concrete beam supporting a bending moment when the compressional pre-stress is removed. It is plausible that similar bending is occurring at a number of subduction zones. A testable prediction of this bending model is that inter-seismic stresses can be compressional near the surface of the upper plate, but should become extensional at depths accessible to drilling.",

            "abstract": "Three-dimensional chemical-transport model (CTM) studies of human effects on the atmosphere, including those of aircraft, have typically employed a single representative year of atmospheric meteorology to drive the model (i.e simulations have been run in a specified dynamics mode). The current and likely near-future aircraft fleets operate mostly near the tropopause, a region sensitive to changes in dynamics that are likely among different years. This study explores the variation in aviation induced ozone perturbations using the Community Atmosphere Model with Chemistry, version 5 (CAM5) over eleven years of meteorological fields which represent eleven years of interannual variability. Meteorology to drive the model was supplied by eleven years of MERRA (Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications) reanalysis for years 2000-2011. The aviation emissions used were obtained from the Aviation Environmental Design Tool (AEDT) for the year 2006.\nResults indicate a very little year to year variation (less than 10%) in the derived changes in aviation-induced ozone. This result led to the conclusion that aircraft effects modeling under a single meteorology year should suffice within current model uncertainties. It can be further concluded that aviation induced signals obtained in coupled simulations could not be entirely masked by the model interannual variability. ",

In this study, the effects of large-scale orography (i.e. Tibet Plateau) on the zonal structure of the storm tracks are investigated by carrying out idealized numerical experiments with the GFDL dynamical core. In the experiment with a zonally uniform diabatic heating and a local Gaussian-shape orography to simulate the effect of Tibet Plateau, a local storm track similar to that in the North Pacific is observed in the downstream region. The energy budget analysis of synoptic eddy shows that the orography induced stationary eddy can efficiently enhance the low-level baroclinicity in the downstream region, which results in more baroclinic eddy generation and a locally enhanced storm track. Sensitivity studies are also carried out to investigate the dependence of the above results to the position and the length-scale of the Gaussian mountain. Our study shows that the intensity of the storm track gets stronger when the position of the large-scale topography is displaced more equatorward. The stronger synoptic eddy activity mainly attributes the stronger baroclinic generation and the weaker EKE conversion due to eddy–eddy interactions response to topography.",

            "abstract": "Inverse modelling provides a mathematical framework for constructing a model of physical property distributions in the subsurface that are consistent with the data collected in geophysical surveys. The geosciences are increasingly moving towards the integration of geological, geophysical, and hydrological information to better characterize the subsurface. This integration must span disciplines and is not only challenging scientifically, but additionally the inconsistencies between conventions often makes implementations complicated, non­ reproducible, or inefficient. SimPEG is an open-source, multi-university effort aimed at providing a generalized framework for solving forward and inverse problems. SimPEG includes finite volume discretizations on structured and unstructured meshes, interfaces to standard numerical solver packages, convex optimization algorithms, model parameterizations, and visualization routines. The SimPEG package (http://simpeg.xyz) supports an ecosystem of forward and inverse modelling applications, including electromagnetics, vadose zone flow, seismic, and potential­ fields, that are all written with a common interface and toolbox. The goal of SimPEG is to support a community of researchers with well-tested, extensible tools, and encourage transparency and reproducibility both of the SimPEG software and the geoscientific research it is applied to.\nIn this presentation, we will share some of the lessons we have learned in designing the modular infrastructure, testing and development practices of SimPEG. We will discuss our use of version control, extensive unit-testing, continuous integration, documentation, issue tracking, and resources that facilitate communication between existing team members and allows new researchers to get involved. These practices have enabled the use of SimPEG in research, industry, and education as well as the ability to support a growing number of dependent repositories and applications. We hope that sharing our practices and experiences will help other researchers who are creating communities around their own scientific software. As this session suggests, “software is critical to the success of science,” but, it is the *communities* of researchers that must be supported as we strive to create top quality research tools.",

            "abstract": "ePoster - AGU2015_DongyueLi.pdf\nSnow is a vital component of water supply and ecological systems in the Western United States. Quantifying the overall fraction of streamflow that originates as snowmelt is a critical step for assessing the winter-season snowpack drought and for determining the vulnerabilities of water resources in late summer and fall. However, estimates of this fraction differ in existing literatures; to our knowledge, a systematic study has not been performed to evaluate this fundamental quantity.\nIn this study, a snowmelt tracker was developed to track the snowmelt-derived runoff from the output of a macroscale hydrological model; the spatiotemporal ratio of the snow-derived runoff to the total runoff (fQ,snow) was calculated over the contiguous U.S. at 0.5° resolution. The tracker calculated fQ,snow based on the Variable Infiltration Capacity model outputs, hydrologic fluxes, and water balance equations. Generally, snowmelt contributes to the total runoff in two ways: surface runoff and baseflow. Since rainfall also contributes to both quantities, the snowmelt tracker operates at every time-step to disentangle the snow-induced runoff from both surface runoff and baseflow and to calculate fQ,snow. In this way, the tracker provides the spatiotemporal distribution of fQ,snow.\nIn this study, the average fQ,snow from 1979 to 1998 was calculated. A significant fraction of runoff originates as snow across the western US, especially in mountainous areas such as the Rockies, the Cascades, and the Sierra Nevada; fQ,snow ranges from 60% to 80% in these mountains. Other places with relatively high fQ,snow include the northern Great Plains and the northeast Appalachians. Storage reservoirs typically store snowmelt in spring and release water during summer and fall; these reservoirs are critical for ecology, irrigated agriculture, and local water supply. Three out of the five largest reservoirs (in term of capacity) in the U.S. are located in the west; we calculated the runoff-weighted average fQ,snow over the drainage basins of these reservoirs, and found about 50% of the water in each originates from snow. Future studies will be focused on running the tracker with forecasting model results to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of fQ,snow in the future, with emphasis on late-season snow water resource availability.",

            "abstract": "The non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) released to the subsurface can form residual ganglia and globules occupying pores and also accumulate and form pools, in which multiphase system forms. Determining transient fluid saturations in a multiphase system is essential to understand the flow characteristics of systems and to perform effective remediation strategies. As a non-destructive and non-invasive laboratory technique utilized for the measurement of liquid saturation in porous media, light transmission is of the lowest cost and safe. Utilization of Coupled Charge Device camera in light transmission systems provides a nearly instantaneous high-density array of spatial measurements over a very large dynamic range. The migration of NAPL and air spariging technique applied to remove NAPL in aquifer systems are typically two-phase flow problem. Because of the natural aquifer normally being heterogeneous, two 2-D sandboxes (Length55cm×width1.3cm×hight45cm) are set up to study the migration of gas and DNAPL in heterogeneous porous media based on light transmission method and its application in two-phase flow. Model D for water/gas system developed by Niemet and Selker (2001) and Model NW-A for water/NAPL system developed by Zhang et al. (2014) are applied for the calculation of fluid saturation in the two experiments, respectively. The gas injection experiments show that the gas moves upward in the irregular channels, piling up beneath the low permeability lenses and starting lateral movement. Bypassing the lenses, the gas moves upward and forms continuous distribution in the top of the sandbox. The faster of gas injects, the wider of gas migration will be. The DNAPL infiltration experiment shows that TCE mainly moves downward as the influence of gravity, stopping vertical infiltration when reaching the low permeability lenses because of its failure to overcome the capillary pressure. Then, TCE accumulates on the surface and starts transverse movement. Bypassing the lenses, TCE migrates down again and eventually accumulates at the bottom of the sandbox. The two models of quantification of fluid saturations for water/gas system and water/NAPL system developed in homogenous porous media give comparatively fit results to the observations and can be used to quantify fluid saturations in heterogeneous porous media.",

However, recent work has introduced the possibility of multiple environmental factors contributing to tree growth in cold environments. We investigate the influence of small-scale light variability on tree-ring based temperature reconstructions from a treeline ecotone. We establish an experimental plot near Sonora Pass in the California Sierra Nevada (38.32N, 119.64W; elev. 3130 m). This treeline environment is dominated by whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis) growing as individuals and in stands, providing an opportunity to test the sensitivity of mean growth rate and interannual variability to light availability. For each tree we quantify the local light environment using three approaches: (i.) geometrical estimates of shading from neighboring trees, (ii.) photographic estimates of shading from neighboring trees, and (iii.) geometric estimates of direct light availability resulting from aspect and local topography. Geometrical estimates of shading are made by mapping the relative position and crown dimensions of each tree in the plot in order to calculate a shading index that will be used to test hypotheses about the influence of shading on tree growth. Photographic estimates of tree-level shading are created by taking hemispheric photographs at the crown edge of each tree and calculating the effects of neighboring trees on direct and diffuse light availability using the Gap Light Analyzer software. To quantify tree growth, increment cores are collected from all trees in the plot to develop sub-chronologies of ring records grouped by different light environments. We hypothesize that trees growing in open areas or at edge of stands, which experience little inter-tree competition, would likely produce ring records more closely correlated with the temperature record; whereas trees growing in middle of stands may produce ring records resembling both temperature and light variability.",

            "abstract": "Stock breeding is a major economic sector of Mongolia, supporting unique cultural and social identity. In spite of its long history, contemporary pastoralism increases interventions on climate-vegetation interactions substantially, which results in negative feedbacks to livestock sector. This presentation draws an attention how natural processes of climate and vegetation interact with livestock dynamics. Massive loss of livestock and wildlife animal during winter seasons (dzud) is an endemic climatic disaster in the Central Asia grasslands but the mechanisms are not well understood yet. Recent national-wide sever Dzud occurred during 2009-2010 winter in Mongolia. The dzud mechanisms were investigated by developing a schematic mechanism model on climate-vegetation-livestock interactions and applying it for quantitative statistical analysis. Various remote sensing products were integrated to prepare the status and process variables of the schematic model, including daily temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration, and primary production and biomass for a period from 2003 to 2010. At a lower level of administration (i.e., ‘soum’ generally larger than 1000 km2), stepwise multiple regression analysis was conducted to find significant factors of inter-annual livestock change. As results, linear regression models were successfully produced at 70% of soums. Summer and winter variables appeared equally important in controlling livestock dynamics. The primary factor of each soum showed certain regional patterns incident well with climate severity and foraging resource availability (e.g. temperature in north, dryness in south, and NDVI in middle). Regional pattern of herbaceous biodiversity depends on both climate and disturbance (i.e. fire and grazing) gradients but the livestock grazing effect appeared localized normally within 1.5 km from livestock shelter or wells. At a local-scale (i.e. family level smaller than 100 km2), species composition seems to provide useful indicator of grazing pressure, while climate and fire disturbance determined regional pattern of vegetation biodiversity. The results provide a useful premise to devise a satellite-based assessment tool for foraging resource availability and biological regime shift by grazing and climate change in future study.",

Many southern California, USA salt marshes import sediment during El Niño storm events, but sediment fluxes and mechanisms during dry weather are also potentially important for marsh stability. We calculated tidal creek sediment fluxes within a sediment starved 1.5 km2 salt marsh (Seal Beach) and a less modified 1 km2 marsh (Mugu) with a watershed sediment supply. We measured salt marsh plain suspended sediment concentration and vertical accretion using single stage samplers and marker horizons. At Seal Beach, a 2014 storm yielded 39 and 28 g/s mean sediment fluxes and imported 12000 and 8800 kg in a western channel. This offset 8700 kg export during two months of dry weather, while landward net fluxes in the eastern channel accounted for 33% of the import. During the storm, suspended sediment concentrations on the marsh plain increased by a factor of four; accretion was 1-2 mm near creek levees. An exceptionally high tide sequence at Mugu yielded 4.4 g/s mean sediment flux, importing 1700 kg, accounting for 20% of dry weather fluxes. Overall, low sediment fluxes were observed, suggesting that these salt marshes are currently geomorphically stable. Our results suggest that storms and exceptionally high lunar tides may play large roles, importing sediment and maintaining dry weather sediment flux balances for southern California salt marshes. However, under future climate change and sea-level rise scenarios, results suggest that balanced sediment fluxes may lead to marsh elevational instability, based on estimated mineral sediment deficits.",

We use aircraft and ground-based in situ data to characterize the temporal distribution of these greenhouse gases, and spectroscopic observations to derive their collocated surface radiative forcing.\nThe spectroscopically-measured surface radiative forcing from rising CO2 is 0.2 W/m2/decade at both sites, with a seasonal cycle of 0.2 W/m2. This finding is largely consistent with theoretical predictions, providing robust evidence of radiative perturbations to the Earth’s surface energy budget due to anthropogenic influences.\nThe contribution from CH4 to the surface energy balance is more spatially and temporally heterogeneous. The ground-based measurements of CH4 at NSA and SGP indicate rising atmospheric concentrations except for a hiatus from 1995-2005, while more recent aircraft profiles indicate that concentrations in the boundary layer and free troposphere are correlated at NSA and decorrelated at SGP. The probability density functions of boundary layer concentrations of CH4 at NSA show little skew, but at SGP show positive skewness, which increased with the introduction of nearby fossil-fuel extraction. The correlated increases in atmospheric measurements of C2H6 and CH4that only occur at SGP are consistent with an anthropogenic influence there.\nTime-series of spectroscopically-measured CH4 surface radiative forcing at SGP and NSA also indicate positive trends of 0.1 W/m2/decade associated with the end of the hiatus, marked seasonal cycles, and little skew at NSA and a positive skew at SGP. The combination of in situ and spectroscopic measurements at these sites enables the quantification of surface radiative forcing from anthropogenic CH4.\nImplications are discussed for how advanced spectroscopic remote sensing measurements of CH4 can be used to quantify the impact of fossil fuel extraction on surface energy budget.",

            "abstract": "The northern Cordillera, situated in the Canadian northwest, is one of the most actively deforming regions in Canada and host to the highest earthquake activity in the country. Furthermore, it presents a largely contiguous snapshot through almost 4 Gyr of Earth's history across a zone <2000 km in linear extent. Deformation is thought to be driven by tectonic forces transferred from the Alaska-Pacific plate collision eastwards to the Cordilleran Deformation Front (CDF), where the westward edge of the Canadian Shield acts as a rigid backstop. Past studies in the southern Yukon indicate a sharp transition into the craton underlying the CDF and evidence of craton growth through shallow subduction. Further north the proximity of the craton edge to the CDF remains largely unresolved; based on studies of the southern Cordillera and Alaska, significant variations in lithospheric architecture are expected. Additionally, significant seismicity is observed further north off the Beaufort Shelf; however, its relationship to the regional stress fields and associated tectonic forcing is unclear.\nDespite the high seismicity levels across, detailed study of this region has been limited by insufficient coverage of seismological infrastructure, hindering resolution in past models. With the deployment of the USArray Transportable Array in Alaska over the last several years, combined with regional arrays such as the Yukon-Northwest Seismic Network (YNSN), Banks Island Seismic Network (BISN) and Mackenzie Mountains Experiment, new studies will leverage these datasets enabling more detailed imaging of the structure and seismicity across the region. Here we present a new high-resolution, vertically polarized shear speed and azimuthal model of northwestern Canada and Alaska, constrained by vertical component seismogram fits computed using the Automated Multimode Inversion of Surface, S, and multiple-S waveforms. With this new model, we aim to address key questions relating to the dynamics of the northern Cordillera, including how far west the craton edge extends at depth, in addition to the crustal thickness, velocity structure, and pattern of crustal fabrics around major faults throughout the region.",

We used the Diatoms of the United States website as an online resource for diatom taxonomy and developed a Google+ class community to serve as a platform for high school students to learn about research in diatom taxonomy, community ecology and diatom applications to the earth sciences. Ecology and Systematics of Diatoms is a field course that has been taught at the undergraduate and graduate levels at the Iowa Lakeside Lab field station for 52 years, beginning with the Diatom Clinic in 1963. Freshwater diatom education at Lakeside Lab has since evolved into a foundational training course attracting budding diatomists from all over the world, and has grown to include a week-long course for high school students. Successful since 2012, the high school course is now offered for college credit (University of Iowa), and covers methods of diatom specimen collection and preparation, microscopy, identification of diatom genera, diatom ecology, applications of diatom research, and an introduction to data analysis incorporating multivariate statistics (ordination) using the R statistical program, as well as primary scientific literature. During the 2015 course, students contributed to a Google+ class community where they posted images, data, and questions. The web-based platform allowed students to easily share information and to give and receive feedback from both peers and instructors. Students collaborated via the Google+ community and used the Diatoms of the United States website to develop a taxonomic reference for a field-based group research project, simulating how an actual diatom research program would develop a region or project-specific flora harmonized across analysts. Students investigated the taxonomy and ecology of diatom epiphytes on the green alga Cladophora from the littoral zone of West Lake Okoboji, Iowa. They found the epiphyte community went through a seasonal succession and developed hypotheses for the observed patterns by researching the ecology of diatoms in primary literature. These course activities may be used as a model for other field-based courses or educational programs in earth and environmental sciences.",

            "abstract": "The sources of PM2.5 are poorly quantified in Seoul, Korea, where tens of millions of populations are daily exposed to the exceedance of PM2.5 concentrations to the air quality criteria. We used a global 3-D chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) and its adjoint to investigate the sensitivities of PM2.5 concentrations in Seoul to emission sources, sectors, and chemical reaction rates. We first conduct forward model simulations using a nested version of GEOS-Chem with 0.25°x0.3125° spatial resolutions in East Asia for July 2012 - July 2013. We evaluated the model by comparing it with PM2.5 mass and chemical composition observations at National Institute of Environmental Research sites in Korea. The model reasonably reproduces the observed seasonal variability of PM2.5 concentrations (R=0.3-0.6), but tends to overestimate the observations in summer and underestimate them in winter. Our sensitivity analyses show the dominant contributions from local emission sources to PM2.5 concentrations in Seoul compared to the trans-boundary transport influences from the outside, which are important for long-lived tracers in spring. Other results including the model sensitivity to input parameters and the updated emissions are used to improve the model performance and to provide strategic information for the KORUS-AQ flight measurement campaign in May-June, 2016.",

            "abstract": "Certain atmospheric aerosols, such as mineral dust, can act as effective ice nuclei (IN) to initiate ice formation at relatively warm temperatures. Evidences have been reported from satellite observations that dust-laden ice clouds tend to have warmer cloud top temperature (CTT) comparing to their dust-free counterparts. However, large uncertainties exist due to concerns that if the observed clouds really interacted with dust and how to untangle the dynamic related variations of CTT. Here we present an example to reduce such uncertainties by combining passive, active satellite observations and WRF model simulations of a typical event of dust invading mesoscale cyclone system on April 25th 2008 in China. We first clearly identified the cloud-dust interactions based on 3-D satellite measurements and modeled wind field. Two heavy dust-laden areas (HD) and two light dust-laden areas (LD) were selected for comparison study. Satellite retrievals shown the probability distribution function (PDF) of CTT in HD shifted ~14oC to the warmer end comparing to that in LD. Meanwhile, the dynamic-only effect was quantified with model simulation: without accounting any dust aerosol effect, the CTT in HD still shifted ~8oC to the warmer end comparing to that in LD, most probably due to effects of warm and dry air mass accompanied with dust. We therefore concluded, in this case, the IN effect contributes about 42.8% to the total satellite observed warming of cloud CTT. This study suggested a new method to reduce the uncertainties in satellite observational study of aerosol indirect effect. ",

            "abstract": "Changes in tectonics can affect erosion rates across a mountain belt, leading to non-steady sediment flux delivery to fluvial transport systems. The sediment flux signal produced from time-varying tectonics may eventually be recorded in a depositional basin. However, before the sediment flux from an erosional watershed is fed to the downstream transport system and preserved in sedimentary deposits, tectonic signals can be distorted or even destroyed as they are transformed into a sediment-flux signal that is exported out of a watershed . In this study, we use the Channel-Hillslope Integrated Landscape Development (CHILD) model to explore how the sediment flux delivered from a mountain watershed responds to non-steady rock uplift. We observe that (1) a non-linear relationship between the erosion response and tectonic perturbation can lead to a sediment-flux signal that is out of phase with the change in uplift rate; (2) in some cases in which the uplift perturbation is short, the sediment flux signal may contain no record of the change; (3) uplift rates interpreted from sediment flux at the outlet of a transient erosional landscape are likely to be underestimated. All these observations highlight the difficulty in accurately reconstructing tectonic history from sediment flux records. Results from this study will help to constrain what tectonic signals may be evident in the sediment flux delivered from an erosional system and therefore have the potential to be recorded in stratigraphy, ultimately improving our ability to interpret stratigraphy.",

            "abstract": "Lateral separation zones are featured by large-scale flow separation, secondary recirculation zones and free shear layers. In the Colorado River, lateral separation zones are the principal source of fine sediment for eddy sandbars. A parallelized, three-dimensional turbulence-resolving model is coupled with a continuum sediment transport model and tested in lateral separation zones located in two pools along the Colorado River in Marble Canyon. The model aims to study the flow and sediment dynamics of lateral separation zones, recognizing the important role that these processes play in the erosion, deposition and morphodynamics of eddy sandbars. The Detached Eddy Simulation (DES) technique is employed for fully resolved turbulence at larger scales than the Sub-Grid-Scale (SGS) while SGS turbulence is modeled using the Spalart-Allmaras one equation turbulence closure model. This DES-3D flow model is coupled to a sediment advection-diffusion formulation, wherein advection is provided by the DES velocity field minus particles settling velocity, and diffusion is provided by the SGS. The Smith and McLean suspended sediment boundary condition is used to calculate the upward and downward settling of sediment fluxes in the near-bed grid cells. Five groups of sediment sizes are employed and estimated using a mixing layer model. Each fraction of the grain size group is redistributed every time step. Thus, the model is able to predict the exposure and burial of bedrock by fine grain size sediment.\nThe simulated results show a pattern of unsteady pulsations in the exchange of concentration of sediment and deposition fluxes between the primary zone and the main channel. This exchange occurs at the convergence and divergence zones. These pulsations are more accentuated at the convergence zone, but still evidenced at the divergence zone. Along the simulated river-reach, the concentration values increase in the constrictions and decrease in the main channel. At both rapids, net erosion is observed due to the high shear stress present in these constrictions. At the reattachment and separation zones, positive net deposition is observed with relatively constant values. The net deposition and deposition fluxes play an important role in the replenishment of sand bars, since these are zones of storage of fine deposits.",

Because flow duration curves are largely used to characterize the streamflow regime and define indices of ecosystem health, they were used to represent and analyze in this study the stream regime in the Maipo River Basin in Central Chile. Water and Environmental Assessment and Planning (WEAP) model and the Plant Growth Model (PGM) were used to simulate water distribution, consumption in rural areas and stream flows on a weekly basis. Historical data (1990-2014), future land use scenarios (2030/2050) and climate change scenarios were included in the process. Historical data show a declining trend in flows mainly by unprecedented climatic conditions, increasing interest among users on future streamflow scenarios. In the future, under an expected decline in water availability coupled with changes in crop water demand, water users will be forced to adapt by changing water allocation rules. Such adaptation actions would in turns affect the streamflow regime. Future scenarios for streamflow regime show dramatic changes in water availability and temporal distribution. Annual weekly mean flows can reduce in 19% in the worst scenario and increase in 3.3% in the best of them, and variability in streamflow increases nearly 90% in all scenarios under evaluation. The occurrence of maximum and minimum monthly flows changes, as June instead of July becomes the driest month, and December instead of January becomes the month with maximum flows. Overall, results show that under future scenarios streamflow is affected and altered by water allocation rules to satisfy water demands, and thus decisions will need to consider the streamflow regime (and habitat) in order to be sustainable.",

The global consumption of animal protein shows a clear increasing trend, driven by both total population and per capita income increases, putting a growing pressure on the sustainability of grazing lands worldwide. Despite their relevance, rangelands have received less attention than croplands regarding global monitoring of the resource productivity and condition.\nThe Rangelands and Pasture Productivity (RaPP) activity is a component within the Global Agricultural Monitoring initiative established under the Group on Earth Observations (GEOGLAM) in 2013. GEOGLAM RaPP is aimed at providing the global community with the means to monitor the world’s rangelands and pastures on a routine basis, and the capacity to produce animal protein in real-time, at global, regional and national levels. Since its launch two years ago GEOGLAM RAPP has made progress in the four implementation elements. These include: 1- the establishment of community of practice; 2- the development of a global monitoring system for rangeland condition; 3- the establishment of pilot sites in main rangeland systems for satellite data products validation and model testing; and 4- integration with livestock production models. Three international workshops have been held building the community of practice. A prototype monitoring system that provides global visualisations and querying capability of vegetation cover data and anomalies has been established. Pilot sites, mostly in areas with long records of field measurements of rangeland condition and productivity have been proposed for nine countries. The link to global livestock models, including physical and economic components, have been established.\nFuture challenges for GEOGLAM RaPP have also been identified and include: better representation of the areas occupied by rangelands, pastures and mixed systems globally; intercomparison and validation of satellite data products and models depicting rangeland condition and forage availability; and better understanding of the environmental and social impacts of the potential use of pastures for biofuel production.",

            "abstract": "Intermontane basin strata along the E flanks of the Puna Plateau in NW Argentina are ideal archives to investigate the interaction between tectonics, topography, and changes in climate. In particular, these strata record the fragmentation of a formerly contiguous foreland by range uplifts, ensuing intra-basin deformation, and surface uplift. These changes were often accompanied by a transition from humid to semiarid conditions as windward range uplift exceeded orographic threshold elevations. The E Andean flanks comprise steep gradients in topography, rainfall, and surface-process rates. Rainfall is focused along the E flanks of the plateau, while the orogen interior is arid. These gradients are mirrored by the stable isotope ratios of modern rainfall, and therefore, in the stable isotope composition of proxy materials that incorporate this water. We present D/H ratios of volcanic glass (δDg) from dated tuffs in Mio-Pleistocene sediments of intermontane basins in the Eastern Cordillera between ~23 and 26°S (Humahuaca, Toro, and Angastaco basins). We document a strong co-varying relationship between tectono-sedimentary events in the basins and corresponding δDg values. Initial D-depletion trends in the Toro and Angastaco basins constrains the onset of surface uplift to 6.5 and 7 Ma, respectively. Strong positive δDg shifts of >15‰ in Humahuaca at ~3 Ma and <2 Ma in the Toro basin are apparently caused by enhanced evaporation.

            "abstract": "Smallholder farmers in Nicaragua and throughout much of Central America preserve forest biodiversity and contribute to the sustainable production of coffee and other crops while, paradoxically, they themselves must cope with recurring periods of seasonal hunger. Smallholder food and water security in the region is affected by hurricanes, periodic drought events, climatic changes, an on-going outbreak of the coffee leaf rust, and fluctuations in food prices. Using regression analysis, our research examines what factors strengthened resilience to these hazards at the household level over the 1981 – 2014 time period. To this end, we integrate qualitative research on coping responses and local institutions, a participatory survey of 368 households, and an analysis of hydro-climatic data. Our results indicate that coping responses to the coffee leaf rust outbreak and the 2014 drought are comparable in severity to those used to endure Hurricane Mitch in 1998, and a severe 2009 drought. Higher smallholder resilience to stresses affecting food and water security is associated with larger farms, off-farm employment, more on-farm food production, higher numbers of fruit trees, and greater coffee harvests. Households that reported more severe coping responses to hazards earlier in the study period tended to be more strongly impacted by later hazards and reported generally greater seasonal hunger. Affiliation with local farmer-to-farmer institutions prioritizing either subsistence-oriented production or sales to international fair-trade markets did not correlate strongly with coping responses; however, subsistence-oriented institutions promote several resilience-enhancing practices. Lessons learned by adapting to past hazards may be used to develop adaptation and mitigation strategies for smallholders under continued climate variability and change.",

This route crosses over several facies of the ice sheet representing different accumulation and melt regimes. The SAGE field objectives included detailed shallow pit studies of snow grain size, stratigraphy, and chemistry. In addition to snow pit data from the SAGE traverses that can be used to examine spatial variations, snow grain size and chemistry data from seasonal campaigns at Summit Station are used to examine temporal variations.

Recognition Tsunami deposits were clearly observed as the sand sheets were laid over the soil which is distinctly different due to differences in the weathering and presence of organic material of vegetation. To understand the preservation potential of 2004 tsunami deposits we were studied a transect profile with seven pits sediments along Thiruvengadu coast , Nagapattinam. The study reveals that presence of sand sheets preserved a mínimum of 10 cm thickness to máximum of 22 cm and the distance is 300 from HTL. From the present study six sedimentary layers were identfied which are (a) Top sediments deposited after IOT, (b). Tsunami sand sheets (c) Silty sand (d). Erosional base and top (e) Silty sand (d) Lagoonal sediments. The 2013 Phailin cyclon with wind speed of 220 kmph which was remnant cyclonic circulation from south china; it had major impact on geomorphology and sedimentology of odisha coast. At rushikulya river mouth, Ganjam district, cyclone had produced washover sand sheets as described in eyewitness along the river mouth of both north and south bar. The study reveals that the washover sand sheets provides the inundation of the water level, and characteristics of sediments where storm deposit has a highly variable grain-size distribution with a marked coarsening at its landward extent, is better sorted, coarser, and has a sharp, non-erosional lower contact associated with buried vegetation and soil. Also, the thickness of cyclone deposits are about 5 cm with the distance from coast 80 m, heavy mineral percentage ranges between 9 % to 75% for entire pit and sandsheets lateral extent are about 45 m. The presence of the laminations and alternate layers of heavy minerals are indicative of the complexity of sedimentation on the coast. The recent marine event Phailin cylcone deposits and 2004 tsunami deposits characteristic and its preservations potential are helpful to identify the paleo tsunami sediment characteristics the along east coast of India. The present study can be used as the background for distinguishing the tsunami and cyclone sediments.\nKeywords: 2004 Tsunami preservation, 2013 phailin cylcone, sedimentology, Topography.",

            "abstract": "Repeating earthquakes are shear slip on the plate interface, and helpful to monitor long-term deformation in subduction zones. Previous studies have measured the size of repeating earthquakes mainly using seismic moment, to calculate slip amount in each event. As another measure of event size, seismic energy may provide some information related to the frictional property on the plate interface. We estimated radiated seismic energy for 620 repeating earthquakes of MJMA from 2.5 to 5.9, detected by the method of Uchida and Matsuzawa [2013], in the Tohoku-Oki region. The study period is from 2001 to 2013, extending before and after the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake of Mw 9, which is also accompanied with large afterslip [e.g., Ozawa et al., 2012]. The seismograms recorded by NIED Hi-net were used. We measured coda wave amplitude by the method of Mayeda et al. [2003] and estimated source spectra and radiated seismic energy by the method of Baltay et al. [2010] after slight modifications.\nThe estimated scaled energy, the ratio between radiated seismic energy and seismic moment, shows a slight increase with seismic moment. The scaled energy increases with depth, while its temporal change before and after the Tohoku-Oki earthquake is not systematic. The scaled energy also increases with the inter-event time of repeating earthquakes. This might be explained by the difference of fault strength, proportional to the logarithm of time. In addition to this healing relation, scaling relationship between seismic moment and the inter-event time of repeating earthquake is well known [Nadeau and Johnson, 1998]. From these healing and scaling relationships, it is expected that scaled energy is proportional to the logarithm of seismic moment. This prediction is generally consistent with our observation, though the moment dependency is too small to be recognized as power or log. This healing-related scaling may be applicable to general earthquakes, and might be associated with the unsolved problem of whether scaled energy is constant or size-dependent.",

In this study we use airborne observations of total atmospheric Hg (THg) collected over Lake Michigan during summer 2013 as part of the Nitrogen, Oxidants, Mercury, and Aerosol Distributions, Sources, and Sinks (NOMADSS) field campaign to quantify the outflow of total atmospheric Hg from the Chicago/Gary urban/industrial area. We use concurrent airborne measurements of THg, carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) to calculate measured enhancement ratios (ER) and thus characterize Chicago/Gary emissions. We determine the observed THg/CO ER in outflow from Chicago/Gary to be 2.11x10-7 mol mol-1, which is comparable to values reported in the literature for other major U.S. urban/industrial areas (Radke et al., 2007; Talbot et al., 2008; Weiss-Penzias et al., 2013). We also employ the FLEXPART Lagrangian transport and dispersion model to simulate air mass transport during plume encounters. We convolve the emissions of each species from the 2011 U.S. EPA National Emissions Inventory (NEI) with the FLEXPART-modeled air mass transport to compare our observations to inventoried emission ratios (EmR). We find that the inventoried THg/CO EmRs are biased low by -63% to -67% compared to the observed ERs for the Chicago/Gary area. This suggests that there are many small emission sources that are not fully accounted for within the inventory, and/or that the re-emission of legacy Hg is a significant source of THg to the atmosphere in this region.",

These changes in drivers may also affect water quality. Here we evaluate the possible impact of climate change on local water quality of the Dudh Koshi basin in the Khumbu Valley region of Nepal, with an emphasis on snow and ice melt interactions with underlying soils. Precipitation, river water, and soils were sampled in 2012-2014, from the Lukla area (2800 m) to above the Pyramid International Laboratory (5,000 m). Here we focus on presenting results for dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), nitrate, and stable water isotopes. The spatial and temporal variability of the surface water chemistry is compared to ratios of carbon to nitrogen in soil samples. Soil carbon to nitrogen ratios decrease with elevation, consistent with dilution in surface water chemistry. Stable water isotopes show large changes with season and elevation. Summer rains are generally 15-20 parts per mil more enriched than winter snow in O18, while values become more depleted by about 10 parts per mil with increasing elevation. In contrast, water samples show much less variation by season and elevation. The trends explored are representative of the influence of both debris-covered glacier outflow of the upper valley and biogeochemical processes on the water and soil.",

The controlling effects of the dipole tilt angle to the location of X-lines or reconnection sites are investigated. Our results show that the Earth's dipole tilt angles strongly modify the location of X-lines predicted by Cooling et al's model, which is thought to be the result of magnetopause reshaping due to finite dipole tilt angles. By investigating the magnetosheath flow outside the reconnection sites, we found that besides the dipole tilt angle the magnetosheath background flows also play a significant role in determining the locations of the reconnection sites.",

            "abstract": "The sources and sinks of biospheric carbon dioxide represent one of the least understood and most critical processes in carbon science. Since the 1990’s, carbon dioxide inversion models have estimated the magnitude, location, and uncertainty of carbon sources and sinks. These inversions are underconstrained estimation problems that employ aggressive statistical regularizations in both space and time to estimate quantities like net ecosystem exchange (NEE) on weekly timescales over fine spatial scales. We developed and tested a new method focusing observational constraints on estimation of corrections to slowly varying biospheric processes, which control time-averaged sources and sinks. Rather than estimate weekly additive corrections to NEE, we estimate persistent multiplicative biases to time mean and several seasonal harmonics of gross primary production (GPP) and total respiration (RESP). We tested the new method by estimating corrections to simulated component fluxes from the Simple Biosphere Model 4 (SiB4) using observations from 8 different eddy-covariance flux towers selected from the North American Carbon Program (NACP) site synthesis dataset. The time-filtering method correctly estimates of both the net and component fluxes and is more robust to observational uncertainty than a control experiment meant to represent current global inversions. Furthermore, the new method is flexible enough to separately estimate component fluxes (GPP and RESP) using additional observational constraints even with a high degree of uncertainty.",

The scale of the investigations varies from the size of tectonic plates to the size of a mineral prospect. To accurately model potential field data at all of these scales, we require modeling software that can operate in both spherical and Cartesian coordinate frameworks.\nThe models are in the form of a mesh, with spherical prismatic (tesseroid) elements for spherical coordinate models of large volumes, and rectangular prisms for smaller volumes evaluated in a Cartesian coordinate framework. The software can compute the forward response of supplied rock property models and can perform inversions using constraints that vary from weak generic smoothness through to very specific reference models compiled from various types of \"hard facts\" (i.e., surface mapping, drilling information, crustal seismic interpretations). To operate efficiently, the software is being specifically developed to make use of the resources of the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) at the Australian National University (ANU). The development of these tools is been carried out in collaboration with researchers from the Colorado School of Mines (CSM) and the China University of Geosciences (CUG) and is at the stage of advanced testing.\nThe creation of individual 3D geological models will provide immediate insights. Users will also be able to combine models, either by stitching them together or by nesting smaller and more detailed models within a larger model. Comparison of the potential field response of a composite model with the observed fields will give users a sense of how comprehensively these models account for the observations. Users will also be able to model the residual fields (i.e., the observed minus calculated response) to discover features that are not represented in the input composite model.",

Previous laser-heated diamond-anvil cell (LHDAC) experiments on ferropericlase yielded an MgO melting curve consistent with ab initio predictions and suggested that FeO forms a complete solid solution with MgO at least up to ~40 GPa [Du and Lee, 2014]. But the melting behavior of ferropericlase at pressures greater than 40 GPa remains poorly constrained. We have performed LHDAC experiments using in situ two-dimensional multi-wavelength imaging radiometry and ex situ chemical and textural analyses of samples melted at ~70 GPa. Our results suggest that ferropericlase deviates from an ideal solid solution to possibly eutectic behavior, assuming the MgO melting curve is still predicted well by ab initio computational methods.\nAdditionally, we find an offset between the centers of the two-dimensional maps of emissivity and temperature. A tentative interpretation is that the (Mg, Fe)O becomes metallic at high pressures and temperatures [Ohta et al., 2014; Ovchinnikov, 2011; Ovchinnikov et al., 2012] and thus the intensity of light absorbed by the solid surrounding the molten region is strongly wavelength dependent, leading to the uneven variation in light intensity detected by the multi-wavelength imaging radiometric temperature measurement system and consequently abnormal correlation between temperature and emissivity.",

            "abstract": "Predicting the geomechanical response of geological formations to thermal, pressure, and mechanical loading is important in many engineering applications. The mathematical formulation that describes deformation of a reservoir coupled with flow and transport entails heterogeneous coefficients with a wide range of length scales. Such detailed heterogeneous descriptions of reservoir properties impose severe computational challenges for the study of realistic-scale (km) reservoirs. To deal with these challenges, we developed an Algebraic Multiscale Solver for ELastic geomechanical deformation (EL-AMS). Constructed on finite element fine-scale system, EL-AMS imposes a coarse-scale grid, which is a non-overlapping decomposition of the domain. Then, local (coarse) basis functions for the displacement vector are introduced. These basis functions honor the elastic properties of the local domains subject to the imposed local boundary conditions. The basis form the Restriction and Prolongation operators. These operators allow for the construction of accurate coarse-scale systems for the displacement. While the multiscale system is efficient for resolving low-frequency errors, coupling it with a fine-scale smoother, e.g., ILU(0), leads to an efficient iterative solver. Numerical results for several test cases illustrate that EL-AMS is quite efficient and applicable to simulate elastic deformation of large-scale heterogeneous reservoirs.",

This unique identifier provides the ability to link each physical sample to any analytical data undertaken on that sample, as well as to any publications derived from any data derived on the sample. IGSN is particularly important for geochemical and geochronological data, where numerous analytical techniques can be undertaken at multiple analytical facilities not only on the parent rock sample itself, but also on derived sample splits and mineral separates.\nAustralia now has three agencies implementing IGSN: Geoscience Australia, CSIRO and Curtin University. All three have now combined into a single project, funded by the Australian Research Data Services program, to better coordinate the implementation of IGSN in Australia, in particular how these agencies allocate IGSN identifiers. The project will register samples from pilot applications in each agency including the CSIRO National Collection of Mineral Spectra database, the Geoscience Australia sample collection, and the Digital Mineral Library of the John De Laeter Centre for Isotope Research at Curtin University. These local agency catalogues will then be aggregated into an Australian portal, which will ultimately be expanded for all geoscience specimens. The development of this portal will also involve developing a common core metadata schema for the description of Australian geoscience specimens, as well as formulating agreed governance models for registering Australian samples.\nThese developments aim to enable a common approach across Australian academic, research organisations and government agencies for the unique identification of geoscience specimens and any analytical data and/or publications derived from them. The emerging pattern of governance and technical collaboration established in Australia may also serve as a blueprint for similar collaborations internationally.",

            "abstract": "The link between widespread ocean oxygenation in the Neoproterozoic and the rise of animals has long been debated, largely because the timing and nature of oxygenation of the oceans remain poorly constrained. Strata deposited during the Cryogenian non-glacial interlude (660 to 635 Ma), between the Sturtian and Marinoan Snowball Earth glaciations, contain the earliest fossil evidence of animals. To quantitatively estimate patterns of seafloor oxygenation during this critical interval, we present uranium isotope (δ238U) data from limestone of the Taishir Formation (Fm) in Mongolia in two stratigraphic sections that are separated by ~75 km across the basin. The Taishir Fm hosts two large δ13C excursions that co-vary in total organic and inorganic (carbonate) carbon: a basal carbonate δ13C excursion to -4‰ in the Sturtian cap carbonate, followed by a rise to enriched values of +8‰, a second negative δ13C excursion to -7‰ referred to as the Taishir excursion, followed by a second rise to +10‰. Above the Sturtian glacial deposits, in the stratigraphic interval below the Taishir excursion, δ238U compositions have a mean value that is similar to that of modern seawater. After the Taishir excursion, the δ238U record exhibits a step decrease of ~0.3‰, and δ238U remains approximately constant until the erosional unconformity at the base of the Marinoan glacial deposits. We use a box model to constrain the uranium cycle behavior that best explains our observations. In the model, the best explanation for the less negative post-Sturtian values of δ238U is extensive oxygenation of the seafloor. Moreover, the model demonstrates that the higher δ238U values of the post-Sturtian limestones are inconsistent with an increased flux of uranium to the oceans due to post-Snowball weathering as the primary driver of the excursion. Thus, we favor a scenario in which there was a rise in oxygen levels following the Sturtian glaciation followed by a decrease in seafloor oxygenation coincident with the Taishir δ13C excursion. The U isotopic data, combined with modeling results, challenge the notion of a unidirectional oxygenation history of Neoproterozoic oceans.",

Many are familiar with reconstructing paleo-climate from ice core data, but few have a connection to current climate research. Many students ask questions like ‘What will our area be like in 20 years?’ or ‘How much does planting trees help?’ while few have the scientific language to engage in a discussion to answer these questions. Our work connects students to climate change research in several ways: first, teacher Keska Kemper engaged in field research with Dr. Heather Throop creating a ‘teacher in the field’ perspective for students in the classroom. Dr. Throop met with Keska Kemper’s students several times to develop an inquiry-based field study. Students predicted and then measured rates of respiration between different soil types in an urban park close to their school. Students then could compare their results from Portland, Oregon to Throop’s work across a rain gradient in Australia. Discussions about percent tree cover and soil carbon helped students see connections between land use changes and changes in carbon cycling.\nLast, students examined satellite imagery to determine percent tree cover and numberss of trees to compare to soil carbon in the same region. Students were able to examine imagery over the last 30 years to visualize land use changes in the greater Portland area.",

The composition of alteration solutions could be inferred from the mineralogy of weathering profiles and models for water-rock interaction. We have developed numerical models for basalt weathering by acidic solutions with different concentrations of weak (H2CO3) and strong (H2SO4, HCl) acids equilibrated with low- and high-pressure CO2 atmospheres. The results show that the observed clay stratigraphies could be produced by neutral to strongly acidic solutions. Weathering by solutions equilibrated with dense CO2 atmospheres produces abundant carbonates at depth, which are not observed in clay stratigraphies. The development of weathering profiles by S-, Cl-free solutions equilibrated with 6 mbar CO2 requires large volumes of water. These volumes are inconsistent with density and orientation of Noachian valley networks and climate models [3–5]. Weathering by sulfate-free fluids does not produce abundant Ca sulfates reported in the Mawrth Valley region [2]. Weathering by low-pH H2SO4-bearing solutions does not require elevated water/rock ratios, a warm climate, or a dense CO2 atmosphere. It leads to formation of Ca sulfates in middle parts of weathering profiles together with neutralized Mg-rich sulfate solutions at depth. The weathering could have occurred through transient volcanism- and impact-generated supply of strong acids, and volcanism-, impact-, obliquity-related warming and partial ice melting, consistent with climate models [3–5].\nRefs: [1] Carter, J. et al.

Pollen records from the tropical West Pacific indicate that the tropical vegetation is much sensitive to the environment and climate change, and their good correspondence with palaeocliamte change in glacial/interglacial timescales. It is shown that the range of the tropical montane rainforest was affected by the temperature change during the glacial cycle. But, from some marine core, the genera variation of tropical mid-upper montane pollen record is also distinct during the glacial cycle. In this study, examination of the pollen content of marine core MD06-3075 taken from Davao Gulf in the Southern Philippines reveals a ～116,000 year record of tropical vegetation change as well as the influence of the environment and climate variability on the ecosystem of the tropical area. Chronology was determined by 16 AMS 14C dates and a detailed oxygen isotope record. A high representation of pollen from tropical upper montane rainforest (mainly Podocarpus) (40-60%) during the last glacial period indicates that this forest type extended to lower attitudes. And the genera variations of the tropical mid-upper montane rainforest exist between the Phyllocladus and Podocarpus with the environment and climate changing. The pollen content of Phyllocladus is much high in marine isotope stage (MIS) 5, but Podocarpus is much higher in the glacial period. During the onset of MIS 5a and 5c, the percentage of Phyllocladus pollen declines dramatically.\nVegetation investigation in Mindanao, shows that Podocarpus exists in altitude ranging from 1,200-1,700 m, and Phyllocladus appear in altitude range from 1700-2100 m, but is more abundant above the 2,400 m. Thus, Phyllocladus might be more sensitive to the temperature change. Then, in this study, the pollen content of is much high during the interglacial period, especially MIS 5, might be caused by their need for different diurnal extremes of temperature, UV-B insolation and moisture.",

In this study, we present our recent simulation results of the energetic electron evolution during a geomagnetic storm using the UCLA 3D diffusion code. Following the plasmasheet electron injections and the subsequent acceleration, the electrons at different energies detected by MagEIS and REPT instruments onboard the Van Allen probes present rapid enhancement and slow decay in differential energy fluxes, and radial extension over different L-shells. The radial transport by ULF waves and local scattering by whistler-mode plasma waves and EMIC waves are energy dependent and may account for the observed different behaviors of hundreds keV to several MeV electrons. We incorporate radial diffusion and local acceleration and loss processes due to real-time whistler-mode wave observations to perform a 3D diffusion simulation. Our simulation results present the roles of each wave mode and the major controlling factors for the electron evolution with different energies.",

This network is actively being deployed and will ultimately consist of nine all-sky imagers. These imagers form a network providing continuous coverage over the western United States, including California, Oregon, Washington, Utah, Arizona and Texas extending south into Mexico. This network sees high levels of both medium and large scale wave activity. Apart from the widely reported northeast to southwest propagating wave fronts resulting from the so called Perkins mechanism, this network observes wave fronts propagating to the west, north and northeast. At least three of these anomalous events have been associated with thunderstorm activity. Imager data has been correlated with both GPS data and data from the AIRS (Atmospheric Infrared Sounder) instrument on board NASA’s Earth Observing System Aqua satellite. We will present a comprehensive analysis of these events and discuss the potential thunderstorm source mechanism.",

            "abstract": "Though it is accepted that Mars has a sulfur-rich metallic core, its chemical and physical state as well as its time-evolution are still unconstrained and debated. Several lines of evidence indicate that an internal magnetic field was once generated on Mars and that this field decayed around 3.7-4.0 Gyrs ago. The standard model assumes that this field was produced by a thermal (and perhaps chemical) dynamo operating in the Martian core. We use this information to construct parameterized models of the Martian dynamo in order to place constraints on the thermochemical evolution of the Martian core, with particular focus on its crystallization regime.\nConsidered compositions are in the FeS system, with S content ranging from ~10 and 16 wt%. Core radius, density and CMB pressure are varied within the errors provided by recent internal structure models that satisfy the available geodetic constraints (planetary mass, moment of inertia and tidal Love number). We also vary the melting curve and adiabat, CMB heat flow and thermal conductivity. Successful models are those that match the dynamo cessation time and fall within the bounds on present-day CMB temperature. The resulting suite of over 500 models suggest three possible crystallization regimes: growth of a solid inner core starting at the center of the planet; freezing and precipitation of solid iron (Fe- snow) from the core-mantle boundary (CMB); and freezing that begins midway through the core. Our analysis focuses on the effects of core properties that are expected to be constrained during the forthcoming Insight mission.",

California paleo-event data, published in the UCERF-3 reports in 2014 and 2015, reveal a curious property: The paleo-event rate for the whole collection of 32 sites exceeds about 4 per century, yet no events at any of the sites has been recorded in about 100 years. Possible explanation include extreme chance (probability about 1% or less) , large-scale clustering with ensemble cv greater than one, or overestimation of paleo-event rates in the pre-instrumental period. Any of these explanations has implications for recurrence. If the hiatus results from extreme luck, any interpretation of the data must be subject to chance occurrence as well. If clustering, single-site recurrence misses the most interesting features of earthquake behavior. So far, no physics-based model of California faulting explains the hiatus. If over-estimation, then some reported events are not earthquakes, and “recurrence” has dubious meaning.",

These transient events can be studied using extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray observations, among others. However, the impulsive events may occur in tenuous loops on small enough timescales that the heating is essentially not observed due to ionization timescales, and only the cooling phase is observed. Bremsstrahlung hard X-rays could serve as a more direct and prompt indicator of transient heating events. A hard X-ray spacecraft based on the direct-focusing technology pioneered by the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI) sounding rocket could search for these direct signatures. In this work, we use the hydrodynamical EBTEL code to simulate differential emission measures produced by individual heating events and by ensembles of such events. We then directly predict hard X-ray spectra and consider their observability by a future spaceborne FOXSI, and also by the RHESSI and NuSTAR spacecraft.",

Moving window cross correlation between NGRIP δ18O and sediment lightness (L*) reveals a consistently high and significant correlation. Based on this relationship, we construct a color-based climate index by calculating color reflectance values from the shipboard line-scanner images. Use of the line-scanner images provides a higher-resolution series (0.01 cm) than the 2-cm shipboard spectrophotometer data and permits for manual removal of disturbed pixels prior to analysis. At present, the composite benthic δ18O record at Site U1308 extends to MIS K2, providing age control beyond 3 Ma. Thus, we expect this to yield a near-continuous, centennial-scale record of 41-ky world interstadial-stadial variability back to Northern Hemisphere glacial inception.",

            "abstract": "The 1905 M8 Tsetserleg-Bulnay earthquake sequence, which occurred 14 days apart in Mongolia, constitutes one of the major continental strike-slip earthquake sequence ever documented. Although the surface ruptures associated with these two events are well-preserved due to dry climate, they had only been mapped in details along short sections. Here, using sub-metric optical satellite images ‘Pleiades’ with ground resolution of 0.5 m, complemented by field observation, we mapped in details the entire surface ruptures and we extensively measure co-seismic and cumulative offsets to understand earthquake propagation mechanisms and rupture processes for the two events.\nPreliminary results show that 1) the NE-SW trending Tsetserleg rupture is characterized by an average 2.5 m left-lateral slip on its central segment, and by a number of second-order antithetic and dip-slip ruptures around its main trace, 2) the E-W trending Bulnay rupture shows 4-6 m of left-lateral slip with high complexity in rupture geometry on its western part, where partitioning can be often observed. In contrast, co-seismic slip increases up to 8-10 m along the eastern part with the rupture trace being highly localized. Interestingly, this change in rupture behavior seems to correlate with a major change in the local geology, 3) the NNW-SSE trending Teregtiyn rupture, one of the subsidiary segments of the Bulnay rupture, is characterized by about 4 m of right-lateral slip, 4) another subsidiary branch of the Bulnay rupture, the N-S trending Dungen rupture is composed of a series of en-echelon tension cracks with no visible through going rupture. The geometry of the cracks suggests right-lateral shear. We show that the apparent complexity of the rupture geometry for the Tsetserleg- Bulnay sequence is actually compatible with the regional stress field (NNE-SSW trending compression). Our detail mapping shows that the Tsetserleg rupture, despite its large size, did not connect with the main Bulnay fault. Similarly, no evidence for connection between these two faults during previous events could be found.\nEventually, our preliminary results imply that the variation in rupture geometry and their related slip distribution seem to be controlled by pre-existing geologic structures, local surficial conditions, as well as dynamic rupture processes.",

The equatorial electrojet (EEJ) strength and the total electron content (TEC) data from low latitudes, over Indian longitudes, during the mid-winter season in the years 2005 to 2013 are used in this study. Five major and three minor SSW events occurred in the observation duration, wherein the solar activity had varied from minimum (almost no sunspots) to mini-maximum (approximately 50 sunspots of the solar cycle 24). Spectral powers of the quasi-16-day waves in the EEJ and the TEC have been found to be dominant and varying with solar activity and SSW strengths. Specifically, the spectral powers of quasi-16-day type variations during the three dramatic strong SSW events in the years 2006, 2009, and 2013 were found to be very high in comparison with those of other years. For these major events, the amplitudes of the semi-diurnal tides and quasi-16-day waves were found to be highly correlated and were maximum around the peak of SSW, suggesting a strong interaction between the two waves. However, this correlation was poor and the quasi-16-day spectral power was low for the minor events. A strong vertical coupling of atmospheres was noted in spite of the solar activity being relatively higher during 2013, which was, however, explained to be due to the occurrence of a strong SSW event. These results suggest that the wave dynamical vertical coupling of atmospheres is stronger during strong major SSW events and weaker during minor events. Also, SSW events play an important role in enabling the upward coupling of atmospheres even during high solar activity.",

            "abstract": "Natural hazards distress the global economy by disrupting the interconnected supply chain networks. Manufacturing companies have created cost-efficient supply chains by reducing inventories, streamlining logistics and limiting the number of suppliers. As a result, today’s supply chains are profoundly susceptible to systemic risks. In Thailand, for example, the GDP growth rate declined by 76 % in 2011 due to prolonged flooding. Thailand incurred economic damage including the loss of USD 46.5 billion, approximately 70% of which was caused by major supply chain disruptions in the manufacturing sector. Similar problems occurred after the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami in 2011, the Mississippi River floods and droughts during 2011 – 2013, and Hurricane Sandy in 2012. This study proposes a methodology for modeling supply chain disruptions using a Bayesian network analysis (BNA) to estimate expected values of countermeasures of floods, such as inventory management, supplier management and hard infrastructure management. We first performed a spatio-temporal correlation analysis between floods and extreme precipitation data for the last 100 years at a global scale. Then we used a BNA to create synthetic networks that include variables associated with the magnitude and duration of floods, major components of supply chains and market demands. We also included decision variables of countermeasures that would mitigate potential losses caused by supply chain disruptions. Finally, we conducted a cost-benefit analysis by estimating the expected values of these potential countermeasures while conducting a sensitivity analysis. The methodology was applied to supply chain disruptions caused by the 2011 Thailand floods. Our study demonstrates desirable typical data requirements for the analysis, such as anonymized supplier network data (i.e. critical dependencies, vulnerability information of suppliers) and sourcing data(i.e. locations of suppliers, and production rates and volume), and data from previous experiences (i.e. companies’ risk mitigation strategy decisions).",

The observed dipolarization effects on pitch-angle distributions (PAD) of electrons at the tailside in the inner plasmasheet during geomagnetic activity identified by AL index has been studied via analyzing data from THEMIS mission. We have shown that cigar distributions below about 1keV tend to become isotropized at the fronts at the dipolarization sites whereas isotropic distributions above 1keV tend to become more cigar-shaped (i.e., fluxes peak at pitch-angle of 0o and 180o). We have previously suggested that the ineffectiveness of Fermi acceleration below 1keV could be the factor causing this difference. We examine the dependence of this effect on radial distance from Earth taking place at or near dipolarization sites during times of geomagnetic activity. Because both the field line length and the properties of dipolarizations vary with radial distance. We anticipate significant dependence of this effect on radial distance. Our study contributes to our understanding of the electron environment during dipolarizations in Earth's magnetosphere.",

The monsoon is historically known to be influenced by El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The inter-annual and inter-decadal variability of seasonal precipitation over India strongly depends upon the ENSO phasing. The average southwest monsoon rainfall received during the years with El Niño was found to be less compared to normal years and the average rainfall during the northeast monsoon is higher in coastal Andhra Pradesh. ENSO is anti-correlated with Indian summer monsoon (ISM). The last prominent effect of ENSO on India’s monsoon occurred in 2009 with 23% reduction in annual rainfall, reducing summer sown crops such as rice, sugar cane etc. and pushing up food prices. Climatic resources endowment plays a major role in planning agricultural production in tropical and sub-tropical environment especially under rain-fed agriculture, and so contingent crop planning drawn on this relationship would help to mitigate the effects of ENSO episodes in the region. The unexplored area in this domain of research is the changes in the frequency and intensity of ENSO due to global warming and its impact on ENSO prediction and agricultural management practices. We analyze the last 30 years datasets of Pacific SST, and precipitation and air temperature over Southeast Asia to examine the evolution of ENSO teleconnections with ISM, as well as making estimates of drought indices such as Palmer Drought Severity Index. This research can lead toward better crop management strategies in the South Asian monsoon region.",

            "abstract": "A new and peculiar type of negative cloud-to-ground (-CG) lightning flash has been found from LMA observations of storms. Called a 'lull' flash, the discharge begins with a short duration (~5-10 ms), stepped leader and high peak current return stroke, followed by a brief period of inactivity. After a few tens to a few hundreds of milliseconds, the discharge reignites in the same location as a normal -CG. VHF observations show a complete lack of activity during the lull. The flashes were first identified from LMA observations during a 2008 lightning study in West Virginia (Krehbiel, 2012 ILDC), but are seen in other normally electrified storms. They are characterized by large negative peak currents (-50 to -150 kA) in NLDN data.\n Here we report detailed LMA, interferometer, and fast antenna observations of lull flashes obtained at Langmuir Laboratory in 2013. A series of six lull CGs occurred over an 11 min time interval in a small storm on August 5. Analysis of the observations shows the breakdown immediately produced a stepped leader that went straight to ground. The durations from initial breakdown to the return stroke (RS) was 2-15 ms, corresponding to leader speeds of 4×105 to 3×106 m/s. Peak currents of the RSs were -32 to -188 kA. The lulls began 10-29 ms after the RSs, and lasted 40-100 ms before the discharge reignited. By contrast, the durations, speeds and peak current values of the reignited first strokes were those of normal -CGs, namely, 9 to 105 ms, -11.5kA to 55.8kA, and 0.6×105 to 6.7×105 m/s. Further analysis indicates the lull flashes occurred when the storm had substantial negative charge but little lower positive charge, allowing the initial stroke to go straight to ground at a high speed. The energetic stroke somehow quenches the discharge a short time afterward while much negative charge remains, which leads to reignition and the second part of the discharge. Exactly how and why this happens remains an open question.",

The routine simulations will be assessed using comprehensive ARM observations of the atmosphere and land-surface states, particularly cloud observations. Since small changes in thermodynamic profiles can manifest large changes in cloud properties, successful simulations require careful initialization, appropriate forcing, and possibly suitable lateral boundary conditions. We use a multiscale data assimilation (MS-DA) system as a major methodology for producing forcing datasets required by the LES modeling. The MS-DA will be implemented in the regional Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model at a cloud resolving resolution (~1 km). MS-DA leverages existing reanalyses (e.g., the NCEP North American Regional Reanalysis, NARR) and operational forecasting products (e.g. the North American Mesoscale Forecast System, NAM; the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh, HRRR) products, and takes advantage of ARM observations to directly constrain the spectra of horizontal scales down to a few km. The analysis from the MS-DA allows deriving initial conditions and forcing datasets for a range of spatial and temporal scales, developing hydrometeor forcing, exploring time-varying boundary conditions, and diagnosing other needed thermodynamic variables. It is stressed that the datasets from the MS-DA are integrated with datasets from other sources to form ensembles to account for uncertainties. The methodologies, implementation and evaluations are presented.",

This novel capability permits a detailed interrogation of the time-temperature history of rocks containing apatite, zircon and other accessory phases by providing both (U-Th-Sm)/He and U-Pb ages (+trace element analysis) on single crystals. In situ laser microanalysis offers several advantages over conventional bulk crystal methods in terms of safety, cost, productivity and spatial resolution.\nWe developed and integrated a suite of analytical instruments including a 193 nm ArF excimer laser system (RESOlution M-50A-LR), a quadrupole ICP-MS (Agilent 7700s), an Alphachron helium mass spectrometry system and swappable flow-through and ultra-high vacuum analytical chambers. The analytical protocols include the following steps: mounting/polishing in PFA Teflon using methods similar to those adopted for fission track etching; laser He extraction and analysis using a 2 s ablation at 5 Hz and 2-3 J/cm2fluence; He pit volume measurement using atomic force microscopy, and U-Th-Sm-Pb (plus optional trace element) analysis using traditional laser ablation methods. The major analytical challenges for apatite include the low U, Th and He contents relative to zircon and the elevated common Pb content. On the other hand, apatite typically has less extreme and less complex zoning of parent isotopes (primarily U and Th). A freeware application has been developed for determining (U-Th-Sm)/He ages from the raw analytical data and Iolite software was used for U-Pb age and trace element determination. In situ double-dating has successfully replicated conventional U-Pb and (U-Th)/He age variations in xenocrystic zircon from the diamondiferous Ellendale lamproite pipe, Western Australia and increased zircon analytical throughput by a factor of 50 over conventional methods.\n",

            "abstract": "The dynamics of sediment particles in a flat bed channel is mainly determined by near bed coherent structures of the turbulent boundary layer. These vortices are characterized by intense velocity fluctuations, which produce an instantaneous increase of the bed shear stress and consequently, sediment particle entrainment and deposition. At low shear stress conditions, the sediment flux has an intermittent behavior, with a series of frequent and localized transport events. Although many experimental and computational investigations have addressed the interaction between the flow and the sediment particles, the mechanisms that generate the intermittency in the bedload transport flux are not yet fully understood. In order to give new insights into these processes, we develop a Lagrangian sediment transport model to simulate sediment transport in a flat bed channel. We couple direct numerical simulation (DNS) to solve the 3D Navier-Stokes equations for the flow and the discrete element method (DEM) to solve the particle dynamics (LIGGGHTS, http://www.cfdem.com/liggghts), using a two-way coupling approach. The objectives of this study are: i) to make a detailed description of the first-order statistics of sediment particles, and ii) to explore the intermittent nature of sediment transport in conditions near the threshold of motion. For low Shields numbers, we show that this intermittency has a fractal behavior, whose characteristics change as the shear stress increases.\nThis work was supported by Conicyt National-PhD Grant, Fondecyt grant 1130940 and ONR-G NICOP Project N622909-11-1-7041.",

Recent studies show that assumed cloud microphysics play a major role not only in forecasting precipitation, especially in cases of extreme precipitation events, but also in the quality of the passive microwave rainfall estimation. Evaluations of the various Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) model microphysics schemes in this study are based on a method that was originally developed to construct the a-priori databases of precipitation profiles and associated brightness temperatures (TBs) for precipitation retrievals. This methodology generates three-dimensional (3D) precipitation fields by matching the GPM dual frequency radar (DPR) reflectivity profiles with those calculated from cloud resolving model (CRM)-derived hydrometeor profiles. The method eventually provides 3D simulated precipitation fields over the DPR scan swaths. That is, atmospheric and hydrometeor profiles can be generated at each DPR pixel based on CRM and DPR reflectivity profiles. The generated raining systems over DPR observation fields can be applied to any radiometers that are unaccompanied with a radar for microwave radiative calculation with consideration of each sensor’s channel and field of view. Assessment of the WRF model microphysics schemes for several typhoon cases in terms of emission and scattering signals of GMI will be discussed.",

Using Earth analogue environments to estimate the small-scale spatial and temporal distributions of key geochemical signatures and (for habitability studies) biomarkers helps ensure that the chosen sampling strategies meet mission science goals.\nWe conducted two rounds of analogue expeditions to recent Icelandic lava fields. In July 2013, we tested correlation between three common biomarker assays: cell quantification via fluorescence microscopy, ATP quantification via bioluminescence, and quantitative PCR with universal primer sets. Sample sites were nested at four spatial scales (1 m, 10 m, 100 m, and > 1 km) and homogeneous at 'remote imaging' resolution (overall temperature, apparent moisture content, and regolith grain size).\nAll spatial scales were highly diverse in ATP, bacterial 16S, and archaeal 16S DNA content; nearly half of sites were statistically different in ATP content at α = 0.05. Cell counts showed significant variation at the 10 m and 100 m scale; at the > 1 km scale, the mean counts were not distinguishable, but the median counts were, indicating differences in underlying distribution. Fungal 18S DNA content similarly varied at 1 m, 10 m, and 100 m scales only. Cell counts were not correlated with ATP or DNA content at any scale. ATP concentration and DNA content for all three primer sets were positively correlated. Bacterial DNA content was positively correlated with archaeal and fungal DNA content, though archaeal correlation was weak. Fungal and archaeal correlation was borderline.\nIn July 2015, we repeated the sampling strategy, with the addition of a smaller-scale sampling grid of 10 cm and a third > 1 km location. This expedition also measured reflectance of the tephra cover and preserved mineral samples for future Raman spectroscopy in order to better distinguish between effects of geochemical variation and intrinsic biomarker variation.",

Back-trajectory analysis ties enhanced water to overshooting cloud tops 1 to 7 days prior to the intercept by the aircraft. Regional context is provided by water observations from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS).",

            "abstract": "Using the watershed as the unit to establish an integrated watershed observing system has been an important trend in integrated eco-hydrologic studies in the past ten years. Thus far, a relatively comprehensive watershed observing system has been established in the Heihe River Basin, northwest China. In addition, two comprehensive remote sensing hydrology experiments have been conducted sequentially in the Heihe River Basin, including the Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (WATER) (2007-2010) and the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research (HiWATER) (2012-2015).\nAmong these two experiments, an important result of WATER has been the generation of some multi-scale, high-quality comprehensive datasets, which have greatly supported the development, improvement and validation of a series of ecological, hydrological and quantitative remote-sensing models. The goal of a breakthrough for solving the “data bottleneck” problem has been achieved.  \nHiWATER was initiated in 2012. This project has established a world-class hydrological and meteorological observation network, a flux measurement matrix and an eco-hydrological wireless sensor network. A set of super high-resolution airborne remote-sensing data has also been obtained. In addition, there has been important progress with regard to the scaling research. Furthermore, the automatic acquisition, transmission, quality control and remote control of the observational data has been realized through the use of wireless sensor network technology. The observation and information systems have been highly integrated, which will provide a solid foundation for establishing a research platform that integrates observation, data management, model simulation, scenario analysis and decision-making support to foster 21st-century watershed science in China.",

            "abstract": "The Red Hills ultramafic massif in the South Island, New Zealand, is part of the Dun Mountain Ophiolite Belt (DMOB). The DMOB was created at the onset of subduction in a forearc setting in the Middle Permian, and it likely formed immediately prior to the establishment of a magmatic arc along the New Zealand and Australian portions of the Gondwanan margin. The Red Hills ultramafic massif records a two-stage history of high temperature mantle flow during subduction initiation along the Gondwanan margin. Initial deformation was homogeneous and fabrics are constrictional. Kilometer-scale deformation zones, part of the second stage of deformation, overprinted the early homogeneous fabric throughout the western portion of the massif. Timing of all high-temperature mantle deformation in the Red Hills was between 285 and 274 Ma during subduction initiation based on the earliest ages of igneous activity in adjacent volcanic rocks, and a new U-Pb zircon age of 274.55±0.43 Ma from a cross-cutting dike. We present a kinematic model to explain the occurrence of the constructional fabrics during subduction initiation, and find that the three-dimensional boundary conditions for deformation in the incipient mantle wedge must have been transtensional, with a dominant trench-parallel component of motion. Such a scenario indicates subduction likely initiated along an active oceanic transform fault. We test this model by kinematically restoring the Red Hills ultramafics to their Permian orientation, and find the consistent elongation direction of the constructional fabrics was oriented nearly parallel to the trench. Stage 2 deformation zones were variably oriented, but all accommodated normal motion. These results support a model where the incipient mantle wedge was undergoing highly oblique transtension, and the lack of evidence for contraction suggests the onset of subduction along the Permian margin of New Zealand occurred along a transform fault due to spontaneous, density driven processes.",

            "abstract": "The India summer monsoon (ISM) experiences long periods of wet and dry conditions frequently associated with floods and long dry spells. These events are largely governed by northward propagating boreal summer monsoon intraseasonal oscillations (MISO). Here we investigate intraseasonal variability of the ISM in the climate of the 20th century using the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (1979-2013) and examine future scenarios of climate change using models of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase-5 project. ISM is characterized with a large-scale index obtained by performing combined EOF analysis of precipitation, low level circulation, specific humidity and temperature. This index realistically defines the monsoon’s onset and withdrawal, is well correlated with seasonal precipitation in India and exhibits variance on intraseasonal timescales that are related to MISO and extreme wet and dry conditions in India. With similar approach we investigate the skill of the CMIP5 models in realistically simulating MISO in the ‘historic’ run (1951-2005) and examine projected changes in the amplitude and persistence these events in the high-emission representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) (2006-2100). MISO is well characterized in CMIP5 models that indicate significant increase in the intensity and frequency of extremely dry and wet conditions affecting India by 2050. We show that the main mechanism driving MISO in CMIP5 models are linked to the propagation of extratropical wave trains and interactions with the tropics. In a warmer planet, the increase in polar temperatures weakens the tropical-extratropical temperature gradient and decreases the intensity of the upper tropospheric jet. These changes in the jet and in the baroclinic structure of the atmosphere result in enhanced extratropical wave activity and more extreme events. We use a wave tracking algorithm to demonstrate these differences and explore physical and dynamical mechanisms underlying these changes.

            "abstract": "Within project SPOT (Short Period Ocean Tidal variations in Earth\nrotation) we develop a new high frequency Earth rotation model based on empirical\nocean tide models. The main purpose of the SPOT model is its application to space\ngeodetic observations such as GNSS and VLBI. We consider an empirical ocean tide model,\nwhich does not require hydrodynamic ocean modeling to determine ocean tidal angular\nmomentum. We use here the EOT11a model of Savcenko & Bosch (2012).\nWe investigate the effect of minor tides, for which recent studies show\nsignificant differences between admittance theory, hydrodynamic modeling\nand estimation from satellite altimetry. As empirical tide models do not provide ocean\ntidal currents, which are required for the computation of oceanic relative angular\nmomentum, we implement an approach first published by Ray (2001) to estimate\nocean tidal current velocities. The approach itself is validated by application to tidal\nheights from hydrodynamic ocean tide models, which also provide tidal current velocities.\nBased on the tidal heights and the associated current velocities the oceanic tidal angular\nmomenta are calculated. For the computation of the related short period variations\nof Earth rotation, we have re-examined the Euler-Liouville equation for an elastic Earth\nmodel with a liquid core. The focus here is on the consistent calculation of the elastic Love\nnumbers and associated Earth model parameters, which are considered in the Euler-Liouville\nequation for diurnal and sub-diurnal periods in the frequency domain. The preliminary SPOT\nmodel is compared in the time domain with the IERS2010 conventional model for a first\nevaluation. In addition, the effects of various Earth models and tidal models are quantified.",

            "abstract": "Mt. Baker and the adjacent Chilliwack batholith (MBC focus) in NW Washington preserve the longest magmatic record in the Cascade Arc, providing an excellent natural laboratory for examining the spatial, temporal and geochemical evolution of Cascade magmatism and links to tectonic processes. We present new U-Pb zircon LA-ICP-MS ages for 14 samples from MBC and neighboring regions of the north Cascades. The new results are up to 8 Myr different from previous K-Ar ages, illustrating the need for new age determinations in the Cascades. A maximum age of 34.74±0.24 Ma (2σ) (Post Creek stock) is consistent with 35-40 Ma ages for arc inception in the southern Cascades. The most voluminous MBC plutons cluster at 32-29 Ma, consistent with an early flare-up that also coincides with intrusion of the Index batholith farther south (2 samples at 33.26±0.19, 33.53±0.15 Ma). This flare-up is absent in the northernmost Cascades where the oldest pluton (Fall Creek stock) is 6.646±0.046 Ma, 4 Myr younger than previously cited. Earliest Cascade magmatism is progressively younger to the north of MBC, possibly tracing the northerly passage of the slab edge. MBC activity was continuous to 22.75±0.17 Ma (Whatcom Arm), marking the initiation of an 11 Myr hiatus. Magmatism resumed at 11.33±0.08 Ma (Indian Creek) and continued to the modern Mt. Baker cone, defining a pattern of southwesterly migration over ~55 km that may be attributable to slab rollback and arc rotation (e.g. Wells & McCaffrey 2013). Uniformity of the rate and direction of migration implies that rollback and rotation began at least 11 Myr ago. Post-hiatus magmas show distinct geochemical and petrologic characteristics including a major Pb isotopic shift. The 2.430±0.016 Ma Lake Ann stock contains 4.2 Ma zircon antecrysts, recording prolonged activity in that area. The 1.165±0.013 Ma Kulshan caldera ignimbrite contains ~200 Ma inherited zircons that may provide the first direct record of Wrangellian basement beneath the arc.",

            "abstract": "Marine seismic refraction have found that there are high Vp/Vs ratio regions in oceanic crusts at subducting oceanic plates (e.g, Cascadia subduction zone (2.0-2.8) (Audet et al., 2009)). Previous studies based on laboratory measurements indicated that Vp/Vs ratio is high when porosity and/or pore pressure is high (Christensen, 1984; Peacock et al., 2011). Although several studies have investigated the relationships between fracture distributions and Vp, Vs (e.g., Wang et al., 2012; Blake et al., 2013), the relationships for rocks (e.g., gabbro and basalt) composing oceanic crust are still unclear. This study reports the results of laboratory measurements of Vp, Vs (transmission method) at controlled confining and pore pressure and estimation of Vp/Vs ratio for thermally cracked gabbro which mimic highly fractured rocks in the high Vp/Vs ratio zone, in order to declare the dependence of fracture distributions on Vp/Vs. For the measurements, we prepared three type specimens; a non-heated intact specimen, specimens heated up to 500 °C and 700 °C for 24 hours. Porosities of intact, 500 °C and 700 °C specimens measured under the atmospheric pressure are 0.5, 3.4 and 3.5%, respectively. Measurements were conducted at a constant confining pressure of 50 MPa, with decreasing pore pressure from 49 to 0.1 MPa and then increasing to 49 MPa. While Vp/Vs for the intact specimen is almost constant at elevated pore pressure, the Vp/Vs values for the thermally cracked ones were 2.0~2.2 when pore pressure was larger than 30 MPa. In future, we will reveal the relationship between the measured elastic wave velocities and the characteristics of the microfracture distribution.\nThis work was supported by JSPS Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (Grant Number 26400492).",

Four types of sensors attached to the International Space Station are used to observe a lightning and TLEs. All four types of sensors work synchronously. Two complementary–metal–oxide semiconductor cameras at two different wavelengths (lightning and sprite imager: LSI) are used to capture a position of optical emission from lightning and TLEs. Six photometers at six different wavelengths (PHs) record an optical emission intensity at high temporal resolution. Each photometer works to detect an altitude of optical mission through the use of the optical spectrum that are absorbed by atmospheric gases. A very low frequency (VLF) receiver is used for recording Whistler mode waves from lightning.

A ranking of the land uses by their stable 127I and by their 239,240Pu concentrations were quite distinct from that of 134,137Cs, indicating 137Cs might not be a good geochemical proxy for radioactive 129I or Pu in the long-term, post-FDNPP accident. Being a proxy for the long-term fate of 129I, soil 127I content was well correlated to soil organic matter (SOM) content, regardless of land use type, suggesting that SOM might be an important factor controlling iodine biogeochemistry. Other soil chemical properties, such as Eh and pH, had strong correlations to soil 127I content, but only within a given land use (e.g., within urban soils). Organic carbon (OC) and Eh were positively, and pH was negatively correlated to 127I concentrations in surface water and rain samples. It is also noticeable that 127I in the bulk deposition was concentrated along the rainwater passage likely due to plant evapotranspiration activity, with all inorganic iodine being completely converted to organo-iodine by plant organic matter. 239,240Pu activities of all soil samples were well within the global fallout range, but the Fukushima-derived 239,240Pu was detectable at a distance ~61 km away, NW of FDNPP. However, it is confined to the litter layer, even three years after the FDNPP accident-derived emissions. 239,240Pu activities were significantly correlated with soil OC and nitrogen contents, indicating Pu may be associated with nitrogen-containing SOM, similar to what has been observed at other locations in the United States, e.g., Savannah River Site (SRS) and Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS). Together, these finding suggest that NOM plays an key role in controlling the fate and transport of I and Pu and may warrant greater consideration for predicting long-term stewardship of contaminated areas and evaluating various remediation options in Japan.",

            "abstract": "Microscopic two-phase fluid behavior in porous media is influenced by reservoir temperature, interfacial tension, pore structure, and porous medium characteristics (e.g., wettability), which vary significantly from one reservoir to the next. Pore-scale interfacial instabilities, such as snap-off and fingering phenomena, influence the stability, injectivity, mobility, and saturation within the reservoir. Therefore, understanding microscopic multiphase flow in porous media is crucial to estimating critical reservoir-scale characteristics, including storage capacity, leakage risk, and storage efficiency. Here we calculated fluid displacements within 3D pore spaces of natural sandstone using two-phase lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulation and characterized the influence of reservoir conditions upon multiphase flow. We classified the two-phase flow behavior that occurred under various conditions into three typical fluid displacement patterns on the diagram of capillary number (Ca) and viscosity ratio of the two fluids (M). Then the saturation of the nonwetting phase was calculated and mapped on the Ca–M diagram. The saturation map is useful to investigate suitable conditions in CCS and EOR. We further characterized dynamic pore-filling events (i.e., Haines jumps) from the fluid pressure variation. The results revealed the onset of capillary fingering in natural rock at a higher Ca than previously reported for homogeneous porous media, with the crossover region between typical displacement patterns much broader than in a homogeneous granular model. These differences between two-phase flow in natural rock and in a homogeneous porous structure could be the result of the heterogeneity of the natural rock.",

Frequency analysis of these measurements reveals differences between studies and field locations including nearly white spectra, as well as spectra with peaks at tidal and inertial periods. Based upon these results, previous authors have suggested several processes that may control diffuse flow rates, including tidally induced currents and ‘tidal pumping’, and have also suggested that there are no systematic controls. To further investigate the processes that control variability in diffuse flow, we use data from a new, deep-sea camera and temperature measurement system, the Diffuse Effluent Measurement System (DEMS), deployed during the July, 2014 cruise of the R/V Atlantis. The DEMS was deployed with DSV Alvin above a fracture network at the Phoenix vent within the ASHES vent field (Axial Seamount, 1541 mbsl). The system collected 20 seconds of imagery at 20 Hz and 24 seconds of temperature measurements at 1 Hz each hour over the period between July 22 and August 2nd. Velocities of the upwelling fluids were calculated using Diffuse Fluid Velocimetry (DFV; Mittelstaedt et al., 2010). DFV is a cross correlation technique that tracks moving index of refraction anomalies (i.e., hot parcels of fluid) through time. Over the ~12 day deployment, median flow rates ranged from 0.5 cm/s to 6 cm/s and mean fluid temperature anomalies from 0°C up to ~6.5°C, yielding an average heat flux density of 0.23 MW/m2. Spectral analysis of both the measured temperatures and calculated velocities yield a peak in normalized power at the semi-diurnal lunar period (M2, 12.4hrs), but no other spectral peaks above the 95% confidence level. Here, we present these results and discuss their implications for the tidal current and tidal pressure models of diffuse flow variability at the ASHES vent field.",

The Ice Sheet Mass Balance Inter-Comparison Exercise (IMBIE) is a joint-initiative of ESA and NASA aimed at producing a single estimate of the global sea level contribution to polar ice sheet losses. Within IMBIE, estimates of ice sheet mass balance are developed from a variety of satellite geodetic techniques using a common spatial and temporal reference frame and a common appreciation of the contributions due to external signals. The project brings together the laboratories and space agencies that have been instrumental in developing independent estimates of ice sheet mass balance to date.\nIn its first phase, IMBIE involved 27 science teams, and delivered a first community assessment of ice sheet mass imbalance to replace 40 individual estimates. The project established that (i) there is good agreement between the three main satellite-based techniques for estimating ice sheet mass balance, (ii) combining satellite data sets leads to significant improvement in certainty, (iii) the polar ice sheets contributed 11 ± 4 mm to global sea levels between 1992 and 2012, and (iv) that combined ice losses from Antarctica and Greenland have increased over time, rising from 10% of the global trend in the early 1990’s to 30% in the late 2000’s.\nDemand for an updated assessment has grown, and there are now new satellite missions, new geophysical corrections, new techniques, and new teams producing data. The period of overlap between independent satellite techniques has increased from 5 to 12 years, and the full period of satellite data over which an assessment can be performed has increased from 19 to 40 years. It is also clear that multiple satellite techniques are required to confidently separate mass changes associated with snowfall and ice dynamical imbalance – information that is of critical importance for climate modelling.\nThis presentation outlines the approach for the second phase of IMBIE, including the project organisation, the work programme and schedule, the main science goals, and its current status, and reviews the recent and historical contributions that the Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets have made to global sea level rise.",

In conjunction with its federal partners the US Geological Survey, Army Corps of Engineers and Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National Weather Service will operationally support both short term flood prediction and long term seasonal forecasting of water resource conditions. By summer 2016, the National Water Center will begin evaluating four streamflow data products at the scale of the NHDPlus river reaches (approximately 2.67 million). In preparation for the release of these products, from September 2014 to August 2015, the National Weather Service partnered with the Consortium of Universities for the Advancement of Hydrologic Science, Inc. to support the National Flood Interoperability Experiment which included a seven week in-residence Summer Institute in Tuscaloosa for university students interested in learning about operational hydrology and flood forecasting. As part of the experiment, 15 hour forecasts from the operational High Resolution Rapid Refresh atmospheric model were used to drive a three kilometer Noah-MP land surface model loosely coupled to a RAPID river routing model operating on the NHDPlus dataset. This workflow was run every three hours during the Summer Institute and the results were made available to those engaged to pursue a range of research topics focused on flood forecasting (e.g. reservoir operations, ensemble forecasting, probabilistic flood inundation mapping, rainfall product evaluation etc.) Although the National Flood Interoperability Experiment was finite in length, it provided a platform through which the academic community could engage federal agencies and vice versa to narrow the gap between research and operations and demonstrate how state of the art research infrastructure, models, services, datasets etc. could be utilized within the context of the operational water enterprise. This paper will provide a reflection on the experiment, present outcomes and describe the road map for continued engagement of the academic community and support for future Summer Institutes at the National Water Center.",

Simulations by a fully compressible non-hydrostatic global atmospheric model, NICAM, and its SG regional model, a Stretched-NICAM, were performed for March-April-May 2011 with various resolutions and global stretching factors. The comparison of weeklong accumulative precipitation amounts between the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite data, the quasi-uniform and SG simulations have shown that a stretched run leads to better representation of storms and associated precipitation, since the errors generated in the outer regions with a coarser grid spacing do not seriously affect the inner domain centered at the focal point. For season-long simulations, in one particular set of stretched runs with the focal point located in the eastern U.S., a larger grid spacing causes the artificial suppression of baroclinic development of mid-latitude eddies in the Southern Hemisphere, weakens the eddy-driven polar-front jet (PFJ), and resulting in a cold bias at mid- to high-latitudes. However, in the Northern Hemisphere, by contrast, the aforementioned changes are less apparent, such that each hemisphere acting nearly independent of the other. Therefore, for the SG runs, the mean temperature was maintained at the region of interest and the increased number of moderate to heavy precipitations, which are also frequent in TRMM, were observed, thus the benefits of increased resolution are realized.",

The algorithm retrieves aerosol optical depth (AOD), size distribution of aerosol, and aerosol type in 0.1 degree grid resolution by look-up tables, which is used in retrieving optical properties of aerosol using inversion products from Aerosol Robotic NETwork (AERONET) sun-photometer observation. To improve the accuracy of aerosol algorithm, first, this algorithm considered the annually estimated radiometric degradation factor of TANSO-CAI suggested by Kuze et al. (2014). Second, surface reflectance was determined by two methods: one using the clear sky composite method from CAI measurements and the other the database from MODerate resolution Imaging Sensor (MODIS) surface reflectance data. At a given pixel, the surface reflectance is selected by using normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) depending on season (Hsu et al., 2013). In this study, the retrieved AODs were compared with those of AERONET and MODIS dataset for different season over five years. Comparisons of AODs between AERONET and CAI show reasonable agreement with correlation coefficients of 0.65 ~ 0.97 and regression slopes between 0.7 and 1.2 for the whole period, depending on season and sites. Moreover, those between MODIS and CAI for the same period show agreements with correlation coefficients of 0.7 ~ 0.9 and regression slopes between 0.7 and 1.0, depending on season and regions. The results show reasonably good correlation, however, the largest error source in aerosol retrieval has been surface reflectance of TANSO-CAI due to its 3-days revisit orbit characteristics.",

One general challenge of noise-based monitoring approaches is the spurious measurements ascribe to the sporadic nature of the excitation pattern, especially for the anthropogenic noise at the intermediate frequencies (a few Hz). Thus, it is imperative to characterize the spatiotemporal distribution of the ambient seismic wavefield at the field scale. A massive multi-stage hydraulic fracturing treatment was conducted in the Weiyuan shale play, located at the center of Sichuan basin in China during the period from 25 October to 10 November 2014. As part of the microseismic monitoring experiments, we deployed a small temporary array, which is composed of 22 broadband seismic stations and is centered at the wellhead of the treatment well with an aperture of ~3 km. With the continuous records for about 15 days, we statistically analyzed the time-dependent properties of the ambient seismic wavefield between 0.1 and 10 Hz. The preliminary analysis showed that the passive records are dominated by surface wave energy that exhibits a moderate daily variation. Daily beamforming results also reveal that there is a persistent ring of maximum amplitude with a slowness around ~0.55 s/km between 1 and 3 Hz. As a consequence, the daily noise cross-correlation functions within this frequency range appear to be remarkably symmetric and stable. With the ambient noise interferometry technique, we plan to detect the potential velocity changes in the regions surrounding the injection zone, and explore its possible correlation with the spatial distribution of the microseismic events.",

            "abstract": "Why, as cities grow in size and density, do some “ignite” into global engines of innovation and prosperity while others grow into dense slums? This is our overarching question as we explore a novel framework for thinking about the evolution of cities and, more specifically, the divergent trajectories they may take. We develop a speculative framework by examining the analogies between the evolution of cities and the evolution of stars. Like cities, stellar gas clouds can grow in mass, eventually reaching temperature and density thresholds at which they ignite the hydrogen fuel in their cores to become full-fledged stars. But not all gas and dust clouds share this fate. Some never achieve the critical conditions and do not unleash the energy we witness emanating from our own star. Some stars, after exhaustion of their initial fuel, evolve to incredible density but lack the temperature to ignite the next fuel needed to maintain the critical interactions that release so much energy. Instead they fade away to an object of intense density, but without the vibrant emission of light and energy associated with non-degenerate stars. The fate of cities, too, depends on the density of interactions – not of gas molecules, but of people. This elevated rate of face-to-face interactions in an urban core is critical for the transition to an innovative and creative economy. Yet, density is not enough, as evidenced both by many megacities in the developing world and degenerate stars. What is this missing element that, along with density, ignites a city and turns it into an innovation engine? With these analogies in mind, we explore whether they are useful for framing future research on cities, what questions they may help pose, and, more broadly, how physical, social, and natural scientists can all contribute to an interdisciplinary endeavor to understand cities more deeply.",

However, the role of wettability at pore-scale still remains poorly understood. In this study, we carried out a series of pore-scale simulations of multiphase displacement process to investigate the impact of wettability heterogeneity on trapping, sweep efficiency and relative permeability using lattice Boltzmann method. We first artificially generated mixed-wet bead pack models with varying degree of wettability by introducing spatial heterogeneity. Based on these models, we then calculated the relative permeability curves and performed the drainage and imbibition simulations to obtain the residual non-wetting phase distributions. The results indicate that strong wettability heterogeneity results in a decrease of non-wetting phase permeability due to the pinned interfaces at wettability discontinuities. The wetting phase permeability as well as the sweep efficiency are largely influenced by the degree of wettability rather than the wettability heterogeneity. The non-wetting phase is observed to be less trapped with strong heterogeneity conditions.",

            "abstract": "The allocation of photosynthate among the plant components (e.g., leaves, stems, and roots) plays an important role in regulating plant growth, competition, and terrestrial carbon cycle. However, the carbon allocation process is still a weak part in the earth system models (ESMs). In this study, the Integrated BIosphere Simulator (IBIS) model coupled with a dynamic carbon allocation model (IBISAL) is used to explore the impact of carbon allocation on the terrestrial carbon cycle. This dynamic carbon allocation model suggests that plants should allocate the largest part of carbon to the plant components which need to capture the most limiting resources, such as light, water and nitrogen. In comparison to the results of original IBIS model using fixed allocation ratios, the net ecosystem productivity, global biomass and soil organic carbon simulated by IBISAL model decreased by13.4% , 9.9% and 20.8%, respectively . The dynamic allocation scheme tends to benefit roots allocation. Because roots had short turnover times, high roots allocation led to the decreases of global carbon sink and carbon pool sizes. The observations showed that the carbon allocation ratios changed with temperature and precipitation. The dynamic carbon allocation model could reproduce this phenomenon correctly. The results show that the dynamic carbon allocation ratios of boreal evergreen forests and C3 grasses are consistent well with the observations. However, the IBISAL, and another three ESMs (i.e., CESM1-BGC, IPSL-CM5A-MR and NorESM1-ME models) adopting dynamic allocation scheme overestimated the stems allocation of tropical forests. This study shows the substantial influences of carbon allocation on the carbon sink and carbon pool sizes. Therefore, improving estimations of carbon allocation by ESMs are an important and effective path to reduce uncertainties in the global carbon cycle simulation and climate change prediction.",

            "abstract": "Understanding the spatial variability of deep-water facies is critical to deep-water research because of its revealing information about the relationship between desity flow processes and their resultant sedimentary sequences. The Cherokee Group in the Anadarko Basin, northeastern Texas Panhandle, provides an opportunity to investigate an icehouse-greenhouse Pennsylvanian hybrid system that well demonstrates the intricacies of vertical and lateral facies relationships in an unconfined fan-delta fed deep-water slope to basinal setting. The stratigraphic section ranges in thickness from 150 to 460 m. The cyclic sedimentation and foreland basin tectonics resulted in a complex stratal architecture that was sourced by multiple areas of sediment input.\nThis investigation consists of wireline-log and core data. Five-thousand wireline logs were correlated in an area of over 9500 sq km to map out six depositional sequences that are separated by major flooding events. These events are correlative over the whole area of study. Six cores, that sample nearly the complete section, were described for lithofacies. Lithofacies are recognized based on depositional features and mineralogy:(1) Subarkose, (2) Lithicarkoses, (3) Sandy siliciclastic conglomerate, (4) Muddy calcareous conglomerate, (5) Crinoidal packstone, (6) Oodic grainstone, (7)Pelodic grainstone, (8) Ripple laminated mudrock, (9) faint laminated mudrock. The integration of isopachs of depositional sequences with the lithofacies has allowed the delineation of the spatial and temporal evolution of the slope to basin-floor system. Thin-to-thick bedded turbidites, hyperconcentrated density flow deposits (slurry beds), and debris and mud flow deposits were observed and can be used to better predicte lithofacies distributions in areas that have less data control. These mixed siliciclastic and carbonate deposits can be carrier beds for the hydrocarbons generated from the enclosing organic-rich (TOC ranges from 0.55 to 6.77wt%), dysareobic to anaerobic mudstones.",

            "abstract": "Gross moist stability has been used to study the link between tropical deep convection and large scale circulation in a moist static energy (MSE) budget. Here we aim to calculate the gross moist stability from more realistic profiles of vertical velocity and extend it beyond deep convection, adding shallow convection. Based on a principal component analysis, we were able to decompose the vertical velocity into two leading modes, which are dominated by deep and shallow convection, respectively. According to the deep and shallow modes, we calculate the gross moist stability for these two modes and discuss the roles of deep and shallow convection in the MSE budget. The gross moist stability of deep convection tends to be positive in the tropics, while that of shallow convection is negative over most areas of the tropics. This implies that deep convection exports MSE to stabilize the atmosphere and shallow convection imports MSE to enhance deep convection and destabilize the atmosphere. Based on the spatial distribution, moisture tends to reduce the gross moist stability of deep convection, while dry static energy has little impact. Deeper deep convection tends to have greater gross moist stability. For shallow convection, on the other hand, the gross moist stability is affected not only by low-level moisture but also mid-level moisture. Both moister low-level and drier mid-level moisture reduce the gross moist stability of shallow convection. Greater low-level dry static energy, which is associated with warmer sea surface temperature, also tends to reduce gross moist stability.",

            "abstract": "Today, topographic, erosion, and climate data are measured in abundance but the role of climate in modulating sediment production and landscape evolution remains difficult to characterize. Studies that quantify climate controls on denudation by analyzing multiple study areas with varying temperature and precipitation are hampered by site-to-site variations in topography, substrate, and vegetation, as well as uncertainty in the state of landscape adjustment. Alternatively, sedimentary records at a given location provide a means to track how climate variations influence sediment flux and weathering rates and mechanisms. Cosmogenic nuclide concentrations in well-dated sediment cores provide a means to quantify how erosion rates track climate, particularly orbital (or Milankovitch), fluctuations. Most cosmogenic analyses of erosion assume steady exhumation. By contrast, time-varying cosmogenic concentrations at a given location require a systematic inverse analysis of inheritance to decipher actual erosion rate changes that integrate in observed cosmogenic concentrations. Failure to consider transient erosion results in biased interpretations of paleo-erosion datasets. Here, we use a suite of inverse methods to constrain erosion rates through the last 50kya at our forested, steepland field site in western Oregon where Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) erosion rates are observed to be 2.5x faster than modern rates. Both paleoclimate simulations and paleovegetation data indicate colder and drier conditions during the LGM across our study domain, such that temperature, rather than precipitation, may be the dominant driver of geomorphic processes during glacial intervals in many mid-latitude regions. Other climate dependencies will apply elsewhere, but the coupling of process theory and climate reconstructions with well-characterized sedimentary records will help resolve the enigmatic role of climate fluctuations.",

One combined reflection and wide-angle seismic profile has been acquired in the scope of the Antithesis cruise North of Barbuda at around 18°N using 26 ocean bottom seismometers, a 4.5 km digital streamer and a 7800 cu. inch seismic source. 13 measures of heat flow were taken in the vicinity of the profile. Forward modelling of the wide-angle seismic data reveals the deep structure of the subduction zone in the study area.\n- The subducting Atlantic oceanic plate is about 5-7 km thick, modelled by one single layer.\n- Sedimentary thickness on the oceanic plate is low with maximal some hundreds of meters of sediments at the trench.\n- The thickness of combined two sedimentary layers is ~5 km near the trench and decreases toward the arc, based on reflection seismic data.\n- The ~18-km-thick Caribbean crust at the arc is subdivided in 3 layers, overlain by a 2-to-4-km-thick layer with velocities ranging from 4.5 to 5.5 km/s that might correspond to volcanic products or high velocity sediments.\n- The velocities in the lower crustal layer reach 7.4 km/s probably corresponding to mafic rocks and plutons.\n- The velocities in the upper mantle were constrained to be 8.00-8.20 km/s underneath the arc as well as underneath the oceanic crust, thereby excluding the existence of extensive serpentinization of the mantle through water entering the subduction zone.\n The anomalously low heat flow indicates cold calculated temperatures along the interplate contact, suggesting a hydrothermal cooling that is possibly restricted to the shallow crustal aquifer. Alternatively, these low temperatures may be due to a depressed thermal structure of the oceanic crust related to the slow-spreading at the medio-Atlantic ridge.\nA wide-angle seismic profile about 150 km to the South in the vicinity of Guadeloupe Island shows a higher sedimentary thickness at the accretionary wedge. However, the crustal thickness and slab geometry are similar indicating that the subduction process is homogeneous along this segment. Wide-angle seismic profiles acquired during the Antithesis cruise further north at the Anegada Passage show a more shallow situated slab.",

            "abstract": "Lake water storage changes (ΔSw) is an important indicator of the hydrologic cycle and greatly influences lake expansion/shrinkage over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Accurate estimation of ΔSw will contribute to an improved understanding of lake variations in the TP. Based on water balance, this study explored the variations of ΔSw for the Lake Selin Co (the largest closed lake on the TP) during 2003-2012 using the Water and Energy Budget-based Distributed Hydrological Model (WEB-DHM) together with two different evapotranspiration (ET) algorithms (the Penman-Monteith method and a simple sublimation estimation approach for water area in unfrozen and frozen period). The contributions of basin discharge and climate causes to the ΔSw are also quantitatively analyzed. The result shows that WEB-DHM can well reproduce daily discharges at two gauges. Both daytime and nighttime land surface temperature (LST) simulated by the WEB-DHM agreed well with MODIS LST for both basin-averaged values and spatial patterns. Compared with the ET reference values estimated from the basin-wide water balance, ET estimates in this study showed better performance than three global ET products in reproducing basin-averaged ET. The modeled ET at point scale matches well with short-term in situ daily measurements. Lake inflows and precipitation over the water area had stronger relationships with ΔSw in warm season and monthly scale, whereas ET from the water area had remarkable effects on ΔSw in cold season. The above three factors contributed about 87% of the total changes of ΔSw during 2003-2012.",

            "abstract": "Validation of oceanic retrieved rainfall from satellite remains a difficult task due to limited surfaced-based observations of precipitation. Currently, the dual-polarimetric S-band radar located on the Kwajalein Atoll (KPOL) is the only fully continuous operational radar in a tropical ocean setting – making the Kwajalein site an invaluable tool for evaluating tropical oceanic precipitation retrievals from the TRMM and GPM missions. Perturbations in oceanic rainfall during El Niño time periods lead to large discrepancies in passive and active microwave rainfall retrievals, which are linked to regional variations in convective organization (i.e. changes in isolated convection and mesoscale convective systems). The Kwajalein ground validation program provides the opportunity to validate the instantaneous TRMM rain products as a function of convective regime. To investigate regime-based relationships, multiple case studies are observed from 2008-2014 encompassing shallow convection, deep isolated convection, organized convection, and stratiform precipitation. The main objectives are to observe which rain rates retrieved from either PR or TMI algorithms are in agreement with KPOL-derived values and if distinct biases exist between TMI and PR as a function of convective regime. Among the cases examined, biases with KPOL are largest in deep isolated convection for TMI and PR retrievals. Furthermore, TMI tends to overestimate PR and KPOL estimations in broad stratiform precipitation. Examination of the GPROF rain rate retrieval and a comparison with rain estimates from the GPM core satellite will be used to further investigate the differences between the TRMM and KPOL-derived rain rates.",

The increasing demand for water and finite water sources have led to long-term groundwater depletion, creating an obstacle to sustainability in several regions of the world under the pressures of population growth and climate change. The High Plains Aquifer System has an area of 450,000 km2, and is the most pumped aquifer and one of the most important agricultural areas in the United States. In this study, we use coupled climate-hydrological model simulations from the NCAR Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble Project to investigate the groundwater storage changes in the High Plains Aquifer under future climate changes and also to explore how such groundwater storage changes might in turn affect the climate through land-atmosphere coupling. Preliminary results indicate that not only the amount of groundwater recharge declines, but the seasonal variations of groundwater recharge also become smaller, resulting in widespread water table decline in a future warmer climate. We will explore how such variations associate to projected changes in precipitation and evapotranspiration, and feedback to the climate.",

            "abstract": "Quantifying feedbacks between the global carbon cycle and Earth's climate system is important for predicting future atmospheric CO2 levels and informing carbon management and energy policies. We applied a feedback analysis framework to three sets of Historical (1850–2005), Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (2006–2100), and its extension (2101–2300) simulations from the Community Earth System Model version 1.0 (CESM1(BGC)) to quantify drivers of terrestrial and ocean responses of carbon uptake. In the biogeochemically coupled simulation (BGC), the effects of CO2 fertilization and nitrogen deposition influenced marine and terrestrial carbon cycling. In the radiatively coupled simulation (RAD), the effects of rising temperature and circulation changes due to radiative forcing from CO2, other greenhouse gases, and aerosols were the sole drivers of carbon cycle changes. In the third, fully coupled simulation (FC), both the biogeochemical and radiative coupling effects acted simultaneously. We found that climate-carbon sensitivities derived from RAD simulations produced a net ocean carbon storage climate sensitivity that was weaker and a net land carbon storage climate sensitivity that was stronger than those diagnosed from the FC and BGC simulations. For the ocean, this nonlinearity was associated with warming-induced weakening of ocean circulation and mixing that limited exchange of dissolved inorganic carbon between surface and deeper water masses. For the land, this nonlinearity was associated with strong gains in gross primary production in the FC simulation, driven by enhancements in the hydrological cycle and increased nutrient availability. We developed and applied a nonlinearity metric to rank model responses and driver variables. The climate-carbon cycle feedback gain at 2300 was 42% higher when estimated from climate-carbon sensitivities derived from the difference between FC and BGC than when derived from RAD. These differences are important to quantify and understand because different model intercomparison efforts have used different approaches to compute feedbacks, complicating intercomparison of ESMs over time. Underestimating the climate-carbon cycle feedback gain would result in allowable emissions estimates that would be too low to meet climate change targets.",

            "abstract": "Kilauea is generally characterized by its modern effusive activity, but the past 2500 years were dominated by cycles of explosive and effusive eruptions lasting 100’s of years (Swanson et al. 2012). These different eruption styles may reflect variable volatile contents in the source that control magma ascent rate and storage durations (e.g., Sides et al. 2014). A detailed petrological study of the dominantly explosive Keanakako’i tephras (1500-1820 CE) was undertaken to better understand the storage and transport conditions preceding high-energy eruptions. Here, we focus on preliminary results for olivine from the 1500 CE Basal Reticulite (>600 m fountain; May et al. 2015). Olivine major (Fe, Mg), minor (Mn, Ca, Ni) and trace (Li, Na, Al, P, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Co, Zn) element traverses and 2D maps were collected for 10 crystals and reveal two major populations. The dominant population has homogeneous Fo89 and Fo87 cores with thin (3-12 μm) rims of intermediate composition (Fo87.5-88.5). Normal, reverse, and complex trace element zoning (Al, P, Ti, Cr) is prominent in these otherwise homogenous (Fo, Ni, Ca, Mn) crystals. 2D maps reveal early skeletal growth and the progressive decrease of Cr from core to rim suggests olivine and Cr-spinel crystallization, which should produce significant Fo zoning. Absence of Fo zoning could imply significant storage time in a reservoir allowing homogenization. The majority of rim compositions are out of equilibrium with adhering glass, and Fe-Mg modeling indicates that their residence within the carrier melt was of a few days. A second population consists of strongly zoned (normal and reverse) crystals with a wide range of core Fo (78 to 89) and Fo82-84 rims. Timescales from Fe-Mg zoning are up to 1 year, and may record storage histories before interaction with the carrier melt. The diversity in olivine zoning suggests at least two stages of magma mixing, and a more complex evolution for the magmas that fed the reticulite eruptions than a simple closed-system and fast transport of a volatile-rich magma from the source to the surface.",

The main geological edges are fault lines and the borders of geological or rock bodies of different density, magnetic nature, and so on. Gravity gradient tensor data have been widely used in geophysical exploration for its large amount of information and containing higher frequency signals than gravity data, which can be used to delineate small scale anomalies. Therefore, combining multiple components of gradient tensor data to interpret gravity gradient tensor data is a challenge. This needs to develop new edge detector to process the gravity gradient tensor data. In order to make use of multiple components information, we first define directional total horizontal derivatives and enhanced directional total horizontal derivatives and use them to define new edge detectors. In order to display the edges of different amplitudes anomalies simultaneously, we present a normalization method. These methods have been tested on synthetic data to verify that the new methods can delineate the edges of different amplitude anomalies clearly and avoid bringing additional false edges when anomalies contain both positive and negative anomalies. Finally, we apply these methods to real full gravity gradient tensor data in St. Georges Bay, Canada, which get well results.",

            "abstract": "We started to develop a new methodology for real-time tsunami inundation forecast system (Aoi et al., 2015, this meeting) using densely offshore tsunami observations of the Seafloor Observation Network for Earthquakes and Tsunamis (S-net), which is under construction along the Japan Trench (Kanazawa et al., 2012, JpGU; Uehira et al., 2015, IUGG). In our method, the most important concept is involving any type and/or form uncertainties in the tsunami forecast, which cannot be dealt with any of standard linear/nonlinear least square approaches. We first prepare a Tsunami Scenario Bank (TSB), which contains offshore tsunami waveforms at the S-net stations and tsunami inundation information calculated from any possible tsunami source. We then quickly select several acceptable tsunami scenarios that can explain offshore observations by using multiple indices and appropriate thresholds, after a tsunami occurrence. At that time, possible tsunami inundations coupled with selected scenarios are forecasted (Yamamoto et al., 2014, AGU). Currently, we define three indices: correlation coefficient and two variance reductions, whose L2-norm part is normalized either by observations or calculations (Suzuki et al., 2015, JpGU; Yamamoto et al., 2015, IUGG).\nIn this study, we construct the TSB, which contains various tsunami source models prepared for the probabilistic tsunami hazard assessment in the Japan Trench region (Hirata et al., 2014, AGU). To evaluate the propriety of our method, we adopt the fault model based on the 2011 Tohoku earthquake as a pseudo “observation”. We also calculate three indices using coastal maximum tsunami height distributions between observation and calculation. We then obtain the correlation between coastal and offshore indices. We notice that the index value of coastal maximum tsunami heights is closer to 1 than the index value of offshore waveforms, i.e., the coastal maximum tsunami height may be predictable within appropriate thresholds defined for offshore indices. We also investigate the effect of rise-time.\nThis work was partially supported by the Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (CSTI) through the Cross-ministerial Strategic Innovation Promotion Program (SIP), titled “Enhancement of societal resiliency against natural disasters” (Funding agency: JST).",

Set to launch in 2017, the mission takes advantage of a 3U+ CubeSat design to reduce cost and complexity traditionally associated with a space weather mission of this kind. This mission seeks to quantify the precipitation of relativistic electrons from the radiation belts using a pair of energetic particle detectors (EPDs). The spacecraft will also fly a fluxgate magnetometer (FGM) for determining the pitch angle distribution of the particles, which in conjunction with the EPDs will provide insight to the mechanisms responsible for their loss. Electromagnetic Ion Cyclotron (EMIC) waves are thought to be a significant contributor to the precipitation of electrons trapped in the magnetosphere; however without direct measurement to verify the exact energy range of the particles with high angular resolution, the precise role of these waves is as yet undetermined. ELFIN is unique as it is the first spacecraft that will perform direct pitch angle measurements of the high-energy electrons at the region in the ionosphere where the particles are being lost. Together with correlative measurements from THEMIS, Van Allen Probes and the upcoming ERG mission, ELFIN will provide a unique dataset of magnetospheric wave-particle interactions that will be able to contribute to a marked increase in the fidelity of current space weather models.",

            "abstract": "The degree of mountain denudation depends on the occurrence of shallow landslides, and on granite slopes the characteristics of the soil layer structure and the occurrence characteristics of shallow landslides vary with the degree of mountain denudation [1]. However, it is not well known how the degree of whole-mountain denudation affects the occurrence characteristics of shallow landslides. Therefore, this study estimated the degree of whole-mountain denudation and then examined the characteristics of shallow landslides.\nFirst, we focused on four granitic regions in which shallow landslides had occurred recently. The slopes were categorized into gentle slopes on the summit (Gen-S), upper dissected slopes (Up-S), and lower dissected slopes (Low-S) in ascending order of denudation. The top convex line of Up-S represented the upper convex break of the slope (Up-C), which was the dissection front between the Pliocene and the Pleistocene. The top convex line of Low-S represented the lower convex break of the slope (Low-C), which was the dissection front for the postglacial period [1]. Second, we calculated the rate of Low-S, which represented the degree of whole-mountain denudation in the postglacial period. Third, we determined the occurrence frequency of shallow landslides from the landslide area as a ratio of the number of square kilometers [%].\nGreater numbers of shallow landslides occurred in Up-S in some areas where the degree of whole-mountain denudation was as low as 4% and Low-C was located downstream. On the other hand, greater numbers of shallow landslides occurred in Low-S in some areas where the degree of whole-mountain denudation was as high as 35% to 44% and Low-C was located upstream. In conclusion, areas with lesser degrees of whole-mountain denudation occur readily with shallow landslides in Low-S, whereas those with higher degrees of denudation occur with shallow landslides in Up-S.\n[1] Matsuzawa, M., Kinoshita, A., Takahara, T., Ishizuka, T.: The effects of the degree of mountain denudation on soil layer structure and shallow landslide properties in granite areas in Japan, Japanese Geomorphological Union, 36-1, 23-48, 2015.(in Japanese)",

            "abstract": "Flood plain ecosystems are mosaics of physical units and the sediments contained within these often display a high degree of spatial and temporal complexity. This paper reconstructs the environmental history of a large floodplain ecosystem in North-west New South Wales. Sediment cores, up to 14 m in depth, extracted from the Narran floodplain ecosystem have undergone detailed stratigraphic, geochemical and textural analyses. When combined with a series of dates obtained from various depths in the cores a complex environmental history is revealed. The Narran floodplain ecosystem is between 40,000 to 85,000 years old that has undergone three major changes in state. From a relatively simple initial state, divergent evolution processes resulted in an ecosystem that experienced periodic and major changes in water and sediment inputs. Finally, a change in flow and sediment regimes approximately 25,000 years ago resulted in the formation of the current floodplain ecosystem. Three major thresholds have thus been recorded, the character of which differs markedly. This study highlights how various numerical methods, in association with standard sedimentological techniques, can assist in unravelling the environmental complexity, identification of thresholds, their character as well as the divergent and convergent trajectories of change in floodplain ecosystems.",

While PyC mobilization and leaching from fire-impacted terrestrial ecosystems are thought to be the primary source of dissolved PyC (DPC) in riverine environments, the influence of recent biomass burning on the fluxes of DPC leached from soils remains poorly quantified. Here we examined differences in DPC leaching fluxes between (1) red pine sites that experienced post-logging slash burning in the late 19th century, and (2) sugar maple sites that show no evidence of burning in the past 200 years. We collected spring snowmelt leachates from zero-tension lysimeters installed underneath O and E soil horizons of Spodosols in both red pine and sugar maple ecosystems. We quantified DPC in leachates by measuring Benzene Polycarboxylic Acids. We also determined DPC in leachates collected from lysimeters installed beneath B horizons in the red pine ecosystem. Average concentrations of DPC leached from O and E horizons in red pine and sugar maple sites were 1.22 ± 0.33 mg L-1 and 0.96 ±0.58 mg L-1, respectively. Although DPC concentrations in either the O or E horizon leachates did not differ between the two ecosystem types, the proportion of DPC in the dissolved organic C pool was 62% higher in red pine than in sugar maple in E horizon leachates. In red pine sites, DPC concentrations were significantly lower in the B horizon leachates than in the upper soil horizons leachates, likely due to DPC immobilization in the mineral subsoil. Our preliminary results showed that a single production of PyC was not the main source of DPC exported from soils, suggesting that DPC mobilized and released from the ecosystems studied here likely integrates PyC produced at a millennial time-scale in the Great Lakes Region.",

The distribution of denser than air gases released from the underground is governed by gravity, turbulence and dispersion. Once emitted, the gas distribution is initially driven by buoyancy and a gas cloud accumulates on the ground (gravitational phase); with time the density gradient becomes less important due to dispersion or mixing and gas distribution is mainly governed by wind and atmospheric turbulence (passive dispersion phase). Natural analogues provide evidences of the impact of CO2 leakage. Dangerous CO2 concentration in atmosphere related to underground emission have been occasionally reported although the conditions favouring the persistence of such a concentration are barely studied.In this work, the dynamics of CO2 in the atmosphere after ground emission is assessed to quantify their potential risk. Two approaches have been followed: (1) direct measurement of air concentration in a natural emission site, where formation of a “CO2 lake” is common and (2) numerical atmospheric modelling. Two sites with different morphology were studied: (a) the Cañada Real site, a flat terrain in the Volcanic Field of Campo de Calatrava (Spain); (b) the Solforata di Pomezia site, a rough terrain in the Alban Hills Volcanic Region (Italy). The comparison between field data and model calculations reveal that numerical dispersion models are capable of predicting the formation of CO2 accumulation over the ground as a consequence of underground gas emission. Therefore, atmospheric modelling could be included as a valuable methodology in the risk assessment of leakage in natural degassing systems and in CCS projects. Conclusions from this work provide clues on whether leakage may be a real risk for humans and under which conditions this risk needs to be included in the risk assessment.",

            "abstract": "Recent detailed mapping of the Willamette River floodplain in northwestern Oregon reveals insights into the floodplain landforms, their formative processes, and historical landscape transformations. Hierarchical mapping classification based mainly upon lidar topography, supplemented by aerial photographs, historical channel and soil maps, and targeted coring of floodplain soils, was carried out for 200 km of the mainstem Willamette River floodplain above Willamette Falls where floodplain landforms mainly reflect fluvial and anthropogenic influences.\nStark differences in the character and distribution of floodplain landforms and their underlying stratigraphy give rise to three distinct process regimes along the fluvial portion of the Willamette River. Floodplain surfaces along 60 km of the Upper Willamette River floodplain generally rise 1-2 m above the low-flow water surface and are bisected by complex assemblage of overflow channels and large-amplitude abandoned bends formed by avulsions along this historically multi-thread anastomosing reach. Downstream, the 90 km-long Middle Willamette River between Corvallis and Newburg Pool becomes increasingly entrenched within its floodplain, with floodplains gradually rising up to 8 m above the low flow water surface. These floodplain surfaces are dominated by ridge and swale topography with occasional floodbasins reflecting gradual meander migration and floodplain aggradation. The 50 km-long Newberg Pool is entrenched and confined by Pleistocene Missoula flood deposits and bedrock valley walls. This low-gradient reach extends to the lip of the15-m high Willamette Falls.\nHistorical declines in flood magnitude, bed-material supply, large wood, and bank erodibility result in a more stable modern-day floodplain with narrower active-channel corridor flanked by relict landforms formed by historical flow and sediment regime. Landscape transformations vary across the three process regimes but are greatest along Upper Willamette River which has transformed from an anastomosing channel to a more stable wandering planform. The inventory of habitats and landforms produced by this mapping provide a framework for developing restoration strategies that accord with present-day floodplain processes.",

We work across traditional boundaries between government, science, and communities to build trust and understanding in ocean and coastal science. We work closely with decision makers to understand their priority needs and identify opportunities for science to have a meaningful impact, and we engage scientists and other experts to compile and translate information into innovative products that help to meet those needs. This often sparks new collaborations that live well beyond the products themselves. Through this unique model, we are deepening relationships and facilitating an ongoing dialogue between scientists, decision-makers, and communities.\nThe West Coast of the United States is already experiencing climate-driven changes in marine conditions at both large and small spatial scales. Decision makers are increasingly concerned with the potential threats that these changes pose to coastal communities, industries, ecosystems, and species. Detecting and understanding these multi-stressor changes requires consideration across scientific disciplines and management jurisdictions. Research and monitoring programs must reflect this new reality: they should be designed to connect with the decision makers who may use their results. In this presentation, I will share how we are drawing from the West Coast Ocean Acidification and Hypoxia Science Panel - an interdisciplinary team of scientists convened by Ocean Science Trust from California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia - to develop actionable guidance for long-term monitoring for long-term change. Building on our experiences working with the Panel, I will discuss the unique model that boundary organizations provide for sustained dialog across traditionally siloed disciplines and management regimes, and share best practices and lessons learned in working across those boundaries.",

            "abstract": "Speleothems that grow in well-ventilated zones of caves have not been widely used in paleoclimate studies, yet may provide paleotemperature records. These zones are characterized by low CO2 concentrations year-round and, in temperate climates, large seasonal temperature fluctuations. They are typically avoided for paleoclimate reconstruction due to concerns about kinetic isotope effects (KIE). However, speleothems in general seem to be sensitive to KIE, even in non-ventilated areas and can nonetheless provide useful paleoclimate records. At Westcave Preserve (Westcave), a shallow, well-ventilated cave in central Texas, we have found seasonal temperature differences recorded in both the oxygen isotope and clumped isotope compositions of speleothem calcite grown on glass-plate substrates harvested from active drips.\nAlthough growth rates in this cave are relatively rapid, speleothem analogs in Westcave are growing near oxygen-isotopic equilibrium with their drip waters (between the calibrations of Kim and O’Neil, 1997 and Coplen, 2007). We have tested the compatibility of the Zaarur et al. (2013) clumped isotope bulk solution thermometer calibration to glass-substrate calcite in the cave collected during various months. This technique can provide absolute temperatures, but is sensitive to kinetic isotope effects, often significantly overestimating growth temperatures of speleothems. When this thermometer was applied to calcite collected from near where the plates were impacted by drip water, it overestimated measured temperatures by 7.7 ± 4.3°C, showing moderate KIE. When applied to calcite away from the drip impact, it overestimated temperatures by 18.7 ± 4.2°C, showing KIE increasing away from the drip. Measured monthly average temperatures in the cave ranged seasonally between 8 and 28°C, and daily temperatures vary significantly. At Westcave, calcite growth rates increase with temperature, and the calcite may therefore preferentially record warmer daily or hourly temperatures. In temperate regions, seasonal temperature records are lacking. Our results suggest near-entrance speleothems may be a valuable proxy for seasonal temperatures, but may overestimate mean seasonal temperatures in seasonally resolved records due to KIE and/or temperature-dependent calcite growth rates.",

Natural hazards associated with surface conditions include dust storms, post-fire erosion and flooding in addition to crop failure. Less obvious, though continually occurring, are microbial-induced gas emissions that are also significantly impacted by surface conditions. With so much at stake, it is surprising that in today’s technological world there are few if any sensors designed for monitoring the top few mm or cm of the soil surface. In particular, remotely sensed data is expected to provide near-real time surface conditions of our Earth, but we lack effective tools to measure and calibrate surface soil moisture.

            "abstract": "W-phase moment tensor inversions have been proven to be a reliable method for rapid characterization for large earthquakes. W-phase is a long period seismic (100s-1000s) wave that arrives between P and S waves and can be synthesized by normal mode summation. For global purposes it has been used at USGS, PTWC and IPGS. These implementations provide moment tensor solutions within 30-60 min after the origin time of moderate and large worldwide earthquakes. W-phase inversion has been successfully implemented at the Chilean National Seismological Center (CSN) for regional distances (5º-12º) obtaining the first solution ~6 minutes after the earthquake. However until now it has been used only with broadband instruments, which saturate in the near field. Therefore, we use near field records from high-rate regional GPS data for some large earthquakes that have occurred in the past five years and with relatively dense azimuthal and station density coverage.Originally the inversion takes the time interval between Tp and Tp + 15 *delta (distance from the epicenter in degrees). In the near field W-phase doesn’t develop as well as in the intermediate or far field, therefore we increased the time window for these events. Here we tried different time windows to find the most accurate result for each earthquake and to reduce time response for tsunami early warning purposes. We took near field GPS for the following earthquakes: The 2010 Mw 8.8 Maule Earthquake, the 2011 Mw 9.1 Tohoku Earthquake, The 2014 Mw 8.2 Iquique Earthquake, and The 2014 Mw 7.8 Iquique Aftershock. The solutions for the examples tested here are potentially available 5 min after the origin time. The calculated magnitude for each earthquake is: Mw 8.9 for the Maule earthquake, Mw 9.1 for the Tohoku earthquake, Mw 7.9 for the Iquique earthquake, and Mw 7.8 for the Iquique aftershock. The mechanisms, as expected, are thrust with some variations with respect to the WCMT from National Earthquake Information Center. The results for each earthquake for strike, dip and rake are: 11, 12, 65; 209, 9.3 113; 358, 47, 104 and 308, 9, 40, respectively. Such variations are likely due to local structure mismodeling, limited number of stations used and azimuthal coverage. With more GPS data available and the possibility of including real time processing solutions will have significant improvements.",

            "abstract": "Once pyrite and heavy metal containing mining waste reacts with water and air it produces acid mine drainage (AMD) and leads to the other environmental problems such as contamination of surrounding soils. Pyrite is the major source of AMD and it can be controlled using a biological-electrochemical dissolution method. By enhancing the dissolution of pyrite using fuel cell technology, not only mining waste be beneficially utilized but also be treated at the same time by. As pyrite-containing mining waste is oxidized in the anode of the fuel cell, electrons and protons are generated, and electrons moves through an external load to cathode reducing oxygen to water while protons migrate to cathode through a proton exchange membrane. Iron-oxidizing bacteria such as Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, which can utilize Fe as an electron donor promotes pyrite dissolution and hence enhances electrochemical dissolution of pyrite from mining waste. In this study mining waste from a zinc mine in Korea containing 17 wt% pyrite and 9% As was utilized as a fuel for the fuel cell inoculated with A. ferrooxidans. Electrochemically dissolved As content and chemically dissolved As content was compared. With the initial pH of 3.5 at 23℃, the dissolved As concentration increased (from 4.0 to 13 mg/L after 20 d) in the fuel cell, while it kept decreased in the chemical reactor (from 12 to 0.43 mg/L after 20 d). The fuel cell produced 0.09 V of open circuit voltage with the maximum power density of 0.84 mW/m2. Dissolution of As from mining waste was enhanced through electrochemical reaction. Application of fuel cell technology is a novel treatment method for pyrite and heavy metals containing mining waste, and this method is beneficial for mining environment as well as local community of mining areas.",

            "abstract": "Planktic foraminifera thrive worldwide and calcify from the mixed layer (surface) through the thermocline (intermediate) to the sub-thermocline (deep). The accuracy of paleoenvironmental reconstruction using planktic foraminifera largely depends on the knowledge of their depth habitat. While fossile planktic foraminiferal depth habitat can be estimated from oxygen-carbon isotope ratio of calcite, little is known about Oligocene planktic foraminifera. Among them planktic foraminifera Dentoglobigerina venezuelana calcifies within the mixed layer during the early Oligocene but inhabits at thermocline or below from the late Oligocene to the early Pliocene. However, no continuous isotopic record of D. venezuelana through the Oligocene have been achieved owing to poor carbonate recovery in order to confirm the depth habitat shift of D. venezuelana from the mixed layer to the thermocline. Here we reveal D. venezuelana depth habitat change throughout Oligocene using deep sea sediment deposited in the eastern equatorial Pacific, IODP U1333 and U1334. We identified planktic foraminiferal assemblage and measured oxygen-carbon isotope of D. venezuelana along with Paragloborotalia siakensis group (mixed layer species). By comparison of D. venezuelana isotopes with those of Pg. siakensis group, studied interval is divided into following 3 phases. From the early to middle Oligocene (Phase I: ~28.7 to 27.4 Ma), D. venezuelana probably inhabited at upper mixed layer while Pg. siakensis group calcified within lower mixed layer. During middle to late Oligocene (Phase II: ~27.4 to 26.3 Ma), the depth habitat of D. venezuelana and Pg. siakensis group were indistinguishable with each other at around lower mixed layer. From late Oligocene to earliest Miocene (Phase III: ~26.3 to 23.0 Ma), D. venezuelana again deepened the depth habitat to thermocline depth while Pg. siakensis group continued to inhabit within lower mixed layer. The two-step depth habitat change accompanied planktic foraminiferal assemblage shift from thermocline species dominance to mixed-layer species prevalence, which suggested depth habitat change was related to thermocline deepening in the eastern equatorial Pacific.",

We survey long-term observation data obtained by ground-based passive receivers installed in Iceland and Svalbard and the Plasma Waves and Sounder experiment (PWS) mounted on the Akebono satellite. This data set includes two simultaneous appearance events, during which frequencies of aurora roar and MF burst detected at ground are different from that of Terrestrial Hectometric Radiation (THR) observed by the Akebono satellite passing over the ground-based stations. This frequency difference supports the previously proposed idea that auroral roar and THR are generated at different altitudes across F peak. There is no possibility that simultaneous observations indicate the identical generation region of auroral roar and THR. When the Akebono satellite passing over the ground-based stations detects THR, auroral roar and/or MF burst does not always appear (at 90 percent in this study). This tendency is explained in terms of the idea that the Akebono satellite can detect THR emissions coming from a wider region, and a considerable portion of auroral roar emissions generated in the bottomside F region is absorbed in the D/E regions.",

The data show that there is a density peak in the evening in addition to the daytime peak. This evening peak at mid-latitude is particularly distinctive in summer, even larger than the daytime peak, but disappears in winter. At high latitudes, however, the evening peak becomes moderate and the altitude of the peak is also similar to the daytime peak while it is much higher than the latter at mid-latitude. We also find that the two-peak structure in summer is more distinctive in the polar cap region (e.g., in Svalbard) than in the auroral region (e.g., in Tromsø).

            "abstract": "In 2013, California’s Senate Bill 4 required an independent science study to assess current and potential future hydraulic fracturing practices in California, and to evaluate potential impacts on water, air, seismicity, ecological systems, and health. The study, completed in July 2015, found that hydraulic fracturing currently supports about one quarter of California’s oil production, and is expected to continue to do so in the near future. California’s experience with hydraulic fracturing differs from that in other states because operators mostly conduct relatively shallow stimulations in relatively high-permeability reservoirs. The upside of this is that operations use relatively little water, but the downside is that in a few locations, fractures could extend into protected groundwater. The study also found that direct impacts of hydraulic fracturing appear small but have not been fully investigated in California. These direct impacts all stem from the use of stimulation chemicals and the study calls for precautionary limits on chemical use. Indirect impacts, which are not directly attributable to the stimulation activity but rather caused by oil and gas production enabled by stimulation, are likely more important. For example, underground injection of produced water from a hydraulically fractured reservoir causes problems common to all oil and gas production, such as the risk of inducing an earthquake or causing groundwater contamination. To date, there have been no reported cases of induced seismicity associated with produced water injection in California. However, it is difficult to distinguish California’s frequent natural earthquakes from those possibly caused by water injection. California also disposes of produced water from all oil and gas production in percolation ponds and injects some of this water into protected aquifers. These are serious issues, often tagged to hydraulic fracturing but actually common to all oil and gas production.",

            "abstract": "The Sierra Crest shear zone (SCSZ), an ~300 km long Late Cretaceous dextral transpressive ductile-brittle shear system in the eastern central Sierra Nevada, CA partitioned tectonic boundary conditions during a fundamental rheological transition in the upper crust from ductile to brittle deformation due to the exhumation and cooling of the arc. The SCSZ represents a well-exposed and data-rich ‘natural laboratory’ to study the mechanisms driving evolving strain partitioning and rheology.\nThe SCSZ transitioned from a broad swath of partitioned ductile shear zones, comprised of anastomosing simple shear dominated zones separated by pure shear dominated domains, to a complex partitioned brittle fault system, expressed as brittle slip, veining, brecciation, and pseudotachylyte formation along discrete structures, as arc magmatism shut down, the arc cooled, and exhumation rates increased. Previous studies have documented evolving deformation partitioning in the ductile system indicated by variable fabric development ranging from preserved bedding to mylonites, the spread of lineation orientations, and variable kinematics. Multi-generational brittle fabrics that are variably ductilely deformed and the orientation of 1st and 2nd order brittle structures, both concordant and discordant with ductile shears, indicate that partitioning also evolved during the complex rheological transition.\nStructural, strain, P-T-t, geochronologic, and field data provide controls on parameters (e.g. lithology, fluids, strain, preexisting structure, timing, P-T conditions) needed to model the development of the SCSZ in anisotropic crust undergoing a transition in rheology and tectonic boundary conditions. As rheological heterogeneity will lead to deformation partitioning throughout intervening scales, it is unrealistic to apply single scale models to this investigation. Thus, we propose to compare the above observations to predictions made by a model (MOPLA; Jiang, 2014) of progressive deformation that incorporates rheology-controlled partitioning.",

            "abstract": "In 2001 the NRC Report “A Climate Services Vision: First Steps Toward the Future” examined the state and trends of climate services. That report included a definition of this term that has lost no relevance: “The timely production and delivery of useful climate data, information, and knowledge to decision makers.” The original entities delivering such services, at the state level, are represented by the American Association of State Climatologists (AASC). In 1986 the NOAA Regional Climate Center program was initiated, followed in 1994 by the NOAA Regional Climate Sciences and Assessments. Since 2010 we have seen the establishment of the USDI Climate Science Centers and the Landscape Conservation Cooperatives, the NOAA Regional Climate Service Directors, and the USDA Regional Climate Hubs. The recent expansion of formal programs has essentially filled out the agency “niche space.” Other non-governmental and private entities are also expanding into this space. The present profusion runs a risk of creating a perception of excessive duplication in some quarters, including those funding these enterprises. Collectively these activities form what can be thought of as an ecosystem of climate services. A certain amount of replication is desirable, healthy, and necessary, but beyond some point can be excessive unless the total capacity remains insufficient. Each component has come into existence for a different set of reasons. Since these components were invented by human beings, their subsequent evolution can in theory be guided by humans. The history and purpose of each component needs to be borne in mind, with capsule descriptions suitable for rapid delivery to the decision-makers who approve the support for the various components. Good communication among the components is therefore essential for a healthy and functional overall system. This in turn calls for the ability to adequately represent the role of each of those components, a purpose best informed through actual participation in multiple components, to obtain the necessary familiarity.",

An important scientific goal is the characterization of extreme weather in current day, and future climate change scenarios. In this work, we consider the problem of finding extreme patterns (such as Tropical Cyclones, Extra-Tropical Cyclones, Atmospheric Rivers) in large climate archives. We present the successful application of Deep Learning, a state-of-the-art machine learning methodology, for finding spatio-temporal patterns. The results from the application of this method can be used for characterizing statistical changes in extreme weather events (both their intensity and frequency) under climate change scenarios.\nMethods\nWe formulate the problem of finding patterns as a classic image classification task. We prepare labeled data (ground truth is obtained from the application of the TECA tool, a catalog of known events from the literature and hand-labeling). We utilize 8 input variables for Tropical Cyclones and 2 variables for Atmospheric Rivers. We construct a Deep Convolutional Neural Network based on the deep learning library-NEON-developed at Nervana System, in conjunction with the Spearmint package for hyperparameter optimization. Our optimal network consists of 4 layers (2 convolutional layer and 2 fully connected layers).\nResults\nWe obtain good classification performance for extreme weather patterns: 99% accuracy for Tropical Cyclones, 90.5% (US Atmospheric Rivers) and 89.5% (European Atmospheric Rivers).

            "abstract": "In a previous study (Nozu, 2012, Zisin; Nozu, 2013, AGU), we developed a new simplified source model (the pseudo point-source model) to explain strong ground motions from a mega-thrust earthquake. In the model, the source spectrum associated with the rupture of a subevent is modeled and it is assumed to follow the omega-square model. By multiplying the source spectrum with the path effect and the site amplification factor, the Fourier amplitude at a target site can be obtained. Then, combining it with the Fourier phase characteristics of a smaller event, the time history of strong ground motions from the subevent can be calculated. Finally, by summing up contributions from the subevents, strong ground motions from the entire rupture can be obtained. The pseudo point-source model developed for the Tohoku earthquake consisted of nine subevents. The model could reproduce the velocity waveforms and the Fourier spectra quite accurately at sites close to the source region along the east coast of Japan from Iwate to Ibaraki. In this study, we investigated the applicability of the model to larger distances. In particular, we simulated strong ground motions in the Kanto Region including Tokyo. In the application of our model to larger distances, careful consideration of the path effect was required. The original path model used in our previous study can be expressed as P(f)=(1/r)*exp(-πfr/Qβ) and Q=114f0.92(Satoh and Tatsumi, 2002). However, there are two factors not included in the original path model that could potentially lead to underestimation at larger distances: (1) the geometrical spreading term inversely proportional to the square root of distance at larger distances, and (2) the lower bound of the Q value at lower frequencies (e.g., Aki, 1980). The simulation based on the original path model resulted in underestimation of Fourier spectra at larger distances as shown in Figure (a). In this case the error was an increasing function with the distance. Then we employed a revised path model with these effects, in which the Fourier spectra decreases with the square root of distance at distances greater than 80 km and the Q value is constant below 1.0 Hz. By using the revised path model, a good agreement was achieved between the observed and synthetic Fourier spectra in the Kanto Region as shown in Figure (b).",

            "abstract": "Since the middle 20th Century -- and earlier-- a large variety of climate services have become available to existing and potential users needing climate information to inform a decision of interest to them. Climate may play a minor to major role in such decisions. Originally, most such information was delivered in the form of products, which could range in complexity from the simplest possible form, the original or edited data themselves, to more highly developed and manipulated information in the form of summaries, typically in fixed forms. These were intended to serve a need for widely, routinely, and frequently requested basic statistical information about climate, in the form of tables, graphics and sometimes narratives. With the rise of the internet this approach has given way to applications that can generate tailored summaries on demand, with the user able to control date intervals, statistical thresholds, formats, and a variety of other issues of both substance and style. A much richer environment for the creation of such information now exists. This tradition arose largely through the combined efforts of NOAA and predecessor agencies via the National Weather Records Center, renamed the National Climate Center, renamed the National Climatic Data Center, now combined with geophysical and oceanographic counterparts into the National Centers for Environmental Information, in analogy with the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. A steady partner during this history has been the membership of the American Association of State Climatologists. The first efforts were intended to address to most common questions and to assist with reduction in workload in answering multiple repeated requests for the same information. Over time users and uses have become increasingly sophisticated, specialized, and diverse. Increasing efforts are directed to a more systematic approach, involving explicit engagement of stakeholders, to learn which applications to develop or improve. The recent merger of three centers into NCEI presents opportunities in this realm.",

            "abstract": "The Early Mississippian (ca. 359–345 Ma) represents one of the most important greenhouse-icehouse climate transitions in Earth history. Closely associated with this critical transition is a prominent positive carbon isotope excursion (δ13C ≥ +5‰) that has been documented from numerous stratigraphic successions across the globe. This δ13C excursion, informally referred to as the TICE (mid-Tournaisian carbon isotope excursion) event, has been interpreted as resulting from enhanced organic carbon burial, with anticipated outcomes including the lowering of atmospheric CO2 and global cooling, the growth of continental ice sheets and sea-level fall, and the increase of ocean oxygenation and ocean redox changes. The casual relationship between these events has been addressed from various perspectives but not yet clearly demonstrated. To document the potential redox change associated with the perturbation of the carbon cycle, we have analyzed rare earth elements (REE) and trace elements across the TICE in two sections across a shallow-to-deep water transect in the southern Great Basin (Utah and Nevada), USA. In both sections, the REE data show a significant positive cerium (Ce) anomaly (Ce/Ce* = Ce/(0.5La+0.5Pr)). Prior to the positive δ13C shift, most Ce/Ce* values are around 0.3 (between 0.2 and 0.4). Across the δ13C peak, Ce/Ce* values increase up to 0.87, followed by a decrease back to 0.2~0.3 after the δ13C excursion (Figure 1). The positive Ce anomaly is best interpreted as recording expansion of oxygen minimum zone and anoxia resulted from increased primary production. This is consistent with a significant increase of nitrogen isotopes (δ15N) across the δ13C peak. Integration of the carbon, nitrogen, and REE data demonstrates a responsive earth systems change linked to the perturbation of the Early Mississippian carbon cycle.",

            "abstract": "Sequences of repeating earthquakes are caused by repeating slips of small patches surrounded by aseismic slip areas at plate boundary zones. Recently, they have been detected in many regions. In this study, I detected repeating earthquakes which occurred in Japan and the world by using seismograms observed in the Japanese seismic network, and investigated the space-time characteristics of inter-plate aseismic slip on the subducting plate boundaries. To extract repeating earthquakes, I calculate cross-correlation coefficients of band-pass filtering seismograms at each station following Igarashi [2010]. I used two data-set based on USGS catalog for about 25 years from May 1990 and JMA catalog for about 13 years from January 2002.\nAs a result, I found many sequences of repeating earthquakes in the subducting plate boundaries of the Andaman-Sumatra-Java and Japan-Kuril-Kamchatka-Aleutian subduction zones. By applying the scaling relations among a seismic moment, recurrence interval and slip proposed by Nadeau and Johnson [1998], they indicate the space-time changes of inter-plate aseismic slips. Pairs of repeating earthquakes with the longest time interval occurred in the Solomon Islands area and the recurrence interval was about 18.5 years. The estimated slip-rate is about 46 mm/year, which correspond to about half of the relative plate motion in this area. Several sequences with fast slip-rates correspond to the post-seismic slips after the 2004 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake (M9.0), the 2006 Kuril earthquake (M8.3), the 2007 southern Sumatra earthquake (M8.5), and the 2011 Tohoku-oki earthquake (M9.0). The database of global repeating earthquakes enables the comparison of the inter-plate aseismic slips of various plate boundary zones of the world. I believe that I am likely to detect more sequences by extending analysis periods in the area where they were not found in this analysis.",

            "abstract": "The Mexico subduction zone has a complex geometry involving along-strike variations in dip of the Cocos plate. What is interesting about the slab dip is that under central Mexico it becomes horizontal for 250 km before it descends steeply beneath the Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt. Numerous studies have examined the geometry of the flat slab, however, few studies have focused on the along-strike transitions from flat to steeper subduction. Some of those studies have suggested the slab tends to tear along the sharp transitions in slab dip as the slab rolls back. In this study, the eastern transition from flat to steeper subduction in Oaxaca, Mexico is examined in greater detail using high resolution seismic data to provide a better understanding of how the slab morphology changes during slab rollback. We determine the geometry based on local seismicity, nonvolcanic tremor (NVT), and slow slip utilizing a deployment of broadband seismometers and continuous GPS receivers distributed in and around Oaxaca. Seismic data are processed with Antelope to detect and locate earthquakes. We construct depth contours of the subducting slab surface down to 100 km to illustrate that the transition from flat to steeper subduction in Oaxaca occurs rapidly via a stronger flexure than what is shown in previous studies. We find no gaps in seismicity to suggest a tear occurs above 100 km depth. A recently determined catalog of NVT in Oaxaca is extended using the same method and additional data that now extends further west. In the east, NVT epicenters are similar to earlier studies and form a continuous trench-parallel band that gradually moves inland. In the west, the distribution of NVT widens, closely following the shape of the newly determined slab contours. There are no gaps in NVT or slow slip across the rapid transition in slab dip, further supporting the notion that the slab is not currently torn in the updip region of the transition from flat to steeper subduction as it rolls back.",
